National Cadet Corps (NCC) came into existence on 15 July 1948 under an Act of Parliament. Over the years, NCC has spread its activities and values across the length and breadth of the country; in schools and colleges in almost all the di stricts of India. It has attracted millions of young boys and girls to the very ethos espoused by its motto \"unity and discipline\" and molded them into disciplined and responsible citiz ens of the country. NCC has attained an enviable brand value for itself in the Young India's mind space. 2. National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims at character building and leadership in all walks of life and promotes the spirit of patriotism and National Integration among the youth of the country. Towards this end, it runs a multifaceted training; varied in content, style and processes with added emphasis on practical training, outdoor training and training as a community. 3. With the dawn of Third Millennia, ther e have been rapid strides in technology, information, social and economic fields bringing in a paradigm shift in learning field too; NCC being no exception. A need was felt to chan ge with times. NCC has introduced its New Training Philosophy, catering to all the new changes and developments taking place in Indian Society. It has streamlined and completely overhauled its train ing objectives, syllabus, methodology etc thus making it in sync with times. Subjects like National Integration, Personality Development and Life skills, Social Awareness etc have alsobee n given prominent thrust. 4. The new syllabus has been in force for the last five years. The feedback, suggestions and various limitations have been broug ht out by different stake holders. This new edition being the outcome of these suggestions. 5. For the ease of both Trainers and Trainees alike, a summary and a list of various types of questions concerning the unit have been added at the end of each unit. The syllabus has been revised to make it cadet friendly, co lourful with large number of photographs, charts, pictures etc and visually appealing. It is hoped that this will facilitate better assim ilation and increased interest among the cadets. 6. The book has been the outcome of sincere de votion and relentless effort of the team Officers Training Academy, Kamptee duly steered by the Commandant. Our sincere gratitude and compliments to them. Any suggestions are welcome for its improvem ent in the future editions. 7. Contents of this hard work must form the basis of Institutional Training with explicit commitment.

NCC Song . The official song of the NCC - \"Kadam Mila Ke Chal\" was adopted in 1963. However, in 1974, a change was felt to catch the imaginat ion of the youth that descr ibes the true feelings of NCC. As a result the song was replaced by \"Hum Sab Hindi Hain\" which kept on playing in RDCs till the word 'Hindi' was replaced by 'Bhartiya' in 1980. The NCC song expresses th e feelings of unity in diversity and urge everyone to march towards the single goal - all being INDIANS. NCC SONG Hum Sab Bhartiya Hain, Hum Sab Ha , Ho, Ho, Ho, Ek Hai Hum Sab Bhartiya Hain Kashmir Ki Ek Hai, EK Hi Allah Hai, Rang Birange Deepak Hai Hum Lekin Jagmag Ek Hai, Ha, Ha, Ek Hai, Ho, Ho, Ho, Ek Hai Hum Sab Bhartiya Hain, Hum Sab Bhartiya Hain.

The term Cadet stands for \"trainee\". It is generally used as a military term. Cadets are the integral part of NCC and they are divided into two divisions i.e. SD/S W and JD/JW.

He/she has to undergo the stipulated training; both at their institution as well as at a training camp. He/she is called a cadet of NCC. Advantages of being a Cadet .

These leaders have had a great impact on the peopl e of the country and ther efore immensely contribute towards nation building. India attained independence in 1947 essentially because of the charismatic leaders who spearheaded the freedom struggle. Post-independenc e the Indian leadership has ensured India to be amongst the best developing countries and is staki ng its claim to be the permanent member of United Nations. Bal Gangadhar Tilak BalGangadharTilak was born on 22 July 1856, in a middle class family in Ratnagiri, a small coastal town in southwestern Maharashtra. His father, Gangadhar Shastri, was a noted Sanskr it scholar and school teacher at Ratnagiri. Tilak was a brilliant student a nd also very good in mathematics. Since his childhood, Tilak had an intolerant attitude towards injustice and he was truthful and straight forward in nature. After graduating from Deccan College, Pune in 1877, Tilak cleared the L.L.B. from the Elphinston College, Mumbai. Later, he helped found a school that laid emphasis on nationalism. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a social reformer and freedom fighter. He was one of the prime architects of mo dern India and strongest advocates of Swaraj (Self Rule). He was universally recognized as the \"Father of Indian Movem ent\". Tilak was a brilliant politician as well as a profound scholar who believed that independence is the foremost necessity for t he well-being of a nation. During 1908-1914, Bal Gangadhar Tilak spent six years ri gorous imprisonment in Mandalay Jail, Burma. He was deported because of his alleged support to the Indian revolutionaries, who had killed some British people. Tilak returned to India in 1915, when the politic al situation was fast changing under the shadow of World War I. There was unprecedented jubilation in India after Tilak was freed and back in India. After seeing such a grand welcome, Tilak decided to re-unite with his fellow nationalists and founded the All India Home Rule League in 1916 with Joseph Baptista, Annie Besant and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. . He traveled constantly in order to organize the people. While fighting for people's cause Bal Gangadhar Tilak died on August 1, 1920. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 02 October 1869 at Porbandar which is in the present day Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a Dewan or Prime Minister of Porbandar. His mother, Putlibai, was a very religious lady and left a deep impression on Gandhi's mind. He was a mediocre student and was excessively shy and timid. He married at the age of thirteen to Kasturbai. Later on in his life, Gandhi denounced the custom of child marriage and termed it as cruel. After schooling, he joined the Samaldas College in Bhavnagar. Gandhiji sailed to England on 04 S eptember 1888. He completed his Law degree in 1891 and returned to India. Gandhiji proceed to South Africa in April 1893. It was in South Africa that G andhiji's transformation from Mohandas to Mahatma took place. During his stay in South Africa, his life underwent a change and he developed most of his political ideas. Gandhiji decided to dedicate himself completely to the service of humanity. In 1906, in the course of his struggle in South Africa, Gandhiji, developed the concepts of Ahim sa (non-violence) and Satyagraha (holding fast to 34 truth or firmness in a righteous cause). His struggl e bore fruit and in 1914 in an agreement between Gandhiji and South African Government, the main Indian demands were conceded. Gandhiji returned to India in 1915 and settled down on the bank of river Sabarmati, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, where he founded an ashram called Sa tyagraha Ashram. In1921, he gave the call for Non- cooperation movement against the ills of British ru le. Gandhiji's call roused the sleeping nation. Non- cooperation movement severely jolted the British gov ernment. But the movement ended in an anti-climax in February 1922. . After the outbreak of Second World War in 1939, Ga ndhiji again became active in the political arena. British Government wanted India's help in the war and Congress in return wanted a clear-cut promise of independence from British government. On 8 August 1942, Gandhiji gave the call for Quit India Movement. Soon the British Government arrested him and other t op leaders of Congress. India attained independence in Aug 1947 but Jinnah's intransigence resulted in the partition of the country. This angered some Hindu fundamentalists and on 30 January 1948, Gandhiji was shot dead by one such fundamentalist Nathu Ram Godse while he was going for his evening prayers. The la st words on the lips of Ga ndhiji were Hey Ram. He proved himself to be a true leader of the people. Bhagat Singh . Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 at Banga in Lyallpur district (now Pakistan). Fr om his early childhood, Bhagat Singh was imbibed with the family's spirit of patriotism. At the time of his birth, his father Kishan Singh was in jail. His uncle, SardarAjit Singh, was a great freedom fighter and established the Indian Patriots' Association. On 30 October 1928, an all-parties procession, led by Lala Lajpat Rai, marched towards the Lahore railway station to protest against the arrival of the Simon Commission. Stopping the procession, police made a lathi charge at the activists. The confront ation left Lala Lajpat Rai with severe injuries and also later led to his death. As reveng e to the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, Bhagat Singh and his associates plotted the assassination of Scott, the Superintendent of Police, believed to have ordered the lathi charge. The revolutionaries, mistaki ng J.P. Saunders, an Assistant Superint endent of Police, as Scott, killed him instead. Bhagat Singh quickly left Lahore to escape his arrest. To avoid rec ognition, he shaved his beard and cut his hair, a violation of the sacred tenets of Sikhism. On April 8 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukesh war Dutt threw a bomb onto the corridors of the assembly and shouted 'Inquilab Zindabad!' The bomb was not meant to kill or injure anyone and therefore it was thrown away from the crowded place. Following the blasts both Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt courted arrest. The British authority, while interrogati ng them, came to know about their involvement in the murder of J. P. Saunders. Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were c harged with the murder. Bhagat Singh admitted to the murder and made statements against the British rule during the trial. Bhagat Singh along with other revolutionaries wasfound responsible for the Asse mbly bombing and murder of Saunders. On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh was hanged in Lahore with his fellow comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev. Bhagat Singh was cremated at Hussainiwala near Ferozepur, on banks of Sutlej River. Conclusion The study of the lives and biogra phy of our national leaders is very important and inspiring for all of us because, we can learn and imbibe some of the l eadership qualities of these great leaders. Besides we must also not forget the great sacrifices they have made in getti ng us freedom from the British . 35 CHAPTER-IV INTRODUCTION TO CONS TITUTION OF INDIA Introduction The constitution of India is the supreme law of I ndia.

It also means an atmosphere in which all citizens, irrespec tive of their caste, religion and region live together peacefully. It refers to integration in all respects, social political, economic and emotional. In an integrated country people share common goals. They all work togethe r and co-operate with each other for the prosperity of the nation. National integration means that though we belong to different castes , religions and re gions and speak different languages, India is a secular democratic country and that we are all one. This kind of integration is very important in the building of a strong and prosperous nation. A unique feature of our country is that all the major religions of the world are practiced here. Importance of National Integration National integration does not mean uniformity of all. It does not stand for uniformity of religion, dress, food habits etc. It means the preservation of diverse cu ltures and at the same time living in harmony with each other. No country can survive if its people do not remain united. The feeling of togetherness and a sense of belonging are absolutely nec essary for a nation to survive. Whether India is fully integrated is an open question. But it has been reunited through process of Independence. On some accounts, India is integrated, and on some other accounts, India is not yet fully integrated. Our country is composite in terms of l anguage, ethnic, religious and cultural differences. Provisions are made in our Constitution to safeguar d these differences and honour their peculiarities. Essence of National Integration National Integration is an emotional and spiritual bo nd which binds all of Indians irrespective of caste, creed, colour, race, religion and region. In reality, it is the common ideal whose intensity in the passions of the people, determines our \"real strength'. Emotional integration of the country connotes a firm conviction on the part of the individual that there exists a stake for him or her in the well-being of the Nation.. In fact, National Integration and Nation Building are synonymous . National Integration includes the following:- (a) Cultural Integration . The process for evolution of Indi an composite culture of today needs to be understood by one and all through it s systematic education at all levels. (b) Economic Integration . The perception of the common man in India is that generally, the poor are becoming poorer and the rich-richer. It is an open question whether equal social and economic justice is available to all segments of the soci ety. However the economic injustice gives rise to indifferent tendencies in the society. (c) Political Integration . Politics needs to be separated from religion. Strict laws must be enforced against exploitation of the common man by t he politicians and vested interests. This can be achieved only through correct understanding of different political ideologies being practiced by politicians from different backgrounds. (d) Religious Integration . Our Constitution permits practice of individual religion, without hurting or offending the religious sentiments and bel iefs of others. The need is to understand the existing commonalties in the principles and teachings of all the religions to develop a positive attitude towards religion. (e) Social Integration . Provision of equal rights and opportunities has been guaranteed through our Constitution. However, its pr actice leaves much to be desired, the justice needs to be meted out equally and swiftly to ensure against frustrations and the forces of disintegration in the society. 42 Necessity of National Integration India has a rich cultural heritage characterize d by tolerance, compassion and synthesis. After independence, our country opted for secularism and equal opportunity for all, but vested interests and divisive forces under the cover of communal organisations and political parties have been encouraging fissiparous tendencies to undermine the security, unity, and integrity of India. Presently, a sense of unity in India can be seen only whenever there is an external threat to the country. At the time of Chinese and Pakistani aggressions, a wonderful se nse of unity swept over the country. Our unity should depend upon the surer foundation of cult ivation of positive qualitie s of love and devotion to the country, transcending the differences of religions, languages and geographical loyalties. National integration is therefore a basic necessity for the following reasons:- (a) Maintenance of peace and harmony: Peac e and harmony between the people of a nation can be achieved only through the feelin g of togetherness amongst the people. (b) Growth and development of the nation: National integration is a process that must be equally understood by all citizens of a nation which will su bsequently lead the nation achieve the growth and development. (c) Law and order: Provision of equal rights and opportunities can be ensured only through proper awareness of the prevailing laws. It will lead to proper maintenance of law and order situation. (d) Culture and religious development: Our constitu tion permits practice of individual religion without hurting the beliefs of others. National integr ation is essential for developing mutual respect for each other's religion. (e) Dignity and self-respect of the nation: Every ci tizen must be dealt with equal dignity. Mutual respect and dignity will develop only if we believe in it and practice it. (f) Welfare and well-being of t he people: Welfare of the masses can be achieved only through proper understanding between the people and it c an be achieved through the process of oneness. Conclusion It is the duty of each and every citizen of our c ountry to strive to achieve unity in spite of diversity and further maintain that. We must remember that ther e should be no divisions between different parts of the country. There is only one India of which we all Indian s are inheritors. We are Indian first and Indians last. 43 CHAPTER - VI FACTORS AFFECTING NATIONAL INTEGRATION Introduction India is a country with innumerable diversities; an entity composed of many communities, races classes, languages and sub cultures. In any such nati on, there are many obstacle s to the achievement of national integration. In India, various issues/ factors are obstructing the growth of national feeling, viz. casteism, communalism, linguistic fanaticism, soci al disparity, economic inequalities and immorality, regionalism etc. In spite of all these limitations. India has developed into one nation by the influence of common territory, common history and common fight for freedom against the foreign rule. . When India came under the British, they follo wed the policy of 'Divide and Rule' in order to perpetuate their authority over India. Consequently, the racial, the religious and the linguistic groups in India first began to disintegrate emotionally and psychologica lly and then, desired to separate territorially. This resulted in the creation of India and Pakistan and late r on Bangladesh. The integrity of the Indian nation has been facing increased threat day by day. There is dire necessity to improve National Integration so as to achieve territorial integrity, all round development and peace within the country. Factors Affecting National Integration The People of India are at cross roads today. A number of divisive forces are working overtime to put us asunder. The overzealous religious, linguistic and regional groups have by and large, adopted myopic policies. For their immediate gains, they sacrifice country 's long term interests. There are several forces of disintegration in the country which are jeopardising the Na tional Unity. Some of the factors chiefly responsible for weakening the National Integration have been discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. Cultural Aspects . The Indian society is multi-racial and multi- religious with a diverse culture. Indian culture has given rise to various complications in the society. The mixed culture of today and the rich cultural heritage can prove to be the most effective tool for ac hieving National Integration. Unfortunately, the people are not being correctly taught and guided on these cultural aspects. It is often forgotten that we all belong to the same culture, whatever be its beginning. Political Motives . For the sake of maintaining their status, political parties indulge in exploitation of the people in one form or the other. Such misguided people tend to move away from the national mainstream, paving the way for insurgency and resurgence of religious fanaticism and fervour. Lack of Education . Inspite of the political independence of the country in 1947, the people at large are yet to be liberated. Illiteracy is still rampant though being overcome slowly and gradually. Illiterates and unemployed are more easily misguided by the people with vested interests, due to their ignorance and lack of proper perspective. Communalism . Religious antagonism has posed a serious challenge to national integration in India. Political manipulation has projected one religi on against the other which resulted in communal riots, bloodbath, mutual distrust and disunity in the country. Large scale illiteracy and superstitions are responsible along with other causes for rise of communalism in the country. It is very difficult to promote national integration under these situations. Casteism . Caste is an imported part of our social fabric. This was developed in the past on the basis of division of labour in the society. But now castei sm has segregated the society. Unity and integrity has become a challenging dream in a caste ridden societ y. The socially neglected and scheduled castes under the suppression of upper castes have less sense of feeling of unity. It becomes a problem for national integration. 44 Regionalism . There are several regions in India having their unique traditions, food habits, dress and languages. Each region differs from the other in one or other ways which leads to divisive tendencies within the country. People of one region compete with t he persons of other regions leading to conflicts and retards progress. Land disputes, language problem etc are some of the reasons which pose hurdle on the way of national integration. Linguistic Fanaticism . Multi-linguism is one of the important ch aracters of India. India has fifteen officially recognized languages. There are about 1652 dialects which are spoken in India which shows its diversity. People of one language try to establish supr emacy of their language over others. When Hindi was declared as the national language, people of South Indi a resented against this decision. Language issue has become a barrier on the way of national integration. Social Disparity . Social disparity among the people of different communities, castes and sometime within the community and caste, causes tension a nd imbalance among the people. Social disparity poses great challenge to national integration. Economic Inequalities . Economic standard of people in a stat e depends on the fertility of land, resources available and manpower management. All the st ates are not equal in the above matter which leads to uneven economic progress of the people. Even in a st ate distribution of wealth is not properly done. Day by day poor are becoming poorer and rich becoming richer causing tension and conflicts. It is a problem for national integration. Ethnic Conflicts . Ethnic conflict has hindered national integration. Whereas the modern concept of nationalism is closely linked with the concept of nation-state, scholars have described another prevailing notion of nationalism such as religious nationalism, ethnonationalism etc. Although political nationhood is denied to the Nagas, the Nagas understand themselves as nation in the sense of ethnonationality. The concept of \"ethnonationalism\" best defines the self-understanding of the ethni c groups in Northeast India in the various forms of their struggle for identity. Tribal Identity . To a member of the Indian national mainstream, a Khasi, a Naga or a Mizo are tribals. The pejorative term \"tribal\" carries a denotation of primitivity and inferiority of the people for whom the name is applied. The attitude of the national mainstream that looks down upon the tribals is in serious conflict with the proud self-understanding of the tribals in the northeast. Such a pride is exhibited in their ethno national feeling. Corruption and Lack of Character . Corruption in the country is on a scale that can belinked to the ants eating away the roots of the foundat ions. The lack of moral character and ethical values deprive us of the strength to overcome our own weaknesses. Comb ined together, corruption and lack of character have caused immense damage to the nati on, whereby people at lar ge have literally sold their souls (and the nation) for short-term personal and political gains. Measures To Achieve National Integration Philosophy of Integration . Integration requires commitment in theory and practice, to work in a cooperative manner. It needs to be unequivocally understood that National Integration is a process, a growth anda development, in which every citizen has a common stake and has to equally strive for achieving it, continuously and vigorously. A sense of patriotism and nationalism alone is not sufficient for maintaining this high ideal; rather we have to keep working at it in a systematic manner all the time, always keeping in view the Nation before self. 45 Culture as a Unifying Factor . The process for evolution of Indian composite culture of today needs to be understood by one and all through its systematic edu cation at all levels. Oneness of the country since time immemorial has never been in doubt. The messages of unity by Indian Saints and Sufis need to reach the common people of the country. The rich cultural heritag e of India, in terms of the variety of languages, dialects, literature, arts, architecture, secular thoughts, customs and traditions, food and eating habits, music, dances, ethics and spiritual/moral values and so on, dev eloped by all for understanding as to what India is. The existing sub-cultures of any par t of the country simply form a part of the Indian culture. A portion can never be bigger than the whole. As such, the natio nal perspective can then be understood and the diverse Indian culture can contribute towards National Unity and In tegrity. Some lesser known examples of prominent Indians perpetuating unity of the country are: - (a) Adi Shankaracharya established four MATH, one each at Shrungeri, Dwarka, Badrinath and Jagan Nath Puri, after travelling through the length and breadth of the country to perpetuate oneness among people. (b) Subramaniya Bharati, a poet, writer, thinke r, philosopher, comparable to any contemporary personality has written the following books, amongst many others: (i) Yesu Prabhu. (ii) Allah Mahan. (iii) Mera Guru - Guru Gobind Singh. Promotion of Secularism . The spirit of secularism is highly ne cessary in our multi-religious society. Any sorts of activities creating communal reactions in the public mind should be prohibited. No discrimination among the people on the grounds of religion should be made. . Role of Politics . Politics needs to be separated from religion and strict laws enacted and enforced against exploitation of the common m an by the politicians and vested interests. Ethnic Heterogeneity . It needs to be understood by all that ethnic homogeneity does not necessarily bring about unity, integrit y and prosperity. Unity is not uniformit y, in spite of our diverse ethnic groups, integration of the country is possible. . Dignity of Individuals . Every citizen must be dealt with equal dignity, irrespective of religion, region, language, caste, creed and socio-economic status. Mutual respect will develop only if we believe in it and practise it, rather than paying only lip service to it. Socio-Economic Reforms . Provision of equal rights and opportunities has been guaranteed through our Constitution. However, its practice leaves much to be desired. The justice needs to be meted out equally and swiftly to ensure against frustrations and the fo rces of disintegration in the society. Eradication of the social injustices and the evils will automatically take care of the economic backwardness of the downtrodden and provide succour to all, particularly the backward classes. Education. Adequate and proper education will cause mass awakening and provide equal opportunities to all. It will lead to improvement in understa nding others and reduce exploitation in the society. The curriculum needs to be evolved systematically, so that a well rounded personality of the individual emerges. Such education needs to be broad based through the following tiers:- (a) Family upbringing - SANSKARS. (b) Schools and Colleges - Social &Professional Education. (c) Society (i) Religious Bodies Socio - Religious cultural, ethics, morals and code ofconduct. 46 (ii) State &Public Media Channelising of socio-religious- cultural thought process. (iii) Interaction with other Developing mutual respect, members of the Society. harmony & tolerance. Indian History. It has always been the prerogative of the victors to write the History. However, it is up to the rulers of today (Indian Government) to include w hat it wishes to in the cu rriculum of the educational institutes. It is a known fact that Indian History has been badly distorted through the centuries. It needs to be rewritten and a correct perspective given to it, so as to highlight the phases during which we have progressed and prospered due to internal stability - Unity and Integr ity. The lives of certain saints, harmony and tolerance levels need to be studied in detail to understand the subj ect in its entirety. The lessons of history, which caused damage to the national cause, need to be underst ood to guard against their repetition, and others highlighted. . National Language. It needs to be ensured that the language should not become a barrier instead of a medium. The people should not be depr ived of equal opportunity, because of any language or the lack of it, particularly in securing Central Govern ment jobs. The tri-lingual formula of National, State and Link language is quite adequate for the time being. It is important that no language be enforced on any particular region, rather people be encouraged to learn additional languages as a matter of habit for better understanding of the literature and culture of other regions. Nationalism and Patriotism. We have had a glorious past, but regrettably our \"today\" is rather hollow. We have a rich cultural heritage, but we hav e to keep building it up through dedication and hardwork. There is a definite need to inculcate the spirit of national ism. The ethical, moral and spiritual values need to be built up to act as deterrence against the fissiparous t endencies in the society. \"Society and Country before Self\" has to be the common motto for all to be followed in letter and spir it and it is in this regard that the National and State Leadership at all levels has to set personal example. . Proper Use of Media. The services of the Radio and TV mu st be intelligently used. People of different states must be introduced to each other's cultures and ways of life and common elements should be stressed upon. These will create an atmosphere of good will and mutual understanding. Media cut through all language barriers and reach the masses in no time whose potential is tremendous. Political and Administrative Measures . Since India is a federal-democ ratic country, its integration in all respects should also be done in a democratic manne r. Each ethnic, caste, tribal, religious and linguistic group should have freedom for protec ting and promoting their own cultures and traditions. Analyzing the process of national integration in India, Prof. Rashe eduddin Khan has observed that it means cohesion not fusion, unity but not uniformity, reconciliation but not me rger, agglomeration but not assimilation, solidarity but not regimentation of the people constituting our polit ical community. Emotional integration with the development of a strong brot herhood among the people discourages the growth of separatism, regionalism or secessionism. Conclusion We need national integration on permanent footin g and this can be achieved by enlightening our children. All the children, during their formative years, must be taught that we all are Indians belonging to the one Motherland. We must not give too much importance to separate identities. Achieving national integration is a slow moving, continuous and long term work in progress which needs to be understood encouraged and practiced by every citizen of t he country especially the youth. 47 CHAPTER-VII UNITY IN DIVERSITY Introduction India is probably the only country in the world wh ere people belonging to different religions, castes and creeds, speaking different languages, having different cultures, different modes of living, different clothing, different feeding habits, worshiping different gods and deity live together in harmony and believe to be the children of one mother-Mother India. They ar e one nation at large. They are governed by one central authority, have one Prime Minister, one President, one Supreme Court and one Army Chief. This is why we say we have unity in diversity. India - A Land of Diversities The tremendous variety of land and people in the Sub-Continent is striking. It has every type of climate from the blazing heat of the plains to the below freezing point cold of the Himalayas. Indian climate offers all varieties; namely, winter, summer, monsoon , autumn, spring - a clear manifestation of nature's different forms of joy. India is an undisputed geographica l unit, clearly separated from the rest of Asia by formidable natural barriers and boundaries, thus clearly defining it and giving it a natural identity and entity. Geographical Diversities . Geographically India is a vast country so much so that even one of its states is bigger than many countries of Europe. But t he whole country is well bounded by nature. In the north is the Himalayan Range, the highest mountain range in the world. The Indo - Gangetic plains lay next to Himalayas; fertile and prosperous, feeding bulk of the pop ulation. The Eastern and No rth Eastern part of India has hills with thick tropical forests, generally inhabited by people of Mongol origin divided into va rious tribes. The Western Desert provide a natural barrier for the free movement. History and Politics . Vindhaychal and Satpura ranges in the Cent ral India are a natural barrier between North and South India. Consequently, while North India took the brunt of invasions, South India generally remained insulated and independent from the rule of the invaders and settlers, including the sultans and mughals. Ironically, it was South I ndia which paved the way for the European invaders who came in the grab of traders and decided to settle down and later rule this country, perhaps the only time when India as a whole was ruled by the invaders and settlers. 48 Culture and Religion . Today's Indian culture can be called a composite culture, which though predominantly a Hindu culture, comprise s of myriad streams of ot her cultures that have, over a period of time, come and mingled into it and having enriched it, became a part of it, India has about 15 officially recognised languages and about 1652 dialects s poken by its vast populace. India has a dozen ethnic groups, seven major religious communities fragmented further into m any sects, castes and sub-ca stes all living in its 88 socio-cultural regions. It depicts a varied life of people speaking different languages, having different belief, social values, in fact; a society comprising of many different societies Through the centuries, people from different part s of the world came and settled in it; some to establish trades, others to conquer and plunder, and still others to carve out empires and beco me permanent residents of the country. It has been most appropriately summarized in t he work of the most famous Indian poet, philosopher and a thinker of recent times. \"The Aryan, the Non-Aryan, the Dravadian. The Huns, the Pathans and the Moghuls. They all have merged here into one body. Today the West has opened its doors. And from thence come gifts. Giving and taking, All will be welcome on the shores of Bharat, Where men of all races have come together\". (Tagore: Bharat Tirtha) India has all the major religions of the worl d, principal among them being Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and a large number of other faiths and sects. At least four of these major religions were born in India Fundamentals Of Unity In Diversity India is a nation having great diversities. The people who inhabit this nation belong to different races, communities and castes. They reside in different geogr aphical regions and speak different languages. They believe in and practice different religions and have vari ed life styles. But with certain shared fundamentals for national unity, the people of India can develop the feel ing of oneness in spite of all these diversities. Spirit of Religious Unity . Apart from Hinduism we have the followers of Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity and Parsees. But Hindus fo rm the greater majority. There are, no doubt, different factions, sections and sub-sections but basically all Hindus believe in the theory of Dharma and Karma. Indian Philosophy . Indian philosophy was developed on Indian soil and not borrowed from anywhere. This has blended the various cultures together. There are diffe rences in overall conception of Gods and modes of worship. Ethnic Coexistance . A very important characteristic of Indian society is the coexistence of different ethnic groups. These groups formulated inter-g roup behavior. Hence there is no mutual interference as also no merging of their identity. Cultural Unity . We have a cultural unity in India in as mu ch as our philosophy of life; our customs, creeds and traditions are more or less, the same. The inst itution of marriage, the very foundation of a society, exists all over the country and most of the rituals and sanskars are similar everywhere. Emotional Unity . Emotional unity plays its own part. The nam e of Bharat Mata brings us closer and closer together. In spite of different languages and dial ects, sanskrit, the language of Vedas, brings us all together because sanskrit is the mother of all la nguages. The outstanding features of Indian culture responsible for bringing unity in diversity may be summarized as follows: 49 (a) We Indians lay emphasis on spirituality, not on material wealth. (b) Religion has the most important place in India. We believe in Karma and Sanskar. Performance of duty is our religion. (c) Religious tolerance is the unique feature of relig ions in India. Hence there is less difficulty in coexistence of followers of different religions. (d) Hinduism which is practiced by majority of the population has the capacity to absorb all good cultures. It has either absorbed the immigrant cultures or has largely influenced them. (e) We have a very broad outlook. We preach and follow religion and spiritualism without ignoring married life and worldly things. (f) We firmly believe in freedom of though t and freedom of expression because such freedom enriches the culture which then becomes dynamic. Relevance of Ncc in National Integration NCC creates awareness amongst the youth about the diverse herit age of our country and fosters national integration. NCC cadets gain experience to li ve together and work in harmony with cadets of other states whom they have not known before. It helps in strengthening the unity as under:- (a) Ethics and Social Values . These are very important values in day-to-day activities on the ground and are the essentials of personality. NCC helps to cultivat e these values through which the spirit of unity and value of personal sacrif ice are ignited in the minds of cadets. (b) Cultural and Traditional Values . NCC organises various camps and group activities where ample opportunity is given to the cadets to closely watch the cultural and tr aditional shows of other regions. (c) Discipline and Patriotism . A cadet is trained to give selfless service to society and be available anytime for national cause. NCC can be described as the disciplined, trained and motivated young force available for national se rvice. NCC provides assistance in various places as well as future leadership and participation in all walks of life. Conclusion It is the duty of each and every citizen of our country to strive for total unity despite of diversities in culture, language and religion. We must remember that there should be no divisions between any religion or community. We must be really proud of the various geographical and other diversities existing in the country. It is the duty of every individual to strive and work in their own respective capa city to respect and promote the diversity of the nation.

Hence it is an important tool for promoting National Integration. The NCC Logo is in itself an excellent example of national integration and is true to its image. 54 CHAPTER-IX ROLE OF NCC IN NATION BUILDING Introduction Nation state is considered as a group of peopl e living in certain territory under one government. Nation building refers to all the efforts of the country and its people to stay united so t hat it can stay politically stable and peaceful which is essent ial for country's development.One of the major aims of NCC is to contribute towards nation building. NC C cadets being young and the future of the nation, have a special role and responsibility towards this sacred mission. Role of Youth in Nation Building Youth is the time of life when one is young, but often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity). It is also defined as \"the appearance , freshness, vigor, spirit, etc.For activities at international or at regional levelUnited Nations for stat istical consistency across regions, defines 'youth', as those persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to other definitions by Member States. Contribution of Youth in Nation Building The vision of our country lies in the hands of our youth. They are filled with tremendous energy and high ambitions. It will be a great wastage of human re sources if the youth are not given an opportunity to exercise their talent.. It has the power to defeat all separatist attempts by dishonest elements. (a) Political Measures . Today's youth can contribute immensel y to the politics of the country. If a nation does notrenew its political leadership prof ile it would be-come old in thought and slow in action. The youth are the future leaders of a nati on. The opportunity provided at educational level to contribute towards politics should be encouraged. T he youth should learn and clean politics. Then only the politics will be able to achieve greater national goals. (b) Security . The nation today faces severe security concerns, both external and internal. This problem can be solved only through properchannelizing of youth power in to the national main stream. The thoughts and actions of youth have th e power to strengthen internal and external security of the country. The yout h are a big force which can ensure and enhance the security of the country. (c) Social and Cultural . The Indian society with a lar ge percentage of youth in its population must be made aware of the various social and cu ltural developments happening in the country. Every kind of social change or social unrest is conseque ntly giving rise to various complexities in the society. While searching the history it is clear that youth can only bring the positive changes required for any society Role of NCC in Nation Building The nation is proud of National Cadet Corps and its activities in facilitating and molding the character of the youth and contribution towards nation building. NCC has nurtured millions of young boys and girls as responsible, disciplined and motivated citizens of ou r country.NCC is an image of secularism and national integration and also espouses the ethos of nationalis m thus strengthening the basi c fibre of a strong India The National Cadet Corps (NCC) holds a golden key for all-round growth and transformation of our youth. What began in the year 1917, as the University Corps, after m any changes and overhauls through the years, has come to be known as the National Cadet Corps since November 1948 55 Cadet's Role Every NCC Cadet as an individual can contribute subs tantially in the process of nation building by adopting the following measures: - (a) Contributing to Adult Education . The cadets are trained on various subjects of national importance. This exposure helps the nation to have a trained pool of resources in imparting adult education in a country where illiteracy is widespread. (b) Acting as Social Ambassadors . Society frequently undergoes positive and negative changes. NCC cadet has the capacity to impart positive chan ges in the society based on national unity and patriotism. (c) Promoting the National language . As per the directive principles of Indian constitution Hindi as a national language must be promoted throughout the country without affecting other languages. (d) Treating All Human Beings As Equals . The motto of NCC is Unity and Discipline. The main part of its training focuses on building a bette r character for the individual. It will help the cadets to treat all human beings as equals irrespec tive of their caste, creed or colour. (e) Respecting All Relig ious Institutes . India is a multi-religious country. It respects every religion. To keep the secularism moving, consistent effort is needed from the side of the youth. It is effectively done by NCC Cadets. Conclusion Youth is that spark which needs ignition and NCC is an ideal platform for its blossoming. Ever since its inception, the NCC has made immense contributions towards nation-building and promotion of social harmony in our country. NCC as an organization has unifi ed the youth, not only of our country, but has made significant efforts to interact with the youth of other countries through YEPs. Nation will be ever grateful to its youth and NCC for their immense cont ribution towards nation building. 56 CHAPTER-X NCC AND NATIONAL INTEGRATION Introduction National integration is the awareness of a comm on identity amongst the citizens of a country. It means that though we belong to different castes, religions and regions and speak different languages we recognize the fact that we are all one. National fest ivals act as an important unifying force. Independence Day, Republic Day, Gandhi Jayanti etc are festivals t hat are celebrated by all Indians and in all parts of the country, regardless of language, religion or culture. They remind us of our common nationality. On Republic Day we stress on the importance of showing proper respect to the nation. NCC celebrates Republic day by conducting Republic Day Camp . Republic Day Celebrations Republic Day honors the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect.

A skilled person uses less time, energy and resources to do a job and produces quality results. Enhancing Life Skills enables us to adapt to situations and people and helps us to lead a healthy and positive life. There are ten core Life skills which help in enhancing the personality of an individual . They are as follows:- (a) Self Awareness . Recognition of self, our character, strengths and weaknesses, desires, likes and dislikes, and sk ills. Being aware of the good points about oneself helps young people build a sense of self-esteem and self-confidence. Being aware of their weaknesses will make you ng people willing to learn more . This also helps them utilize the opportunities available to them in relation to their abilities . Self-awareness is necessary for developing a positive attitude towards life. (b) Empathy . Is the ability to be sensitive to another person`s situation, tounderstand his/her concerns, worries, fears and needs a nd how they feel. Empathy works wonders when we apply it to our relationships - with our loved ones, classmates, parents, friends, cousins and colleagues. It helps us move closer to solutions, to resolve conflicts, and enhance our quality of life. (c) Critical Thinking . Is the ability to analyse information and experience in an objective manner. It can help us recognize and assess the factors that influence our attitude and behavior, such as media and peer pressure influences. (d) Creative Thinking . Creativity is the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing, or reapplying existing ideas. It helps us to look beyond our direct experience, and to respond adaptively and with flexibility to situations in our daily lives . (e) Problem Solving Skills . Enable us to deal with problems in our lives in a constructive manner. The process of problem solving involves various steps. They are identifying the problem, exploring the available alternativ e and deciding on the best possible solution . (f) Decision Making . Decision making is to choose from the varied options based on the existing knowledge of the topic under considerat ion keeping in mind the positive or negative consequences of each of the option. (g) Interpersonal Relationship . Ability to establish positiv e relationships helps us to relate in positive ways with the people we interact with. This means being able to make and maintain friendly relationships, which can be of great importance to our mental and social well being. It may also mean being able to end relationships constructively. Positive relationships help in the growth of the individuals involved. (h) Effective Communication . Is the ability to express, verbally through spoken or written language and non-verbally through gestures and body movements, in ways that are culturally acceptable. (j) Coping with Emotions . Being aware of the predominant emotion that preoccupies the mind at any point of time, knowing how emotions influence behavior, and being able to respond to emotions appropriately. (k) Coping with Stress . Means recognizing the source of stress in our lives, recognizing how this affects us physically and emotionally, and acting in ways that help us control our levels of stress, by changing our environment or life style and learning how to relax. 102 Use Of Core Skills In Daily Life Now the class will be introduced to the prac tical use of core life skills through a daily life activity. (a) Activity - Life Skills In Daily Life . (i) Step 1 - Game Kho-Kho . Inform the participants that it is time For Kho-Kho a popular game in rural and urban areas. Both teams of boys and girls can play this game. Randomly divide the participants into two teams and ask them to organize the game and play. Observe the process ad opted by the groups (who takes the leadership, how they organize themselves , now they interact with each other, whether they function as a team, what decisions are being made, body language used and how they carry on the game etc.) . (ii) Step 2- Analysis of the Ga me for Understanding Life Skills . On completion of the game, initiate an interact ive discussion to understand their experience in the whole process and their feelings while playing the game. The following questions may be asked:- (aa) Who took the lead? (ab) Who gave instructions? (ac) Was there team work? (ad) Was there any pressure on the team to perform? How did the team cope up with that? (ae) Was there a chance for the team to perform better than what they did? If yes, why? (af) How was the communication between the opponents? (Body language, sign language, shouting etc). (ag) Was there any new technique used in the game? (ah) If someone got hurt, how did the others feel about it? (aj) Who resolved problems in the team? (A player not moving fast enough or not actively participating) . (ak) Who cheered the team? (al) Who pointed out the shortcoming of the game? 103 (iii) Step 3 . On completion, explain the game in terms of Life Skills:- (aa) Self Awareness . What strength and weakness each one has (can run very fast, very strong etc.). (ab) Empathy . Response of the team me mbers when one of them gets hurt . (ac) Critical Thinking . Think how the opponent is planning the next move; identify the shortcomings of the game. (ad) Creative Thinking .

The following story of \"Hunter and Pigeons \" will be narrated to the class and Life skills therein will be internalized through Brain Storming Session Story of Hunter and Pigeons . (a) A group of pigeons enjoyed the fresh grains in a field every day. One day a hunter spotted them and decided to catch them. He spread a net in the field and waited for them to come. The pigeons were caught in the net. They re alized that the hunter will take them away soon. The leader pigeon said, we have to get out. There must be a way out. Let us think. But they could not find a way out. The net was strong. Each pigeon tried to escape by pulling the net indifferent directions . But it increased the fear and confusion among them more than helping them. (b) A young pigeon said, Why don`t we all try a nd fly together instead of trying to escape individually? When we pull individually, we wa ste our energy. The leader pigeon was not in agreement. He said, \"No it may be difficult\". But the young pigeon insisted that they try it once. The leader finally agreed when he spotted th e hunter at a distance. When he said fly all of them lifted together and flew away with the net . The hunter arrived at the scene to see the pigeons fly away together as one group with his net . 104 Life Skill Used by the Characters . (a) Self Awareness . The pigeons knew that they were in trouble and had to find a way out of the net . (b) Creative Thinking by the Hunter . Spreading grains under the net to catch the pigeons . (c) Creative Thinking by the Pigeons . Identified a creative solution of flying together . (d) Critical Thinking . The young pigeon identified that they were wasting energy and time by trying to fly individually. (e) Decision Making . They decided to fly as a group . (f) Effective Communication . The young pigeon assertively communicated his suggestion of flying together. Conclusion Life Skills help in building self-confidence and self esteem and enable us to adapt to situations and people. Life skills are learnt from our own experience, perceptions, insight, stories, books, parents, teachers, religion, media, culture etc. Li fe Skills are present in every individual. To get the best out of them we need to sharpen them regularly . 105 CHAPTER II FACTORS INFLUENCING / SHAPING PERSONALITY : PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, PSYCHOL OGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL Introduction Personality is the characteristics and patterns of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, which make a person exceptional, one of a kind and exclusive to his or herself. People are different from one another, including identical twins they differ in fingerprints and personalities. A healthy self- image is the core determining factor of a strong pers onality. It is the sum total of your inherent and acquired characteristics. It is not necessarily something you are born with, but something you definitely need to take responsibility for. It is primarily you alone, who c an shape your personality and create your world . Physical And Social Factors Influencing/ Shaping Personality Personality development is the development of the organized pattern of behaviours And attitudes that makes a person distinctive. Personality is what makes a person a unique person, and it is recognizable soon after birth. There are many factors which influence/ shape an individuals personality. Some of the physical and social fact ors influencing/shaping personality are enumerated below. Hereditary . The traits and skills acquired by the parent may not modify the genes but just pass on to the children just as they are wh ichever genes carrying hereditary trait is dominant, the trait will pass on to the children fr om their parents just as it is. For instance, the child inherits complexion, physique, intelligence, etc. from his paren ts. Heredity is indeed, an important factor in personality development. Almost every form of personalit y has been attributed to heredity. Today it is believed that hereditary traits are transmitted th rough the genes. Your personality can be influenced by the genes you may have inherited from either your mother s or your father s side or a combination of both. Apart from inheriting physi cal attributes, like height, weight and skin/hair colour, psychologists have ascertained that our mental aptitudes and temperaments which have the potential for influencing our personality are to a certain extent, hereditary. Self-Development . Of the other factors, self-development is the most important factor that can influe nce ones personality . Self-awareness is the key; it entails believing in oneself and ones capabilities. It implies that despite ones fam ily and environmental background or ones current circumstance, one remains in control/charge of m oulding his/her personality. Such a person is aware that personality is a changing, evolving process and does everything possible to enhance his/her personality. Environment . Our environment can also play a si gnificant role on our personality . Right from early childhood through all the stages of developmen t, our home and family, our school and teachers, our friends and colleagues at work, all exert influence on the development of our personality. Besides these, the location where we live and the society we associate with, the country of our birth and the culture we have adopted, are all critical fa ctors that influence our personality. 106 (a) Geographical Environment and Personality . Physical or geographical conditions influence the personality of the individual. People of co ld countries are industrious and hard working. (b) Family Environment . Family atmosphere if disruptive will produce disrupted, delinquent, backward and maladjusted personalities. The number of members in the family, birth order of the child, emotional climate of the family , Outlook of parents, cultural and economic conditions of the family has an impo rtant bearing in personality formation . (c) Family Life Pattern . Family life, aims ambitions, aspi rations and attitudes of parents; their emotional stability or instabilit y; their overprotection or under protection of children- all these factors are important in persona lity development of the individual . (d) Early Childhood Experiences and Personality . Childhood experiences play a very important role in the development of th e individual. Tensions and emotional upsetting of early life influence personality development. Met hods of breast feeding and toilet training do play a significant role in the personality development . (e) Neighbourhood . If the people in the neighbourhood are cultured and educated then the child may also grow into a good person. (f) Friends and Companions . Friends and companions greatly affect the personality of the child. Children of labourers go to third rate school and play with half naked children in dirty streets or slums. They live amidst hunger and poverty . There would be children who go to better schools and make friends and companions. The friendship of all types has a huge impact on the personality of the individual . good friends make good company . (g) School . School plays a vital role in the development of personality. (i) Teacher's personality, i.e. his attitudes, beliefs, ideas, habits, ambitions, aspirations, sentiments and emotional maturity affect the personality development of the child. (ii) Curriculum of school i.e. richness or drabness of curriculum also affects the personality of an individual. (iii) Methods of teaching and co-curricular activities also influence personality development . (iv) General atmosphere in school i.e . congenial or uncongenial atmosphere influence personality development. Education . Education falls into two categories ; school smarts and street smarts . Thus, the most effective way of shaping one's personality is to have a taste of both types and experience both worlds. School smarts are the knowledge gained from sc hool while street smarts are the learning that came from even the most unlikely sources. Life-situations . Every person face many situations in his life which enables him/her to change his/her behavior. For example, a teacher may be rigid and strict with students but may not with his/her family. An officer may behave with the subor dinates differently as compare to his/her friends. Our situations in life are constantly changing and th ese can affect our personality in varying degrees. 107 Some have greater opportunities in life like bette r amenities, better schools and greater advantages than others. Learning skills, life skills, communicative skills and language skills although partially latent in some, can only be acquired through personal effort and gained through practice and experience. Hence it is our competence in handling life-situat ions that can positively influence our personality . Psychological And Philosophical Factors Influencing/ Shaping Personality Psychological & philosophical factors play a big role in the functioning of the human behaviour and development of one's personality. These include our motives, acquired interests, values our attitudes, our will and character, our intellectual capacities such intelligence i.e, the abilities to perceive, to observe, to imagine, to think and to reason. A healthy self-image is the core determining factor of a strong personality. Your personality is your identity; it is the sum total of your inherent and acquired characteristics. It is not necessarily something you are born with, but something you definitely need to take responsibility for it is primarily you alone, who can shape your personality and create your reality. Past Experiences . Experience is one of the major determi nants of personality, it could affect a person either positively or negat ively. For instance a person wh o has harsh experiences of say, being left behind, may display characteristics of di strust and may isolate himself from others. On the other hand, good experiences can fuel us either consciously or subconsciously to be motivated to work towards achieving the same results . People respond depending upon their experiences whether good or bad. Dreams and Ambitions . Dreams and ambitions shape our personality in a way that it facilitates our goals. We start to set priorities and change the way we are in order for Such priorities to be fulfilled. Hence, these aspirations are perhaps the st rongest factors that develop our attitude towards work and career. Self-Image . Each person views himself quite diff erent from how other people perceive him. Thus, one's self-image usually breeds personality characteristics that sti ck within the self-image. People who feel highly with their selves display a ce rtain aura of confidence and make it always seem that they are a cut above the rest. Values . Personality of an individual is greatly influenced by the values a person strongly believes in. A person who adheres to high moral standards is a well-respected member of the society. He is known for his integrity and is truste d by not only his family members, but also by his colleagues and friends. The characteristics of such a person having a strong moral fiber ingrained into his character, can have a significant infl uence on the personality of an individual. Conclusion In reality, you may be playing many roles i.e. husband/wife, mom/dad, son/daughter, teacher/ student, bo ss/employee; each of these enact different aspects of your personality and require a different set of behavior and responsibilities. A combination of the roles you play each day, becomes the sum total of your personality. Developing a fine personality can be within anybodys grasp . It can be attained through systematic steps in personal development. It can be the direct result of mans positive attitude combined with all the above factors. In the final analysis, it is your skill in maintaining a balanced approach to making your life healthier and happier. 108 CHAPTER III SELF AWARENESS Introduction Self-awareness sounds very simple - after all dont we know ourselves. But if we are blatantly honest with ourselves, we might be come uncomfortable and experience stress since we will see our deficiencies and failure. Self-a wareness is a unique human capacity. Self- awareness is the concept that one exists as an individual, separate from other people, with private thoughts. Self-awareness is a personal understanding of the very core of one's own identity. Self-awareness includes our recognit ion of ourselves, our character, strengths, weaknesses, desires and dislikes. It can help us to recognize when we are stressed or feel under pressure. It is often a pre-requisite for effective communications, interpersonal relationship and developing empathy for others. Dimensions Of Self Awareness Self awareness involves knowing oursel ves and our personality, and accepting oneself inspite of our imperfection. It includes all aspects of our selves- our thoughts, emotions, like, dislikes, strengths, and weakness, knowledge the fa ct that though I am imperfect, but still I like myself since I am a good human being and possess many qualities. It acknowledges the fact that I may be imperfect, but still I like myself since I am a good human being and possess many qualities. To have complete self awareness one needs to concentrate on two aspects the first being how we perceive ourselves our strengths, weakness, abilit ies etc and seco ndly how others perceive us. Both the views together gives a person a complete picture about one self. Every person perceives oneself in three aspects as:- (a) The perceive self--the way we see that part of ourselves, (b) The real self--the way we truly are. (c) The ideal self--the way we would like to be in that area. Unhappiness and poor adjustments in persons are mainly because of discrepancies between the perceived and the real or ideal self. These unhappiness and poor adjustments are due to misperceptions of self which there by leads to discontentment . The following dimensions of Self-awarene ss will be dwelt with as many people limit their self awareness to their bio-data which is usually things known by everybody. However at a deeper level there is so much inside each one of us that it has many dimensions:- (a) Self Realization . Self-realization is the ultimate of self-awareness when one realizes one self and the requirement of their existence in the world. (b) Self Knowledge or Self Exploration . This is a process through which we undo or explore ourselves . This exploration and understanding and knowledge about three important areas Physical self- Knowledge about our own body, Social self - Knowledge about how we relate and interact with society; whether we are 109 social, extroverts or introverts; help ing nature; empathetic, etc. Inner self - Knowledge out our goals, dreams, aspirations, secrets, fears, etc. (c) Self Confidence . Self-confidence builds in from self-esteem and this is possible only when one is completely aware about ones abilities and limits . Success, appreciation, care, love etc, are factors that boost up the self- confidence . (d) Self Talk . These automatic thoughts can be po sitive or negative. Some of our self talk comes from logic and r eason. Other self talk may arise from misconceptions that we create because of lack of information. This is the endless talks and conversations that runs through our minds through the day. This is also a strategy for raising ones self-confidence if one practices positive thinking . (e) Self Motivation . Self-Motivation is what makes an individual work towards a goal or target, not fo r external reasons but because of his own internal will to achieve it. It is an important quality required by everybody to do various activities like studying, working, earning and building relationships. (f) Self Esteem . Self-esteem or self-worth includes a persons subjective ppraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positiv e or negative to some degree. Developing high self-esteem would improve our self- confidence , the way we look at ourselves, what we can do for ourselves, our well-being, our relationships and our happiness . (g) Self Image . Self-image is how one perceives himself-positively or negatively. Self- image is important because how one feels and thinks about himself affects the way he acts. Self-image about our body is called body image, which is very often a cause for low self-esteem. By body image one is keeping in mind both internal and external aspects of it . (h) Self Control . The ability to control your thoughts, emotions, urges, desires, fantasies, actions is called self-control. It is part of our will power, and includes delayed gratification . (j) Self Purpose . This is the ability to find a purpose for ourselves in relation to this world. What are our goals in terms of family , friendships, career, hobbies, interests. When taken to the extreme -what are our goals in te rms of our own selves in this world and universe - that is self-realization . (k) Individuality and Uniqueness . Every single human being is born in this world with different qualities inherent and later they acquire some as they live and learn . This helps individuals to become unique in skills giving them an identity of their own . This describes their individuality and describes each and every person in a different manner . (l) Personality . Personality can be defined as the distinctive and characteristic patterns of thought, emotion and behavior that define an individual's personal style of interacting with the physical an d social environment. Our personality has various dimensions, including our openness, conscientiousness, nature, etc . There are numerous courses available for personality development . 110 (m) Values . Value is a concept that describes the beliefs of an individual or culture. Love, care, courage, bravery, respect, in tegrity and compassion, and respecting our elders are examples of values. (n) Attitude . Attitude is a mind set the way we think and look at things. All of us at one time or another, express the thre e different types of attitudes: positive, negative and neutral. Attitude is the way you look at things. Half a glass of water may appear half empty tone and half full to another. (o) Character . This is defined as the collective qualities or characteristics that distinguish a person, including his reputation, morals and will power. Self Awarenes Through Activity Activity 1 - Warming Up . (a) Step - 1 . Tell the participants to shake hands with others and ask each others names. Encourage each participant to shake hands with as many participants as possible within a minute. (b) Step - 2 . Tell the participants to share their feelings during the exercise by asking following questions:- (i) Did you feel comfortable while shaking hands with others? (ii) What stopped you to do this exercise? Discuss with the participants that in th is exercise, some people would have felt comfortable and some would have been hesitant to shake hands. To know why people feel the way they felt, it is necessary to understand oneself. Note : If shaking hands is not culturally acceptable just finding names and greeting in the traditional way - for example, saying namaste or hello may be sufficient. Modify the other steps accordingly). The Self Awareness life skill s will be further internaliz ed by another activity as follows:- Activity 2 - Open Your Heart . (a) Step - 1 . Give each participant an A-4 size paper . Ask them to draw an outline of a heart . Then divide the heart into four sections . Name 111 (b) Step - 2. Encourage them to write down the following inside the heart: - (i) Significance/ meaning of their name - in the top left section. If they do not know the meaning of their name, ask them to write their name vertically and then add a positive adjective after each alphabet. For example, if someone s name is AJIT then - A - Affectionate J - Joyful I - Intelligent T - Talented (ii) Their likes and dislikes - in the top right section . (iii) Mention twso good qualities they po ssess and two qualities they want to change - in the bottom left section . (iv) What others think about them (two qualities) - in the bottom right section . (c) Step -3 Ask the participants to come and fix the heart prepared by them on the flipchart/board. Let each participant take tu rns to read the contents of one heart. This exercise will enable the participants to come closer to each other and will help them come to know of their own/other s talents. Tell the participants that each one is unique and has distinctive qualities. Every person has his/ her exclusive strengths and weakness. It is important to identify and accept the weaknesses of oneself to make an effort to change it into strengths. Body Image The class will be explained about the body im age how they have arrived at a particular quality of themselves and all about Body Image. (a) What is Body Image? Body image is the way we perceive our body. It also means how we believe others see our body. It is one of the factors that affects our self- esteem, and influences the way we accept or reje ct ourselves. It determines whether we feel attractive and confident in society. (b) What Decides our Body Image? Any external factors decide the way we view our body. These may be current fashion fads, role models, comments from parents, media and peer pressure. By seeing slim models in TV programs, girls get the impression that thin is in and therefore try to lose weight and go on diets. With so many fancy advertisements for fairness Creams, a dark complexioned boy or girl may have poor body image. Boys may dream of developing muscles like their favorite film heroes. All these concerns are not from their bodies and that of their role model. (c) What is Poor Body Image? A person is said to be suffering from \"poor body Image\" when he/she focuses on the negative (real or imaginary) aspects as perceived by himself or herself about his/her body. The positive aspe cts are totally or partially excluded by him/her . 112 He/she thus develops poor self-esteem . (d) What are the Harmful Effects of Poor Body Image? Poor or negative body image can produce a feeling of inferiority in the minds of adolescents. It can also lead to anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and in extr eme cases, suicide. A lot of money is wasted on attempts to change their bodies. Some people indulge in high-risk behavior, to prove that he/she is attractive to others. A desire to look like an ad ult also arises due to body image concerns. These may include smoking, consumption of alcohol, substance abuse and unsafe sex. Poor body image is also the cause of many eating disorders seen in adolescent girls and boys. Tackling Poor Body Image . (a) Enhance Self-Esteem . This can be done by peers, teachers, family and friends. The positive points of the adolescent should be highlighted to him/her. He/she should be motivated to concentrate on personal strength not related to physique, e.g . hard work, determination, patience, courage etc. (b) Build Up Critical Thinking . Is physical beauty the only criteria for success/popularity? Even film stars have to work very hard to make a movie successful. Many successful and famous people may not be very good looking. (c) Build up Positive Qualities . Everyone has some positive qualities. Hese should be identified and highlighted e.g. caring, confident, hardworking etc. (d) Understand Cultural Variation . The colour of skin and shape of body and facial features vary from country to country and even within a country from state to state . The definition of beauty also varies from region to region. (d) Dispel Myths . Like being thin is in , fair & lovely , fair &handsome . (f) Utilise Life Skills. Life skills like critical thinking and self-awareness can be utilized to promote or develop a positive body image. Conclusion Self-Awareness is called the mother of all skills. It is a thinking skill, a social skill and a coping skill. It is one of the most difficult skills to master. Many great saints spend their life meditating and looking inward but only a few like Buddha actually achieve complete self-awareness. Knowing others is wisdom but knowing oneself is enlightenment - Tao Tzu. Awareness about our self is the first step towards creation . This understanding then gives us the opportunity and freedom to change those things youd like to change about yourself and create the life you want. 113 CHAPTER - IV CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING Introduction Critical thinking is an ability to Analyse info rmation and experi ences in an objective manner. It helps us to recognize and assess the factors t hat influence attitudes and behavior, such as media and peer pressure influences. Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent something new. Creativity is not the ability to create out of nothing, but the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing or reapplying existing ideas. Some creative ideas are astonishi ng and brilliant, whiles others are just simple, good, practical ideas that no one seems to have thought of yet. Critical Thinking Critical thinking is not criticism, it's a link between positive thinking and creative thinking, and are very essential for positive and creative emotions and behavior. It is also called \"logical\" thinking and \"analytical\" thinking. Critical thinking enabl es us to Analyse information and experiences, objectively, and assess the factors that influence the way we think and act. Critical thinking is important for any of our crucial life decisions. What options do I have? What can each option lead to? Is this really what I want? It is the process of determini ng the authenticity, accuracy or value of something; and is characterized by the ability to:- (a) Seek reasons and alternatives. (b) Perceive the total situation. (c) Change one's views based on evidence. Critical thinking involves logical thinking and reasoning. It also includes skills such as comparison, classification, cause/effect, deductive reasoning, and planning. After all, the quality of everything we do is determined by the quality of our thinking. It involves analyzing and judging the information provided, and then weighing the pros and cons and the consequences of any action. Critical thinkers gather in formation from all senses, verbal and/ or written expressions, reflection, observation, experience and reasoning. Critical thinking requires skills in:- (a) Analyzing the information and examining it in detail. (b) Thinking about different perspectives an d possibilities (c) Problem solving - considering available information before making an appropriate decision. (d) Reasoning - thinking logically; making links between ideas and information. (e) Evaluating - examining information, to as sess whether it is useful, relevant, and reliable. Critical thinking is about following attitudes:- (a) Open-mindedness - w illing to examine multiple points of views. 114 (b) Flexibility - able to change your point of view. (c) Persistence - able to follow a line of reasoning. (d) Interpersonal sensitivity - willing to respect the opinions of others. (e) Intercultural sensitivity - respecting dive rsity of culture, socioeconomic variations, etc. Critical Thinking Promotes Creativity. To come up with a creative solution to a probleminvolves not just having ideas. The new ideas being generated must also be useful and relevant to the task at hand. Critical thinking plays a crucial role in evaluating new ideas, selecting the best ones and modifying them if necessary. Critical Thinking is Crucial for Self-Reflection. In order to live a meaningful life and tostructure our lives accordingly, we need to justify and reflect on our values and decisions. Critical thinking provides the tools for this process of self-evaluation. An individual with critical thinking skills is able to do the following:- (a) Raise pertinent questions, which are clear and precise. (b) Identify the relevance and importance of ideas. (c) Understand the logical connections between ideas. (d) Assess statement and arguments. (e) Detect inconsistencies and common mistake in reasoning. (f) Examine belief, assumptions, and opinion and weigh them against facts. (g) Listen carefully to others and give feedback. (h) Suspend judgment until all facts have been gathered and considered. (j) Look for evidence to support assumptions and beliefs. (k) Adjust opinion when new facts are found. (l) Reject information that is incorrect or irrelevant. (m) Interested in finding new solutions. (n) Gather and assess relevant informati on, using abstract ideas to interpret it effectively. Draw well-reasoned conclusions and solutions after testing them against relevant criteria and standards. (o) Solve problems systematically. Creative Thinking Activity I (a) Step - 1 . Tell the participants that it is time for another interesting exercise. Make 9 dots on the flipchart as shown in FigA. A sk the participants to draw four straight lines through the nine dots without retracing and without lifting their pen from the paper. 115 Figure A Figure B (b) Step - 2 . Give 5 minutes to the participants to do this exercise, and then ask them to share their drawings. Applaud thos e participants who could make the drawing correctly as shown in Fig. B. Tell the participants that the key to the solution is that the imaginary boundaries formed by the dots need not be observed. Once freed from this restriction, it is easy to find a solution, as shown here. Creativity encompasses the following:- (a) An Ability . Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent something new. Creativity isnot the ability to create out of nothing, but the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing or reapplying existing ideas. Some creative ideas are astonishing and brilliant, whiles others are just simple, good, practical ideas that no one seems to have thought of yet. Everyone has substantial creat ive ability. Often all that's needed to be creative is to make a commitment to creativity and to take the time for it. (b) An Attitude . Creativity is also an attitude: the ability to accept change andnewness, a willingness to play with ideas an d possibilities, a flexibility of outlook, the habit of enjoying the good, while looking for ways to improve it. (c) A Process . Creative people work hard continuously to improve ideas and solutions, by making gradual alterations and re finements to their works. Contrary to the mythology surrounding creativity, very few works of creative excellence are produced with single stroke of brilliance. T he creative person knows that there is always room for improvement. Characteristics of the Creative Person.A crea tive person has the following characteristics:- (a) Curious. (b) Seeks problems. (c) Enjoys challenge. (d) Optimistic. (e) Able to suspend judgment. (f) Comfortable with imagination. (g) Sees problems as opportunities. 116 (h) Sees problems as interesting. (j) Problems are emotionally acceptable. (k) Challenges assumptions. (l) Doesn't give up easily: perseveres, works hard. Activity 2 . (a) Step - 1 . Inform the participants that it is time to play another game. Take them outside where they can have a large area to work. Split them into two teams (or more if the group is large). (b) Step - 2 . Explain that they are to create a long line on the ground or floor, using whatever they currently have on their bodies (they are not permitted to take off their clothes except shoes and socks). They are not permitted to get additional things, but whatever they have tissue, handkerchief, watche s, shoes, pen etc. can be used to make the line longer and longer. Their goal is to have a longer line than the other teams. (If people are really creative, they will use everything possible and then lie down on the ground themselves to make the line longer). The team with the longest line is the winner.Initiate a discussion on how creative and critical thinki ng helped them in making thei r line longer. How creative and critical thinking helps in finding solutions to the problems? (c) Step - 3 . Initiate a discussion on how creative and critical thinking helped them in making their line longer. How creative an d critical thinking helps in finding solutions to the problems? Creative thinking means finding solutions beyond our usual or traditional way of reacting to a problem. We are often limited by our past experien ces, and we dread to think differently. To go beyond the traditional boundaries of doing things, it is necessary to empower ourselves with more information through newspapers, radio, TV, cla ssmates, teachers, relatives, friends, or even strangers. Research is the key to help us formulate ideas towards finding a creative solution. Creative thinking will enable us to find solution when it looks as if there is no way out. Conclusion Critical thinking is not criticism, it's a link between positive thinking and creative thinking. Creativity is the ability to generate new ideas by co mbining, changing, or r eapplying existing ideas. It helps us to look beyond our direct experience, and to respond adaptively and with flexibility to situations in our daily lives. 117 CHAPTER-V COMMUNICATION SKILLS- 1 Introduction Communication issharing ideas, opinions, thoughts, feeling and understanding through speech, writing, gestures or symbols betw een two or more persons. We are communicating all the time with others Understanding Basics of Communication Communication is conveying a message - verbally, written or through the use of signs. If we do not talk with others, then they will not know what we ar e thinking and they will not be able to understand us. One will feel terribly lonely this way. For some people, it is the problem of not know ing how to communicate. For others, it may be that they are too afraid to talk about their problems, shar e their views, and let others know what is going on in their mind. In fact, without communication, our relationships with others are likely to be dominated by suspicion, guess work, misunderstandings and false assumptions. Empathy creates wonderful results only when we are willing to let others know how we feel. Lack of communication breeds problems in our rela tionships. We tend to assume that others know what we want or how we feel. Then when they do not react as we expect they should, we get upset. We expect people to understand us. Different Ways of Communication Activity 1 (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to find a partne r with whom they haven't paired with before. When everyone has a partner , ask the pairs to sit together. (b) Step - 2 . Give two news clippings/messages to each participant. One of the news clippings should be relatively easy while the second clipping should be more difficult. (c) Step - 3 . Allow the first person a few moments to read the first news clipping. The second person does nothing at this point but sits quietly. The first person is then blindfolded and is asked to narrate what he/she had read. (d) Step - 4 . The second person who wa s listening will then re peat what he/she heard while the first person listens . Both partners will then check the news clipping to see if the information was reported correctly or if anything was missing from the narration. (e) Step - 5 . Let the participants swit ch roles by having the second person read his/her news clipping and then narrate it blindfolded to thei r partner. Follow the same process in Step 4. (f) Step -6 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions: (i) What have they learnt from this activity? (ii) How did they feel when they had to speak or when they had to listenwhile blindfolded - especially during the second it em, which was more difficult than the first? (iii) How did they feel being blindfolded when they were communicating with others? (iv) Was it different from normal communication? (v) What is the importance of eye c ontact when talking to another person? 118 (g) Step - 7 . Discuss the three different styles of communication - Aggressive, Passive and Assertive. Ask participants if they can demonstrate these three different styles of communication, how the body language, tone and cont ent changes with the style of communication There are three ways of communication as under:- (a) Aggressive . They believe that everyone should li ke them; I am never wrong I`ve got rights but you don`t. They have a close mind and ar e poor listeners. They have difficulty in seeing the other person point of view, they interrupt and monopolize. They tend to dominate and put down others. (b) Passive . The persons do not express their true fee lings;they do not disagree and think that others have more rights than they do. Their communication style is indirect, they always agree and do not speak out and are very hesitant. While comm unicating they often lack facial expression and stand with down cast eyes. (c) Assertive . The person believes he/she as well asothers are valuable. They know that if they have rights then others also have rights. They are active listene rs and check on others feelings. They are action oriented, attentive, vocal, expres sive, good listeners, aware, supportive, persuasive, fair, open and consistent in behavior. Their expect ations are realistic. They have open and natural gestures. They maintain an eye contact while communicating. Components of Effective Communication Activity 2 (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to form pairs - encourage the young people to form pairs with peers they haven't pai red with before. When everyone has a partner have the pairs sit together. (b) Step - 2 . Then one of them should start by descr ibing to the other an important event in his/her life, which made him/her feel happy. (c) Step - 3 . The listener should say nothing, but should just concentrate hard on hearing what is being said. After a couple of minutes, as k the listener to stop listening. She/he could yawn, look elsewhere, turn around, whistle, do what ever she/he wants to show that she/he has stopped listening, although the speaker should continue to describe her/his story. After a couple of minutes, call \"halt\". At this stage, the speaker and listener should change roles. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 of the exercise. (d) Step - 4 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions:- (i) How did they feel as a speaker? Encour age them to compare telling their story to a willing listener and speaking with a non-willing listener. (ii) How did they feel as good and bad listeners? (iii) What are the characteri stics of good and bad listening? (iv) Could you make out from the body language of the listener whether she/he was listening? (v) What do you do when the person you ar e communicating with is not listening? (vi) What steps can be taken to communicate more effectively? (e) Step - 5 . Tell the participants that effective communication involves: (i) Verbal Communication (ii) Non-verbal Communication 119 (iii) Listening also tell them the other components of communication - Source, Message, Receiver, Channel with the help of a diagram. Discuss how one can reduce the communication gap. Effective Communicative involves:- (a) Verbal Communication . One person talks and the other listen to be able to react. The conversation can be informative, in the form of questions, a negotiation, and statement or open ended questions, instruction, etc. And the situatio n can be formal or informal. In relationships, communication is usually informal. Speech problem, too long sentences, mumbling, speaking too softly, hearing problems, listeners interrupting the s peaker, loud external noises, etc. all hamper proper communication. (b) Non-Verbal Communication . Non verbal communication is that gives meaning to what is said and may communicate both appreciation and reject ion. It includes such things as tone of voice, a nod of head, using silence, frowning, smiling, body posture, touch, shaking of the head to communicate approval or disapproval, lifting of t he eyebrows to show surprise, distance between persons, playing with something in hand instead of focusing. (c) Listening . During communication, one person talks and another person listens. The listeners must give attention to all that is said, without interrupting the speaker and react later in a relevant manner. Many people may listen but know what the full message is. Some people react to when only half is said. There are people who listen selectively, who miss much of the message and only focus on points relevant to him or her. How would we know if someone is not listening to us:- (a) Look somewhere else. (b) Interrupts communication. (c) Constantly looks at the watch. (d) Gets up to do so mething and returns. (e) Gives advice. (f) Talks to someone else. (g) Answers the phone. (h) Begins to do some work. (j) Does not stop doing work. (k) Says that she/he will be back in a minute and does not return. (i) Looks bored. Components of Communication:- Source Message Receive r Channel Feedback Why is Effective Communication Important to Young People ? Adolescence being a period of immense change, communication during this transitional phase of life assumes even more importance. Young people should be equipped to effectively communi cate with others regarding their feelings and emotions or decisions. Also, a young person who is in need of advice or who harbour s some fears, needs to talk to others and expr ess himself/herself. Conclusion The ability to effectively communicate with other people is an important life skill. Through communication, people reach some under standing of each other, learn to like each other, influence one another, build trust, and learn more about them selves and how people perceive them. People who communicate effectively know how to interact with others flexibly, skillf ully, and responsibly, but without sacrificing their own needs and integrity. COMPONENTS OF COMMUNICATION 120 CHAPTER-VI COMMUNICATION SKILLS- 2 Introduction Overcoming the many barriers to communication is more a matter of common sense, practice and effort than any specific skill. Essentially, being an effective communicator means having the skill to recognize if and when there is a barrier to communication and being able to resolve it. Common Barriers to Effective Communication No matter how good and effective a communicator one maybe, yet the fact is that one does face certain barriers, from time to time, which forces them to work on becoming even more effective in their skills to communicate. Given here are the communication barrier s that occur while listening, speaking and in the case of non- verbal communications. Listening Barriers . (a) Interrupting the speaker. (b) Not maintaining eye contact with the speaker. (c) Rushing the speaker to complete what he has to say. (d) Making the speaker feel as thoug h he is wasting the listener's time. (e) Being distracted by something that is not part of the ongoing communication. (f) Getting ahead of the speaker and completing his thoughts. (g) Ignoring the speaker's requests.

Ask the participants to brainstorm on the effect of such barriers. (i) The communication may remain incomplete. (ii) The intended results may not be achieved. (iii) A 'communication gap' emerges due to the different perception that the sender (intended meaning of the communication) and t he receiver (perceived meaning of the communication) have. (b) Step - 2 . Explain the factors that in fluence the communication gap. The factors that cause the 'communication gap' are many. They include - Hierarchy (not able to question hi gher authority for clarification) Conflict of interest ( e.g. personal in terest versus the parental expectations) The level of motivation that one holds. (e.g. I do not care, things can wait) Perception (e.g. Nobody understands me ) Psychological factor (e.g. fear of autho rity and power, anger about following rules) Stress (e.g. stress due to exams/ work/personal pressure and hence misunderstand the communication) Activity 2 . (a) Step - 1 . Ask the participants to add any more fa ctors from their personal experience especially related to interpersonal communication with mother, father, elder /younger siblings, teachers, at work etc). Ask them to expl ain how do they resolve or bridge the gap? (b) Step - 2 . Tell them, that it is important to identify the communication gaps and develop skills to bridge the same. End the sessi on by emphasising on the following key messages: (i) Communication is a basic skill and forms the foundation of all relationships. 123 (ii) The quality of communication often det ermines the quality of a relationship. (iii) We communicate to give inform ation, express our feelings, solve problems/arguments/conflicts, to show that we care, etc. (iv) Understanding how to communicate and learning how to communicate effectively in different situations protects young people from risks and risky behaviour.

Conclusion Communication is a basic skill and forms the foundation of all relationships. The quality of communication often determines the quality of a relations hip. We communicate to give information, express our feelings, solve problems/arguments/ conflicts, to sh ow that we care, etc. Th erefore understanding how to communicate and learning how to communicate effectively in different situations protects young people from risks and risky behavior. 124 CHAPTER-VII DECISION MAKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING Introduction We make decisions every day. Some are made after careful deliberation, some made more hastily. Problem solving skills enable us to deal with problems in our lives in a constructive manner. The process of problem solving involves various steps. They are identi fying the problem, exploring the available alternative and deciding on the best possible solution. Decision Making Skills . Activity 1 . What is Decision Making? (a) Step - 1 . Encourage the participants to think of any decision they have taken (or seen anyone taking) in the last one week and discuss how decisions are usually taken. Ask some of the participants to share their answers with t he larger group. Some possible answers are:- (i) Someone else takes it for them. (ii) Decide suddenly. (iii) Wait until someone else decides. (iv) Do what an older person says. (v) Don't take any decision at all. (vi) Think through the choices and then choose. (b) Step - 2 . Ask the participants to sit in a circle. Walk around the circle with the cloth/paper bag in which you have put 8-10 small item s and ask each participant to feel the contents in the bag (no peeping into the bag). The participants should try to remember what they felt in the bag. Each participant is given 20 seconds (facilitator counts to 20) to feel the contents in the bag. When all the participants have had a chance to feel the contents in the bag, ask all the participants to share what they felt in the bag. T hen show the objects in the bag one by one. (c) Step - 3 . Initiate a discussion with the help of following questions:- (i) When you felt the objects in the bag, why did you feel that you could identify what they were? (ii) In spite of feeling the same contents, what made the participants identify some of the objects differently? (iii) Do people use past experiences to he lp them make decisions about issues that have occurred after those experiences? (iv) How can those experiences have a positive or negative effect on further decisions? Decision Making . We make decisions every day. Examples of minor decisions which we take very often are - what to eat, what to wear or how to reach a place. Examples of major decisions which we take once in a life time are - what career to choose, when and whom to marry, where to buy a house, which college to go to etc. Decision making is a complex process. Some decisions are made after careful deliberation, some are made more hastily; some are made through our own will, some under the pres sure of others.Our past experiences determine many of the decisions we make. Sometimes due to the past experiences we are afraid of doing things differently. 125 Problem Solving Activity 2 . We introduce the topics to the cadets by following activity:- (a) Step 1 . Ask the participants, when faced with a problem, how do you react? Most of you try to escape from the problem instead of facing it. (b) Step 2 . You should always question yourself, \"Do I have problem?\"If you don't take any action to solve the problem, your ability cannot be im proved. Problems give us opportunity to evolve to our full potential. Problems are often opportunities in disguise. When we escape from problems, we give up the opportunity to develop our skills and potentials. Once we resolve our problems, we will find ourselves happier, more fulfilled, and more ready to confront new issues. Tackling problems involves the use of our mind. The process enhances our capacity to solve greater problems. Problems are not to be avoided or feared. Problems ar e part of life, and are there for us to solve, not evade. Problems left unsolved can bring mental stress and eventually affect our health. Problem solving skills empower us not only to confront our prob lems, but can in fact turn them into opportunities. Conclusion Problems are not to be avoided or feared. Problems are part of life, and are ther e for us to solve, not evade. Problems left unsolved can bring mental stress and eventually affect our health. Problem solving skills empower us not only to confront our problems, but in fact turn them into opportunities. Whenever required cadets can take help from their trusted adul ts and friends in understanding their problem better and working at appropriate solution. 126 CHAPTER-VIII EFFECTIVE USE OF TIME Introduction We all have one thing in common a 24 hour day. It is how we use our time that makes the difference. Time is money because it is the only one you ca n't reorder or renew.Time is irreplaceable and irreversible. Few things are more important to us than learning how to save time and how to spend it wisely. Paradoxically, to save time you must spend time. Both time and money are limited resources. Essentials of Time Management Time management is a set of skills, tools, and systems that work together to help you get more value out of your time and use it to accomplish what you want. Successful people use time management to achieve outstanding results, both personally and profession ally. Until you come to grips with that reality, your personal time problems will remain. Time management helps you to: - (a) Reduce or eliminate wasted time and effort so you'll have more productive time each day. (b) Improve your productivity so you c an accomplish more with less effort. (c) Focus your time and energy on what is most important and make time for the things you want and value. Thus help you fi nd greater balance and fulfillment. (d) Improve your performance while reducing stress. (e) Set and achieve your long-term goals. Time Wasters Time is like a precious jewel. It must be guarded well and worn with discretion or you will suddenly realize that it has been stolen. Major time-wasters are:- (a) Mobile phone . Learn to control the mobile phone, or it will control you. Regard yourmobilephone as a business tool, not a soci al one. Practice having quick, to the point conversations. (b) Visitors . When faced with the question: Have you got a minute? Don't fall into the courtesy trap of saying yes when you really want to say no. Learn to give a polite no, and then tell them when they can see you.. Try some of thes e techniques if a visitor overstays their time:- (i) At the finish of work, stand up. (ii) Let the visitor see you by looking at your watch, or your body language. (iii) Don't make eye contact with the chat ty one. Keep your head down and continue working. (c) Paper . The best guideline for paperwork is to either file it or toss it. We never use80% of the paperwork we keep. Computer printers produ ce over two and a half million pieces of paper every minute throughout the world. (i) Try, where possible, to make a decision about each piece of paper when you first handle it. 127 (ii) Don't handle your daily mail until you are r eady to deal with it properly. If you take a quick look and then go back to it later, you've just doubled thoseminutes. (iii) Learn to read selectively. (iv) Learn to throw out what you probably won't need. (d) Lack of Planning and Fire Fighting . The best way to avoid crises is to anticipatethem. Common reasons are lack of planning, unrealistic ti me frames, and reluctance by subordinates to break bad news. Tips to help you deal with the situation:- (i) Firstly, take time to think. Then ask questions. What is the real problem? Where possible, get input from more than one sour ce. What can you ask others to help with? (ii) Once you've made a decision, get on with it. Whoever hesitates is lost! (iii) What can be done to avoid the same problem happening again? (e) Socializing . Avoid extended tea-breaks, regular social lunch-hours, and unnecessary chats in the corridors. (f) Indecision . Caused by ignorance, fear, or lack of confidence in the facts. Improveyour fact-finding procedures, and learn to listen to yo ur intuition. If we can learn to make decisions quickly, we save time. Successful people make de cisions quickly. They're not necessarily always right, but they do decide. (g) Whatsapp, TV, Lap top, I Pad Fac ebook etc can be a huge time wasters. (h) Procrastination . Procrastination, which comes from the Latin word for tomorrowis the world's number one time-waster. Procrastinati on can best be defined as putting off the doing of something that should be done intentionally & habitually. It you suspect that you are prone to procrastination always ask yourself Why am I pu tting this off? If you can see no good reason - and don't confuse reasons with excuses brace yourself a nd take action this day. By off-loading today's work onto tomorrow you are simply storing up work for yourself. Start now by doing something today that you have been putting off. The best tool to fight time-wasters is a firm decision to concentrate on the few things that, in a day, will make a long-term difference. Principles of Time Management There are some basic principles of time m anagement. These are given in the subsequentparas. Develop a Personal Sense of Time . Make sure you know where your time goes. Don'tdepend on memory, it's treacherous. Put time under the micros cope. You cannot manage time that is past. But you can examine how you managed it in an objective and realistic way. Identify Long-Term Goals . The foundation of good time management is to first, find outwhat matters deeply to you - what it is you really want to achieve in life. Spend time on considering what are your own personal values? What really matters to you at th is stage of yourlife? Remember, they must be your values no-one else's. In this, concentrate on four ke y areas of your life - Self and Well being, Community and Humanity, Home and Family and Business and Career. Concentrate on High Return Activities . In any organisation there are a few basicfunctions, which are central to its effective function ing. For a classroom teacher the hi gh-return activity will be enabling the children to learn well. Weekly and Daily Planning . Traditional time management teachi ng talks of daily planning,so why change?. If we mainly focus on our daily scheduling, we 're looking at what's under our nose and we tend to 128 become immersed in the urgent. Hence, from our m onthly goals and objectives, plan a weekly focus. Planning on a weekly basis helps us to take better control of our lives. . Make the Best Use of Your Best Time . The quality of your attention or concentrationvaries at different times. You may notice that you habitually tend to be more mentally alert, at certain times of the day. 20% of your time produces 80% of your high-quality output.. Make Use of Committed Time . You may sometimes complain that you lack time. But youhave all the time there is for you. At work there is time wh ich you can choose to spend as, committed time. If you are alert you may find portions of it, which are actually free time. Think of an example of committed time in the last week, where you found unexpectedly that you had at least half an hour to spare. What did you do with it? Could you have put that time to better use? What w ould you need to have had with you in order to do so? Manage Your Health . (a) Even a few weeks off being avoidably ill is going to involve you in a major waste of productive time. Depending on the nature of your illness, you may be able to use it in some constructive way. To give to your work and to others high quality time you must top up your energy levels. (b) Do you get enough sleep? The norm is eight ho urs, slightly less as you grow older. You can function on much less, but your creativity is 15% down. Do you apply common sense to diet? The Golden rule is moderation in all things. Do you take exercise? Do you take holidays? Remember that you can do a full year's work in 11 months, bu t you cannot do it in 12 months. It is a good idea to spend some time just meditating. Conclusion Time management should be fun. Keep it as simp le as possible. The good news is that you will never meet the perfect time manager. You are probably very good - now you could be better. The wonderful thing is that tomorrow's 24 hours now await you untouched and unwasted. You are now in a position to make more effective use of your time. Always remember, NOW is the keyword of time management. If you want to reap in the future, you have to sow now. And, Your Time Starts Now'! 129 CHAPTER-IX COPING WITH ST RESS AND EMOTIONS Introduction Stress is a very common phenomenon and is univ ersal in nature. It is our body's reaction to people and events and to our own thoughts. Some level of stress is normal, such as before a test, stage performance or an athletic event. Coping with stress means recognizing the source of stress in our lives, recognizing how this affects us physically and emotionally, and acting in ways that help us control our levels of stress, by changing our environment or life style and learning how to relax. Understanding Stress and its Impact Stress is unique and personal to each of us. W hat is relaxing to one person may be stressful to another. But too much stress can have physical and psychol ogical effects that interfere with the health and well-being of an individual. Overtime repeated st ress can lower self-esteem, decrease academic performance and create a cycle of self-blame and self-doubt. Activity - Stress and its Impact on Us . Distribute three cards, each with one of thefollowing titles:- (a) \"Physical\",\"Emotional\" and \"Behavioral\" to each participant. (b) Ask the participants to imagine a stressful situation and write responses to the following questions:- (i) What happens to their body when they are stressed? (Physical-e.g. headache, restless). (ii) How do they feel when they are stressed? (iii) What do they do when are stressed? (Behavioral -e.g. cry, shout at others). Expected Responses . (a) Effect on the body (Physical) - hea dache, grinding teeth, trembling. (b) Effect on feelings (Emotional) - depressed, angry, irritated, anxious. (c) Effect on behavior - do not sleep, eat a lot, do not eat, cry, break things, becomes silent. The class will be explained that stress signals fall into four categories: thoughts, feelings, behaviours and physical symptoms.

Everyone needs to find ways that work best for them. (a) Take Deep Breath . Stress often causes us to breathe quickly and this almostalways causes more stress. Try to take deep slow breaths. Breathe in through your nose and count as you breathe out through mouth. Inhale enough so your lower abdomen rises and falls. (b) Talk It Out . When you feel stressed, try to express your feelings. Bottling offeelings can increase stress. Share your feelings. Perhap s a friend, family members, teacher can help you see your problem in a new way. Talking with some one else can help clear your mind of confusion so that you can focus on problem solving. Even if it is slightly embarrassing, asking for help after a problem occurs may avoid serious problems later. Writing down thoughts and feeling can help clarify the situation and give a new perspective. (c) Take A Break . Recognize when you are most stressed and allow yourself somereasonable break. When things seem especial ly difficult, take a walk or otherwise change your scenery. (d) Create A Quite Place In Your Mind . You cannot always run away, but you candream. Imagining a quite place can take you ou t of a stressful situation. When you have the chance, take a moment to close y our eyes and imagine a place where you feel relaxed and comfortable. Notice all the details of your chosen place, including pleasant sounds, smells and temperature. (e) Pay Attention to Physical Comfort . Be as physically comfort able as the situationwill allow. Wear comfortable clothing. If it`s t oo hot, go somewhere where it`s not. If chair is uncomfortable, move. Do not wait until your discomfort turns into a real problem. (f) Move . Physical activity can help reduce and pr event stress. When you feelnervous, angry or upset, release the pressure through exercise or physical activity.

Trying to take care of everything at once can seem overwhelming and may keep you from accomplishing anything. (k) Know your Limits . When in a stressful situation, as k yourselfis this my problem? If it isn`t, leave it alone. If it is, can I resolve it now? Once the problem is settled, leave italone. Do not agonize over the decision, and try to accept situation you cannot change (l) Do you have to be Right Always ? Do you get upset when things don`t go yourway? Consider cooperation or compromise rather than co nfrontation. It may reduce the strain and help everyone feel more comfortable. (m) Have a Good Cry . It is normal for people of all ages to cry. A good cry duringstressful times can be a healthy way to bring relief to your stress, and may prevent a headache or other physical consequences of stress.

Your t houghts can become like a pair of very dark glasses, allowing you to see very little light or joy in your life. Decide to notice five good things around you. 131 (o) Talk Less, Listen More . Listening banishes stress, makes you more popular, moreknowledgeable, more sensitive. Understanding Emotions and Feelings The class will be introduced to various emotions by activity method. Activity One - Understanding Emotions . (a) Step-1 . Prepare cards with names of some emoti ons such as happy, shy, scared,excited, angry, envy, guilty, jealously, love etc. etc and pu t them in a bag. Note: Depending on the number of participants, you can have three-four cards having the same emotion. (b) Step-2 . Make the participants sit in a circleand pass the parcel of emotions whilethe music plays. When the music stops, the participant who has the parcel picks up a card from the bag and acts on the emotion described. No words are to be used. The rest of the participants have to guess the emotion expressed. (c) Step-3 . Also ask the participants to say in stances where they will feel like theemotion mentioned (like one feels happy w hen everything goes their way). (d) Step-4 . Tell the participants that all emotions are integral part of life. Activity Two- Mixing and Matching Feelings . (a) Step-1 . Tell the participants that a good way to know our emotions is to understandour associated body language. Understanding how our body reacts to the feelings help us to think about the feeling and express it the way we choose. (b) Step-2 . Take one volunteer aside and tell him/her to say the following statement infour different ways sounding happy, fed-up, scared, and a ngry to the larger group. Ask the participants to identify the emotions he/she is expressing:- (i) I was asked to go to the Principal's Office - (say it with excitement as if an honour is being given, and you are going to get some good news). (ii) I was asked to go to the Principal's Office-(Say it as if you are fed-up of going there, you are bored). (iii) I was asked to go the Principal's Office-(Say it as if you are scared, and you have no clue what is going to happen). (iv) I was asked to go to the Principal's Office - (Say it as if you are angry at being asked to go-and as if an unfair event is taking place. Alternative Statement . (a) My uncle from the neighbouring village will come home tomorrow. (b) I was asked to go to the village Pradhan's house. Step-3 . Explain that with every feeling there is an associated body language, whichhelps us understand the feeling.If we want to change the consequenc e, we need to under stand the feeling and associated body language. Step-4 . Divide the participants into five groups - Give each group five feelingstatements (given below) and place them on the floor/table for each group:- (a) When I am angry. (b) When I am very sad. 132 (c) When I am happy. (d) When I am very scared. (e) When I am very nervous. Step-5 . Give each group a set of five body statement s that have to be matchedwith the feeling statements. Give set a first, once they have completed Set A give Set B and following completion give Set C. Shuffle the statement cards before giving to the participants. (a) Set A Body Statements . (i) I feel a lot of tension in my neck and my shoulders. (ii) I feel empty inside. (iii) I feel light, like I am flying in the air. (iv) I feel weak at my knees. (i) I feel queasy or bad in my stomach. Set B Body Statements . (a) I breathe shallow and quick. (i) My heart feels heavy. (ii) I want to smile. (iii) My heart beats very fast. (iv) I can't sit still. Set C Body Statements . (a) My head is about to burst and I perspire a lot. (i) I feel very tired and tears come from my eyes very fast. (ii) I feel energetic. (iii) Palms become very cold. (iv) I have a headache. Individual variations in emotional expressions are primarily due to age and past experiences. Variations in expressions also occur within the individual, No one follows a consistent pattern at all time. How a person reacts to an emotion-provoking stimulus depends on his/her physical condition at that time, on the interests and activities that are preoccupying him/her at that time, on his/her mood, on the social group with which he/she happens to be etc. Conclusion Coping with stress means recognizing the source of stress in our lives, recognizing how this affects us physically and emotionally, and acting in ways that help us control our levels of stress, by changing our environment or life style and learning how to relax.Emot ions form a as integral part of our life. A well adjusted and mentally healthy person is one who is able to keep his/her emotion under control. One should not be carried away by one's emotions. 133 CHAPTER-X SOCIABILITY: SOCIAL SKILLS ETTIQUETTES AND MANNERS Introduction Etiquette, the manners and forms prescribed by custom, usage, or authority and accepted when people deal with each other, as corr ect or proper behavior.

Most of the people do not know the art of speaking. While some are just inept and incompetent, there are others wh o lack confidence and yet others who do not have mannerism and etiquettes. Improving Social Skills (a) Be Yourself . Only when you are your own self do you feel comfortable. And it iswhen you are in utmost comfort that you indulge in free conversation and interaction. Do not change your inner self for anything in the world. Remember , humans have this innate quality of discovering whether a person is real or fake. In case y ou pretend to be someone you are not, you would be lonelier than ever before. (b) Be Responsible . One of the vital components of soci al interaction is to know thatart of carrying yourself. It is very important for you to know what to do and how to behave in a social gathering. A person behaving in an undesirable an d unacceptable manner is usually avoided by people. So, be responsible for your actions and act according to the situation. (c) Be Open & Approachable . Imagine talking to a person who is an absoluteintrovert or extrovert! Extremes of personality often turn off people. Ideally, you should have a fusion of both the characters. While being too shy and withdrawn is enough to repel people immediately, being too loud and outgoing would not do much good eit her. Just strike a delicate balance between both the personalities and you would be th estar of the social gathering. 135 (d) Be Attentive . The art of listening is a stepping ston e for conversation and interaction. Alas! Not many have it in them. If you would hav e attended a social gathering, you will know that everyone wants to talk, but no one is ready to liste n. So, the trick is to be an attentive listener and people would definitely talk to you. Also, do not interru pt or chip in a piece of advice or suggestion just when the other person is in the middle of a subject. (e) Be Polite . Being humble and down-to-earth is an excellent way to break the ice. Itsheds off all the apprehensions and nervousness and gives a good impression. It would speak miles about your manners, personality and confidence . Apart from being polite, it is also advisable to be diplomatic. While being honest and forthright definitely pays, sugar-coating the truth is very necessary at times. (f) Be Aware . It is very important to be aware and observant of people's behavior.For instance, watch if the person you are talking to is comfortable with the specific topic. If he looks uncomfortable or is simply disinterested, just mo ve on to the next topic. In casehe/she is not interested in talking to you completely, the best bet would be to move out of the scene. (g) Be Cautious . It is advisable to keep your sens es active. Do not shut your eyes, close your ears and numb your senses at the time of interacting. Keep a keen eye on who are your friends and who are your enemies. Do not conf ront everything to someone you have just met. Conclusion The point of etiquette is not, of course, the rules themselves but the comfort of the people concerned. Exhibiting bad manners and \"I don't care a damn\" attitude are the ones who are the social outcast. Manners that put a strain on others are no t good manners, no matter whose rules they follow. Remember, having good manners and etiquette can gravitate ever ybody towards you. 136 SUMMARY Personality Development means enhancing and grooming one's outer and inner self to bring about a positive change to your life which includes bo osting one's confidence, improving communication and language speaking abilities, widening ones scope of knowledge, developing certain hobbies or skills, learning fine etiquettes and manners, adding style and grace to the way one looks, talks and walks and overall imbibing oneself with pos itivity, liveliness and peace.

Throughout the ages, we have examples of leaders and groups performing well beyond their known capabilities under the most difficult conditions. We read and hear of leaders exhorting their men to perform tasks which appear to be almost impossible. How did these leaders motivate their followers to accomplish tasks which were so difficult? Definition \"Motivation is the commitment and urge within a member which makes him accomplish his task under all situations without thinking about the cost\" A good leader understands this basic truth and devices ways and means to keep his entire team always motivated. In a game of football or social se rvices field work, each member's motivation level is important for achieving the overall stated goals of the group. The urge or the force that motivates an individual comes from within. It is his will alone wh ich pushes him to the limits of his capabilities. Factors which Motivate A study of human history has given us three factors which help motivate any person. These are:- (a) Material Factors. (b) Intellectual Factors. (c) Spiritual Factors. These factors generate pride in and team spirit in on e's group. We shall look at each in some detail. Material Factors Material Factors are resources which are required to establish, maintain and enhance the basic quality of the life of the team and fu rtherance of their goals. A football t eam will require good and sufficient quantity of football boots, quality grounds, funds, kits for players etc. On ce the team is provided with the resources, the motivation level of members goes up .Lets consider an example. Kitting Of RDC Contingent . Participation in Republic Day Camp is a prestigious honor for any NCC cadet .The Inter Directorate competition held in Delhi requires that the teams go well prepared and with maximum of resources. Some of the state Direct orates go out of their way to provide all the support and resources required by the contingent which invariabl y increases the motivation level of these teams .It has been seen that those Directorates who provide all the material resources have performed better in the Inter Directorate competitions. Intellectual Factors These factors make an individual proud of his/her group and motivate other members to perform better in difficult situations. Let's look at few examples. Malala, an International Activist . Malala Yousafzai, a girl born in a small village in Pakistan is an international activist for girls education. Her courag e, determination and zeal for her cause made her an international youth icon. She was shot in the head by Taliban for speaking against the ban against girl education and destroying schools in the region. With gr eat efforts of number of countries and individuals she recovered fully after long period of treatment. It made her doubly determined to fight for the education rights of girl students across muslim world. 145 She founded Malala Education Fund and opened a school for Syrian refugee girls in Lebanon. Pakistani citizens came out in support of her forc ing the Pakistani government to ratify the Right to Education bill. For her courage, bravery and zeal, she became youngest recipient of Nobel Peace Prize in October, 2014. Her acts of courage and selfless service have motivated million across the globe to emulate her feat. Leadership Traits Shown by Malala . (a) Courage . She had the courage to speak against Taliban ban against girls going to school. Despite being threatened by them many time s, she did not stop studying or preparing for exams. (b) Determination . She was determined and spoke against Taliban on Radio and in TV interviews. The threat to her life didn't deter her. (c) Dedication . She is dedicated to the cause of girls education. She opened an Education Fund to finance girl's school after recovering from bullet injury. (d) Goal Oriented . She knew her goal well. She garnered support for her goal wherever she went and met famous personalities like Ban Ki Moon, Queen Elizabeth, Barack Obama etc. On her insistence, Pakistan government opened two senior secondary schools and a college in her area. Case study of Tarh Peeju, Recipient of National Bravery Award . On May 19, 2016, 9-year- old Tarh Peeju attempted saving her friends Phassang Marry and Tarh Charu when they were trying to cross Pachin River at Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. A student of class fourth at Alphabet Public School in Nirjuli, Tarh immediately jumped into the turbulent river and dragged both Marry and Charu to safety. While doing so she herself got entrapped by the st rong current and was dragged inside a whirlpool. She was swept downstream and drowned by the strong current of the river. For displaying unbelievable courage, sacrificing her own life in saving her frie nds, Tarh Peeju was conferred the National Bravery Award, the top National Br avery Award posthumously. Some of the qualities of leadership exhibited by Tarh Peeju are: (a) Alertness . Tarh Peeju's alert mind helped her take quick action to save two human lives. (b) Courage . Jumping into the river was exceptional act of courage. (c) Sacrifice . Tarh Peeju saw her friends drowning and could not stop herself. She saved the life of her friends by riski ng and sacrificing her own life. (d) Initiative . Peeju took the initiative and quickly reacted to what was to be done, without wasting time. Spiritual Factors Our soul offers the highest inspiration for our extr a ordinary feats. It is the only factor which sustains a man when all hope is lost. The spiritual factor stems fr om group identity, pride in the group, team spirit, history and positive aspects of religion. Religion has played an important role in motivating men. Alexander's men imagined they were playing the role of their many gods during his con quests. Krishna's advice to Arjun on the battlefield of Kurukshetra is a soul-stirring speech. Even today it insp ires and motivates men to war. It is the victory of the spirit which has led many physically and mentally challenged persons to take part and excel in various sports and other physical activities. Conclusion There are three factors namely Material, Intelle ctual and Spiritual factors, which motivate an individual to go beyond his limits and do something wh ich seems impossible otherwise. Motivation is an unseen force from within which makes a person to improve his performance beyond his normal limits. 146 CHAPTER-IV CASE STUDIES ON EFFECTS OF LEADERSHIP IN NCC Introduction NCC has been grooming the youth of the country to be potential leaders and responsible citizens with character qualities. Cadets have risen to the occa sion at many times exhibiti ng the leadership traits thus fulfilling the noble aims of NCC. We will discuss so me of the real life situations that have happened in NCC and how various cadets have reacted to such situations. Case Study-I: Drowning of Cadets at Camp Site An Annual Training Camp (ATC) was being organize d by Directorate at Dehradun. A total of 789 cadets both from SD as well as JD participated in the camp. The advance party was sent well in advance. It sited the camp at a scenic place which had all the facilities required for the camp as well as for the training. The cadets reached the camp location by road/ rail under their respective ANOs. There was general enthusiasm a ll around. Excellent weather furt her increased the eagerness to conduct the training and get benefits of outdoor training. The training started in right earnest. As there was no proper firing range in the vicinity of the camp loca tion, an improvised location in the river bed, which was dry with only a small water channel in the middle, was selected as firing range. The location was approximately 1.5 km from the camp locati on. The firing was conducted in batches. On 6 June 2014, a group of 110 cadets were detai led to carry out firing at the improvised range. Second Officer D P Saini was in charge of firing, an d was assisted by Sub H R Chahar, Sub Premlal, Hav Karam Chand and Hav Kiran Singh. The firing got over by 1100 hrs. By now, the day had warmed up. A canal which originated from the headwork located upstream flowed nearby. The cadets made earnest request to the ANO in charge for permission for bathing in the canal, which he granted and instructed his man of all seasons and able, CUO Alam Baig to take charge of the party. Almost a ll the cadets joined in the swimming and bathing in the canal. At approximately 1120 hrs, there was shrill sound of siren. Soon water level in canal started rising at an alarming speed as well as the current became swi ft. The situation has turned into an emergency in no time. Assessment of Situation If you were CUO Alam Baig, what action would you have taken? CUO Alam Baig who was made in charge of the swimming party by the ANO, at the outset did quick assesment of the tasks at hand and risks involv ed. He organised the cadets properly; first into buddy pairs and then into squads with a squad leader each nom inated. He took the assita nce of PI staff too. A detailed briefing was given to the entir e party which included the following:- (a) Seperation of swimmers and weak swimmers. (b) Dangers involved in going into water and safety precaution to be followed. (c) Earmarking of life guards and tasking them. (d) Earmarking separate areas; shallow banks for weak swimmers and so on.

(ii) Action of weak swimmers. (iii) Duties of life guards. (iv) Agencies to be informed in case of emergency. (v) First aid stores and protocol to be followed. In the meantime, CUO Alam Baig who was awar e about various water body related accidents and safety instructions issued by HQ DG NCC, gathered information about the nearby Headworks, its timings, warning signal etc through liaison with them. As soon as the warning siren was heard, he immediately blew the whistle signal for all cadets to leave canal. He took assistance of PI staff, activated the life guards and cautioned the lookout man. His first action was to get all weak swimmers onto the banks which he successfully achieved. However the wa ter current was so fast that last few of the good swimmers hitting for the banks were swept away. CUO Alam Baig and his team of life guards and others in tow, ran down stream using ropes and floats, started rescuing one by one. In the meantime message was conveyed to ANO, Second Officer D P Saini who rushed to the spot wi th additional staff, after informi ng the Camp Comdt who too sought immediate assistance from the near by army unit and villagers. A massive rescue effort followed in right earnest. CUO Alam Baig then arranged for immediate cl osing of the Head Works which eased the flow of water. The rescue team was finally able to save all fi ve swimmersfrom down stream who got washed away and thus avoided a major catastrophe. What leadership traits were demonstrat ed by CUO Alam Baig in the whole episode? (a) Alertness (b) Courage (c) Decisiveness (d) Dependability (e) Enthusiasm (f) Initiative (g) Self Confidence (h) Judgment (j) Knowledge.

On 26 Jan 2013, the Republic Day celebration of the town was being held in CUO Gurmail Singh's college and a colorful parade was organized by the JD as well as the SD NCC cadets of all the three wings in the town. CUO Gurmail Singh was nominated as a parade commander since he had the most commanding personality and always had the best turn out. He was the best in drill and had a commanding voice. The Education Minister of the State who was on the hit list of the terrorists was to unfurl the national flag and review the parade. Elaborate security arrangem ents were made and extensive rehearsals of the parade had been carried out to ensure success of the parade since the whole town was to witness it. . On the day of the parade all the arrangements h ad been made.

He was a man of great courage, a single minded and dedicated leader who was an icon of patriotism. He wanted to free Indi a from British yoke, not by peaceful agitation or petitioning, but by waging an open war. He did so by escaping from India, organizing an army of Indian nationals and fighting like Mazzini and Garibaldi of Ita ly which is rarely seen in the annals of liberation movement all over the world. Subhash Chandra Bose was one of the most visionary and fierce leaders of the pre independence era, for he followed a path which no one could even have imagined. An unparallel example of the declaration of Independent Indian government with a cabi net and its own army was seen in form of the Indian National Army. Under his char ismatic leadership he organized a m ilitary attack on the British India and had pushed them till Imphal. Early Life Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack as the ninth child among fourteen of Shri Janakinath Bose, an advocate and Smt Prab havati Devi, a pious and God fearing lady. A brilliant student, he topped the matriculation examination of Calc utta province and passed his BA in philosophy from the Presidency College in Calcutta. Remembered fo r his fiery speeches which mobilized masses, this leader was a great orator and had started a debating club in his college saying that India in her forthcoming struggle would need great debaters and parliamentarians. He tried to promote quick thinking and self reliance among his colleagues. He was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekananda' s teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal as a student. His parents' wishes kept him away from the freedom struggle and send him for higher studies for the Indian Civil Services in England. Although he fini shed those examinations on t op of his class (fourth), he could not complete his apprenticeship and returned to India, being deeply disturbed by the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. Bose was outspoken in his anti - British stance and was jailed 11 times between 1920 and 1941 for periods varying between six months to three years. He was the leader of the youth wing of the Congress party, in the forefront of the trade union movement in India and organized 'Service league', another wing of congress. He was admired for his great skills in organization development. Bose advocated complete freedom for India at the earliest, whereas the congress committee wanted it in phases, through a Dominion status. Other younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru supported Bose and finally at the historic Lahore Congress co nvention, the Congress had to adopt 'Poorna Swaraj' (complete freedom)as its motto. Bhagat Singh's martyrdom and the inability of the Congress leaders to save his life infuriated Bose and he started a movement opposing the Irvin-Gandhi peace pact. He was imprisoned and expelled from India. But defying the ban he came back to India and was imprisoned again. He was elected president of the Indian National Congress twice ie 1937 and 1939, the second time defeating the nominee of Gandhiji. He brought a resolution to give the British six months to hand India over to the Indians, failing which there would be a revolt. There was much opposition to his rigid stance and he resigned from the post of the president and formed a progressive group known as the 'Forward Block' in 1939. Subhash Chandra Bose was against the British invo lving India in the Second World War. He started a mass movement against utilizing Indian resources and men for the Great War. To him, it made no sense to further bleed poor Indians for the sake of colonial po wers. There was tremendous response to his call and the British promptly imprisoned him. He took to hunger strike and after 11 days of fasting, his deteriorating health made the British free him. However he was plac ed under house arrest. The British were afraid of violent reactions in India, should anything happen to Subhash Chandra Bose. 156 Netaji and INA Bose suddenly disappeared in the beginning of 1941 and it was not until many days that authorities realized that Bose was not inside the house they were guarding. He traveled by foot, car and train and resurfaced in Kabul (now in Afghanistan), only to di sappear once again. Finally he reached Germany where with the help of the German army, he raised an Indian Legion and started broadcasting anti British speeches. From a secret radio station known as t he 'Azad Hind Radio, he urged the people to rise and revolt against the British. He coined the term 'Jai Hind 'as greeting which is very popular these days. His legion called him 'Netaji' or the revered leader. Bose's sensational escape and his broadcasts from Berlin stirred the people of India into action. In Nov 1941, his broadcast from German radio sent shock waves among the British and electrified the Indian masses w ho realized that their leader was working on a master plan to free their motherland. It also gave fresh conf idence to the revolutionaries in India who were challenging the British in many ways. Netaji met the war leaders Hitler and Mussolini, besides their commanders from whom he sought help for liberating India. The Axis powers assured Bose help to fight the British. Japan by that time had grown into another strong world power occupying key colonies of Dutch, French and British in Asia. Bose had struck alliance with Germany and Japan. He rightly fe lt that his presence in the East would help his countrymen in freedom struggle and hence decided to shift his base to Japan. In the beginning of 1943, a most hazardous jour ney was undertaken by him under water, covering thousands of miles, crossing en territories. He was in the Atlantic, the Middle East, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean. Battles were being fought over land, in the air and there were mines in the sea. At one stage he traveled 400 miles in a rubber dingy to reach a Ja panese submarine, which took him to Tokyo. He was warmly received in Japan and was declared the head of the Indian Army, which consisted of 40,000 soldiers from Singapore and other eastern regions. Bo se called it the Indian National Army (INA) and a government by the name \"AZAD HIND GOVERNMENT\" was declared on 21 Oct 1943. INA freed Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British and was renamed 'Swaraj' and 'Shaheed' islands. Bose wanted to free India from the eastern front. He had taken care that Japanese interference was not present from any angle. Army leadership, admin istration and communication were managed by Indians only. The INA was structured into three Brigades na mely - 'Subhash', 'Azad', and 'Gandhi'. INA marched through Burma and occupied Coxtown on the Indian bor der. They were determined to drive the British out of India. However the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagas aki changed the history of mankind. Japan had to surrender. Bose was in Singapore at that time and decided to go to Tokyo to plan the next move. Unfortunately there has been no trace of him from that point. He was just 48 and his death or disappearance continues to be a mystery. Leadership Qualities The effect of a leader can be measured by the amount of influence he is able to exert on the activities of a group in an effort to move towards a pre-determined goal. The fact that Subhash Chandra Bose could raise a voluntary army in itself without an y material resources speaks volumes of his effective leadership. Certain qualities which made him a leader unique in himself and endearing to the masses are enumerated below:- Alertness . Subhash Chandra Bose was mentally alert and al ways exploited the limited opportunities that came his way. One such event was the formation of the 'A zad Hind Fauj'. Netaji observed that some Indian POW's are being brought to radio department to listen to the BBC and other stations which sent out their programs in Hindustani and were translating the same for Germans. It occurred to him, that these people could be motivated to form a national militia, which he accomplished through persuasion of the German authorities and by motivating the POW's. Courage Netaji had ample physical and moral courage. He displayed physical courage a number of times, but the most significant incident was undertaking th e most perilous journey ever undertaken by man; a submarine voyage through thousands of miles of mine infested waters all the way from Germany to Japan crossing the Atlantic. He was transferred from one submarine to another which in itself was hazardous. Moral courage was displayed time and again when Subha sh Chandra Bose stood by his decision, be it his 157 anti British stance for which he was jailed 11 times between 1920 and 1941 or opposing Congress leaders who advocated a milder approach of revolting against British rule. Initiative Subhash Chandra Bose was a natural leader. He to ok the lead and initiative whether it was college activities or politics. He took initiative and started a debating club in his college with a thought that 'India in her forthcoming struggle would need great debaters and parliamentarians'. Knowledge He was a brilliant student, having topped the matr iculation examination of Calcutta Province. He also cleared the Indian civil services and moved to England for further studies .He also had immense knowledge of freedom struggles in other parts of the worl d from which he drew lessons as far as the Indian struggle was concerned. Esprit-de-Corps Subhash Chandra Bose laid a lot of importance on team spirit and camaraderie. He always made it a point to be with his troops as much time as possible .He made sure he shared their agonies and sorrow and not just happiness. In one instance he ordered his personal physician to go forward to Imphal to treat the INA soldiers even when he was not keeping good health. Humility A simple man with high ideals, he, despite having a huge mass following never behaved or felt as a special person. He could mingle with the common man and a royalty alike. He was accessible to one and all. Conclusion The Indian people were so much enamored of Bose 's oratory skills and leadership qualities, that he became a legend. Many people still do not believe that he died in the plane crash. Bose also raised an army of women called the Rani of Jhansi regiment, a Balak sena. For him there was no difference between a man and a woman, the spirit was what mattered. While Bose's approach to Indian freedom continues to generate heated debate in our society, there is no denying of his burning patriotism, his tireless efforts to free India from inside and outside and his reckless advent ures in trying to reach his goals. His exploits later became a legend due to many stories carried by the disbanded INA soldiers who came from every nook and corner of our great country. 158 CHAPTER-VIII LEADERSHIP CASE STUDIES- II MOHANDAS KARA MCHAND GANDHI Introduction Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Maha tma or \"Great Soul\" was a hero, as well as a political and spiritual leader of India. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, in the present state of Gujarat. Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did most of his studies. In 1888, Gandhi went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law. Later in 1893, he went to South Africa to work and found that there was lot of prejudice towards Indians. That was when he began protesting and eventually became an inspiring hero for millions. Gandhi fought for India's independence by using no n-violent means of resist ance. He thought there was injustice being done to the Indians by the British. The three main qualities that define Gandhi as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery. G andhi first experienced racial discrimination, and prejudice directed at Indians and the injustice imposed on them. This encouraged him to work for the Indian people in South Africa. His idea of non-violence and peaceful agitation came to be known as Satyagraha which forced the British to leave India. Early Life Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was the Diwan (Prime Minister) of Porbander st ate, a small princely state in the Kathiawar Agency of British India. On 4 September 1888, less than a month shy of his 19th birthday, Gandhi traveled to London, England, to study law at University College and to trai n as a barrister. His time in London, the Imperial capital, was influenced by a vow he had made to his mo ther in the presence of the Jain monk, upon leaving India, to observe the Hindu beliefs of ke eping away from meat, alcohol, and immorality. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Mu mbai failed. Later, after failing to secure a part-time job as a high school teacher, he ended up returning to Ra jkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, a business he was forced to close when he fac ed problems of a British officer. In April 1893, he accepted a year-long contract from Dada Abdulla & Co., an Indian firm, to a post in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, then part of the British Empire. In South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination dire cted at Indians. He was thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to mo ve from the first class to a third class coach while holding a valid first class ticket. Traveling farther on by stagecoach he was beaten by a driver for refu sing to travel on the foot board to make room for a European passenger. These events were a turning poi nt in his life, awakening him to social injustice and influencing his subsequent social activism. Gandhi And Freedom Movement In 1915, Gandhi returned from South Africa to liv e in India. He spoke at the conventions of the Indian National Congress, but was primarily introduc ed to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a respected leader of the Congress Party at the time. In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, Gandhi was invited by the Viceroy to a War Conference in Delhi. Perhaps to show his suppor t for the Empire and help his case for India's independence, Gandhi agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In 1918, in Champaran, a district in state of Bi har, tens of thousands of landless and poor farmers were forced to grow indigo and other cash crops inst ead of the food crops neces sary for their survival. Gandhi proposed Satyagraha - non-violence, mass civil disobedien ce. While it was strictly non-violent, Gandhi was proposing real action, a real revolt that the oppressed people of India were dying to undertake. His sathyagraha came to a halt when he was arrested by police on the charge of creating unrest and was ordered to leave the province. 159 Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried fo r sedition and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, havi ng served only 2 years. Without Gandhi's uniting personality, the Indian National Congress began to splinter during his years in prison, splitting into two. Furthermore, cooperati on among Hindus and Muslims, which had been strong at the height of the non-violence ca mpaign, was breaking down. After long deliberations, Gandhi declared that I ndia could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom, while that freedom was d enied to India itself. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, drafting a resolution calling for the British to Quit India . This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revo lt aimed at securing the British exit from India. When the moment of freedom came, on 15 August 1947, Gandhi was nowhere to be seen in the capital, though Nehru and the entire Constituent Assemb ly were to salute him as the architect of Indian independence, and as the 'Father of the Nation' . Gandhi, quite characteristically, refused additional security, and no one could defy his wish to be allowed to move around unhindered. In the early evening hours of 30 January 1948, Gandhi met with India's Deputy Prime Minister and hi s close associate in the freedom struggle, Vallabhai Patel, and then proceeded for his prayers. Gandhi commenced his walk towards the garden where the prayer meeting was held. As he was about to mount the steps of the podi um, Gandhi folded his hands and greeted his audience with a 'namaskar'; at that moment, a young man came up to him; Nathuram Godse bent down in the gesture of an obeisance, took a revolver out of his pocket, and shot Gandhi three times in his chest. Leadership Qualities Faith in Self Mahatma Gandhi wasn't a great orator, didn't ha ve a very attractive physique, lived a life of simplicity and avoided limelight as much as he could, but still he is regarded as one of the greatest persons to have ever walked on earth. The reason is that he always believed in himself. He believed that he has a great responsibility to free his country and he had complete faith in himself. He knew he'd to play a significant role in the freedom of India and so he did. His faith in himself triggered the faith of millions of Indians in him. Resistance and Persistence It was very tough to lead a huge country such as India that too with non-violence mantra and against the violent and cruel British army. Gandhi wa s beaten a lot of times, a lot of times he was left alone, bleeding and lying on the ground and sometimes it seemed that he won't see the sun, next day but each day and each time he faced the opposition, he resisted, he persisted and he got through all the opposition. Forgiveness Mahatma Gandhi was thrown into jail, beaten on the roads; many people conspired about his death and tried to assassinate him. But he forgave them all. He always forgave the people that might have hurt him in any way. Learning from Mistakes Mahatma Gandhi wasn't perfect from the beginning. When he was child, he lied, he stole, and he fought and was too much after material things. But he was honest to admit his mistakes and take recourse correction by elders. He made mistakes throughout his life but he never made the same mistake twice. He learned from his failures and used it as a stepping stone to achieve success. Strength of Character Mahatma Gandhi was a man of great character. He kept himself away from the materialistic desires, always favored the truth and honesty, he condemned violence, he was married but still he was celibate and was himself a pure vegetarian. He was a ce lebrity and was covered on the front-page of all the important newspapers in the world at that time. But still he lived the life of simplicity and discipline. 160 Truthfulness 19. Many may not be aware that before becomi ng a freedom fighter, M.K. Gandhi was actually a lawyer. It is common belief that the profession of law requires much cunni ng and lying but still Gandhi never resorted to lying. He promoted truth throughout his life. He always called truth as his most powerful weapon. Conclusion 20. Gandhi without a doubt could inspire and move the masses in India, he could show the common man that even he can make a difference and bring the Br itish Empire to its knees. It was all possible since his leadership was based on self-reliance and non-co operation, something every commoner could adopt and feel that they were a part of freedom struggl e, synergizing the country men. One of the most outstanding qualities of Gandhi which makes him a great transformational leader of modern history was his long term vision, self confidence an d strong principles of righteousness. 161 CHAPTER-IX LEADERSHIP CASE STUDIES - III P.V SINDHU Introduction P.V.

The word - volcano comes from the Latin word Vulcan, the Roman God of fire. Volcanoes erupt when the lower levels of the earth's crust push up on hot magma causing the volcano to burst through the top layer of the earth. When a volcano erupts, m agma, ashes, and other gases are released and pushed upward from beneath the earth's surface. Landslides . Landslides are mostly caused by mo vement in the ground and the force of gravity pulling down on all earthly objects. Landslides can al so be caused by heavy rain, earthquakes, and even some man-made causes such as road work. Landslides usually consist of falling rocks and sliding earth in addition to failure in the Earth's surface. Earthquakes . Earthquakes are one of the many po werful natural disasters caused when there is a shift, collision, or sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. Sometimes ca lled tremors and temblors, earthquakes usually occur on the boundaries of, or near, the lines where the Earth's tectonic plates collide and slide past each other. Volcano Eruption Landslide Earthquake Tsunami Flood Cyclone Drought Hurricane 170 Tsunamis . Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning harbor wave. Tsunamis usually take place in the ocean, but can also occur in large lakes. Caused by an underwater earthquake, volcano, landslide, or other type of explosion, tsunamis are giant waves that can destroy entire cities. Tsunamis can range anywhere from a few inches to several yards high. Hurricanes . Sometimes called Tropical Cyclones, Typhoo ns, or Willy-Willies. Hurricanes can rip up trees, destroy crops, and flatten buildings. Torrential rain causes flooding and coastal regions may be swamped by huge waves whipped up by winds that blow as fast as 300 km/h (185 mph). Floods . It can arise from abnormally heavy precipitation, dam failures, rapid snow melting, and river blockages or even by cloud burst water. Droughts . If, over about two weeks, there is less than 0.2 mm of precipitation, there is said to be a drought. Without reservoirs, there is not enough water for people and crops. Some places have extreme drought which lasts for many years. Conclusion Natural disasters and the increasing environmen t degradation world-wide are serious threats to development. Natural disasters threaten all three di mensions of development to include economic, social and environmental. Natural calamities have killed millions of people, inflicted injury, disease, homelessness and misery on one billion others. It is therefore important for all of us to be fully aware of the various types of Natural Disasters and take measures to minimize losses of all types. 171 CHAPTER-II ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND THEIR MAINTENANCE Introduction The term 'Essential Services' means any public utilit y service, public safety or the maintenance of infrastructure and services which are necessary for the maintenance of daily life of the people and the non- availability of which would result in the inf liction of grave/extreme hardship to the people.

Due to increase in the standard of living, electrical goods, air conditioners and cooking gas are found in most of the houses. Also, due to the influx of multinational companies, most offices, shopping malls and hospitals have air conditioners. It is therefore essentia l that everyone should be aware of how to prevent fire hazards or to provide assistance in firefighting. Causes and Prevention of Fire Fire is the outcome of either heating or over heating of a combustible substance to the required temperature or igniting an inflammable material. The following three elements are essential for creation of fire and its continuation:- (a) Oxygen. (b) Sufficient heat to raise the temperature of fuel to its burning point or ignition temperature. (c) Combustible or burnable material (Solid, Liquid or Gas). It should, therefore, be remembered that three th ings or conditions that necessary to start a fire, fuel (Combustible Material), oxygen (Air) and sufficient Heat to raise t he temperature of the fuel to its burning point are not present at the same place and ti me to prevent out break of any type of fire. Modes of Spread The fire spreads by the transmission of heat in one or any combination of the following four ways:- 181 (a) Conduction . Transfer of heat by the intermediary material. Many materials which will not burn easily partic ularly metals are good conductors for tr ansmitting heat. These materials when overheated or heated by the fire, may ignite other combustible material with which these may be in contact e.g. short circuiting of electrical wires due to overloading. (b) Convection . Transfer of heat through gases or smoke. Gases tend to rise until ceiling or roof is reached after which they sp read sideways in a mushroom manner and ignite combustible materials located at higher levels than the original fire e.g. fire spreading onto top floor. The best method to check this is to remove or cool the combustible materials. (c) Radiation . Radiation means transfer of heat from the source of fire, without heating the midway media e.g. air. The effect of radi ation can be countered by forming a water curtain 'between the fire and the object to be protect ed or the object may be removed or cooled. (d) Direct Burning . This phenomenon is self-explanatory. Direct burning is often due to a combination of the above two or three fa ctors viz, conduction, convection and radiation. Prevention of Fire The following measures must be taken to prevent occurrence of fire incidents:- (a) Domestic Fires . (i) Kitchen Fires . These fires can be prevented by following measures:- (aa) Don't keep any inflammable material like petrol, kerosene or clothing near the fire or the gas. (ab) Always check the gas cylinder, gas pipe for leakage. Keep the kitchen well ventilated to prevent leaking gas accumula tion. Switch off the regulator when the gas is not in use. (ac) Before lighting the gas, ensure there is no gas leakage. (ad) Keep children away from gas or fire or stoves. (ae) Before leaving the kitchen, ensure that the gas and kerosene stoves are switched off and there are no burning embers in the 'Chula'. (ii) Other Fires . (aa) Ensure that no electrical circuit is overloaded'. (ab) Ensure that good quality electrical items are used. (ac) Ensure that all electrical gadgets ar e switched off when not in use, e.g. TV, AC, room heater or iron. (ad) Ensure that smokers do not leave any burning cigarettes or stubs in ashtrays near inflammable material (ae) Don't ignite any fire cracker inside the house. (b) Fire in Public Places . (i) Ensure that smokers do not leave any burning cigarettes or stubs in public dustbins or near inflammable material in closed AC offices, shopping malls or cinema halls. (ii) Don't ignite any fire cracker near petrol pumps, in crowded markets, near inflammable material or inside malls. 182 Fire Fighting Fire can be extinguished if any one or more of t he three main constituents are removed from the scene of fire. The fire can thus be extinguished by:- (a) Starvation . Starvation means removal of fuel or combustible material and it can be achieved by either segregation of fire and un-burnt fuel by removing either of them e.g. removing un-burnt combustible materials from a room on fire with the help of hook or otherwise or division of a large fire into several smaller ones to prevent the radiated heat from setting alight combustible material at some distance. (b) Cooling . Cooling implies the removal of heat to lower the temperature of burning material to a point below its ignition point. This is usua lly achieved by water. W hen water is poured over a burning material, it absorbs heat, becomes hot and flows away or is converted into steam. The burning substance loses heat to the water and its temperature comes down to below its ignition temperature and so the fire is extinguished. (c) Smothering . Smothering means Choking 'or restricting the supply of Oxygen (Air) to the burning material. This is also called - blanke ting' and is achieved by sealing all the burning material from Oxygen (Air) by covering it with sand/dry earth/ foam or by creating an atmosphere over the fire of heavier than air inert gas. Fire Fighting Parties To carry out the above methods, the fire services and fire parties are organized at the level of every city, town and important establishments. House Fire Parties . It consists of four persons who ca rry stirrup pumps and water buckets. They act as fire watchers and work under the orders of the wardens. They carry one stirrup pump, two buckets, one torch and one hand axe. One steel helmet and one whistle per member are envisaged as personal equipment. Auxiliary Fire Services . This consists of eight persons with Trailer Pump which can throw water at the fire from a distance. The members of this Service are drawn from the Home Guards. Fire Fighting Equipment Fire Fighting Equipment can be divided into the following four categories:- (a) Fire Extinguishers. (b) Stirrup Pumps. (c) Buckets. (d) Fire Beaters and Hooks. Fire Extinguishers . For the convenience of study, these could be grouped as under:- (a) Soda Acid Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers are used for extinguishing fires involving ordinary combustible material, where the c ooling effect is achieved by water or solution containing large percentage of water. Such exti nguishers are conical /c ylindrical in shape. (b) Foam Type or Dry Chemical Powder Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers contain dry chemicals or solution and are exclusively me ant for extinguishing fires involving inflammable liquids such as oils, fats, or grease, where blanke ting the fire to isolate it from Oxygen (Air) is required. (a) CTC Carbon dioxide and Dry Chemical Extinguishers . These fire extinguishers contain chemicals, either liquid, gas or dry, and are mainly used to fight fires involving Live 'electrical equipment' etc. where, the use of an electrically non-conductive extinguishing agent is of most importance. 183 (d) The main advantages of these extinguishers are:- (i) They are easy to operate. (ii) They need only one man to operate and carriage to another place. (iii) They are very useful in the initial stages of fire. (e) The disadvantages of these extinguishers are:- (i) The use is limited as the duration of the working of the extinguishers is approximately one to two minutes. (ii) The cost of thes e extinguishers is high. (iii) These extinguishers requi re constant care and careful maintenance. Stirrup Pumps . The stirrup pump is an excellent piece of first aid firefighting equipment designed for use on small fire. It is very useful in localizing and controlling fires with limited water supplies. Water spray from this equipment may be used on small fires for cooling the combustible material or the surrounding of scene of fire. It is generally operated by a team of four members but in an emergency a team of two members can also operate it effectively. The consumption of water is about 3.8 to 5.7 litres per minute. The spray produced by this pump can reach 15 to 20 feet away from the nozzle with water consumption 2.8 litres per minute. Bucket . Buckets are ideal for storing water and sand for fighting small fires. They could be easily carried by one person, from one place to another. Fire Beaters / Hooks . Beaters made of wire net in a rectangular shape and hooks made of iron fitted on bamboo poles are ideal for separating the burning and unbent combustible material, and extinguishing by beating the small fires. Conclusion It is extremely essential for all to be aware of the causes of fires and how to prevent fires or carryout firefighting in homes and public places. 184 CHAPTER-VI CIVIL DEFENCE ORGANISATION AND THEIR DUTIES Introduction Civil Defence was first established in India on 24th October 1941. Two significant events took place after independence which gave a major fillip to Civil Defence in India. The first was the Chinese aggression in November, 1962 and the other was th e Indo-Pakistan war in September 1965, when, for the first time after Independence, the nation wa s subjected to enemy air attacks. This led to considerable rethinking about the policy and scope of Civil Defence and as a result the Civil Defence policy, as it exists today, was started. Civil Defence Organisations General The Civil Defence Act of India was enacted by Parliament in May 1968. Today, Civil Defence' includes any measures, not amounting to actual combat, for affording protection to any person, property, place or thing in India or any part of the territory thereof, against any enemy attack, whether from air, land, sea or other places, or for depriving any such attack of the whole or part of its effect. Civil Defence is a much misunderstood subject be cause; it is often confused with the air raid precautions taken during the war. There are many ot her measures necessary to deal with effects of direct and indirect raids and such measures cann ot be separated from the Civil Defence measures. Civil Defence measures mainly consist of the following:- (a) Protective and Preventive Measures . Measures which may be taken before an air raid, such as dispersal of population and industries, camouflage, preparation of shelter, warning and training etc. (b) Control Measures . Measures taken immediately after the raid, such as reconnaissance , reporting of damage and unexploded bombs, rescue of casualties, control of services, clearance of debris and extinguishing of fires. (c) Restorative Measures . The measures which become necessary after an air raid include feeding, providing shelter and clothi ng, salvage of property, disposal of dead, disposal of unexploded bombs, control of in fection and contamination, repair of damages caused to utility services etc. 185 Civil Defence Organisation at work Civil Defence is primarily organized on voluntary basis except for a small nucleus of paid staff and establishment which is augmented during emer gencies. The present target of Civil Defence volunteers is 12.49 lakhs, out of which 6.0 la khs have already been raised and 4.8 lakhs have been trained. These volunteers are administered and train ed by 68 Deputy Controllers, 17 Medical Officers and 503 Civil Defence Instructors, which are full time paid posts. National Level . At the national level, the Home Mi nistry is responsible for the Civil Defence. It has under its direct control, the Di rectorate of Civil Defence, headed by a Director General - usually a senior police officer, who is responsible to advise th e Home Ministry on all matters relating to Civil Defence. In addition, The Ministries of Defence and Railways are responsible for civil Defence on properties owned or managed by them. State Level Organization . Each State and Union Territory government has, under the overall control of its Inspector General of Po lice, a Director General of Home Guards and Civil Defence. As in the case of the central government, he is a senior police officer and is responsible for controlling fire departments as well. District Level Organization . In a district, the District Magistrate is the highest authority on Civil Defence. He is designated as the Controll er of Civil Defence. He is responsible for implementation of all Civil Defence measures by the district department al heads such as Civil Surgeon, Superintendent of Police, PWD Engineer, P ublicity Officers etc. They are appointed by him as in-charge of various Civil Defence Services. He also constitutes an Advisory Committee out of the people possessing qualities of leadership and discipline that can arouse and sustain public interest in the Civil Defence Services. Civil Defence Services and their Duties The Civil Defence Corps has the following 12 services in which volunteers are trained:- (a) Headquarters Service .

Constitution stipulates that the Governments preserve publ ic order and ensure welfare of its citizens. 'Administration ' encompasses any activities towards impl ementation and execution of above tasks. Administration is an art of getting things done through and with the people in various organizational departments of the Governments. Administration involves guidance, leadership and control of the efforts of various departments towards common goals. Administrative set up at District Level The government at the centre and the state leve l cannot implement its policies directly from the head quarters. Therefore, the state is divided into territorial di visions and districts. The actual work of the government is carried out at the district level. People tend to judge the performance of the government by the way the programmes are actually administered in the district. The people come into direct contact with the administration at the di strict level more than the state or central level. District administration is one of the most important parts of the Indian administrative system and has been one of the most powerful institutions. During the colonial regime, it was rigorously built up to bring the totality of government closer to the people. It was hierarchical sub-system of the state administration performing the specific tasks assigned to it. District Collector The head of civil administration in a district is a District Collector who is also a district magistrate. She/he is a regional officer but she/he represents the government in the district in practically all spheres of its activities. She/he is as sisted by a number of other bureaucrats in various departments. All the officers assist him/her in di fferent branches of administration such as land records, collection of revenues, policy implementati on etc. Collector is also the ex-officio district election officer. He/she is also responsible fo r planning and development of the district plans and assists district planning committees in the budgetary processes. The office of the collector is called the collectorate. The other major functions of District Collector include:- (a) Maintenance of law and order. (b Inspection of Jails. (c) Supervise cadastral survey and land records. (d) Revenue administration and collection of land revenue. (e) Enforces civil Defence measures, and is responsible for the protection of vital installations. (f) Coordinates work of Different Departments/Offices (g) Acts as returning Officer for elections. (h) Heads the District disa ster management Authority. 188 Other Officials A District is further divided into tahsils for th e purposes of realization and collection of land revenue and administration. Tahsils are the units of Sub divisions, and Sub Divisional Magistrate performs similar functions as that of district collector at the tahsil level. He is assisted by a number of land revenue officials like Tahsildar, Naib-Tahsil dar, Kanoongo and lastly the Lekhpal. Lekhpal is the last in the revenue chain and is a village level functionary. Administration below District Level Sub Divisions For administrative purposes the district is divided into Sub divisions, Tehsils, Parganas or Circles or Ferkas and the Village is at the lowest level. The sub division is headed by SDO - SDM/ Assistant Collector. He performs revenue as well as law and order functions in his sub division. He is a link between the District Collector and the Tehsildar in revenue matters. As future citizens of India, we need to be aware of the system and responsibilities of each official in the administrative set up so that we can contribute in our own way for the development of our soci ety. Station Police Officer is in charge of law and order matters. Tehsil is the basic unit for purposes of general administration, treasury, land revenue, land records, etc. A Tehsil comprises of about 100 villages. Taluka / Tehsils Talukas, blocks or mandals (sub-districts but can also refer to division), headed by a Tehsildar or Talukdar, comprise several villages or village clusters. The governmental bodies at the Tehsil level are called the panchayat samiti. Blocks The block is often the next level of administrative division after the Tehsil. Villages Villages are often the lowest level of subdivi sions in India. The governmental bodies at the village level are called Gram Panchayat, of which there were 2645880 in 2009. Each Gram Panchayat covers a large village or a cluster of smaller villages with a combined population exceeding 1500 (Gram Group). Municipalities Municipalities of India are governed by Munici pal Corporations (Mahanagar Paalika) for large urban areas, Municipal Council (Nagar Paalika) for smaller urban areas, and Town Councils (Nagar Panchayats) for suburban areas. Municipalities can be as large as a district or smaller than a Tehsil. Conclusion It is very important in a large and democratic country like India, all we lfare schemes and other administrative benefits reach every citizen. For this to happen, it is important that an effective administration set up is available at every level from Central Government to Gram Panchayat. Of course, honest and corrupt-free im plementation of projects will decid e the success of the system. As the future citizens of India, we need to be aware of the system and responsibilities of each official in the administrative set up so that we can contribute in our own way for the development of our society. 189 SUMMARY The term disaster is commonly used to denote any odd event natural or manmade which brings about a lot of misery to a region and it beco mes difficult to cope with the situation through local resources. Classification of Disasters :- Natural Disasters . Wind related, water related and earth related. Man-made Disasters . Accidents, industrial mishaps, fires, forest fires, warfare, poisoning, terrorist's activities, ecological destruction etc. The word 'Essential Services' mean s any public utility services, public safety or the maintenance of infrastructure and services which are necessary fo r the maintenance of daily life of the people. Types of Maintenance Required for Essential Services . Medical, communication, transport, infrastructure , miscellaneous etc. NCC cadets can assist in maintaining the essent ial services and other tasks in any part of the country as they are qualified in First Ai d, Basic Home Nursing, Signals and having developed leadership traits and learnt about So cial Services, Civil defence and Disaster Management. NCC can play a significant role in the managem ent of the after effects of natural disasters. With its organizational capability, st rength and quality of its cadre, NC C in disaster relief will be able to provide valuable assistance to the nation as well as an avenue to the youth in showing their commitment to the society. Do's and don'ts during natural disasters are to be known to cadets as if you live in a cyclone or earthquake or floods prone area. Fire is a major cause for destruction of propert y and lives these days. Due to increase in the standard of living, electrical goods, air conditioners and cooking gas are found in most of the houses. Also, due to the influx of multinational companies, most offices, shopping malls and hospitals have air conditioners. With the influx of these electrical ga dgets and cooking gas, occurrences of fire incidents have increased manifold, especially during winters and summers. The fire spreads by the transmission of heat in one or any combination of the following four ways:-Conduction, Convection, Radiation, and Direct burning. Fire fighting equipments are Fire exti nguisher, Stirrup Pumps, Buckets Hooks. Civil Defence Corps has 12 services in whic h volunteers are trained: Headquartes Service, Warden's Service, Fire Fighting Service, Cas ualty Services, Communication Services, Rescue Services, Depot and Transport Services, Salvage Servic e, Corpse Disposal Service, Supply Service, Repair and Demolition Service, Welfare service. District administration is one of the most important parts of the Indian administrative system and has been one of the most powerful institutions. During the colonial regime, it was rigorously built up to bring the totality of government closer to the people. 190 Comprehensions Questions Q1.

The modern institutional service took shape with the impact of the industrial revolution upon family and community life, and creating dependence upon the wage system as a means of livelihood. Social service characterises a formalised way of helping people, to help themselves. It is based on the reorganization of variations in individual capability and variations in the social structure. The objective is to help the individual to utilise his capability for his own welfare and for that community. Basics of Social Service Methods . There are generally three accepted methods identified for conduct of social service which are as under:- (a) Social Case Work. This aims to help the individual make maximum use of the established community, through understanding the individual in his total situation. (b) Social Group Work . It seeks to help the individuals utilize their fullest capacity for their own welfare and for the welfare of the group as a whole, through understanding of the behavior of individuals in a group setting. (c) Community Organization . It attempts to help groups of individuals or groups of agencies to work together so that their combined efforts will be useful for the social welfare of the whole community. Types of Social Service Activities . There can be many social servic e activities. Some of the social service activities which can be undertaken are as under:- (a) Education. (b) Family Welfare, Medical Care, Family Planning and Nutrition. (c) Provision of Water and Cooking Fuel , Roads, Electricity and Sanitation. (d) Old Age Support Systems. (e) Employment. 194 (f) Social Assistance, Social Security and Care & Protection. (g) Housing and Rehabilitation. (h) Recreation, Sports and Social activities. Weaker Sections of Society and their Needs General . India is still divided into many endogamous groups, or castes and sub-castes, as a result of centuries of practicing a form of social hierarchy called the caste system. The traditional caste system, leads to severe oppression and segregation of the lower castes and other weaker sections and limits their access to various freedoms eg:- education and employment. Classes of Society . (a) Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes . Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are communities that are accorded special status by the Constitution of India. They are socially and economically backward and were subjected to extensive social disadvantage and discrimination. The Scheduled Caste people are also known as Dalits and the Scheduled Tribes as Adivasis. (b) Other Backward Classes (OBCs) . These classes are a group of sub castes which are socially and educationally backward while still hav ing a higher status than scheduled castes or scheduled tribes. Needs of the Weaker Sections. (a) Education. Education is the basic need of the weaker sections. The right approach would be to provide all weaker sections, proper pr imary education, to prevent them from dropping out of school and making them 'nat ural competitors' and to give scholarships at higher level. Some measures which can contribute in this are:- (i) At the village level, opening of schools which impart basic education c oupled with the vocational skill that can be taught with the naturally available resources e.g. basket weaving, painting printing, tailoring, embroidery, pottery, music, dance, etc will help in achieving self-sufficiency. (ii) Schools should also educate the villagers on mora l values, hygiene, first aid, family planning, budgeting, savings etc. (b) Villagers must be educated on the n eed for educating the girl child as she is the one responsible in bringing up the future generations. (c) Social evils such as the dowry system, ch ild marriages and superstitions, should be taken up for discussion and their drawbacks be pointed out, so that they become events of history. (d) Provision of land to landless and helping them in working out a life by providing softer loans for cultivations etc can take care of employment probl ems to some extent. Taking up of infrastructure projects will help in creati ng large number of jobs. Contribution of NCC Cadets . NCC Cadets are from every nook and corner of India. We must therefore utilise this huge potential of eager, helpful, energetic, educated and talented cadets, to achieve our aim of imbibing values and skills amongst the weaker sections of our society which will make them self-sufficient and confident. Conclusion There is no doubt that the interests of the weak er sections need to be protected and their legimiate needs fulfilled so that we can have a just fair society where the under privileged are not discriminated against and no section lags behind the other. 195 CHAPTER-II CIVIC RESPONSIBI LITIES: SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAN, SAUCHH ABHIYAN Introduction Sense is that positive sense in an i ndividual which makes him a civilized citizen of a country. It means developing the positive understanding, perception, attitudes towards society or community. Each one of us enjoy many rights as a citi zen of the country, howev er with these rights understanding and performing our responsibilities is extremely important, which includes abiding by the law and maintaining proper behavior in public places. Swachh Bharat and Sauchh Abhiyan are two community cleaning programs launched by Government of India to make India more clean and hygienic. Civic Responsibilities Civic sense means social et hics, the positive perception, and understanding attitude towards society or community. Civic sense is not just keeping t he roads clean and avoiding the violation of basic civil rights, it's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining proper decorum in public places. Nowadays, we are so busy that we do not have time to spare for civic responsibilities. We absolutely lack basic civic sense and some of us are not even bothered. We see people littering, smoking in public places, cutting off plants and many other violations every day. Characteristics of Responsible Citizen Obeying laws and respecting authority is one of t he main responsibilities of a good citizen. Don't break laws and also prevent others from doing so. Be aware about the issues affecting the society and provide solutions to them, vote intelligently, pay taxe s fully and timely. Keep your surroundings and locality clean by use of dustbins, avoid littering and respect public property. It is necessary to be honest to country and fellow citizens. When the civic sense among citizens increase, our surroundings especially public places and environment will be a better liveable place. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Movement) is a campaign launched by the Government of India to clean the streets, roads and other infrastructu re It is India's largest ever cleanliness drive with 3 million government employees, school and college st udents from all parts of India, participating. Aims and Objectives . The Swachh Bharat mission aims to involve each and every Indian from all walks of life in the mission of cleanliness. It is a mass movement that seeks to create a Clean India. Implementation . By inviting common people to participate in the mission, a sense of responsibility has been evoked among the people. With citizens now becoming active participants in 196 cleanliness activities across the nation, the dream of a 'Clean India' by Mahatma Gandhi has started taking shape. Outcome and Benefits Expected . People from all sections of the society have come forward and joined this mass movement of cleanliness. From gove rnment officials to jawans, Bollywood actors to the sportspersons, industrialists to spiritual leaders, all have lined up for the noble cause. Organising frequent cleanliness drives, seminars and campaigns for spreading awareness about hygiene through plays and music are also being widely carried out across the nation. Sauchh Abhiyan . Sauchh mission is aimed to construct individual sanitary latrines for household purpose. Sauchh Abhiyan is a project within Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which deals with only toilets and bathrooms in the country. Benefits of Sauchh Abhiyan . It is beneficial for the people living below poverty line. It assists in converting dry latrines into low-cost sanitary latrines. It also provides facility of hand pumping, safe and secu re bathing facilities, setting up of sanitary stores, construction of drains for disposal of solid and liquid wastes etc. Conclusion Civic Sense is not just about keeping the roads clean and avoiding the violation of basic civ il rights, it's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining discipline in public places. A Clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi. 197 CHAPTER-III CONTRIBUTION OF YOUTH TOWARDS SOCIAL WELFARE Introduction Youth constitute the most creative section of any society.

Necessary steps need to be taken to mobilize the most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our society in the mission of Nation Building and Social Welfare. 198 CHAPTER-IV LITERACY ENHANCEMENT, POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND BETI BACHAO BETI PADHAO PROGRAMS Introduction Literacy is a key factor for development of any nation. Enhancement of literacy is one of the primary duties of the Governments at Centre as well as States. All other issues like economic development, employment availability, industrial development, poverty etc. can be linke d to the basic issue of literacy. In India, another basic problem is poverty. Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao is one important Social Sector Initiative introduced by government to address the problems of gender imbalance and discrimination against girl child in In dian society. Literacy Enhancement in India Definition . Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak, listen, and communicate effectively. As per 2011 census, 26 % of Indian population is illiterate. The Literacy rate in India has improved a lot ov er the last couple of y ears especially after the implementation of mid-day meals. Reasons for Low Literacy Rate in India Some of the reasons for low literacy rates in India have been inadequate and poor infrastructure in education, sector, awareness, caste system, gender bias, poverty and lack of political will etc. The States and the regions which have gone ahead in these fields, t he literacy rate has improved, as high as 100 % in states like Kerala, Mizoram etc. Literacy Enhancement Government of India has taken several measures to improve the literacy rate in India. State Governments are making efforts to improve literacy rate in districts and villages where people are very poor. Some of the steps or programs to im prove the literacy rate include the following:- (a) National Lite racy Mission .

The bulk of Indian illiterates live in the country's rural areas, where social and economic barriers play an important role in keeping the lowest strata of society illiterate. Government programmes alone, however well intentioned, may not be able to dismantle barriers built over centuries Poverty Alleviation Poverty in India is widespread, with the nation estimated to have a third of the world's poor. According to United Nations Development Programme , an estimated 37.2% of Indians live below the country's national poverty line. Causes for Poverty in India Following are some of the causes for poverty in India:- (a) Lack of Market Economy . After independence, India adopted a centrally planned and closed economy. It has started to open its markets since the economic reforms in 1991. (b) High Population Growth Rate . Another cause for poverty in India is the high population growth rate. (c) Neglecting Agricultural Sector . A griculture growth rate has dropped drastically compared to services and industry. Poverty Removal Programmes In order to reduce poverty, the following programmes were launched by the government:- (a) Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojna . It was started on 01 April 1999. The main aim of this programme was development of rural areas. Its secondary objective was to give out sustained wage employment. This was only given to BPL families.

Objectives It is to increase awareness among common people to save the lives of girl child by completely stopping the female foeticide. People are encouraged to celebrate the birth of their girl child and educate them with full responsibility as they do for their boy child. Implementation of the scheme Under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, government has taken various steps towards protecting the girl child and enabling her education.

To reach out the community at a large, awareness programs are being conducted for wider publicity of the Scheme. A number of rallies have been organized with major participation from school s, employees of government departments, etc. Conclusion Literacy enhancement and re moval of poverty are two important aspects to be tackled on an urgent basis in order to ensure that every section of our country progresses evenly and at a faster pace . Evils of illiteracy and poverty can eat away the soul of India unless the entire country along with the governments tackles them on mission mode. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao program has noble in tention which needs to be translated on ground. NCC cadets can play an important role in these aspects, particularly in literacy. 201 CHAPTER-V RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES Introduction Every country has a population which is divided into two sections, the urban and the rural. The rural areas are generally backward and lack development. T he basic needs like health care, education, water, electricity, telecommunication, roads, transports, railways, etc. in rural areas are to be improved. For a country to develop, it is very necessary that the gap between urban and rural areas be reduced.

Conclusion It is very important in a large and democratic c ountry like India, all schemes and other administrative benefits reach every citizen. Fo r this to happen, it is important that an effective administration set up is available at every level from Central Government to Gr am Panchayat. Of course, honest and corruption free implementation of projects will decide the success of the system. As the future citizens of India, we need to be aware of the system and responsibilities of each official in the administrative set up so that we can contribute in our own way for the development of our society. 203 CHAPTER-VI SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES Introduction Social Security refers to all governmental or ot hers programmes aimed at providing basic needs to citizens who are retired, unemployed, or unemploy able due to disability/old age. It is funded through contributions from both the employees and th e employers or by the government itself. The ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's populati on has access to comprehensive social security. What is social security? Social Security Any of the measures established by legislation to ma intain individual or family income or to provide income when some or all sources of income are not ava ilable.In India, the modern social security measures were planned and implemented after independence. They were too meagre and limited to the organized sector workers only, which constitute d about 8 per cent of the total work force, despite a majority of the workforce (about 93%) comes in the unorganiz ed sector (self-employed or casual workers). Importantly, the need to ensure social security for all, especially those in the unorganized sector, is an overarching concern recognized in the Five-Year Pl ans. The Constitution of I ndia provides strength and spirit to the social security for organized and unorgani zed workers through its Directive Principles of the State Policy. Thus, while a large proportion of the organized se ctor workers have been benefiting from legally mandated and budget-provided social security benefits si nce independence, but most of the workers in the unorganized sector have been left out (only less than 10% of the total unorganized were benefited). The below poverty line (BPL) criterion is a minimalist and inappropriate approach to extend social security to the unorganized workers. About 55 per cent of the population though not comes in the category of the poor in India but is vulnerable. Not only this, mo st of the unorganized workers suffer from the lack of awareness about social security and social welfare measures. Narrowly speaking, social welfare refers to a set of institutional or personal services provided either by the state or voluntary organization s to prevent the incidence or to re form or rehabilitate the victims of disabilities, or disorganization or del inquencies or destitution and so on. Types of Social Security . Social security are of three types:- (a) Social Insurance . It is where people receive benefits of services in recognition of contributions to an insurance program. These serv ices typically include provision for retirement pensions, disability insurance, survivor b enefits and unemployment insurance. (b) Services . The ones provided by government or designated agencies responsible for social security provision. In different countries , that may include medical care, financial support during unemployment, sickness, or retirement, health and safety at work, aspects of social work and even industrial relations. (c) Basic Security . I t i s i rrespective of participation in specific insurance program where eligibility may otherwise be an issue. For instance, assist ance given to newly arrived refugees for basic necessities such as food, clothing, housing, education, money, and medical care . 204 national mission for financial inclusion to ensure access to financial services, namely Banking/Saving & Deposit Accounts, Remittance, Credit, Insurance and Pension with direct benefit schemes. Purpose of Jan Dhan Yojana . Under the scheme:- (a) Account holders will be provided bank accounts with no minimum balance. (b) Debit cards will be issued. (c) Coverage of Accidental insurance for Rs1 lakh. (d) After six months of openi ng of the bank account, holders will be eligible for Rs 5,000 overdraft from the bank. (e) A person can transfer funds, check balance through a normal phone which was earlier limited only to smart phones. Benefits of Jan Dhan Yojna . (a) Zero Balance Requirements. (b) Mobile Banking. (c) Loan Benefits. (d) Insurance Benefits. New Social Security Schemes of Government On May 9, 2015 Government of India launched th ree new mega social security schemes. These schemes intend to widen the process of financial inclus ion in the country to include pension subscribers will re ceive a fixed minimum monthly pension ranging from Rs.1, 000 to Rs.5, 000 at the age of 60 years. The fixed minimum monthly pension will be depending on the contri butions of subscribers. Union Governm ent will co- contribut es 50 percent of the total contribution of subscriber for a period of 5 years. Subscribers must ha ve bank account and should not be members of any statutory social security scheme or Income Tax payers. The minimum age of joining is 18 years and maximum age is 40 years. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJBY) . The insurance subscriber will get an annual life insurance in case of death. It is available to any person in the age group of 18 to 50 years having a bank account. Risk coverage of this scheme is Rs. 2 lakh in case of death due to any reason. For premium, Rs. 330 per annum will be directly auto-debi ted by the bank from the subscrib er's account. The Scheme will be offered by life Insurance Co rporation (LIC) and all other life insurers who are willing to tie up with banks for the purpose of joining the scheme. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) . The insurance subscriber will get annual life insurance in case of accidental death, partial disability or full disability. It is available to any person in the age group of 18 to 70 years. Any person having Aadhaar number-linked bank account can join the scheme. Conclusion The Government of India has provided several so cial security schemes for the benefits of its citizens. The three new social secu rity schemes along with JanDan Acco unt will help and majority of poor and people in unorganized sector to secure their future considerably. However people will have to make good use of these schemes to reap benefits. 205 CHAPTER-VII SOCIAL EVILS: FEMALE FOET ICIDE, DOWRY, CHILD ABUSE TRAFFICKING AND CORRUPTION Introduction India is a large mixed society with varied castes , culture, religions and economic status.

They act on the brain and can change the way a person thinks, feels or behaves. ' Drug Addiction' is one of the most serious problems facing the world. Drug trafficking and drug abuse are considered as a greater problem than drug consumption. Types of Drugs Types of Drugs . There are three main types of drugs affecting the central ervous system:- (a) Depressants. Depressants are drugs that slow down the function of the central nervous system. Example includes Alcohol, Cannabis, Hashish, etc. (b) Stimulants . Stimulants acts on the central nervo us system to speed up the messages to and from the brain. They make the user feel more awake, alert or confident. Stimulants increase heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Ot her effects include craving, stretched pupils, talkativeness, agitation and sleep disturbance. Mild stimulants include Caffeine in coffee, Nicotine in tobacco, Ephedrine in medicines for cough, asthma etc. (c) Hallucinogens . Hallucinogens affect awareness. People who have taken them may believe they see, hear and notice things that ar e not really there. Example includes Dhatura, Ketamine etc. Legal Drugs . These are those where laws and regu lations control the availability, quality and price. For example tobacco may not be sold to persons below the age of 18 years. Illegal Drugs . The ones that are illegal to produce, possess, buy or sell, consume and store. There are no prices or quality control over such drugs say heroin. This means that a user can never be sure that the drug they are taking is suitable and these kinds of drugs are banned. Drug Abuse and Trafficking What is Drug Abuse . Consuming the substance which is neither approved nor supervised by medical professionals. The use of steroids for performance enhancement in sports is also called drug abuse. Continuous and prolonged abuse of drugs may make a person an addict. It was found that all the addicts either take hashish, cannabis or heroin. 72% percent of addicts are in the age group of 20-24 years. And females comprise only 2% of the addicts.78% of addicts come from the families which are facing problems such as, loss of one or both parents or separation of the parents. Reasons for Drug addiction . Drug addiction does not develop overnight, but have general and genuine reasons. It is most common in peer group then in some due to curiosity. If a person is not strong enough then they may go for pleasure seeking with drugs. Some people have mental tensions and therefore use this to relieve their pressure. If the av ailability of these drugs is easy then that may lead to more cases of addiction. Drug Trafficking in India India, due to its geographical location has become a transi t route base for illicit heroin, hashish and morphine from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Nepal and Burma. To meet the expenses for drug intake, many users involve themselves in crime and thefts. The drug syndicates often use poor people, especially youth to carry their illegal products from one place to another, at a huge price, which makes the youth fall for this easy money. The youth today, do not understand th e dangers of this illegal activity. 209 The Law The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and Rules provide for punishment up to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and fine up to Rs Two Lakhs for indulging in trafficking in drugs.

One of the fastest growing economies in the world, India has become one of the fast growing economies of the world. have Through various new init iatives, Government is bringing in substantial improvement in the social and economic condition of the masses. Few of these initiatives are as under:- (a) Aadhar . For unique identity of citizens and its connectivity digitally. (b) Digital India . For digitalizing / paperless transactions. (c) BHIM App . For fast, safe and trustworthy payments. (c) Part III - BHIM App. Aadhar Aadhar is a Unique Identification Number issu ed by UIDAI to individuals for the purpose of establishing unique identification of every single pers on. Aadhar is actually a 12-digit number and not a card. The Unique Identification Authority of I ndia (UIDAI) is the regulatory body for this. Aadhar is meant for individuals of any age (including children) for the purpose of establishing identities. Since Aadhar is for only individuals, it is di fferent for all the members of a family. For deciding uniqueness of every individual, the demographic details (residence address information) of the person and his/her biometric information (photograph, iris-scan, finger prints) is collected which is stored in a centralized database. As. NCC cadets, one should not only possess AADHAR card not also educate those who do not have to proure it. Application process for Aadhar Card . (a) How to apply for AADHAR card online? (i) Not all AADHAR card centers have onl ine appointment regi stration facility. (ii) To check a center nearby has onlin e appointment facility, click on: Apply for AADHAAR Card Appointment Online . (iii) Once applicant has ta ken the online appointment, co llect the required documents and go to the center with the documents at the assigned date and time. (b) How to apply for AADHAR card at the center? 217 (i) If an AADHAR card center near one's location DOES NOT have online appointment registration facility, one can wa lk into any nearby AADHAR card center, without prior appointment. (ii) To contact nearby AADHAAR card cent er click on: Locate Nearby AADHAAR Card Centers . (c) What documents are required to apply for AADHAR card? (i) Generally 1 identity and 1 address proof document is required to apply for AADHAR card. To know about the documents required to apply for AADHAR card click on: AADHAAR Card Documents Required . (ii) If someone in a family does not have valid documents , he/she can still enroll if his/her name exists in family entitlement docum ent. In that case the Head of the Family in entitlement document needs to be enrolled first with valid Identity and Address proof document. The head of the household can then introduce other members in the family for enrollment. (iii) If there are no documents available at all , resident may take the help of Introducers available at the enrollment cent re. For further details please contact the concerned Registrar office. Features of AADHAR (a) Uniqueness . This is achieved through the pr ocess of demographic and biometric de- duplication. The de-duplication process compares the resident's demographic and biometric information, collected during the process of enrol ment, with the records in the UIDAI database to verify if the resident is already in the database or not. An individual needs to enrol for aadhaar only once and after de-duplication only one aadhaar shall be generated. In case, the resident enrols more than once, the subsequent enrolments will be rejected. (b) Portability . Aadhaar gives nationwide portability as it can be authenticated anywhere on- line. This is critical as millions of Indians mi grate from one state to another or from rural area to urban centres etc. (c) Random Number . Aadhaar number is a random number devoid of any intelligence. Person willing to enrol has to prov ide minimal demographic along with biometric info rmation during the enrolment process. The aadhaar enrolment process does not captur e details like caste, religion, income, health, geography, etc. (d) Scalable Technology Architecture . The UID architecture is open and scalable. Resident's data is stored centrally and authent ication can be done online from anywhere in the country. Aadhaar authentication service is bu ilt to handle 100 million authentications a day. (e) Open Source Technologies . Open source architecture precludes dependence on specific computer hardware, specific storage, specific os , specific database vendor, or any specific vendor technologies to scale. Such applications are built using open source or open technologies and structured to address scalability in a vendor neutral manner and allow co-existence of heterogeneous hardware within same application. Why Aadhar Card is Becoming Important? With the passage of time, importance of Aadhar ca rd has greatly increased. In future, Aadhar card will be mandatory to avail benefits of various governm ent schemes and services. Few important uses of Aadhar card in our basic living are as under:- (a) LPG Subsidy through Aadhar . Government has started the PAHAL Scheme under which the subsidy amount of LPG cylinder is directly transferred into the Aadhar number linked bank 218 account of the consumer. Absence of Aadhar card can deprive the consumer from availing subsidy benefits on LPG cylinders. (b) Aadhar card must for Passport . Government has also ordered that Aadhar card is necessary for issuance of new passpor t. You can be denied of passport if you do not have your Aadhar card with you. (c) Aadhar is Digital ID Proof . Aadhar card will be identity proof of every individual in future. Since the details of Aadhar card holder are ke pt at secure online serv ers, the bio-metrically verified identity of an individual can be us ed to confirm the identity of its holder. (d) Use Aadhar for new SIM Card . Aadhar card is necessary for purchasing new SIM cards. With this you cannot buy a new SI M card without having Aadhar card. (e) Aadhar Vital for Government Employees . There is a proposal to bring Aadhar card into use to connect it with the a ttendance book of government employees. Advantages/Benefits Of Aadhar Card . Indian Government is planning to use Aadhar not only for the identity but also for the various other important purposes. It give an identity is a citizen, facilitate easy transaction as well as makes every citizen re sponsible for his actions and also participate in development of the nation. Some of the benefits are:- (a) In several places and all government departments various documentary proof is required, but, the Aadhar will reduce the burden of many identity proofs. (b) To open a 'bank account' or to operate a current account, now it's mandatory to submit your Aadhar Number, to your bank officials. So, RBI can easily find out all the bank accounts of a person. (c) Aadhar Number linked to a bank account w ill get LPG Subsidy directly to their bank account. (d) Under the Prime Minister's 'Jhan Dhan Yojana,' Aadhar is used as the main document as evidence, to open a 'bank account.' (e) For various monetary transaction providi ng UIN detail, would be necessary, which reduce the 'black money' transfer. (f) Various types of duplication of data and fake identities created by frauds for a long time, in India, for their individual benefits, can be stopped with the help of UIN. Digital India Digital India is a major step by Government towards development. Can you imagine a country where Government procedures are done on a click of a button? Yes, the ultimate aim of digital India is its facilitate all transactions through digital means rather than by manual method. For e.g. the application are sent on email and certified and stored digitally. It saves time and effort of the citizen. Digital India was laun ched by Government of India on 01 July 2015 with the objective of connecting rural areas with high-speed Internet networks and improving digital literacy in the country. The vision of Digital India programme is inclusive growth in areas of electronic services, products, manufacturing and job opportunities etc. and it is centered on three key areas - Digital In frastructure as a Utility to Every Citizen, Governance and Services on Demand and Di gital Empowerment of Citizens. Digital Literacy mission will cover six crore rural households. It is pl anned to connect 550 farmer markets in the country through the use of technology. 219 Out of 10% English speaking Indians, only 2% reside in rural areas. Rest depends on their vernacular language for all their lives. As of now, ema il addresses can only be created in English language. To connect rural India with the Digital India, the Government of India is encouraging email services providers like Gmail, MS Office and Rediff etc to prov ide email address in regional languages. The email provider companies has shown positive signs and an India based company, Data Xgen Technologies Pvt Ltd, has launched world's first free linguistic ema il address under the name 'DATAMAIL' which allows to create email ids in 8 Indian languages, English and 3 foreign languages - Arabic, Russian and Chinese. In due course of time email services in 22 languages will be offered by Data XGen Technologies. The Nine Pillars Government of India hopes to achieve growth on multiple fronts with the Digital India Programme. Specifically, the government aims to target nine 'Pillars of the Digital India' that they have been identified as:- (a) Broadband Highway. (b) Universal access to Internet. (c) Public Internet Access Programme. (d) e-Governance - Reforming Government through Technology. (e) e-Kranti - Electronic delivery of services. (f) Information for All. (g) Electronics Manufacturing. (h) IT for Jobs. (j) Early Harvest Programmes. Through Digital India Programme the Indian Government aims to create jobs for 18 lakh people and bring investment of around Rs. 4.5 lakh crore in the country. The government will look to benefit both the consumers an d the service providers by developing a two-way platform. The programme will be supervised and managed by the Digital India Advisory group which will be lead by India's Ministry of Communications and IT. Bhim App The indigenously developed payment app ' BHIM ' (Bharat Interface for Money ) has been named after the main architect of Indian constitution, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. It was l aunched on 30 December 2016 by National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). This app will create financial equality in the country, as envisaged by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. BHIM is a biometric payment system app using Aadhar platform, and is based on Unified Payment Interface (UPI) to facilitate e-payments directly through bank. It stresses on the importance of echnology and digital transactions. It can be used on all mobile devices, be it a Smartphone or a feature phone with or without internet connection . The payments through the new system ( BHIM App) can be made by just a thumb impression after the bank account is linked with Aadhar gateway. Indeed, the technology through BHIM will empower poorest of the poor, small business and the marginalized sections. The app will minimize the role of plastic cards and point of sa le machines. The app will eliminate fee payments for service providers like MasterCard and Visa, which has b een a stumbling block in people switching to digital payments. Advantages of BHIM app are:- (a) The app can be used to send and receive money through smart phones. (b) Money can also be sent to non UPI supported banks. (c) Bank balance can also be checked through the app. (d) Currently Hindi and English are supported in the app, with more languages coming soon. The e-wallet app will feature fingerprint verification in future. Thereafter only thumb will be needed to make a payment. Thumb will be your bank then. People especially young should utilize the app and support this to curb black money and to create financial equality in the society. Conclusion The new development initiatives undertaken by Governme nt of India will definitely propel India to a higher developmental pedestal if executed properly. T he government, the industries, banks, various other agencies and common man especially youth will have to work in collaboration to make these initiatives a great success which is what the world is expecting from India at present.

Civic Sense is that sense in an individual which makes him/her a civilized citizen of a country. It's about respecting one another, abiding by the law and maintaining discipline in public places. Lack of civic sense retards the progress of the society. At home, in our neighbourhood, in the colony, on the road, in the office, in a theatre, in a restaurant and everywhe re we go, we are duty bound to have civic sense. The Swachh Bharat mission aims to involve ea ch and every Indian from all walks of life in the mission of cleanliness. It is a mass movement that seeks to create a Clean India. Youth is the strength of the family, village, loca lity and the community. They are also the future of our nation. We must take all necessary steps to mobiliz e this most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our society in the mission of nation building and social welfare. Literacy enhancement and removal of poverty are two important aspects to be tackled on an urgent basis in order to ensure that every section of our country progresses evenly and at a faster pace . The objective of Indira Awas Yojana is primarily to help construction of new houses as well as conversion of unserviceable \"kutcha\" hou ses into pucca / semi-pucca houses. We need to develop rural areas in order to bridge the urban - rural divide, to have equitable distribution of resources and development activities, to create more job opportunities and to empower the rural population. The Government of India has provided several social security schemes for the benefits of the citizens namely Jandhan Yojana, At al have to make good use of these schemes to attain the benefits. Social evils are mostly due to poor educati on, misplaced beliefs, unemployment and inequitable distribution of wealth. Social evils are a disease on t he society and have disastrous long term effects. We need to take concerted action to eradicate these ev ils forms society. Although many laws/legislations presently exist to prevent the social evils, but t he wholehearted participation of the people will only force their implementation. Hence we must all educate oursel ves, as also our family and neighbours to take all necessary steps to eradicate all types of society evils form society. Corruption in any form is bad and not acceptable. If we want to eradicate corruption, we must all take a pledge not to form part of the chain of corrupti on either as a 'giver' or as a 'taker'. Also we must ensure that, any person who make a demand for bribes or gratification must be promptly reported to the authorities for remedial action. Drug trafficking and consumption has become a global menace. To eradicate this governments and NGOs should emphasise on education, healthcare, treatment and rehabilitation and combat illicit production, trafficking and consumption of drug s for the effective c ontrol of drug abuse. The role of alcohol in traffic accidents is very hi gh. After drinking, the judg ment power of the driver gets impaired - a threat to road safety. Due to its effect s, a drunken driver tends to take more risks, become more aggressive and take a longer reaction time we must ensure that neither do we drive after drinking alcohol nor do we allow others to do this. The protection of Children from Sexual Offences Ac t, 2012, is an important milestone, and children are to be educated about the provisions available in the act. The responsibility to control all traffic is with t he Traffic Police department. For the safety 'Drunken and driving' should be prohibited. The Government has introduced Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2016 with better provisions for making roads safe and save lakhs of innocent lives. 224 Government of India has launched a number of new developmental Initiatives which can usher transformative changes the society. They are:- Aadhar . For unique identity of citizens and its connectivity digitally. Digital India . For digitalizing / paperless transactions. BHIM App . For fast, safe and trustworthy payments. Make in India . To encourage manufacturing in India. Start up India . For encouraging new businessmen. 225 Comprehension Questions Q1.

Introduction to Yoga &Exercises 252 256 229 CHAPTER-I STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE HUMAN BODY Introduction The human body is the greatest of all complex mach ineries. In order to carryout first aid, a first aider should have basic idea of stru cture and function of every part of the human body. Many lives can be saved if proper and timely first aid can be rendered. Skeletal and Muscular System Skeletal System The human body has 206 bones of various shapes and sizes. The bones give shape and firmness to the body, as also it protects the vital organs like brain, heart, lungs and spinal cord . Bones can either be loosely arranged or densely arranged. The loosely arranged bone is called \"spongy bone\" and densely arranged bone is called \"compact bone\". Some bones are hollow from inside and filled with bone marrow. Classification of Bones. Bones can be classified according to their shape as under:- (a) Long Bones . These bones are long and tubular a nd are confirmed to upper and lower limbs. (b) Short Bones . This bones are short and tubular and are found in the ankle/.wrists (c) Flat Bones . These bones are flat like plates.e.g. Bones of cranium Skull shoulder or hips. (d) Irregular Bones . Irregular or mixed shapeeg.Vertebral column. (e) Sesamoid Bones . They develop in the tendons of the muscles around the joints e.g., Patella Long, Flat, Short And Irregular Bones Long, Flat, Short and Irregular Bones Muscular System . The muscles form about half of the total weight of the body and are responsible for body movement. The musc les form the flesh of the body that is under the control of nervous system. Classification . The muscles of the body are classified into the following types:- 230 (a) Voluntary/Skeletal Muscles . These muscles are attached to the surface of bones. These muscles form about 47% of the body weight. Most of the skeletal muscles pan from one bone to another across a joint and by contracting; they act upon the joints and produce movements. ( b) Involuntary Muscles . These muscles are controlled by the automatic nervous system. (c) Cardiac Muscles . These muscles are striated stru cturally, unstrained functionally. They form the part of heart wall. Organ Systems Circulatory System . The circulatory system consists of the Heart, Blood Vessels and blood. Each time the heart contracts; blood is pumped along the blood vessels. By blood circulation, oxygen, nutrients and other substances are brought to the tissues and the waste products and carbon dioxide formed by the tissues are constantly removed. (a) Heart . The Heart is the four chambered pu mping organ. It is situated in thorax between the lungs and on to the left side of the body. The si ze of heart is to a closed fist and the average weight of heart in a male is about 300 grams, and in a female about 250 grams. (b) Blood. The blood is also known as the transport system of the body. It consists of plasma and formed of cells such as RBC, WBC and platelets. (c) Blood Vessels. Blood vessels are tube like structures which carry blood all over the body for circulation. These are of three types: (i) Arteries . These are the blood vessels which carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body. (ii) Capillaries . These are tiny blood vessels which connect the small arteries & veins. The exchange of oxy gen and nutrition with carbon di oxide by the tissue takes place in the capillaries. (iii) Veins . These blood vessels carry blood to the heart. The main veins are called superior and inferior vena cava. 231 Respiratory System . Respiration is a process by which oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is given out. The main organs of resp iratory system are Nose, Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchi, and the Lungs. Digestive System. Digestion is a mechanical and chemical process by which, complex food substances are converted into simple substances so that they can be easily absorbed by blood and utilized by the various tissues of the body according to their requirements. The main organs of digestive system are mouth, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, stomac h, pancreas, liver, small intestine and the large intestine. Excretory System. Excretion is a process by which wast e products are removed out of the body. Among the organs that contribute towards the e limination of waste products are the skin, lungs, kidneys and the gastro-intestinal tract. 232 Nervous System . Internal balance of the human body is maintained with in normal limits by the nervous system and the endocrine system. The neur ons are the basic units of nervous system. The nervous system may be divided into three main parts:- (a) The Central Nervous System. This consists of brain and spinal cord. (b) The Peripheral Nervous System. This forms the connections between the central nervous system and the various organs and muscles. (c) The Autonomic Nervous System. It is an offshoot of the central nervous system and controls the involuntary functions of the various internal organs. Conclusion Basic knowledge of our body systems allows us to understand the field of health and hygiene with ease. This knowledge provides us the basic framew ork on which subsequent knowledge and skills dealing with medical science can be gained in a progressive manner. 233 CHAPTER-II HYGIENE AND SANITATION (PERSONAL AND FOOD HYGIENE ) Introduction Personal and Food Hygiene are ne cessary to preserve and improve the health of the individual and of the community as a whole. Its study is aimed at ma king the cadets aware of the many preventable health hazards and to enable them to look after them selves and their community most efficiently. Personal Hygiene Maintenance of personal hygiene is very important in preventing disease. It deals with the practices that help in the maintenance and promotion of a pers on's health. Personal hygiene habits such as washing hands and brushing teeth will keep bacteria, viruse s and illness at bay. There are mental and physical benefits. Practicing good body hygiene helps you feel good about yourself. Main components of personal hygiene are:- (a) Sleep is the periodical rest of both body and mind and it is extremely essential for a healthy body. The duration of sleep one requires varies wi th individual age. The average requirement of sleep is about 7 to 8 hours a day. (b) Bathing keeping the skin clean and in healthy condition is essential for good health. Wash your body regularly. Your body is constantly shedding skin. That sk in needs to come off. Otherwise, It will cake up and cause illnesses. (c) Brush your teeth twice a day. Brushing mini mizes the accumulation of bacteria in mouth which can cause tooth decay and gum diseases. Brushing Prevents Tooth Decay (d) Keeping finger and toe nails trimmed and in good shape will prevent problems such as hang nails and infected nail beds. Feet that are cle an and dry are less likely to contract Athlete's foot. Prevent Infection Trimmed Nails 234 Food Hygiene Food hygiene is the condition and measures necessar y to ensure the safety of food from production to consumption. Food can become contaminated at any point during slaughtering or harvesting, processing , storage, distribution, transporta tion and preparation. Lack of adequate food hygiene can lead to food borne diseases and death of consumer. The five keys to safer food are listed below:- (a) Keep clean. (b) Separate raw and cooked items. (c) Cook thoroughly. (d) Keep food at safe temperatures. (e) Use safe water and raw materials. Over the past years, the Five Keys to Safer Food have become an international reference source and are recognized as one of the best WHO global risk communication message. Important Components of Food Hygiene Food is a potential source of infection and is liable to contamination by micro organisms at any point during its journey from the producer to the cons umer. Prevention of contamination of food has to be observed from production to handling, distribution and serving. The following are the important components of food hygiene. (a) Milk Hygiene . Milk is an efficient vehicle for many disease organisms Contamination of milk may be through infected animal, human handler or environmental factors. Following aspects should be ensured to obtain clean and safe milk:- (i) The animal and its surroundings should be healthy and clean. The animal should be properly washed before milking. (ii) Milk handler should be free from any communicable disease. (iii) Milk vessels should be cleaned, sanitized and kept covered. (iv) Water supply must be safe. (v) Pasteurization . It is the heating of milk to such temperature and for such periods of time, as are required to destroy any pathogens wi thout destruction of nutritive value. It does not alter taste. (Temperature 130 C and time 1 to 2 seconds.) (b) Meat Hygiene . The word meat includes various tissues of animal origin. The diseases which may be transmitted through meat are 'Tapeworm Infestation' and 'Bacterial infections' like anthrax, tuberculosis or food poiso ning. The animals intended for slaughter, must be subjected to proper ante mortem and post mo rtem inspection. Good meat should neither be pale pink nor deep purple nor should it be slimy. Good meat should be elastic to touch and should have agreeable colour. (c) Fish Hygiene . Fish for human consumption should be fresh. In fresh fish, the gills are bright red and the eyes are clear and prominent. Consumpt ion of contaminated fish may give rise to fish poisoning. (d) Egg Hygiene . Though the majority of freshly laid eggs are sterile inside, the egg shell may become contaminated by fecal matter from the hen. The egg must be properly washed before cooking. (e) Fruits and Vegetables Hygiene . Fruits and vegetables are an important source for the spread of pathogenic organisms, pr otozoan and helminthes. Fruits and vegetables consumed raw must be washed well before eating. 235 Fruits and Vegetables should be Rinsed before Eating (f) Hygiene of Eating Places. (i) Eating places should not be located near filthy places, open drains, animal, sheds, manure/soakage pits and other such places. (ii) Floors should be easy to clean, and should be preferably tiled. (iii) Room for storage of food should be well v entilated, insect and rat proof and should have adequate lighting. (iv) Perishable and non perishable items should be kept separately. (v) Furniture should be strong and easy to clean. (vi) Refuse should be collected in covered bins and removed regularly. (vii) Water supply should be independent, adequate and safe. (viii) Proper place for cleaning of utensils should be provided. (g) Hygiene of Food Handlers. (i) Complete medical examination of food handlers must be done at the time of employment. (ii) Regular health checkups should be done. (iii) Food handlers should be regularly edu cated on health and hygiene aspects. (iv) They should be constantly reminded about hand washing, trimming of nails, covering of hair, wearing of overalls and covering mouth while coughing and sneezing during cooking. 236 Cleanliness and Hygiene in Restaurants Conclusion Personal and Food hygiene are two sides of a coin, which must be ensured together for best results. These are simple steps which, if taken re gularly and correctly can be beneficial to both individuals and community as investing of time and effo rt in them can lead to saving of lives. 237 CHAPTER-III PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH Introduction Earlier doctors defined health simply as an absence of disease or illness. However the World Health Organization defined the term health as a complete state of physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Physical Health Physical health is the absence of disease and in firmity and it is assessed by taking health state measurements of the body. P oor physical health can lead to an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Similarly, poor mental health can have negative impact on physical health, leading to an increased risk. Elements of Good Health. Good health is an essential condit ion for a purposeful existence. The main elements of good health are:- (a) Absence of disease. (b) Ability to work hard with efficiency and enthusiasm. (c) Ability to endure stress and strain. (d) Cheerfulness. (e) Courage. (f) Freedom from anxiety. (g) Self control and self confidence. (h) Sense of well being. (j) Wholesome mental attitude. Five Components of Health Related Fit by W H O . (a) Cardio-respiratory Endurance. Cardio-respiratory endurance is the ability of the body's circulatory and respiratory systems to suppl y fuel during sustained physical activity. (b) Muscular Strength . Muscular strength is the ability of t he muscle to exert force during an activity. (c) Muscular endurance . Muscular endurance is the abilit y of the muscle to withstand contractibility during an activity.

These diseases are the bacterial or viral origin. Many of the deadly diseases can be prevented from spreading to healthy persons if proper precautions are taken by checking infection and contagion of several diseases and by killing carriers of several other diseases. Classification of Contagious Diseases Contagious diseases (communicable dis eases) can be classified as follows:- (a) Excremental Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated through human excreta (urine and f aeces). The excreta can contami nate food, water or hands of cooks and thus pass on the infection. Typhus fever, dysentery, diarrhea, jaundice and intestinal worms are some of the important diseases belonging to this group. (b) Droplet Infection . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred through germs which are sprayed out from the nose, throat or lungs in the air, in small droplets of saliva during coughing, sneezing or even while talking. Common cold, influenza, diphtheria, meningitis, (inflammation of the brain) and tuberculosis are the common diseases in this group. (c) Contact Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred when the germs pass from a sick person to a healthy person by actual body contact. Venereal diseases i.e. syphilis , gonorrhea and skin infection are some common examples. 240 (d) Insect Borne Diseases . These are those diseases which are communicated or transferred when the germs move from a sick person to a healthy person through blood sucking insects known as 'carriers'. These insects first bite a sick person and then bite a healthy person, transferring the germs of the diseases in the blood of the healthy person. These germs then multiply in the blood of the healthy person during the period of incubation, and at the end of which he starts showing symptoms of the diseas e carried by the insect. Some of the carrier insects and their disease are:- (i) Mosquito - Malaria, Dengue and Filaria. (ii) Sand fly - Sand fly fever, Kala Azar, Oriental Sore. (iii) Lice - Typhus, Relapsing Fever. (iv) Flies - Diaorreah, Dysentery, Cholera, Typhoid. (v) Fleas - Plague, Typhus. (vi) Ticks - Relapsing Fever, Typhus. (e) Water Borne Diseases. Certain diseases spread due to infection carried through water. These are cholera, dy sentery, diaorreah, jaundice etc. These spread as water gets contaminated through vomits or faces passing into it. Epidemics are likely to spread if immediate steps are not taken to disinfect water and to prop erly dispose off the excreta through efficient conservancy arrangements. All sources of the diseases ought to be eliminated. (f) Animal Borne Diseases. The germs are transmitted through the agency of animals by drinking milk or through the agency of inse cts. Rabies, plague, anthrax and tuberculosis are some of the common diseases. Preventive Measures Specific measures to prevent diseases are as under:- (a) Prevention of Excremental & Water Born Disease. (i) Control of water route is easy by disinf ecting water or providing safe water in place. (ii) Control of the milk route is easy by su bjecting the milk to boiling or pasteurization. (iii) Food born infection may be controlled by standards of food hygiene, exclusion of sick persons from food handlings. (iv) Safe disposal of excreta will bl ock the transmission of disease by the faecal matter. 241 (b) Prevention of Droplet Infection. This can be achieved by use of mask, proper spacing of bed, screening, dust control, avoiding of over-crowding, proper ventilation, avoiding of spiting in public places, proper sunlight and proper disinfection of air. (c) Prevention of Contact Disease. This can be achieved by:- (i) Complete segregation of patient. (ii) No direct personal contact between patient and the relatives/staff. (iii) Early diagnosis will help in preventing the spread in the patient. (iv) Proper disposal of all the excreta a nd disinfection of all articles of the patient. (d) Prevention of Insect Born Disease. (i) Filling, leveling and drainage of breeding places and water m anagement will help in eliminating larvae. Adequate collection, re moval and disposal of sewage and waste water are important in preventing culex. (ii) Use kerosene oil, fuel oil, or special oil to prevent larvae. (iii) Use of residual sprays like malathion. (iv) Use of mosquito nets, screening of doors and windows, mosquito repellant and sun down sleeves down. (v) Control the presence of rodents and fleas in and around the home. (vi) Avoid contact with any species of wild rodents, especially sick or dead rodents. (vii) Not to handle sick or dead animals or animal waste. The following preventive measures are ne cessary to ward off these diseases:- (a) Segregation of the Patient. Important points are as under:- (i) Preferably shift patient to an isolated room. (ii) Ensure room confirms to hygiene and sanitation standards i.e, adequate ventilation, sunlight and cleanliness. (iv) Nominate one healthy person to undertake nursing and care of the patient. (iv) Nominated person to take preventive measures like use of mask, gown, and gloves and avoid direct contact and hand washing before and after every visit. (iv) Clothing and utensils used by patient to be cleaned / washed separately. (vi) Safe disposal of patients excreta - Ur ine, Stool, Sputum, Refuse e.g, discarded dressings, garbage etc by burning. (b) Destroy Agents (Germs) Causing Infection in the Surrounding Area or Premises. Immediately on detection of a communicable dis ease, the source of agents /germs causing infection should be destroyed by following actions :- 242 (i) Removal / destruction of garbage. (ii) Cleaning the drains & keeping them covered. (iii) Remove/ dry out waste water. (iv) Spray malathion mixed in water (ratio:malathion - 1 ml, water 1000 ml) in and around the premises. (Caution - malathion is hi ghly poisonous. Direct breathing / touching should be avoided). Wash hands after use. (v) Keep premises free of ro dents (rats), stray dogs. (vi) Use mosquito nets, long sleev es, screening of doors and windows. (c) Disinfection . All articles in contact with the patient should be disinfected by following means:- (i) Natural. Sunlight and air can be used to disinfect articles like blanket, mattresses, pillows and also the rooms. The micro organisms thrive in darkness and need moisture for their survival, on being exposed to sunlight and air they die. (ii) Physical. Physical agents like heat, cold radiation etc. can also be used for disinfection and sterilization. (aa) Heat . Heat can be used in two ways for sterilizing. Moist Heat in the form of 'boiling' kills germs very rapidly. In addition, 'autoclaving or Steam under Pressure' is the most effective method used to disinfect all hospital equipment which can be boiled like linen, bandage, dr essing material, gloves and instruments. Dry heat like flaming or use of hot air oven. Sterilization by steam under pressure (autoclaving) is the commonest method for sterilization which is being used in the Army. (ab) Cold . Freezing or freeze-drying can inac tivate bacteria. Some of them can however survive even at 0\u00b0 C. (ac) Radiation. It includes ionizing radiations like X rays, gamma beta and ultraviolet radiation. These are expens ive methods and are not suitable for small- scale procedures. (ad) Other Methods . Disinfection and sterilization can also be done by using other methods like of infrared rays, filtration etc. (iii) Chemical Agents. Chemical agents like phenol, savlon, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide etc are commonly used for disinfection and sterilization. The strength of agent depends upon used concentration being used. (iv) Control of Food & Drink. Salient points to be observed while feeding the patient:- (aa) Clean water preferably boiled must be served to the patient. Water container must be kept covered. (ab) Balanced diet, well cooked, hygienically prepared food using less oil and condiments, should be served hot. Stale, cold and food exposed to flies & insects should not be served. (ac) Food items sourced from rest aurants /dhabas must not be served. 243 (iv) Inoculation and Vaccinations . Inoculations and vaccinations are provided free of cost under various government programmes. These are administered at Primary Health Centers/Hospitals. If not available the same should be administered/ taken from market. Important inoculations and vaccination are as under:- Name of Vaccine Disease Prevented Injection Rabipur Rabies Injection TAB Typhoid Injection Hepatitis 'B' Hepatitis 'B' Injection T T Tetanus Oral Polio Polio Conclusion Communicable diseases as the name suggests are mo st easy to prevent if timely measures are taken as recommended above. As these diseases are communicated through some carrier or agent, their spread on occurrence is difficult to control. It is adv isable to always follow the prevention measures to save precious human and animal lives, national resources and effort. 244 CHAPTER-V FIRST AID IN COMMON MEDICAL EMERGENCIES Introduction There will be number of occasion s on which we may be faced with a situation where, we may be required to provide First Aid to the injured, because of an accident or due to any calamity. Therefore it is very important for all cadets to have knowledge of providing basic First Aid in common. Injuries to Internal Organs Internal injuries cannot be seen but can only be suspected, where bleeding instead of coming to the surface occurs into the cavity of chest or abdomen whereinimportant organs like heart, lungs, liver or spleen might get ruptured. The following symptoms are observed in case of internal injuries:- (a) Cold clammy skin. (b) Weak or rapid pulse. (c) Shallow sighing and breathing. (d) Face pinched and pale. (d) Eyes deeply sunken with dark rings around them. (f) Patient usually restless and anxious and may lose consciousness. First Aid Treatment. (a) Keep the patient warm and lying down with feet raised up and head kept low. (b) Apply cold application on the suspected injured region. (c) Cheer up the patient. (d) Arrange medical attention as soon as possible. Burns and Scalds Burns may be caused by heat either, dry by contact with fire or flame, or wet, as caused by moist heat such as hot water, hot fluids and steam, which is called scalding. Chemical burns may be caused by strong acids or alkalis. First aid Treatment . (a) If the burn is chemical, let water from a pipe or hose flow freely on the burn so that the chemical flows off. (b) Protect the burnt area by applying bandage or cover exposed part with clean towel or cloth. (c) Give complete rest and plenty of fluids to the patient. (d) Re-assure the patient. (e) Evacuate patient to the neare st hospital or dispensary. Snake, Scorpion and Dog Bite Snake Bite In Snake bite, the poison is injected by the snake through a pair of hollow and deeply grooved biting fangs. The majority of bites occur on parts of limbs which are exposed like hands, feet and lower legs. 245 First Aid Treatment . All cases of snake bite should be treated as being bitten by poisonous snakes. The First Aid treat ment will be as follows:- (a) Make the victim lie down comfortably. (b) Give convincing reassurance against fear of death. (c) Apply a light constricting tourniquet with hand kerchief, bandage or shoe lace above the knee for a bite on the leg and above elbow for a bite on the arm. So that the poison does not flows to all parts of the body. (d) Wash with soap and water. Use water freely. (e) Evacuate the patient quickly to t he nearest dispensary or hospital. (f) If breathing fails, start artificial respiration. Scorpion Bite Bite by scorpions should be treated like snake bite. First Aid Treatment . If blood has been drawn, the wound should be cleaned well with antiseptic lotion. Rabid Dog Bite Rabies is a very dangerous disease transmitted by a rabid dog. The disease is preventable by giving anti-rabies vaccine. First Aid Treatment . (a) Immediately wash the bite area with lots of water and soap. (b) Wound should be cleaned with available antiseptic. (c) Patient should be sent to hospital for an anti-rabies injection course. (d) Dog and the patient should be kept und er observation for at least 10 days. Snake Bites : Do's and Don'ts . (a) Do's . (i) Stay calm, make the victim lie down comfortably. (ii) Give convincing reassurance against fear of death. (iii) Call ambulance. (iv) Take off anything constricting the area, such as a ring or watch. (v) Position the affected area at or above heart level on the basis on the affected site. (vi) If breathing fails, start artificial respiration. (b) Don'ts . (i) Don't apply ice as it can cause local tissue damage. (ii) Don't cut the affected area and don't attempt to suck venom out. (iii) Don't use a commercially available extraction device. (iv) Don't use electrical therapy. (v) Don't apply any type of lotion or ointments. 246 Foreign Bodies in Eye, Ear and Nose Foreign Body in Eye . Particles of coal or dust may lodge on the ey e-ball or inside the eye lid causing discomfort and damage to the tender structure. . First Aid Treatment . (a) Ask the patient not to rub the eyes. (b) Wash the eye with water repeatedly for a minute or two. (c) Search for the foreign body by lifting the up per eyelid and parting the lower eyelid down. The patient should face the light. If the foreign body is seen, it can be wiped off with the moistened corner of hand kerchief, cloth or cotton swab. (c) If foreign body is fixed to the ey e-ball, patient should be sent to the hospital with a light eye bandage. Foreign Body in Ear This is common with children. They often put beads , peas, nuts and other objects into the ear or an insect may get into the ear. First Aid Treatment . Do not try to remove the foreign body with the help of a pin or forceps as this may push the foreign body further in, causing damage to the ear. The patient should be sent to the hospital. Foreign Body in Nose This is a common occurrence among children. They might put peas, beads in the nostril. . First Aid Treatment . (a) Blowing the nose and sneezing may expel the foreign body. (b) Make the casualty breathe through the mouth. (c) Do not try to remove the foreign body. (d) Send the patient to the nearest hospital. Asphyxia The tissue and organs of the body are supplied with oxygen through respiration, essential for the functioning of body. Respiration consists of inspirati on, expiration and a pause. During inspiration air is drawn inside causing the lungs to expand. During expi ration the lungs contract and air is pushed out. The respiratory system consists of the air passage known as respiratory tract and lungs. The actions of muscles concerned with respiration are controlled and regula ted by the respiratory centre of the brain. Asphyxia Causes. Anything which interferes with respiration producing irregularities in breathing, produces a condition known as Asphyxia. The main causes of Asphyxia are:- (a) Drowning - due to water entering the air passage. (b) Hanging and Strangulation - due to obstruction to entry of air. (c) Suffocation. (i) Due to obstruction to entry of air through the air passage. (ii) Foreign body obstruction in air passage. 247 (iii) Inhalation of poisonous gases e.g. carbon monoxide. (d) Over dosage of drugs such as sleeping pills, morphine, pethedine. (e) Electric Shock. (f) Diseases e.g. tetanus, epilepsy, rabies. Signs and Symptoms of Asphyxia . (a) Dizziness and weakness. (b) Shortness of breath rate or breathing increase. (c) Rapid pulse. (d) Partial loss of consciousness. (e) Swelling of the veins of the neck. (f) Face, lips, nails, fingers and toes turn blue. General Rules for Treatment of Asphyxia . (a) Remove the cause if possible or the casualty from the cause. (b) Ensure that there is a free passage for air. (c) Lay the individual on his back. Press the head back-wards supporting the neck on your palm. Lift the tongue clear of the airway. Give mouth to mouth breathing. First Aid for Special Cases - Drowning . (a) Wet clothes should be loosened. (b) Mouth, throat and nostril should be cleaned of mucus and any foreign body.

NCC cadets by virtue of t heir routine are prone to injuries and hence must possess this basic knowledge to help fellow cadets or friends in school or at home. 252 CHAPTER-VII INTRODUCTION TO YOGA AND EXERCISES Introduction Yoga is a commonly known activity for physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines which originated in ancient India. One of the most detailed and thorough expositions on the subject are the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Various traditions of yoga are found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism .(UNO has declared 21 June as the International Day of yoga. NCC is practising, propagating and celebrating this in a big way every year.) Definition and Purpose of Yoga Definition The Sanskrit word yoga which is \"yoke\", yuj, already had a much more figurative sense, where t he yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses takes on broader meanings such as \"employment, use, applicati on, performance\" , \"to put something to some use\". In Hindu philosophy , the word yoga is used to refer to one of the six orthodox (astika) schools of Hindu philosophy. Purpose Yoga is a disciplined method utilized for attaining a goal. In the sense the physical postures of yoga are to alleviate health problems, reduce stress and make the spine supple. Yoga is also used as a complete exercise program and physical therapy routine. . The characteristics of Yoga are given below :- (a) The Yogic system of health involves the ex ercise of skeletal as well as the deep seated smooth muscles of the body. (b) The intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure may be mentioned as special characteristics of the yoga system of health. (c) Little expenditure of energy and money is involved in the Yoga practices. (d) The rich as well as poor, and men and women of all ages can practice Yogic practices. (e) Every school of Yoga emphasized specific practices, but their aim always remained the same; but the highest level of integration through the control of the modification of mind. (f) The nature of Yogic pr actices is psycho-neuro physical. (e) All yogic practices are complementary. Potential Benefits of Yoga for Adults Yoga as Exercise or Alternative Medicine . (a) Many yoga practitioners have reported mu sculoskeletal and mental health improvements, as well as reduced symptoms of asthma in asthmatics. Regular yoga practice increases brain GABA levels and has been shown to improve mood and anxiety more than some other metabolically matched exercises, such as walking. (b) The three main focuses of yoga (exercise, br eathing, and meditation) make it beneficial to those suffering from heart disease. Overall, st udies of the effects of yoga on heart disease suggest that yoga may reduce high blood pressu re, improve symptoms of heart failure, enhance cardiac rehabilitation, and lower cardiovascular risk factors. (c) For chronic low back pain, specialist Yoga for Healthy Lower Backs has been found 30% more beneficial. (d) Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) . This program includes yoga as a mind- body technique to reduce stress. A study found that after seven weeks the group treated with 253 yoga reported significantly less mood disturbance and reduced stress compared to the control group. Another study found that MBSR had showed positive effects on sleep anxiety, quality of life, and spiritual growth. Potential Problems Certain health problems associated with yoga have been brought to the attention of the general public. Yoga has been criticised for being potentially dangerous and being a cause for a range of serious medical conditions including thoracic outlet syndrome, degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, spinal injuries, retinal tears, damage to the common fibular nerve, knee injuries, and headaches are common ailments which may result from yoga practice. Some yoga practitioners do not recommend certain yoga exercises for women during menstruation, for pregnant women, or for nursing mo thers. However, meditation and breathing exercises are encouraged. Children and Yoga . Research in the countries which have advanced medical research and development facilities do not recommend, Yoga ex ercises for children under 16 because their bodies'nervous and glandular systems are still grow ing, and the effect of Yoga exercises on these systems may interfere with natural growth. However, meditation and simple breathing exercises (without breath-holding) are safe and can help children to manage stress, impulsiveness, and emotional situations.

Obey all traffic laws, signs, signals, and street markings . Watch for changes in road conditions. Keep your head and ears open and do not wear headphones while riding. (f) Turns and Intersections . Look left, right, back, an d ahead before turning. Stop and search all directions when entering a street from a driveway, parking area, sidewalk, or alley. Signal all turns using universal hand signals . Walk your bike through or across busy intersections. (g) Equipment . Ride only a bike that fits you. Select a bike that permits youto put both feet on the ground while standing over the top tube. The handgrips should be no higher than your shoulders or lower than your seat. (i) Bicycle Accessories . Every bike needs a horn or bell and reflectors (front, back, landsides). Items should be carrie d only in baskets, in saddlebags, or on a rear carrier rack. If you must ride in traf fic, a helmet-mounted mirror is recommended . For long trips, a bike-mounted container for drinking water is recommended. (ii) Maintenance . Keep your bike clean and well maintained, especially the brakes and drive chain. (h) Racing . Open street racing is dangerous. Race only with supervision on marked courses that have been set up to exclude other vehicle or pedestrian traffic, to eliminate fall hazards and minimize ollision ri sks. Clearly define \"start\" and \"finish\" points . (j) Discipline . All participants should know, understand, and follow the rules and procedures for safe biking, and all participants should conscientiously and carefully follow all directions from the adult supervisor. (Pavement required) . Rock Climbing Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing competitions have objectives of completing the route in the quickest possible time or the farthest along an increasingly difficult route . 267 Safety Tips Use the following 10 tips to keep safe when you're out rock climbing:- (a) Always Check Harnesses . After you've geared up, always check that both the climber's and belayers' harness buckles are doubled back . (b) Always Check Knots . Before you start climbing, always double check that leader's tie-in knot right and finished with a backup knot. Also check that the rope is threaded through both the harness waist loop and the leg loops. (c) Always Wear a Helmet . A climbing helmet is essential if you want to live long and prosper. Always wear one when climbing or belaying. Helmets protect your head from falling rocks and from the impact of falling. (d) Always Check the Rope and Belay Device . Before you lead a route, always double check that the rope is properly thr eaded through the belay device. Also, always make sure the rope and belay device are attached with a locking carabineer to the belayers ' harness . (e) Always Use a Long Rope . Make sure your climbing rope is long enough to reach the anchors and lower back down on a sport route or to reach a belay ledge on multi- pitch routes . (f) Always Bring Enough Gear . Before you climb a route, always eyeball it from the ground and determine what you need to bring . (g) Always Climb With the Rope Over Your Leg . When you're leading, always make sure the rope is over your leg rather than between them or behind one. If you fall with the rope in this position, you will flip upside down and hit your head. Wear a helmet for protection. (h) Always Properly Clip the Rope . Make sure you always clip your rope through carabineers on quick draws correctly . (i) Always Use Safe Anchors . At the top of a pitch or route, always use at least two anchors. Three is better. Redundancy keeps you alive. On a sport route, always use locking carabineers if you're lowering down to top-rope off the anchors. 268 Conclusion Trekking is a very enjoyable and satisf ying adventurous activity in which proper health and fitness is an absolute must for every trekker.

Waste Management 282 284 272 CHAPTER-I NATURAL RESOURCES CONS ERVATION & MANAGEMENT Introduction A natural resource is any us eful product which is produced by nature and is essential for our daily life. Natural resources ca n be classified in different ways as per their nature or availability or type. A few examples of natural resources are air, water, wood , oil, solar energy, windenergy, fossil fuels, minerals and coal. Refined oil is not a natural resource since humans create it. Basic Information of Natural Resources and Types Ofresources Natural resources can be classified by various methods, which includes:- (a) Source of origin. (b) Stage of development and by their renewability. Classification Natural resources are basically classi fied as either renewable or non-renewable:- (a) Renewable Resources. Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human time scale such as solar, hydropower, biomass, geothermal and wind energy. Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity regeneration, air and water heating, motor fuels, and rural energy services. Thus renewable resources are resources which can be used repeatedly because it is refilled naturally. (b) Non-Renewable Resources. These are re-sources which are formed extremely slowly and those which do not naturally form in the environment. Most common non-renewable resources are Minera ls and Fossil Fuels. Thus non-renewable resources are the resources that cannot be re-made, re-grown or re-generated. 273 Classification of Natural Resources on the Basis of Origin Resources can be further classified on the basis of origin as under: (a) Biotic . Biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere (living and organic material), such as forests & animals and the materials that can be obtained from them. Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter. (b) Abiotic . Abiotic resources are those that come from non-living, non-organic material. Examples of abiotic resources include land, fr esh water, air and heavy metals including ores such as gold, iron, copper, silver, etc. Classification of Natural Resources on th e Basis of Their Stage of Development On the basis of their stage of developm ent, natural resources can be divided in the following types: Potential Resources . Potential resources are those t hat exist in a region and maybe used in the future. For example, petroleum may ex ist in many parts of India, having sedimentary rocks but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use, it remains a potential resource. (a) Actual Resources . Actual resources are those that have been surveyed, theirquantity and quality determined and are being used in present times. The development of an actual resource, such as wood processing depends upon the technology available and the cost involved. (b) Reserve Resources . The part of an actual resource which can be developedprofitably in the future is called a reserve resource. (d) Stock Resources . Stock resources are those that have been surveyed butcannot be used by organisms due to lack of technology. For example, hydrogen. 274 Conservation And Management Of Natural Resources Need for Management and Conservation of Natural Resources Most of natural resources on earth, especia lly the non renewable resources, have a finite limit. Extreme use of these may deprive the futu re generations for their use. It is therefore extremely essential that we not only conserve natural resources but also plan their proper management so that the longevity of these resour ces increases. Some of the major effects of unrestricted use of natural resources are as under: (a) Ozone Depletion . This is a process by which the total volume of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere decreases. Gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and many aerosol sprays, are rapidly destroying the ozone layer. Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful ultraviolet radiation, ultraviolet B (UVB) with wavelengths between 290 and 320nm, passing through the Earth's atmosphere, depletion of the ozone layer has serious damaging effects. (b) Effect of Ozone Depletion . Due to ozone depletion harmful UV rays such as UVB radiation reaches to earth which leads to harmful effects on animals, plants, aquatic life as well as on human also. (i) Effect on Aquatic System . Affects phytoplankton, fish, larval carbs. Decrease in amount of phytoplankton increase the CO 2 in atmosphere which contribute the global warming. (ii) Effect on Materials. Degradation of paints and plastics . (iii) Effects on Climate . Global warming (Increasing the average temperature of the Earth's surface). (iv) Effects on Human Health . Damage genetic materials in the cells. Leads to more people suffering from Cataracts. Ca uses cancer, allergies and some other infectious diseases.10% depletion in ozone laye r results in 30% increase in skin cancer infection. (c) Soil Erosion. Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's surface by natural processes such as, wind or water flow and then transported and deposited at other locations. While erosion is a natural process, human activities such as deforestation and expansion of built up areas have dramatically increased the rate of soil erosion. Excessive soil erosion causes problems such as desertification (the gradual transformation of habitable land into desert), decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation, sedimentation of waterways and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers.

Wastage canbe prevented by proper education, monitoring and controlled usage. (f) Increasing Energy Efficiency . Use of energy efficient vehicles or equipment (for example: use of CFLs, LEDs etc.) w ill reduce consumption of energy in our daily life. Us e of alternate sources of energy like solar or wind ener gy will leadto reduce consumption of electricity. (g) Monitoring and Control . There is a need to put into place strong andstrict control and monitoring organizations so that wastage can be prevented. Role of NCC in Conservation of Natural Resources Every cadet can fulfill his duty towards environm ent individually or collectively by following means:- (a) By planting more trees and avoid cutting of trees. (b) Not polluting water sources like rivers, ponds, sea etc. (c) Avoiding use of plastic. (d) Avoiding noise pollution. (e) Recycling natural resources to ens ure their efficient sustainable use. (f) Using renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power. (g) Saving energy by taking small but important measures like switching off fans, lights and other electric gadgets when they are not in use. (h) Preventing of wastage and ov eruse of all natural resources. (j) Conservation of nature in all forms. (k) Ensuring environmentally rational behavior in oneself and others. (g) Developing environmental consciousnes s amongst common people through posters, hoardings and environmental awareness campaigns. Conclusion Natural resources are Mother Nature's gift to mankind. These need to be used with attention. Large scale industrializ ation, urbanization and massive increase in population are leading to depletion of these meager resources. Natu ral resources are to be conserved and managed judiciously. 278 CHAPTER-II WATER CONSERVATION AND RAIN WATER HARVESTING Introduction Water is a very important and precious re source for life. Water Conservation covers policies, strategies and activities to manage fresh water as a sustainable resource, to protect the water environment and to meet current and futu re human demands. Population growth, household size and effect the quantity of water that is consumed Water Conservation Need for Water Conservation No other natural resource has had such an overwhelming response on the history of mankind as much as Water. As human population increases, the desire for a better standard of living will increase the demands of fresh water resources. Much of the world's fresh water is consumed by the agricultural, industrial and domes tic sectors. The failure in useful managing this resource to meet the increasing water demands of these sectors has resu lted in a situation of crisis in many parts of the world. In many parts of India, freshwater crisis already exists. With only 1% of water available for human consumption, we must treat our water supply with more respect. Water conservation should not be considered an option any longer but is an inescapable necessity. Current circum stances require our full attention, if we hope to thrive as a civilization. Much of the world is currently sufferi ng due to a lack of clean water. Therefore, it is extremely important to seek out, find and start us ing all the innovative water conservation solutions and methods that are available today. Ways to Conserve Water Indoors. The best place to start Water Conservation is one's own house. Certain measures wh ich can be adopted at home are:- (a) Ensure that there are no leaks in your house, in the pipelines, taps and toilets. (b) Use water efficient flushes and if possi ble, toilets with dual flushing systems. (c) Close taps while brushing your t eeth, shaving or soaping your face. (d) Use water from washing of clothes for cleaning floors. (e) Use appropriate amount of detergent for washing clothes. (f) Close the shower tap while soaping your body. (g) While washing the dishes by hand, don't let the water run while rinsing. Fill one sink with wash water and the other with rinse water. (h) Monitor your water bill for unusually high use. Your bill and water meter are tools that can help you discover leaks. 279 (i) Water your lawn and garden in the morning or evening when temperature is cooler to minimize evaporation Other Practices for Water Conservations Water Conservation Practi ces for Water Utilities . Common practices used by water supply utilities include metering, leak detection, repairing water lines, well capping, retrofitting programs, pricing, waste-water reuse and developing public education programs and drought management plans. Agricultural Water Conservation Practices . Practices such as drip irrigation can save large quantities of water. Careful and judicious use of water for irrigation can lead to irrigating much more land. Industrial and Commercial Water Conservation Practices. Industries could save copious amounts of water by installing water recycling systems. Cooling Water Recirculation and Wash Water Recycling are the most widely used water recycling practices. Other Methods to initiate Water Conservation would include, public awareness programmes, nukkad natak and community dramas and water audits. Rainwater harvesting is one of the most successful techniques being used in India. Rain Water Harvesting Rainwater harvesting means capturing the runoff of the rainwater in our own house, village, town or city. It basically means accumulation and st orage of rainwater for reuse, before it reaches the aquifer. Utilization includes water for garden, lives tock, irrigation, etc. In many places, the water collected is just redirected to a deep pit with percolation. The harvested water can be used for drinking water also, if the storage is a tank that can be accessed and cleaned when needed. Need for Rainwater Harvesting India is in a state of water crisis, both in rural and urban areas. Floods and droughts go hand in hand in our country, which causes water shortage. Rainwater is a pure form of water if stored properly and can greatly reduce the pressures on treated water supply. Rainwater harvesting is therefore extremely es sential for the following reasons:- (a) It helps to recharge sub soil and groundwater thus increasing the level of the water. (b) It helps to create large quantity of pollution free clean water that can be stored in huge tanks or ponds for use later on. In cities, it reduces the dependency on treated water supply to a great extant.

Rainwater may also be used to recharge groundwater where the runoff on the ground is collected and allowed to be absor bed, adding to the groundwater. In India this includes Bawdis and Johads, or Ponds which collect the run-off from small streams in a wide area. In India, reservoirs called tankas were used to store water; typically they were shallow with mud walls. Ancient tankas still exist in some places. Advantages In Urban Areas . Rainwater harvesting in urban areas can have manifold advantages. Some of the reasons why rainwater harvesting can be adopted in cities are to provide supplemental water for the city's requirements, to increase soil moisture le vels for urban greenery to increase the ground water table through artificial recharge, to mitigate urban flooding and to improve the quality of groundwater. In urban areas of the developed world, at a household level, harvested rainwater can be used for flushing toilets, washing laundry, showering or bathing. It may however re quire some treatment before it can be used for drinking. Conclusion Water is the only resource for which there is no alternative. Earth sustains life primarily because there is water available on th e earth. Inefficient management of this important natural resource has caused a situation of crisis in many parts of the world including India, therefore it is very important that we co nserve this unique natural gift to mankind. 282 CHAPTER-III WASTE MANAGEMENT Introduction Waste Management refers to the collection, transport, processing or disposal, managing and monitoring of waste materials. Waste materials usually relate to materials produced by human activity and the process is generally undertaken to reduce their bad effect on health, environment or natural beauty. All wastes material s, whether they are solid, liquid, gaseous or radioactive, fall within the scope of waste management. Type Of Waste Waste material can be of following types:- (a) Solid Waste . This can be further classified into different types depending on theirsource as under: :- (i) Household waste is generally classified as municipal. (ii) Industrial waste as hazardous waste. (iii) Biomedical waste or hospital waste as disease causing waste. (iv) Electronic wastes such as TV's, refrigerators and computers. (b) Liquid Waste. This can be classified into following types:- (i) Chemicals released by industries. (ii) Waste water released by households through the sewer lines. (c) Radioactive Waste . These arethose wastes that containradioactive ma terial.Radioactive wastes are usually by-products of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment. (d) Municipal Solid Waste. Municipal solid wastes consist of household waste,and waste from the streets. This garbage is generated mainly from the residential and commercial complexes. This waste comprises of:- (i) Organic waste such as vegetable and fruit peels, leftover foodstuff, etc. (ii) Paper. (iii) Cotton and Woolen clothes. (iv) Wood. (v) Plastic Bags. 283 (vi) Tin, aluminum and other metal items such as cans. (vii) Glass Bottles. (e) Hospital or Bio-Medical Waste . Hospital waste is generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities in these fields or in the production orbiological testing. It may include Soiled Waste, Disposables, Anatomical Waste, Discarded Medicines and Chemical Wastes. (f) E-Waste . Electronic waste or E-waste as it is popularly called is a collectiveterminology for the entire stream of electronic wastes such as Used TV's, Refrigerators, Telephones, Air Conditioners, Computers, Mobile Phones etc. (g) Hazardous Waste . Sources of hazardous waste mainly include industries liketextile, tannery, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, paint and dye, petroleum, fertilizers, asbestos, caustic soda, inorganic chemicals and general engineering industries. Hazardou s wastes contain heavy metals, cyanides, pesticides, complex aromatic compounds (suc h as PCBs), and other chemicals which are toxic, reactive, corrosive or have a se rious damaging effect on the environment. Disposal and Management of Waste Actions by Individuals Some steps which all individuals can take while contributing to the waste management may include:- (a) Separation of household waste into bio-degradable and non- bio-degradable. (b) Reduce use of plastic bags and replace with paper or jute/cloth bags. (c) Recyclable waste such as paper, glass, cloth etc could be segregated and disposed off accordingly. (d) Keep the surroundings of your house and around the house clean. Do not dump waste just outside the house on the road. (e) Colonies could start vermin-composting and natural composting. (f) What is waste for you is wealth for som ebody else. There has been a tradition in India of finding an innovative use for ev erything -tyres, battery cases, plastic bins and what not. Think of reuse of the thing you would like to discard. Actions by Civic Bodies The major functions of civic body may include the following:- (a) Prohibiting littering of street. (b) Organizing house to house waste collection. (c) Conducting awareness programs to spread information to public. (d) Providing sufficient community storage facilities. 284 (e) Use of colour code bins and promotion of waste separation. (f) Transportation of wastes in covered vehicles. (g) Processing of wastes by adopting suitable combination of composting, an aerobic digestion, pelletization etc. (h) Upgradation of the existing dum p sites and disposal of inert wastes sanitary landfills. Conclusion Water is the only resource for which there is no alternative. Earth sustains life primarily because there is water available on the earth. Inefficient management of this important natural resource has caused a situation of crisis in many pa rts of the world including India; therefore it is very important that we conserve this unique natural gift to mankind. 285 SUMMARY A natural resource is any useful product wh ich is produced by nature and is essential for our daily life.
