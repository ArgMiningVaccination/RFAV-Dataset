If you've been religiously using retinoids, moisturizers, sunscreen and eye creams, you might want to also optimize your skin care routine with growth factors for the ultimate glow. While growth factors don't receive as much buzz as other trendy [active ingredients](https://www.today.com/shop/what-are-active-ingredients-t241864), there has been a lot of discussion around them in the science community over the years. Growth factors were first discovered during the 1950s by two scientists, which ultimately earned them a [Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1986/press-release/). Since then, epidermal growth factors (EGF) have become a matter of interest in many clinical studies to regenerate or grow new cells. Shop TODAY talked to two dermatologists on the natural substance, along with their recommendations on how to implement this ingredient into your beauty regimen. What are growth factors? Growth factors are proteins that are naturally produced by skin cells and responsible for maintaining homeostasis, which helps you keep your skin alive and healthy. \"When it comes to growth factors in cosmeceuticals, the idea behind that is that you take these growth factors that are naturally produced by the body and [promote] wound regeneration, growth of collagen, growth of blood vessels [and] wound healing; that if you can apply those to your skin, you can trick your skin into thinking [it's] young and healthy and [give it] time to regenerate,\" said New Orleans-based dermatologist Dr. Deirdre Hooper. In simpler terms, the purpose of growth factors is to act as a healing agent. The substance can help to \"boost collagen synthesis, prompt cells to produce components that improve skin firmness and elasticity, [strengthen the skin barrier](https://www.today.com/shop/skin-barrier-damage-repair-t234313) and repair and rejuvenate skin,\" added board-certified dermatologist Dr. Sejal Shah. How are growth factors sourced? While growth factors' main role is to repair tissues, sourcing these molecules for skin care products is quite different. Most growth factors are genetically engineered in a laboratory or obtained from human stem cells such as bone marrow stem cells, skin cells and fat stem cells. Growth factors can also be extracted from platelet-rich plasma, along with other natural sources such as snails and some plants. These molecules have been proven to [promote collagen](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909351/), elastin and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production to reconstruct and reinforce skin's extracellular matrix. Growth factors are also referred as [cytokines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785020/), which are cells secreted by the immune system that act and communicate between other cells. Are growth factors in skin care safe? Growth factors in skin care has been a subject of some debate among some dermatologists. \"We don't have robust or long-term studies to say what happens if you keep applying something that causes you to grow, because it can cause a growth that you [may not want]. For example, you can grow [additional] blood vessels, which [can] result in more redness,\" mentioned Hooper. However, research revolving around short-term usage of growth factors have shown promising results. According to a [2020 study in The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7442306/), subjects saw improvements in areas like skin hydration, firmness and elasticity over a 12-week span of time. Since growth factors occur naturally in your body, those with sensitive skin or conditions like [eczema](https://www.today.com/health/eczema-skin-disorder-information-t185611) are also free to use them. That said, \"the vehicle in which the growth factor is delivered, whether it is through a serum, cream or lotion might contain fragrances and preservatives that are irritative to your skin,\" added Hooper. Before committing to a purchase, she recommends testing out the product beforehand and confirming that it doesn't contain added fragrances or preservatives that can produce an allergic reaction upon application. As a general rule, always consult your dermatologist if you have a skin condition that requires extra guidance. How to use growth factors in your skin care routine Most formulas with growth factors are gentle to the skin and most [women with mature skin](https://www.today.com/shop/anti-aging-products-dermatologists-actually-use-themselves-t110345) tolerate it, though Hooper has some reservations on basing your whole skin care routine around them. \"The caveat here is the data behind efficacy or actual effectiveness of growth factors is far less than the data behind the effectiveness of sunscreen, retinoid and other cosmeceuticals,\" she said. \"It's not my first choice of an anti-aging regimen, rather is an add-on for...someone already using sunscreen and retinoid.\" If you do want to add some products to your regimen, growth factors have better results when used at night since \"that is when your skin is in repair and regenerate mode,\" according to Shah. The best way to apply a product with growth factors, she said, is to lather it over damp skin right after cleansing. Shah also recommended allowing 5 to 10 minutes before layering with a retinoid or moisturizer if you are using one. Skin care products that utilize growth factors [Factorfive Soothing Facial Mask](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=96128X1550925&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactorfiveskin.com%2Fproducts%2Fsoothing-facial-mask.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fshop%2F242563skingrowthfactor) If you're hesitant to try this ingredient for the first time, try this soothing mask that contains ethically sourced stem cell factors and other nourishing natural elements like aloe, hemp seed oil and green tree extract.
