You can't walk into a store or scroll on social media without hearing what you can do to protect your skin these days. We have been advised by the media to apply sunscreen and serums, and even take oral supplements in order to maintain a youthful appearance. While both oral and topical skin care products have their respective benefits. Studies have shown that oral supplements are one of the effective ways for your body to obtain the vitamins and nutrients it needs against extrinsic skin aging. Currently, there are a number of beauty supplements on the market right now so it can feel a bit overwhelming to choose from. Popular brands like Kinohimitsu and Crystal Tomato are some of the beauty supplements designed to help improve the overall skin health as well as lightening melasma and other pigmentation problems. Recently, a new beauty supplement has entered the market known as Diamond Cherry. Between [Diamond Cherry and Crystal Tomato](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21732161/ ), what is the difference between these two beauty supplements, and which is better? What is Crystal Tomato? [Crystal Tomato ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5868779/ )is a popular whitening skin care supplement that offers skin protection against daily sun damage while also repairing the skin, maintaining overall skin health. A study conducted by [Singapore National Skin Centre](https://www.nsc.com.sg/Pages/home.aspx) has shown that almost 80% of patients suffering from melasma have seen an improvement in their skin. Apart from skin lightening benefits, Crystal Tomato helps to improve overall skin tone, texture and also promote an even skin tone for a smoother complexion. One of the active ingredients in Crystal Tomato contains colourless carotenoids, which are extracted from non-genetically modified white tomatoes. Carotenoids are a class of phytonutrients (plant chemicals) that are found in the cells of a wide variety of plants, algae and bacteria. Known for its natural antioxidants, it not only protects the skin from free radicals that degrade collagen and elastin but also helps to stimulate fibroblasts to synthesize collagen and elastin; thus, smoothing wrinkles and preventing further loss of firmness and premature ageing. In addition, Crystal Tomato also contains L-Cysteine, an important amino acid which assists in the body's production of [Glutathione](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4684116/). Glutathione is a strong antioxidant which converts dark brown pigments into pink pigments which give the skin whitening effect. Since we are unable to digest Glutathione directly, consuming L- Cysteine is one of the ways to do so in order to receive the necessary nutrients. It also helps skin cells to rejuvenate faster for anti-aging benefits. The purpose of this supplement is to protect the skin from free radical damage by environmental aggressors, prolonging cell DNA longevity. A good complementary treatment in conjunction with your other skin care treatments such as medical lasers and other energy devices. Before heading down to your clinic to purchase a box of Crystal Tomato, make sure you speak to a medical aesthetic practitioner so they can advise a suitable supplement plan tailored to your lifestyle and medical history. What is Diamond Cherry? Designed in Switzerland, Diamond Cherry Shield is a natural food supplement with three proprietary patented blends containing three active antioxidants. Among the benefits of these ingredients are: - Skin rejuvenation - Skin brightening - Sun protection - Reduction of [melasma](https://ensoulclinic.com/what-is-the-approach-to-melasma-treatment/)and stubborn [pigmentation](https://ensoulclinic.com/condition/pigmentation-removal-treatment-singapore/) - Anti-ageing. Let's deep dive into the difference between each of these ingredients; Cherry Blossoms The consumption of too much sugar accelerates the ageing process resulting in dark eye circles, wrinkles, and dull skin. As a result of this process called, glycation, collagen and elastin are destroyed in the skin. Accumulation of advanced glycation end product (AGEs), may also induce apoptosis (death) in fibroblasts creating a greater loss of on [hyaluronic acid](http://4) http://www.oryza.co.jp/html/english/pdf/SAKURA_EXTRACT_ver4.0HS.pdf ), collagen and elastin. Anti-glycation is one of the approaches to counter these effects and these agents are found in cherry blossoms to help generate collagen and elastin for plump and youthful skin. Bioactive ingredients are also found in the cherry flower extract. These bioactive ingredients inhibit the production of melanin in B16 melanoma cells, which are skin cancer-causing cells. It also helps to brighten the skin and reduce uneven skin tone. These ingredients also promote collagen production which keeps your skin looking young and stops the production of AGEs for an anti-aging effect. Cherry Fruit Cherry Fruit is a rich source of naturally occurring polyphenols and [Vitamin C](http://5) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/ ), which have antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. (5) It helps to support fullness of the skin as well as provide skin lightening properties to give a whitening effect. Cherry fruit also contains Trihydroxybenzoic acid, which is a strong antioxidant and assist with moderating the production of melanin. Another phenol found in the chemical make up on cherry fruit is Chlorogenic acid which naturally inhibits tyrosinase and monoamine oxidase A. This reduces the overproduction of melanin in the body. Cherry Leaves and Stems Cherry Leaves and Stems contain antioxidants. These give photoprotection against UVB, sun protection and have strong anti-aging properties. Skin aging results in defects in the structural integrity of the skin and a loss of its physiological functions. UV irradiation is the primary extrinsic factor responsible for skin aging, by overwhelming cellular [antioxidant](http://5) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/) defense systems, leading to oxidative stress in the skin. Studies have shown that these active ingredients help to protect against UV-induced oxidation which helps to prevent [skin aging](http://5) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/). It also contains antibacterial properties which help keep the skin's microbiome in check by destroying bad bacteria and maintaining good bacteria. Diamond Cherry Additional Benefits Diamond Cherry Shield also has 9 other beneficial suncare ingredients, to greater protect the skin from the inside out. It contains Broccoli Extract for UV protection, Brussels Sprouts Powder for skin healing and keeping it hydrated, and Allium Cepa Powder for anti-aging properties. Anti-aging ingredients minimise the development of wrinkles and sun spots caused by excess exposure to UV rays. Which supplement is the best to take? Both Diamond Cherry and Crystal Tomato supplements are designed to lighten melasma and pigmentation while protecting the skin from environmental damage such as free radicals and UV radiation. While these supplements helps to improve the overall skin quality, it is also imperative to apply topical skin care such as sunscreen that has at least an SPF 30 to protect the skin. The use of oral supplements and topical skin care products provides protection and prevention, but treatments utilizing medical lasers and energy-based devices are complementary solutions for treating skin concerns such as fine lines, hyperpigmentation and over skin health. Not all supplements provide the same functions or benefits. Consult your aesthetic doctor for a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your skin type, concerns, lifestyle and medical history. "}
