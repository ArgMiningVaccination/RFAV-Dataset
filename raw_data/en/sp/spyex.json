Reflexology Reflexology is based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to every part of the body. Reflexology serves to relax, improve circulation and promote a general feeling of wellness. Foot reflexology quite simply refers to the reflexes that have been mapped out in the foot. There are many different foot reflexology charts that show where the reflexes are for every part of the body. Reflexology is different than massage. Reflexology works through nerve endings whereas massage is applied to the muscles and soft tissue of the body. The actual technique is quite unique as it is meant to affect the reflex and not just the surface of the skin. Reflexology treatment should not be painful, though there may be uncomfortable or tender areas if your body is highly stressed. The more pressure that is applied to those areas, the less tender they will become. Foot reflexology can be used to treat a variety of health conditions which include, but are not limited to: elaxation and stress management elief of aches, pains and tension revent and cure symptoms such as headache, asthma, digestive and elimination difficulties mprove sleep patterns oost blood circulation urn the body's functions into its homeostasis state Services & Pricing Thai Reflexology Thai Foot Reflexology helps to improve health by stimulating Sen energy lines, activity of internal organs, and improving blood and lymph circulation to the sensory nerves. All these sensory nerves are mainly rooted at the plantar area of the foot. Unique to Thai Reflexology, a massage stick is used to access these zones. Thai Hand Reflexology effects are the same as Foot Reflexology, but it can be a more relaxing treatment. Because the hands are closer to the spine and nerve roots, treatments can effectively relax the nervous system. This treatment is also ideal for a person with sensitive/ticklish feet, if there is a foot injury, the leg or foot is in a cast, amputation(s), or if there are personal reasons you don't want your feet worked on.
