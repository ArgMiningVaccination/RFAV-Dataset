Anyone know what sort of proof is required?

Just because they say something does not automatically equate to global acceptance. Countries believe and follow what they choose to so the pessimism in me would err on the side of caution. Again, I think it's moot for both sides of the argument to go back and forth on the subject. Someone with firsthand experience needs to step up and share their story.....(if there are any). If no one does then that's an even greater sign to be more cautious. Also, the fact that it's so difficult now to find an airport to transit through hassle free is not a good sign either. Believe me, I want nothing more than to jet away and get my global adventures kick started again but the barriers just seem to keep piling up.....it's super annoying. Edited: 2 years ago "}
