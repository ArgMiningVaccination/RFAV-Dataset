From what you read inthis booklet, who can imagine the scopeand importance of the work Marquettepeople will do during the coming hundredyears?In addition, this gathering honors therecipient of the Lawrence G. HaggertyFaculty Award for Research Excellence,as well as recognizing the prestigious prizeand the man for whom it is named.Presented for the first time in the year2000, the award has come to be regardedas a distinguishing mark of facultyexcellence in research and scholarship.This program lists much of the publishedscholarship, grant awards, and majorhonors and distinctions amongMarquette's faculty as well as similarresearch-oriented achievements amongalumni. These scholarly accomplishmentsare numerous and significant; however,the listing is incomplete in two ways.First, it only reflects scholarship, whichconstitutes one-third of the professionalresponsibilities expected of a facultymember. Although teaching and serviceare not honored here today, facultypedagogy is recognized through the Robertand Mary Gettel and Reverand John P.Raynor, S.J., Awards for TeachingExcellence. Second, the list of facultyaccomplishments is extensive but is notcomprehensive, while the alumni listingprovides only a sampling of individuals'outstanding accomplishments, excludingremarkable records in many non-scholarlypursuits. It is noted that the careers ofsome alumni have been recognized morefully over the years through variousAlumni Association awards.Given limitations, it is likely that somedeserving individuals have been omittedand others have incomplete or incorrectcitations in the program listing. Apologiesare extended to anyone whose work hasnot been properly recognized; just asscholarship is a work always in progress,so is the compilation of a list like the onethat follows. To improve thecompleteness and correctness of thelisting, you are invited to submit to theGraduate School the names of individualsand titles of works and honors that havebeen omitted or wrongly cited so thatadditions and changes can be made to thedatabase. For your convenience, a copy ofthe program and instructions forsubmitting data on-line can be found onthe Internet athttp://www.marquette.edu/orsp/haggerty/index.shtml , which is the website forMarquette's Office of Research andSponsored Programs.The list's shortcomings aside, it strives tohighlight faculty recognized publishedand/or researched work accomplishedduring their tenures at Marquette; alumniare acknowledged for scholarly andcreative accomplishments during theirentire careers. In cases where facultygraduated from Marquette, the listPrefaceidentifies these individuals under facultyand includes data regarding graduation andscholarship. College and departmentaldesignations for both faculty and alumnireflect those in use today.Lastly, it is significant to indicate thatinclusion in the program listing, as well asfaculty and alumni invitations to today'sreception, were based upon the followingspecific categories reflecting scholarlyactivities or honors:Chairs and Distinguished ProfessorshipsAuthors, Editors, and Translators of Books(If no further designation is provided, thenamed individual is the sole author of thework.)Distinguished Career Funding(Individuals who have obtained over$1,000,000 in career funding.)Major Grants and Contracts(Generally includes grants or contractsgreater than $10,000.)Editors of Scholarly Journals and BookSeriesFellowships and Visiting ProfessorshipsResearch Published Principally ThroughArticlesPrizes, Awards, Distinctions, Offices inProfessional Societies, and Other Forms ofRecognitionPatents(Patent description, year, and number aregenerally indicated.)Lawrence G.

From1968 to 1968, he was a member ofthe Board of Regents\u2014the firstuniversity governing body toinclude both lay and Jesuitrepresentatives. Thereafter, heserved as one of the first laytrustees from 1969 through 1988,after which he was trustee emeritusuntil 1994. This role as a trusteepartially coincided with thepresidency of the Reverend John P.Raynor, S.J., to whom Mr.Haggerty was a dear friend, trustedadvisor, and mentor.Marquette recognized LawrenceHaggerty's association with theuniversity, his extraordinarycommitment to serve, and hisillustrious career by honoring himwith the Distinguished EngineeringAlumnus Award in 1970.In addition, Lawrence Haggertywas the co-founder of theMarquette Club of Chicago, andthe Club's Distinguished AlumnusAward is named for him.Such honors attest to the integrityof an individual committed todoing one's best. Throughout hiscareer and until his death in 1994,Mr. Haggerty generously supportedthis commitment in an educationalsense at Marquette Among these wassponsorship of the JohnP. Raynor, S.J., Faculty Award forTeaching Excellence, which heestablished. Thus, it is only afitting tribute that the Lawrence G.Haggerty Faculty Award forExcellence in Researchcomplements, in the name ofscholarship, Lawrence Haggerty'sall-encompassing belief inexcellence.3The Lawrence G.
