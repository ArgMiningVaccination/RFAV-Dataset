A note from the editors: impact of anthropogenic changes to water on human pathogens. Euro Surveill. 2016;21(15):pii=30200. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30200 Article submitted on 14 April 2016 / accepted on 14 April 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 Water safety is vital, and the quality of water important in terms of public health. One of the objectives of the Water Quality and Health Strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2013 to 2020 period, is to obtain 'the most rigorous and relevant evidence regard - ing water quality and health' [ 1]. In terms of infectious diseases, water can transport pathogens in the envi - ronment through different steps of the water cycle [2,3]. In the water, some physical or chemical parame - ters, e.g. temperature, pH, salinity, organic matter, may affect the survival of the pathogens [ 4]. Substances intended to control pathogens or insects (antimicrobi - als, antivirals and pesticides) can occur in water sub - sequent to their use [ 5,6] or manufacturing process [7,8]. This may paradoxically induce pathogen or vector resistance to these substances [ 9-12]. Moreover, water can also bear a number of pathogens with resistance acquired through other pathways [ 13]. Exposure of people to waterborne pathogens may occur by drink - ing or swallowing water, inhaling aerosolised droplets and contact with water through bathing and recreation [14,15]. Some pathogens may also be disseminated by water further in the environment (e.g. in the soil and air) potentially allowing human exposure. Consuming foods, grown on/in or irrigated with pathogen-contami - nated water may also lead to infection [ 16,17]. As a number of changes to water, e.g. canalisation, temperature, nutrient enrichment, addition of pest-control or antimicrobial/viral substances, and patho - gen contamination, result from human activities, it is relevant to understand their impact on infectious disease epidemiology. To provide some examples rel - evant for European public health, and to present issues related to the detection and identification of cases of waterborne outbreaks and the proof of anthropogenic change to water as the cause, we issued a call for papers [ 18]. Subsequent to this, we now publish five articles, through which a number of issues arise and which can be summarised as follows.The challenges of outbreaks potentially caused by microbial contamination of water are first illustrated in a report from Italy, where an outbreak of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium 1,4 [5],12:i:- with sole resist - ance to nalidixic acid is described [ 19]. Attempts to determine the source of this outbreak led to extensive environmental investigations. While its cause could not be ascertained, a number of surface water samples in the outbreak area, including of water used for grow - ing fruit and vegetables, were positive for the outbreak strain. Moreover some water samples from local sew - age treatment plants also tested positive, thus leading to the hypothesis that wastewater may have contami - nated irrigation water [ 19]. The epidemiological investi - gation was complicated and the origin of the outbreak strain and how this strain acquired its resistance to nalidixic acid remain unresolved. The study reinforces the value of detecting waterborne outbreaks early. Generally, water may become contaminated from a non-point source, such as the runoff of water from manure in agricultural fields, or from a point dis - charge, such as a hospital wastewater outlet or a sew - age treatment plant. The issue of clinical wastewater harbouring microorganisms resistant to antimicrobials, and its subsequent effect on sewage and freshwater is important for public health, particularly if resistant bacteria introduced in the water can not only survive but also grow in wastewater. Acinetobacter baumanni for example, is considered a nosocomial pathogen, but its ecology is as of yet not fully understood and the observation of community outbreaks has made environmental niches suspect. A study from Croatia finds multiresistant A. baumannii strains in both influ - ent and effluent water to a sewage treatment plant in Zagreb, indicating that such strains can evade the treatment process. The study shows moreover that iso - lated strains can survive and grow in effluent sewage water up to 50 days, posing a potential risk for further dissemination in the recipient river to the plant [ 20].3 www.eurosurveillance.orgAs a risk exists for surface water to become contami - nated by wastewater pathogens, there is relevance in fully assessing its safety for further human use. A study from Serbia conducted during the bathing sea - son reveals adenovirus and rotavirus genetic materi - als in recreational waters of the Danube, along popular public beaches in addition to faecal contamination. As the presence of viruses could not necessarily be pre - dicted by the amount of bacteria measured in the water via routine quality control, the authors conclude that viral indicators may be helpful for further assessing the risks posed by water, in particular in areas where the sewer network is insufficient or inadequate [ 21]. Which panels of viruses could serve as relevant indi - cators of water quality in certain circumstances would need further investigations, as this may depend in part on their infectivity doses and persistence in environ - mental water. Also this might require to know what potential viruses contaminate the water to begin with, possibly first requiring agnostic screening techniques. In this regard, the development and implementation of assays that can be used for the surveillance of the whole population of viruses in water samples can be of interest. In this special issue, a methodology combin - ing tangential flow filtration of sewage combined with deep sequencing, without the need for cell culture, is presented as an agnostic approach to survey viruses in sewage. The use of this methodology is proposed for the surveillance of poliovirus, but broader applica - tions, including creating new viral sequence databases for retrospective analysis of presently unknown human viruses that may be discovered in the future are sug - gested [ 22]. Should it be a priori known what viruses likely con - taminate water in an area, defining more specific tools to confirm their presence may be considered. Moreover in terms of further risk assessment, and as also dis - cussed in the Serbian study in this issue [ 21], assays to determine the presence of infectious virus might also be of value. As illustrated by some of the above studies [ 19,21], adequate management of wastewater is crucial. Indeed, water contaminated by wastewater can subse - quently cumulate in larger water bodies such as lakes or the ocean. There, its impact may be less clear, as not only pathogens, but supportive nutrients may be carried by the wastewater. In combination with mete - orological factors such as temperature, this may lead to the sporadic or intermittent occurrence of 'exotic' or 'unusual' pathogens in some areas [ 4]. An article from the Netherlands describes three cases of Vibrio chol - era non-O1 serogroup (VCNO) bacteraemia reported in the country. Cases had been prior exposed to fish and/or had contact with surface water. The Dutch study includes a review of the literature to identify sources and risk factors for bacteraemia [ 23].In conclusion, this special issue provides some insights into the importance of surveillance of pathogens in the water [19-23] and outbreaks or cases caused by water - borne pathogens [19,21,23]. Wider studies could help further refine criteria for assessing water treatment processes. Through pollution of ground water with antimicrobials and multi-resistant bacteria, water - borne outbreaks of multi-resistant bacteria are likely to become more frequent in the future. The special issue illustrates that addressing the problems due to anthropogenic changes to water on the epidemiology of human pathogens will require a multi-disciplinary approach. References 1.

Outbreak of unusual Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium monophasic variant 1,4 [5],12:i:-, 2014. Euro Surveill. 2016;21(15):pii=30194. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30194 Article submitted on 15 April 2015 / accepted on 14 April 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 Monophasic variant of Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-, appears to be of increasing importance in Europe. In Italy, monophasic S . Typhimurium represented the third most frequent Salmonella serovar isolated from human cases between 2004 and 2008. From June 2013 to October 2014, a total of 206 human cases of sal - monellosis were identified in Abruzzo region (Central Italy). Obtained clinical isolates characterised showed S. Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i:- with sole resistance to nalidixic acid, which had never been observed in Italy in monophasic S. Typhimurium, neither in humans nor in animals or foods. Epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations were conducted to try to identify the outbreak source. Cases were inter - viewed using a standardised questionnaire and micro - biological tests were performed on human as well as environmental samples, including samples from fruit and vegetables, pigs, and surface water. Investigation results did not identify the final vehicle of human infection, although a link between the human cases and the contamination of irrigation water channels was suggested. Introduction Monophasic variant of Salmonella considered an emergent pathogen in many European countries [1]. It accounted for 4.6%, 7.2% and 8.6% of total cases of salmonellosis reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively [2], and ranked third among the Salmonella serovars identified in humans in the European Union (EU) during this period. Human infection is usually acquired through the con - sumption of contaminated food and several food-borne outbreaks caused by this serovar have been reported in Canada, Europe and the United States (US) [1-3]. Fresh beef and pork account for the major sources of infection, but dried sausages and frozen chicken pies have also been implicated in food-borne outbreaks, as well as vegetables and juices. The majority of mono - phasic S. Typhimurium isolates detected in live animals originates from pigs [3]. Human outbreaks potentially related to environmental sources, including water, have been also observed [4-8]. In Italy, the laboratory-based surveillance network for enteric pathogens EnterNet Italia [9] provides information on the microbiological characteristics of Salmonella spp. strains isolated from humans. The data are gathered through a network of regional reference laboratories which characterise the strains isolated from peripheral diagnostic laboratories. The EnterNet Italia network is coordinated by the National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella infection in humans of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS).6 www.eurosurveillance.orgAccording to EnterNet data, monophasic Typhimurium represented the third most frequent Salmonella serovar isolated from clinical samples in the country between 2004 and 2008 [10], ranking second in 2009 [11]. It accounted for 2.95 isolates per 100,000 population/year between 1980 and 2011, with particularly high isolation rates in children aged one to five years [12]. Strains characterised by resistance to ampicillin, strep - tomycin, sulfafurazole, and tetracycline (ASSuT) (with or without additional 75% of all the monophasic S . Typhimurium isolates from either 2008 or 2009. Forty-eight per cent of strains belonged to DT193 and 13% to U302. The most common [3]. In October 2013 a significant increase of human cases of salmonellosis in L'Aquila province (Abruzzo region, Central Italy) was reported to EnterNet Italia. In the period between June and October 2013 only, ca 30 salmonellosis cases, corresponding to 9.9 cases per 100,000 population [13], were observed in the L'Aquila province, clearly excessing levels of previous recent years. For example, between 2005 and 2009, the aver - age number of salmonellosis cases notified in the prov - ince was equal to nine per year, with a maximum value of 30 annual cases in 2005 [14]. The vast majority of cases observed in L'Aquila province during 2013 and 2014 was due to monophasic S. Typhimurium. Isolates from patients' stool samples were indistinguishable by traditional typing methods, such as phage type, PFGE and multilocus-variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) and were solely resistant to nalidixic acid, which had never been observed in Italy in mono - phasic S. Typhimurium neither in humans nor in ani - mals or foods [15]. According to TESSy, monophasic S. Typhimurium with this peculiar antimicrobial profile had also rarely been reported in the EU. Here we present the results of the epidemiological, environmental and molecular investigations carried out in the Abruzzo region in 2013-2014. The aims of these investigations were to gather relevant informa - tion on exposures and to identify the potential sources of infection so as to allow adequate control measures. Methods Case ascertainment and case definition Following the observation of the significant increase of human cases of salmonellosis in L'Aquila province (Abruzzo region, Central Italy), an alert was sent to all public health services of Abruzzo region in October 2013. Prospective and retrospective active finding of cases was conducted for the period from January 2013 to October 2014, involving hospitals in Abruzzo as well as microbiological laboratories in the whole Italy through the EnterNet Italia surveillance network.Figure 1 Number of confirmed, probable and possible monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak cases based on symptom onset weeka, Italy, 2 June 2013-27 September 2014 case Probable case Conrmed case a For 57 cases symptom onset date was not known and specimen date was used. b Although a total of 206 cases were part of the outbreak, only 204 are depicted in this figure because for two confirmed cases the onset day and the specimen date were missing information.7 www.eurosurveillance.orgThe outbreak strain was defined as: ' monophasic S. Typhimurium resistant to nalidixic acid, with a PFGE profile equal to the reference type XBAI.0027 and MLVA 3-14-11-NA-211 encoded by the molecular surveil - lance service (MSS) of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) '. Definitions of possible, probable and confirmed cases were established on the basis of phenotypic and gen - otypic characteristics of the Salmonella isolates, and the existence of a possible epidemiological link with Abruzzo region (people living in Abruzzo or reporting to have travelled to Abruzzo in the seven day-period before the disease onset). A confirmed case was a patient epidemiologically linked to Abruzzo, who was laboratory confirmed with the outbreak strain from January 2013 onwards. A probable case was a patient epidemiologically linked to Abruzzo, who was labora - tory confirmed with Salmonella group B from June 2013 onwards. A possible case was a patient with gastroen - teritis epidemiologically linked to Abruzzo from June 2013 onwards, but who was not laboratory confirmed with Salmonella . An international alert was also launched through the European Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS) in April 2014. Epidemiological investigations From October 2013, cases were requested to respond to a standardised questionnaire. This was administered by a face to face interview of either the patients or, if they were younger than 18 years-old, their parents. Until the end of March 2014 the questionnaire was generic and included only information on demographic data and presence of clinical symptoms. Starting from April 2014, a more elaborate version was used to also collect information on the occurrence, duration and severity of clinical symptoms, healthcare seeking behaviours, and exposures possibly presenting a risk for Salmonella infection in the seven days before symptoms onset. These included exposure to possible animal reservoirs, contact with people with gastrointestinal illness, as Figure 2 Geographical distribution of outbreak cases (n = 115)a and of surface and sewage water samples (n = 21) with a monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak strain isolate, L'Aquila province, Italy, April-October 2014 a Although there were a total of 179 outbreak cases in the Abruzzo region, only 115 are depicted in this figure because for 64 cases the residential address was missing information.8 www.eurosurveillance.orgwell as travel, details on food and beverages consumed including their purchase places, and the consumption of meals out of home. Cases were also asked about the consumption of local handmade food products of ani - mal and vegetable origins. The implementation of a case-control study was origi - nally considered but could not be realised due several difficulties which are further discussed. Data from the questionnaires were entered into a data - base using Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States (US)). Data man - agement and analysis were performed using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, Texas, US). Data derived from the 2011 demographic census performed by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) were used to cal - culate the attack rates [16]. The possible existence of a relationship between the age of cases and both the duration of clinical symptoms and disease severity was assessed by the calculation of Kendall's rank correla - tion coefficient. Environmental investigation Given the temporal and spatial extension of the out - break, a possible implication of environmental sources was suspected. Accordingly, the regional health authorities established a microbiological monitoring plan in April 2014. This included sampling of all com - mercial pig herds of L'Aquila province (faecal, dust, drinking water and feed samples were taken in each herd), and the examination of ileocaecal lymph nodes taken from swine at slaughterhouses to assess the status of Salmonella infection in pigs bred and slaugh - tered in the province. In addition, locally produced fruit and vegetables, mainly fresh vegetables grown in open fields and intended to be consumed raw, were directly collected in a subset of producing farms. These farms were selected on the basis of the results of sur - face water sampling, which was performed as further described. In each cultivated field at least eight sam - ples of fruit and vegetables, with the minimum weight of 2 kg and chosen to be representative of the whole cultivated surface, were taken. Overall, 23 pig herds, 11 swine slaughterhouses and 17 fruit and vegetable-producing farms in L'Aquila province were investigated. The monitoring plan also concerned surface water. Channels used for irrigation (including at farm sites) were sampled as well as surface water from three main catchment basins of the Tevere, Liri-Garigliano and Aterno rivers and their tributaries. Nine sewage water Figure 3 Geographical distribution and microbiological testing results of surface and sewage water samples in the L'Aquila province, Italy, April-October 2014 (n = 302) 9 www.eurosurveillance.orgtreatment plants were additionally subjected to micro - biological controls on fluids entering and leaving the plants. The sampling programme was performed until the end of October 2014. Daily data on rainfall covering a period from September 2013 to June 2014 [17] were obtained from the Centre of Excellence for the Remote Sensing and Forecast of Severe Weather (CETEMPS) of L'Aquila University and a preliminary analysis was conducted to assess the pos - sible association between rainfalls and the occurrence of salmonellosis cases, using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The correlation was evaluated through a cross-correlation approach by using two different time lags: the time shift between rain and cases detection and a time window used to average the quantities of rain along a period of time before the occurrence of cases. Data were aggregated using five days interval since this was considered the best temporal aggrega - tion to summarise and analyse data on rainfall and on the occurrence of salmonellosis case. Only cases occurring in the L'Aquila municipality and in the neigh - bouring municipalities were included in the analysis, since available data on rainfall referred to that area. The analysis was performed using the R free package [18].Characterisation of strains Biochemical identification of isolates was conducted using the automated Vitek 2 system (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The mercial antisera (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) according to the Kauffmann-White scheme by slide agglutination. After having identified the somatic antigen and the phase-1 flagellar antigen, if the second one was negative, the phase inversion method was used to allow the expression of the second flagel - lar phase. Strains were assigned to Salmonella serovar Typhimurium monophasic variant 1,4 [5],12:i:- on the basis of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [19]. Antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was evalu - ated by disk diffusion method [20]. Phage typing was performed using S . Typhimurium phages according to the method described by Anderson et al. [21]. Strains were typed by PFGE and MLVA according to the ECDC Laboratory standard operating procedures [22,23]. The genomes of 20 respective strains matching the outbreak strain definition and isolated from human (n = 14) and environment samples (n = 6; five from sewage plants and one from surface water) were fully sequenced. They were chosen on the basis of geo - graphical location, timeline isolation and biochemical properties. Moreover most of the strains chosen to be Figure 4 Maximum likelihood relationship of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium whole genome sequences, obtained from environmental water and clinical samples during an outbreak of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, L'Aquila province, Italy, Family 0.490.54 0.09 0.17 0.130.450.02 0.02 0.02 0.12 0.620.020.8 Bootstrap values are indicated at the tree nodes.

Three additional isolates, two unrelated outbreak monophasic S. Typhimurium isolates (differing from outbreak strain for antimicro - bial resistance patterns) and a further strain isolated five years prior, were also sequenced and added as controls and outgroup respectively. Whole genome sequencing was performed by a Personal Genome Machine (PGM) Ion torrent platform. After quality trim - ming, retained reads were in the 40 to 350 nt length range, exhibiting an average phred score of 30 and pro - viding an estimated coverage spanning from 18x to 45x for the selected isolates. Trimmed reads were submit - ted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repository [24] under the Bioproject accession number SRP049581 and were used to build a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reference-based matrix using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) SNP-pipeline programme [25]. The phylogenetic tree was built using the Tamura-Nei model in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA)6 [26]. Confidence of branch points was esti - mated by Fast bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates. Results Outbreak description A total of 206 cases (98 confirmed, 101 probable, 7 possible) were identified in Italy between June 2013 and September 2014 (Figure 1). No cases possibly linked to this outbreak were reported from the 14 coun - tries (including the US) reacting to the EPIS alert. Of the 206 cases, the place of residence was unknown for 19. Among those with available information, only eight cases were detected outside the Abruzzo region. In this region with a total of 179 cases, most (n = 146) were reported from the province of L'Aquila. The attack rate was 14 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Abruzzo region (95% confidence interval (CI): 12-16), and 49 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in L'Aquila province (95% CI: 41-58). Information on patient's age was col - lected for 192 cases and the median value was 4 years (range: 0-91 years). The age of cases significantly dif - fered (Fisher's test p < 0.01) from that of the Abruzzo population, taken as 'control' population, and the greatest number of cases (n = 98; 51%) occurred in patients aged between one and four years (Pearson's chi-squared: 1,248; p < 0.01). No significant difference was observed by sex (53% males and 47% females). Data on clinical signs were complete for 90 patients and the mean duration of illness was seven days (range: 1-30 days). Diarrhoea was the most important symp - tom (89/90; 99%), followed by diffuse Among symptomatic cases, 46 (51%) were hospitalised. The median age of hospitalised patients was four years (range: 1-91 years). No significant cor - relation was observed between the age of cases and the duration of the illness (Kendall's coefficient = 0.03) or its severity (Kendall's coefficient = 0.05). A man aged > 70 years died following the S. Typhimurium infection. Epidemiological investigation Of a total 112 cases approached for interviews, 106 took part in the questionnaires, corresponding to a par - ticipation rate of 95%. Of these, 51 cases answered to the first generic questionnaire (48%) and 55 to the fol - lowing more elaborate version (51%).

During the week before disease onset, eight of 49 respondents (16%) reported to have travelled. These eight cases resided in L'Aquila and had travelled out - side the Abruzzo region (however, no cases travelled to the same place) and 24 of 95 (25%) respondents reported contacts with an individual presenting gastro - intestinal illness. Contacts with pets were reported by 31 of 90 cases (34%). In the week prior to the onset of the disease, 38 of 49 cases had consumed food outside their home: in school canteens (20/41), in restaurants (10/49), in bars (13/44), in fast foods (7/45), or in other places (8/23). As far as school canteens are concerned, the investiga - tion was extended to verify possible common food sup - pliers and no common places or epidemiological links were identified. The investigation on food eating habits did not reveal the consumption of any particular food considered at risk for Salmonella infection, apart from eggs and veg - etables. Most of the cases reported drinking tap or bot - tled water, respectively 41/66 (62%) and 56/76 (74%). Environmental investigation All samples taken among the pig herds (n = 123), the fruit and vegetables produced by farms (n = 37), and in the slaughterhouses (n = 32) from April to October 2014 tested negative for Salmonella (Table ). Monophasic S. Typhimurium isolates, fitting the definition of outbreak strain, were detected in 11 of 191 samples of surface water, in one of four samples of irrigation water taken on farms, and in nine of 111 samples of sewage treat - ment plants taken in several geographical locations of L'Aquila province (Table). The positive sample of irrigation water was taken from irrigation pipelines with water from the Vera river, which is tributary of the Aterno river, and from which surface water samples also tested positive. The sam - ples of fruit and/or vegetables taken from the fields irrigated with the contaminated water were negative for Salmonella . Monophasic S . Typhimurium outbreak strain was detected in five sewage treatment plants localised on the Aterno river and in one sewage treat - ment plant localised on the Raio stream flowing into Aterno river (Figure 2). The geographical location of 21 water samples testing positive for monophasic S . Typhimurium with the same characteristics as the out - break strain is shown in Figure 2. In addition, three further surface water and five sew - age samples resulted positive for monophasic S. Typhimurium, but showing different phenotypic char - acteristics than the outbreak strain, while another 50 samples (34 of surface waters and 16 of sewage) were positive for other Salmonella serovars. The geographi - cal locations of 302 sewage and surface water sam - ples, which were microbiologically analysed as well as their testing results are reported in Figure 3. The analyses performed to explore the possible corre - lation between rainfalls and the occurrence of salmo - nellosis cases gave a significant value of the Pearson's coefficient (0.47) when an increase of the average value of rainfall over a 10 day period was considered and for a time shift between rain and cases detection of 20 days. Characterisation of strains Phylogenetic relationships among the selected iso - lates were investigated using the SNP matrix obtained from the whole genome sequencing. The single maxi - mum parsimonious (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses resulted in a single tree with similar topology (Figure 4). The two strains not matching the definition of outbreak strain, clustered as a separate clade with high bootstrap support, and one of them differed from the antigenic profile (SAMN03162144), while the other exhibited a completely different antimicrobial resist - ance profile (SAMN03162146). In contrast, outbreak- related isolates were grouped in a well-separated clade from the other strains. However, genetic relationships among isolates (both from patients and water samples) inside the outbreak clade were supported by very low bootstrap values (range: 13-80%). Subclades with higher bootstrap values include both water and clini - cal-related strains. Discussion In the outbreak described here, cases were solely iden - tified in Abruzzo region and occurred continuously and uninterruptedly from June 2013 to September 2014. The outbreak strain was repeatedly isolated in sewage treat - ment plants and surface water, including water used for irrigation in the region. A cross-correlation analy - sis between rain episodes and human cases moreover showed that an increased level of rainfalls (averaged over a 10 days period) preceded the onset of salmonel - losis cases by ca 20 days. Whole genome sequencing phylogenetic analysis, albeit not robust, also indicated some relationships between clinical and water strains. To gain more information on whether outbreak strains could be of clonal origin, the phylogenetic distances among the outbreak isolates would need to be care - fully evaluated taking into account the relative long period of time during which the human cases occurred and the subsequent higher probability of Salmonella population differentiation and heterogeneity. Taken together, the results are in line with the hypoth - esis of a waterborne mechanism for the outbreak, and might suggest a possible relationship between heavy precipitations and the presence of Salmonella in sur - face waters, maybe via the flooding of sewage treat - ment plants, subsequently leading to contamination of irrigation waters. That floods, as result of intensive 12 www.eurosurveillance.orgprecipitation events, bring pathogens from sewage water to surface water is a known phenomenon: heavy rainfalls in a relatively short time can cause sewer overflows to surface water and/or soil, thus increasing the risk of contaminating irrigation waters [27]. Here, the contamination of surface and irrigation waters by the outbreak strain could also have been due to prob - lems with the treatment plants or to persisting damage inflicted to water pipelines of the sanitary sewer sys - tem of the city of L'Aquila and surrounding villages by the devastating earthquake in 2009. In the environmental investigation, the apparent absence of the outbreak strain in pigs reared in the Abruzzo region and the negative microbiological results in fruits and vegetables, may suggest the exist - ence of yet undetected infection reservoirs, such as wild animals. Nevertheless, given the time elapsed between the possible occurrence of an environmen - tal contamination and the collection of samples, the results cannot definitely rule out pigs or vegetables as sources of infection. Fruits and vegetables may be gen - erally colonised by a wide variety of microorganisms and Salmonella is usually associated to fresh produce [28]. The occurrence of Salmonella in whole and fresh- cut leafy greens has been reported [1] and outbreaks due to S . Typhimurium, which may survive for extended time periods in manure and manure-amended soils [29], have been associated with the consumption of fresh lettuce [30]. Rainfalls have also been proven to play a role in Salmonella dispersal and contamination of tomato plants in the field, especially during con - centrated and relatively intense rain events and when plastic mulch was used [6]. Aside from contamination via animal manure for fertili - zation purposes, it is also well known that vegetables can become contaminated with pathogens by irrigation water [31]. In the US this was confirmed in repeated incidents: a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Newport infection associated with eating tomatoes in 2002 and 2005 [5], an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak associated with shredded lettuce in 2006 [32] and the outbreak caused by Salmonella Saintpaul, which was found in irrigation water and in Serrano peppers [33]. A ban of using surface water to irrigate produce and other crop due to the presence of Salmonella spp. in some areas of L'Aquila province was already in force since September 2013, before the peak of the out - break. Unfortunately the ban was just applied to a limited area of L'Aquila province. Only starting from June 2014 did the local health authorities ban the use of surface water for crop irrigation on a larger area [34-36]. Sanitization interventions were subsequently performed in water cleaning plants and no more human cases were observed after September 2014. The role of banning the use of surface waters for irri - gation in the cessation of the outbreak can neverthe - less not be ascertained and the possibility of multiple transmission routes from the environment to humans, involving food-vehicles, cannot be excluded. The observed higher incidence in patients aged between one and four years-old is not surprising in Salmonella infections, given the increased vulnerabil - ity of children and the elderly to this infection. On the other hand, this finding could suggest the implication of food vehicles normally consumed also by children or the contamination of drinking water. A case-control study would have added more signifi - cant information on the possible source of this out - break. Although originally considered and planned, this study proved impossible. Indeed, the uncertain - ties on the times of first exposures due to interventions occurring late in the outbreak progress made it difficult to find suitable controls. In addition, the realisation of such a study was hampered by the extended geograph - ical area involved. During the period of the outbreak there was also an increase of cases of Salmonella infections due to Salmonella strains different from the outbreak strain. Since laboratory diagnosis concerned solely Salmonella spp. no other pathogen was investigated. The charac - terization of all pathogens responsible for cases of gas - troenteritis might have added more information on the possible source of this outbreak and possibly further supported the hypothesis of a waterborne mechanism. The delays between generating hypotheses on the contamination routes and implementing the sampling programme and interviews of cases could also have affected the identification of a food vehicle. This con - firms once again the importance of having an effec - tive epidemiological surveillance system in place, to early identify all possible suspected clusters of infec - tion and to quickly mobilise the human and diagnostic resources for a rapid identification of sources and vehi - cles of infection.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30195 Article submitted on 05 February 2015 / accepted on 14 April 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging hospi - tal pathogen. Whereas A. baumannii isolated from patients or hospitals has been reported, there are few data regarding propagation of viable A. baumannii in the natural environment. This study investigates the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of viable A. baumannii in municipal wastewater and its per - sistence through the wastewater treatment process. A total of 21 A. baumannii isolates were recovered at a secondary type of municipal wastewater treatment plant in Zagreb, Croatia: 15 from raw influent waste - water and six from final effluent. All isolates were car - bapenem- and multidrug-resistant. Among 14 isolates tested for bla OXA genes, all harboured the constitutive blaOXA-51-like gene, while the acquired blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-40-like genes were found in 10 and three isolates respectively. Six A. baumannii isolates recovered from effluent wastewater multiplied and survived in sterilised effluent wastewater up to 50 days. These findings support the idea that multidrug-resistant A. baumannii can occur and have the ability to survive in the environment . Introduction Over the last decade, hospital-acquired infections due to Acinetobacter baumannii have increased dramatically worldwide including in Croatia [1,2]. Difficulties caused by this pathogenin the hospital setting are exacerbated by its abilities to form biofilms on abiotic or biotic sur - faces and to cope with different environmental condi - tions, including desiccation and disinfectants [3-5]. Non-susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials [6] has also been observed, with carbapenem resistance becoming a global problem since 2000[7,8]. In Croatia, proportions of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains in clinical samples increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 (10% to 73% of isolates respectively), with some individual hospitals recording a rate of 90% [2,9]. The most important mechanism of carbapenem resist - ance in A. baumannii involves OXA-type carbapene - mases, which are encoded by bla OXA lineage genes. Five main phylogenetic subgroups including from OXA-143-like strains, whose prevalences in certain areas remain to be determined [11], A. baumannii strains of all these subgroups are globally distributed. Carbapenemase genes in A. baumanii are moreover constitutive (e.g. OXA-51-like) or acquired (e.g. OXA-23-like, A. isolates with constitutive OXA-51-like carbapenemases have been described [8,12,13]. Moreover, since 2009, isolates with acquired OXA-40-like carbapenemases dominate in most hospitals [13,14], while isolates with acquired OXA-23-like and OXA-58-like enzymes are sporadically reported [14]. How A. baumannii is introduced into the hospital envi - ronment remains incompletely understood [5,15]. Acute community-acquired human infections have been reported [16] and suggest a source of the pathogen out - side of the hospital. Even if such infections are mainly reported from tropical and subtropical areas and rep - resent only a minor proportion of all A. baumannii infections worldwide, community-acquired infections underline the importance of searching for possible environmental reservoirs of the pathogen and their potential consequences. In nature, multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains have been isolated from hospital wastewaters [17,18]. Aside from reports of A. baumannii in wastewaters close to hospitals, only few 16 www.eurosurveillance.orgstudies report detection elsewhere in the environment [19,20]. The aim of this study was to screen municipal waste - water for the presence of viable A. baumannii , charac - terise the recovered strains as well as investigate their potential for survival in the environment after passage through the wastewater treatment process. Methods Sampling and characterisation of wastewater Wastewater was collected at the largest Croatian waste - water treatment plant of Zagreb. This plant (capacity 1,200,000 population equivalents) is designed for the secondary treatment of municipal wastewater, which originates from a combined sewage system of domes - tic, hospital, industrial and storm water. The central treatment plant receives wastewater from all nine clini - cal hospitals of Zagreb. In accordance with the national legislation, sanitary hospital wastewaters are released into the sewage system without pre-treatment, and only radioactive wastewaters and infective solid waste are disposed of separately. The sewage system of Zagreb is an underground network of sewer with dif - ferent retention time of wastewater depending on the inhabitants' behaviours and stormwater runoff.Composite 24h samples of influent and effluent waste - water were collected in June and October 2014 and April and October 2014, respectively. The physico-chemical parameters of water samples were measured according to the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater [21]. Temperature was measured online and average values of composite samples were calculated. Bacteriological analyses For bacteriological analyses, wastewater was asepti - cally sampled in sterile 1L glass bottles and transferred to the laboratory within 1h. The wastewater samples were concentrated on sterile membrane filters of pore size 0.45\u00b5m in triplicate both before and after dilution in sterile peptone water. Intestinal enterococci were determined according to HRN ISO 7899-2 [22]. Membrane were incu agar (Biolife) at 37 \u00b0C for 72h and subsequent confirmation of intestinal enterococci (i.e. colonies with dark brown halo) was done on bile esculin azide agar (Sigma-Aldrich) Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis dendogram based Apa I-digested DNA from of Acinetobacter baumannii , Zagreb, Croatia, 2014 (n=20 isolates)a 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 100 clonal lineage I (RUH 2037); EUII: international 134); IN: isolates influent wastewater; n.t.: not tested for bla OXA genes; : no acquired bla OXA-like gene. The isolates' names according to their origin (influent or effluent wastewater), as well as the carbapenemase they harboured and date of collection are shown on the right hand side of the dendogram. a A total of 21 A. baumannii isolates were obtained throughout the study but the Apa I digestion failed for one, hence 20 isolates were further analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and presented in the dendogram.17 www.eurosurveillance.orgAerobically grown total heterotrophic bacteria were determined on 22 CR102 (CHROMagar), which allows the growth carbapenem-resistant isolates after incubation at 42 \u00b0C for 48h. The numbers of intestinal enterococci, aerobically grown total heterotrophic bacteria, and carbapenem-resistant bacteria were determined as colony form - ing units (CFU), logarithmically transformed, and expressed as log CFU per 1 mL of water. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria among total hetero - trophic bacteria was calculated.Isolation and characterisation of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates There is no simple protocol for the isolation of viable A. baumannii from environmental samples. A. bau - mannii is usually overgrown with accompanying flora even on selective and differential media. For the iso - lation of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from wastewater selective CHROMagar Acinetobacter sup - plemented with commercial supplement CR102 was used. Cefsulodin sodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 15 mg/L to suppress the growth of Pseudomonas and Aeromonas spp. The isolation of A. baumannii was performed at 42 \u00b0C for 48h to suppress the growth of most other species of Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas with intrinsic resistance to carbap - enems, as well as species of Pseudomonas .

The two lower panels (IN4 and EF1) show the degradation of meropenem in presence two respective wastewater isolates, recovered in this study. While the IN4 strain induces full meropenem degradation, in the same way than the clinical strain, the degradation by EF1 is incomplete.18 www.eurosurveillance.orgcolonies of A. baumannii were isolated from plates inoculated with 0.01-0.1mL of influent water and 0.1-1.0mL of effluent water. Presumptive colonies of A. baumannii were recultivated (42 \u00b0C for 24h) on the same selective plates and then on Nutrient agar. Pure cultures of presumptive A. baumannii grown at 42 \u00b0C on Nutrient agar were firstly characterised by rou - tine bacteriological techniques to assess the following characteristics: Gram negative coccobacilli, negative oxidase, positive catalase reaction, no reaction on the Kligler Iron Agar (Biolife). Further identification of pre - sumptive A. baumannii was carried out by ATB of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) which was shown to be a reliable method for rapid identifica - tion of A. baumannii [25,26] was used for confirma - tion on cell extracts according to Sousa et al. [27]. In brief, overnight cultures pre-grown on Nutrient agar were suspended in 70% ethanol. After centrifuga - tion and removal of the supernatant, cultures were extracted with 70% formic acid and an equal volume of acetonitrile. The suspension was centrifuged and cell extracts were spotted onto a MALDI target plate and air dried at room temperature. Subsequently, the sam - ple was overlaid with a saturated solution of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid as a matrix, dried, and subjected to analysis. Spectra were obtained by using Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics) in the linear positive mode in the range 2-20 kDa. Each recorded spectrum is the result of six series of 40 single laser shots in different locations. Identification of isolates was performed in technical triplicate and biological duplicate. Recorded mass spectra were processed with the MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software package (Bruker Daltonics) using stand - ard settings.The genetic relatedness of A. baumannii isolates from wastewater to clinical isolate was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Representatives of A. baumannii belonging to the international clonal line - age I (RUH 2037) and II (RUH 134), which have been confirmed as two dominant clones causing outbreaks in Croatia since 2002 and which are still present in Croatian hospitals [8,9,12-14], were used as PFGE ref - erence strains. PFGE analysis was performed using CHEF-DRII/III system (Bio-Rad) with Apa I (New England BioLabs) as restriction enzyme. The images of gel-electrophoresed restriction products were processed using Gel-Doc 1000 system (Bio-Rad) and Compar software. PFGE profiles were analysed and compared using Molecular Analyst Software for Fingerprinting (Bio-Rad). Matching and dendogram were performed with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) analysis [28,29] using Dice similar - ity coefficient with optimisation and a position toler - ance of 1.0%. The isolates were classified into clusters based on their genetic similarity (cut-off of 90%). Antibiotic resistance of The minimum inhibitory concen - tration (MIC) values were confirmed using AST-XN05 and AST-N233 testing card for Vitek2 system or using E-tests (AB Biodisk) for colistin (which was also included for susceptibility testing), and interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria [30]. The carbapenemase-induced carbapenem degrada - tion was confirmed described by Burckhardt and Zimmermann [31] and Hrabak et al. [32], with slight modifications. In brief, a loopful of overnight bacterial culture was added to 0.5mL of 0.2mM mero - penem trihydrate (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) in 0.05M NaCl. The solutions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2.5h with stirring at 150rpm. After centrifugation, the supernatants were spotted onto a MALDI-TOF MS targets by a sandwich method using 2,5-dihydroxyben - zoic acid (DHB) as a matrix, and subjected to analysis. A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii carrying the OXA-72 carbapenemase [13] was used as a positive control, while a meropenem solution without addition of bacteria served as the negative control. The presence of the genes of bla OXA lineage which encode OXA-type carbapenemases was checked in 14 isolates of A. baumannii , selected on the basis of PFGE pattern and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific respec - tive was bla 40-like, and blaOXA-58-like genes, according to [33].Figure 3 Survival of six Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (EF1-6) recovered from effluent wastewater in the autoclaved effluent wastewater during 50 days, Croatia, 2014 66.577.588.5 0 1 2 baumannii in effluent wastewater Survival of six isolates of A. baumannii (isolates EF1-6) recovered from effluent wastewater was moni - tored in the sterilised effluent wastewater collected on 28 October 2014. Effluent wastewater was filtered through filter paper (blue band) and membrane filter of pore size 0.45\u00b5m. Wastewater was partitioned per 200mL into Schott bottles and autoclaved (121\u00b0C for 20min). The of A. baumannii were separately on CHROMagar Acinetobacter at 42 \u00b0C for 24h. The biomass from each plate was then vortexed in sterile 0.05M NaCl, and 1mL of each suspension was inoculated into bottles containing the effluent wastewater. The bottles were sealed with a sterile gum cap and aeration was insured by a central hole through which filtered air (1L/min) was provided. The bottles were incubated at 16.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C in a thermostat (Memmert IPP400) with stirring (120 rpm) during 50 days. Any loss of the solution volume caused by evapo - ration was compensated by refilling with sterile 0.05M NaCl. For each measurement of bacterial numbers 1mL was taken from the bottle. Numbers of A. baumannii were counted in triplicate after dilution The numbers of CFU were loga - rithmically transformed and reported as log CFU per 1 mL of water.Results Physical, chemical and bacteriological characteristics of wastewater Temperatures of pH-neutral wastewater were relatively constant (Table 1). The physico-chemical character - istics of wastewater slightly varied on two sampling occasions of influent or effluent. Most evident how - ever, were variations in inflow and outflow and concen - tration of dissolved oxygen where the influent in June was anoxic (0.09 mg dissolved O 2/L). Both in June and in October, the ratio of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) to chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the influent was 0.5, which is considered high (0.3-0.6) and suggests nutrient rich biodegradable influent wastewater [34]. Concentrations of nutrients in efflu - ent wastewater were however in compliance with the national emission standards [35]. National emission standards do not require the moni - toring of microorganisms at a described type of waste - water treatment plant. High levels (> 1.8 log CFU/mL) of intestinal enterococci (Table 1) that are reliable indi - cators of faecal pollution [36] were found in the influ - ent and effluent water at each sampling occasion. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria among total heterotrophic bacteria ranged from 34 to 57% in influent and 22 to 29% in effluent. Isolation and characterisation of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates For the whole study, a total of 21 A. baumannii were isolated; 15 from influent and six from effluent waste - water. Colonies of A. baumannii were circular, convex, smooth, red with a paler central area. All isolates of A.

All isolates were also determined by Vitek 2 system as A. calcoace - ticus-baumannii complex. An influent isolate named IN19 appeared resistant to ApaI digestion and was therefore not subjected to sub - sequent PFGE cluster analysis. For the remaining A. baumannii isolates recovered from wastewater, none were similar to isolates belonging to the international clonal lineage I or II based on the PFGE dendrogram (Figure 1). Three effluent wastewater samples collected on 16 April clustered together as well as all but one of the influent samples from 11 June, and all but one of the influent samples from 28 October. The efflu - ent samples from 28 October, however, showed the absence of clusterisation. Isolates IN4 and PFGE profile. These PFGE identical pairs were respectively collected on the same date, all from influent water.Antibiotic resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates According to MIC values of tested antibiotics (Table 2) all 21 A. baumannii isolates from wastewater were resistant to carbapenems. Although always susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and colistin, all iso - lates were resistant to at least five of the nine antibiot - ics tested, and therefore could be classified as MDR. The isolates identical in PFGE profile (pairs IN4 and IN5, IN13 and IN17, IN14 displayed - ences in phenotypic antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. Isolate IN4 showed lower MIC value for gentamicin and higher MIC value for colistin as compared with isolate IN5. Differences in MIC values of amikacin, ciprofloxa - cin, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tobramycin were isolates IN13 and IN17. Isolates IN14 and IN16 showed differences in MIC val - ues of all tested antibiotics, except for imipenem and meropenem (Table 2). The carbapenemase-induced carbapenem degrada - tion by A. baumannii isolates from wastewater was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. No spontaneous degra - dation of meropenem was observed and characteris - tic peaks (m/z 383, 405, 427) were evident after 2.5h Table 2 Minimum inhibition concentration values of tested antibiotics and presence of acquired genes of blaOXA lineagea in isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii , Zagreb, Croatia, 0.50 Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria. a The constitutive gene blaOXA-51-like was confirmed in all isolates. b No acquired blaOXA-like gene.21 www.eurosurveillance.orgof incubation (Figure 2). All isolates from wastewater degraded the meropenem within 2.5h. Selected types of spectra are shown in Figure 2. The positive control carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii yielded a typical spectrum of complete meropenem degradation with characteristic peaks at m/z 379, 401, 423, and 445. Three isolates (IN4, IN5, IN8) of A. baumannii from wastewater degraded the meropenem as efficiently as the clinical isolate, as represented by the spectra of isolate IN4 in Figure 2. In the spectra of the remaining A. baumannii isolates recovered from wastewater in this study, residues of meropenem sodium and disodium salts (m/z 405 and 427) were visible in addition to the meropenem degra - dation products. This type of meropenem degradation is represented by the spectra of isolate EF1 in Figure 2 and suggests that such wastewater isolates degraded meropenem slower than the clinical isolate. A contact time of more than 2.5h was needed for these environ - mental isolates to fully degrade 0.2mM of meropenem. These isolates degraded the meropenem molecule first, followed by the degradation of meropenem sodium and disodium salts. Monitoring of the meropenem degradation by MALDI- TOF MS does not provide detection of the type of carbapenemase carried nor detection of other car - bapenem-resistance mechanisms [31]. The presence of genes of bla OXA lineage which encode OXA-type carbapenemases was further confirmed by PCR. All of 14 tested A. baumannii isolates harboured the consti - tutive bla OXA-51-like gene. Among these, 10 isolates had the acquired blaOXA-23-like, three the acquired blaOXA-40-like genes and one isolate did not have any acquired blaOXA gene (Table 2). For the three pairs of identical isolates by PFGE, the blaOXA genes in two pairs were only determined for one isolate respectively. For the remaining pair compris - ing IN14 and IN16, the acquired blaOXA-23-like gene was confirmed for both isolates in the pair (Table 2 and Figure 1). The bla OXA-23-like gene was moreover found in two tested isolates from the three effluent samples of 16 April, which clustered together by PFGE. It was also present in the four of six tested influent water sample isolates from 28 October, which together formed a sep - arate in PFGE. The four remaining isolates with bla OXA-23- like gene did not cluster together by PFGE and included three effluent isolates from 28 October and one influent isolate from 11 June. Although influent samples from 11 June formed a larger PFGE group, this group contained a sub-cluster with two isolates harbouring bla OXA-40-like genes. The third isolate with blaOXA-40-like gene was from an influent water sample collected on 28 October. Survival of Acinetobacter baumannii in effluent wastewater Six isolates of A. baumannii recovered from effluent wastewater showed excellent survival in the auto - claved effluent wastewater from 28 October (Figure 3). The low concentration of nutrients in this effluent wastewater was sufficient to support the multiplica - tion of bacteria. Multiplication of isolates occurred after one day of incubation, and log phase of growth was evident up to nine days of incubation. The station - ary phase of growth was continued up to 30 days, after which a slight decrease of log CFU was observed up to 50 days of incubation. After 50 days of monitoring the numbers (log CFU) of A. baumannii isolates were 4.4 to 15.7% higher than initial numbers. Discussion In this investigation, wastewater collected at a water treatment plant in Zagreb in April, June and October 2014 tested positive for A. baumannii at each occa - sion. A previous study in 2002 [37] reported the pres - ence of eight phosphate-accumulating A. baumannii strains in the activated sludge of a municipal wastewa - ter treatment plant in Izmir, Turkey. The strains in the latter study were however only characterised biochemi - cally (API 20NE identification kit) so they could have belonged to other species of the genus Acinetobacter considered important for enhanced biological phos - phate removal from wastewaters [24,27,38]. In con - trast, none of the A. baumannii isolates in the current study were able to accumulate intracellular polyphos - phate granule as confirmed by Neisser staining (data not shown). The prevalences of carbapenem-resistant bacteria among total heterotrophic bacteria, which were esti - mated each time the water was sampled, ranged from 34 to 57% in influent water and 22 to 29% in efflu - ent water. As carbapenems are heavily used in clini - cal environments, such prevalences suggest hospital wastewater in the influent water and bacteria of clini - cal origin in the effluent. The finding of OXA-40-like carbapenemase in three of 14 A. baumannii isolates recovered from wastewater strengthens this hypoth - esis. Indeed, OXA-40-like carbapenemases constitute the dominant mechanism of carbapenem resistance in clinical isolates of A. baumannii from most Croatian hospitals [9,13,14]. In addition to this, a number of strains isolated from wastewater degraded meropenem in the same way as a control clinical isolate. The domi - nance (10 of 14) of wastewater isolates harbouring the bla OXA-23-like gene was nevertheless unexpected, since the clinical isolates of A. baumannii which produce OXA-23-like carbapenemases have only been observed sporadically in the country [14]. It is possible that iso - lates carrying the bla OXA-23-like gene are more resistant to adverse environmental conditions in sewage as well as in the wastewater treatment process, thus surviving longer, but this needs to be further examined. In spite of this, all wastewater A. baumannii isolates recovered in this study were MDR and showed compara - ble levels of antibiotic resistance to clinical A. bauman - nii isolates in Croatia [12]. As environmental bacterial isolates are generally more susceptible to antibiotics than clinical isolates [39], these results also point to 22 www.eurosurveillance.orghospitals as the likely source of MDR A. baumannii in the wastewaters considered. In a preliminary screen - ing, we confirmed the presence of MDR A. baumannii in the wastewater of one hospital in Zagreb (data not shown). The observation of MDR A. baumannii in hos - pital wastewaters has also been previously reported in Brazil and China [17,18]. High numbers of intestinal enterococci that are reliable indicators of faecal pollution [36] were also found in the wastewater together with A. baumannii , suggesting the presence of sanitary water and bacteria of faecal origin. MDR A. baumannii has been found in digestive tracts of hospitalised patients [40] as well as in animal faeces and urine [41]. The digestive tracts of colonised patients and animals could be important epidemiologi - cal reservoirs of MDR A. baumannii , from which bacte - ria could migrate through wastewater into the natural environment. The wastewater from veterinary clinics [41] and stormwater, which could leach the bacteria from solid waste [20] may also represent a source of A. baumannii . Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of housekeeping genes should be further performed in order to assess the genetic relatedness of A. bauman - nii isolates from municipal wastewater and clinical iso - lates, as well as isolates from hospital wastewaters in Zagreb. When allochthonous bacterial species come in the environment, some abiotic and biotic ecological fac - tors have been shown to determine their survival and multiplication. Little is known however about the influ - ence of environmental factors on A. baumannii strains which are significant for public health in wastewater. Six isolates of A. baumannii recovered from effluent wastewater multiplied and survived in the effluent wastewater for up to 50 days of monitoring. The aver - age annual water flow velocity of the Sava River, which receives the effluent wastewater, is 0.75m/s, and 12 days are needed for the water mass to travel from the location of effluent discharge to the firth of the Sava into the Danube River. Therefore, the viable MDR A. baumannii could possibly spread through the natural water bodies or accumulate in river sediments. A sepa - rate study finding a MDR A. baumannii isolate related to a clinical isolate in the Seine River in France further supports this possibility [19]. Zhang et al. [39] reported that the tertiary wastewater treatment process contributed to the selective increase of MDR Acinetobacter spp. in final effluent and natu - ral recipient. Lower numbers of carbapenem-resistant bacteria together with lower prevalence of such bacte - ria among total heterotrophic bacteria in effluent than in influent wastewater does not support this in the case of our secondary wastewater treatment process. Higher numbers of viable MDR A. baumannii isolated per sampling occasion from influent than from effluent wastewater rather suggest a beneficial role of the sec - ondary wastewater treatment process on the distribu - tion of clinically important bacteria in the environment. However, certain numbers of carbapenem-resistant bacteria and A. baumannii are released after the sec - ondary treatment through the effluent wastewater into the natural recipient, which is the Sava River. The presence of viable MDR A. baumannii in both raw and treated municipal wastewater poses a serious concern about the spread of this emerging pathogen in nature. Disinfection of effluent water has been suggested as a promising tool for prevention of the accumulation of MDR bacteria in waterbodies [42]. However, currently the standards for discharge of treated municipal waste - water do not prescribe the elimination of MDR bacteria. Furthermore, carbapenem-resistant MDR A. baumannii were isolated from hospital wastewaters both prior and after disinfection by chlorination [18]. Genes encoding New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) were pre - sent in domestic and industrial wastewater and each stage of the wastewater treatment process, includ - ing the chlorinated effluent [43]. Although the viable bacteria were not determined, these NDM-1 genes were 99.8% identical to the NDM-1 genes carried by A. baumannii . The findings of MDR A. baumannii and NDM-1 genes after the process of chlorination suggest that conventional disinfection of effluent may not be the best strategy for mitigating the propagation of A. baumannii in the environment. Other disinfection tech - niques or barrier approaches at the source of contami - nation may be a more promising approach. Tracking the source and further dispersion of A. bau - mannii contamination is needed to initiate any response plan for its control in the environment. The isolates of A. baumannii recovered from the environment should be compared with hospital, veterinary/livestock and community-acquired strains by using additional types of molecular assays such as whole genome sequenc - ing [16], whereby there may be identifiable differences between these strains. Larger screening and epidemio - logical studies should also be performed to investigate the impact of human waste on the spread of MDR A. baumannii in the natural environment. In the current era when new antimicrobials for MDR Gram-negative microorganisms are scarce, it is most important to understand the epidemiology of this human pathogen. The results of this study represent a step forward in this direction.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30196 Article submitted on 15 April 2015 / accepted on 14 April 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 From August to September 2014 a water quality study was conducted on five popular public Danube beaches in Vojvodina, Serbia. To assess the safety of Danube water for bathing, physical, chemical, bacteriologi - cal tests were performed. While many parameters for monitoring the quality of water are regulated by law, there are neither national nor international legisla - tions addressing the presence of viruses in recrea - tional waters. In this study, we performed analyses that surpassed national requirements, and investi - gated if adenovirus, enterovirus or rotavirus genetic material was present in samples of recreational water collected for quality monitoring. Of 90 water samples obtained during the study, enterovirus material was not found in any sample, but adenovirus and rota - virus genetic materials were respectively detected in 60 and 31 samples. Statistical analyses showed a significant correlation between adenovirus DNA and total coliforms in the water. Even when water samples were adequate for recreational use, adenoviruses were detected in 75% (57/76) of such samples. Our results indicate that implementation of viral indicators in rec - reational water might be helpful to better assess pub - lic health safety. This might be particularly relevant in areas where urban wastewater treatment is insuf - ficient and surface waters affected by wastewater are used for recreation. Introduction Water quality is an essential prerequisite for human health. In the Water Quality and Health Strategy of the World Health Organization, (WHO) 2013-2020 [1], which is centred on the primary prevention of water - borne and water-related diseases, the first strategic objective is to 'obtain the most rigorous and relevant evidence regarding water quality and health'. While WHO has issued guidelines for safe recrea - tional water environments [2], in the European Union (EU), drinking and bathing water directives (Directive 2000/60/EC, Directive 2006/118/EC, and Directive 2006/7/EC) regulate monitoring and management of water for such purposes. Although many parameters are considered for monitoring water quality, there is currently no national or international regulation regard-ing the presence of viruses in recreational waters. Epidemics caused by waterborne viral pathogens can occur however, and for persons affected, infection can potentially result in serious complications (hepatitis [3], meningitis [4], myocarditis [5]), even leading to death in some cases. The most important waterborne viruses are enteric viruses, and comprise adenovi - ruses, enteroviruses (polio, coxsackievirus A and B, echovirus), hepatitis A and E viruses, noroviruses I and II, and rotaviruses [6-8]. With respect to drinking water, outbreaks caused by waterborne viruses related to water that met bacterio - logical standards have been reported [9,10]. Viruses on the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA)'s drinking water Contaminant Candidate List 4 (CCL 4), a list of 'contaminants that are currently not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations, but are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems', include viruses of the Calciviridae (norovirus), Picornaviridae (enterovirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus) families. These groups are internationally considered relevant in terms of public health with a suggestion that they should be part of monitoring [6,11,12] and there is a growing consensus within the scientific community, about the need to implement viral indicators in legisla - tions that define water quality control [12,13].26 www.eurosurveillance.orgSurface waters can become contaminated by viruses through sewage. Individuals with gastroenteritis or hepatitis excrete from 10 5 to 1011 viral particles per g of stool [14] and contact or ingestion of water contami - nated by faeces might potentially in turn lead to human infections [11]. In surface waters affected by sewage, over 100 viral species may be found [6,7]. Still, only some are epidemiologically proven to be transmitted by water. The WHO guidelines for safe recreational water environments include enteroviruses as a regula - tory parameter of importance for faecal pollution, but no guideline values are provided due to the 'insuffi - cient data for the development of guideline values' [2]. In Serbia, urban wastewater treatment, although regu - lated by law [15], is still inadequate, and the sewerage network not complete due to financial and technical difficulties. In this context, faecal contamination of sur - face water is inevitable [16,17]. This represents a poten - tial public health risk especially during bathing season. In the province of Vojvodina, several public beaches on the Danube are crowded with swimmers during the summer. According to the national legislation, physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters of the recrea - tional water are monitored, as well as some biological indicators of water quality (macroinvertebrate, phyto - benthos, phytoplankton, and macrophyte analyses). Similar to EU directives however, testing for viruses or viral material is not recognised as part of regular moni - toring of bathing waters in the country [18,19]. The objective of our study was to perform analyses that surpass the national requirements and investigate the presence of adenovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus genetic material in recreational waters of the Danube during summer. Methods Water sampling The study was conducted from August to September 2014 at five of the most popular beaches on the Danube in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The locations investigated were 'Strand' beach in the city of Novi Sad (1,257.57 river kilometre - rkm; measured from the river mouth) as well as beaches near villages and small towns - Eighteen river water samples per location were respectively obtained by collecting three samples per week for a period of six weeks. This corresponded to a total of 90 recreational water samples for all five locations. Water sampling, transport of samples and analyses of recreational water on site were done according to national standardised methods [20-23]. On site air and water temperatures were measured as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization [24]. Water sampling for virological analyses was done according to the procedure given by Method 1615, USEPA [25]. Briefly, 30 L of water were collected in pre-sterilised plastic containers. Water samples were taken at waist-depth, 30cm below the surface, closed carefully and transported to the laboratory at 4 \u00b0C. Upon arrival, the containers were kept in a refrigerated room (at 4 \u00b0C) until further processing for analysis, which occurred no longer than within 24h of sample arrival. Microbiological indicators and physical and chemical parameters For all samples, compliance with National Guideline Values (NGV) for microbiological indicators and physi - cal and chemical parameters (the so-called 'ecologi - cal and chemical status') was determined. Analyses were undertaken in laboratories accredited by National Accreditation Bodies. Microbiological parameters defined by national regulation and relevant for this study were: faecal coliform concentration, total coli - form concentration, intestinal enterococci concentra - tion and the heterotrophic plate count [18,19]. These were determined by the membrane filter method defined in the standardised method, and the Kohl method [18,19,26]. Physical and chemical parameters were: pH by poten - tiometry; suspended particulate (mg/L) and total mineralisation (mg/L) by gravimetry; dissolved oxy - gen (mg/L) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (mg O 2/l) by volumetric titrations; nitrate (mg and (mg P/l) by spectro - photometry (VARIAN Cary 100); biological oxygen demand after five days (BOD5) (mg O 2/l) by volumet - ric titration [27]; total nitrogen (mg N/l) by volumetric Figure Locations of the beaches investigated for recreational water quality on the Danube in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia, 2014 Bosnia and HercegovinaSERBIACroatiaHungary Palanka; 5: Apatin. The locations where water was sampled are marked in red and numbered from one to (HACH 2100N Laboratory Turbidimeter) and oxygen saturation by computing. According to the national regulation five classes of coastal recreational water by decreasing quality are defined (I, II, III, IV and V), whereby the first three classes (I-III) are considered adequate for human rec - reational needs, fish farming and drinking - after treat - ment [18,19]. The microbiological indicators, physical and chemical parameters for each class are described in Table 1. There is no national guideline value for tur - bidimetry in recreational water [18,19].Study of viral material present in the water Assessing the presence of viruses in water is not defined by the current national legislation, so it was performed according to internationally recognised methodology with minor modifications [29]. Briefly, 30L of river water was filtered with nanoceramic fil - ters (NanoCeram-VS Virus Sampler Filter Cartridges, Argonide Corp., US) allowing negatively-charged virus particles to be absorbed onto the positively-charged nanoceramic filters. Following elution with 500 mL of eluate was concentrated by organic floccula - tion whereby viral particles attached to beef extract proteins at pH 3.5 and were pelleted by centrifugation for 15min at 2,500 x g at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resus - pended in 15 mL of 0.15M phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The sample was further concentrated by ultrafiltration using Table 1 Values of microbiological indicators, physical and chemical parameters defining classes of coastal recreational water applicable to Serbia, 2014 Parameter UnitsGuideline values Class I Class II Class III Class IV Class V Faecal coliform concentration cfu/100 mL 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 >100,000 Total coliform concentration cfu/100 mL 500 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 >1,000,000 Intestinal enterococci concentration cfu/100 mL 200 400 4,000 40,000 > 40,000 Heterotrophic plate count concentration cfu/100 mL 500 10,000 100,000 750,000 pH - 6.5-8.5 Conductivity \u00b5Sv/cm<1,000 (or natural level)1,000 1,500 3,000 > 3,000 Dissolved oxygen mg O2/L8.5a (or natural level)7a5 4 < natural level)10 20 50 > 50 BOD5 mg O2/L2a (or natural level)5a7 25 > 25 Nitrate (NO3-N) mg N/L1a (or natural level)3a6 15 > mg N/L0.01 (or natural 0.12 0.30 Ammonium ion (NH4-N) mg N/L0.10a (or natural level)0.30a0.60 1.50 > 1.50 Total nitrogen (N) mg N/L1 (or natural level)2 8 15 > 15 Total phosphorus (P) mg P/L0.05 (or natural level)0.20a0.40 1 > 1 Orthophosphates (PO43-) mg P/L0.02 (or natural level)0.10a0.20 0.50 > 0.50 BOD5: biological oxygen demand after five days; cfu: colony forming unit; COD: chemical oxygen demand; NG: no guideline for this class. For a water sample to belong to a given class, all the parameter values in the corresponding column for this class have to be fulfilled. a Depends on the type and coastal water magnitude. Analysed samples are from the Danube, a river defined by national regulation as river Type I (i.e. large lowland river, with dominance of fine drifts); guideline values provided in Table 1 for Class I and II are valid for a Type I river [18,19].28 www.eurosurveillance.orgAmicon Ultra-15, 30K device (Milipore) to obtain 0.5 mL of sample. Viral nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) were isolated by Ribo Virus kit (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy), and analysed by real-time chain reaction using a real-time thermocycler Applied Biosystems 7500 (Applied Biosystems, US) as well as the follow - ing kits for human diagnostics: Italy). Statistics For data processing, the standard parametric and non - parametric statistical methods were used. Numerical data are presented through the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, while qualitative data are assessed by frequency of distribution. To check the normality of continuous data we used Shapiro-Wilk normality test, along with the normal-probability plots. Data of faecal coliforms were log 10 transformed to meet assumptions of normality, while transformation (squareroot and log 10) of data for total coliforms did not improve their normality. In accordance with the objectives of the analyses and nature of the data, Spearman's correla - tion coefficient, Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U and Student's t-test were used. Data of faecal coliforms were log transformed to meet assumptions of normal - ity for the Student's t-test. In all statistical analyses the presence of viruses was examined as a dependent vari - able, and coded as '1' to indicate absence of viruses and '2' to indicate presence of viruses. Results were considered statistically significant when the p value for all the applied models was <0.05 and the correspond - ing 95% confidence interval (95%CI) did not include 1.0 (Student's t -test). For all statistical analyses the statistical package SPSS (version 17), Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and Microsoft Visual Fox Pro were used. Results Chemical and microbiological findings In terms of microbiological parameters, the aver - age concentration of faecal from mL on Futog beach, while the average total coliform concentration was in the range of mL the same respec - tive locations (Table 2). For chemical analyses, the minimum average value of pH (7.99 \u00b1 0.08) and nitrite (0.02 mg nitrogen/ mL \u00b1 0.006) was found at Futog, while the minimum average value of nitrate (0.01 mg nitrogen/mL \u00b1 0.006) was at Backa Palanka. The highest of ammonium ion (0.46 mg nitrogen/mL \u00b1 0.29) was found at Begecka respectively (Table 2).Table 2 Description of key variablesa relevant to the investigation of Danube water quality at different locations, Vojvodina, Serbia, 2014 LocationFaecal coliform Only key variables from Table 1 were statistically analysed for the purpose of this study. Accordingly heterotrophic plate count and other physical and chemical parameters showed in Table 1 were not taken into further statistical consideration. b Because of the small number of water samples where intestinal enterococci were detected, these were not taken into consideration for further statistics. c Value determined in only one of 18 samples. d Average value calculated according to number of intestinal enterococci determined in two of 18 samples.29 www.eurosurveillance.orgClassification of the coastal recreation water samples Taking into account parameters defined by national law - the so called 'chemical and ecological status' for rec - reational waters, 76 of a total of 90 samples analysed at all locations (84%) complied to the NGV for recrea - tional use (Table 3). Considering water class distribution at each beach, full compliance with NGV for recreational use over the whole study period was only observed for Backa Palanka, with all 18 water samples taken at this loca - tion corresponding to class II or III (2 samples of class II and 16 of class III). Of the 18 water samples collected respectively at the other beaches, 13 were of class II or III at Apatin, 12 at Begecka jama, 16 at Strand and 17 at Futog (Table 3). One class IV sample was found at Futog, two at Strand and three at Begecka jama (Table 3). Three water sam - ples corresponding to class V were detected at Begecka jama and five at Apatin.Presence of viral material in the water and relationship with water quality parameters Enteroviruses were not detected in any of the samples of recreational water analysed, while adenoviruses and rotaviruses were respectively found in 60 (67%) and 31 (34%) samples of the total 90 (Table 3). Adenoviruses were predominantly present in water collected at Backa Palanka beach (17 of 18 samples), where all analysed samples were in accordance with NGV (Table 3). Rotaviruses were mostly found on the beaches of Strand in Novi Sad and Apatin (9 and 7 samples respectively) where 16 and 13 samples com - plied to the NGV respectively. An analysis by Spearman's correlation showed that regardless of the species, the presence of viral mate - rial (i.e. adenoviruses and rotaviruses, taken together), was negatively correlated with the surface water tem - perature (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with nitrite concentration (p < 0.05) (Table 4). There was no statisti - cally significant relationship to the class distribution of recreational water samples, nor to the concentration of total coliforms and faecal coliforms.

None of the water samples were defined as Class I. a These totals are the number of samples of a certain category of water quality (defined as water class, or as suitable/unsuitable for recreational use) at each location. Adding up the number of samples testing positive for adenoviruses with the number of samples testing positive for rotaviruses in each category, does not necessarily yield the totals presented, because some individual samples could test positive for both adenovirus and rotavirus. Moreover, some samples included in the total could be negative for both types of viruses.30 www.eurosurveillance.orgWhen viral species were analysed separately, the pres - ence of rotavirus material was significantly negatively correlated with surface water and air temperatures (p < 0.01 for both parameters). No significant relation - ship to class distribution was observed. Like for rotavirus, presence of adenovirus material (Table 4) was significantly negatively correlated with temperature of surface water (p < 0.01). Water pH value was negatively correlated (p < 0.05). A positive cor - relation was obtained between presence of adenovi - rus material and concentrations of faecal coliforms (p < 0.05) and total coliforms (p < 0.01), as well as con - centration of nitrate (p < 0.01) and turbidity (p < 0.01). For class distribution, a negative correlation was found (r o = -0.355, p < 0.001). The relationship between adenoviruses and coliforms in the water as well as adenoviruses and water class were further explored with other statistical tests. Samples testing positive for adenovirus material were more frequently found when concentrations of total coliforms (Mann-Whitney U test; p = 0.002) and faecal coliforms ( t test, p = 0.017) were elevated, i.e. 100,000 cfu/100 mL and 10,000 cfu/100 mL respectively (Table 5). In terms of the correlation between adenoviruses and class, assessment using the Fisher exact test indi - cated that even when the water samples corresponded to class I-III (n=76 samples), adenoviruses were detected in 75% of samples (n=57) in relation to 25% of samples(n=19), where adenoviruses were not detected (p = 0.000).Discussion In this study, we found that 76 of a total of 90 water samples collected at popular beaches on the Danube in Vojvodina during the summer 2014 complied the NGV for recreational use. Further analyses beyond the requirements defined by current legislation how - ever confirm the presence of adenovirus and rotavi - rus genetic material respectively in 60 and 31 of the 90 obtained water samples. Although data on viruses in environmental water are scarce for Serbia, a recent report also relates detection of adeno- and/or norovi - rus material in surface waters of Vojvodina province, at 21 of 30 analysed locations [30]. In that report how - ever, only two of the locations investigated were public beaches and sampling was done only once in the bath - ing season. Our study in contrast was designed to seek viral material in the Danube at five different popular beach locations, throughout the bathing season. In addition to checking for the presence of viral mate - rial in the water, we conducted in parallel the routine law-required analyses for monitoring water quality. Results suggest faecal contamination of recreational waters in the Danube at all investigated locations, with data not differing significantly from those obtained in previous years [31]. A statistically significant positive correlation was moreover obtained between adenovi - rus material in the Danube and both the nitrate concen - tration and turbidity of the water, which are parameters related to faecal contamination. Corroborating these results, adenovirus genetic material was also signifi - cantly positively correlated with concentrations of total coliforms and faecal coliforms. The results found here are in agreement with those of a large European study (EU FP6 Project VIROBATHE study) [13], where significant trends were observed Table 4 Spearman rank correlation of microbiological indicators, physical and chemical parameters, water samples status defined as classes and the presence of adenoviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses and rotaviruses taken together, Vojvodina, Serbia, 2014 Microbiological indicators/ physical and chemical parameters of water samples status of coastal recreational waterAdenovirus RotavirusAdenovirus and Temperature of water on site -0.451b-0.311b-0.210a Class -0.355b-0.080 -0.077 a Spearman's correlation statistically significant at the level p < 0.05. b Spearman's correlation statistically significant at the level p < 0.01.31 www.eurosurveillance.orgbetween categories of increasing faecal indicator organism coli , intestinal enterococci and somatic coliphage) and increasing pro - portions of human adenovirus-positive results in fresh - water. An explanation for the results, may lie in the fact that human adenovirus has been detected at high con - centration in faeces of infected individuals (10 6 per g of stool) [32]. Quantitative analyses of adenovirus genetic material in European recreational waters in 2010 found 3.2 x 10 2 genomic copies of adenovirus per 100 mL water on average [33], while in another study of the EU FP6 Project VIROBATHE, Wyn-Jones et al. [12] detected ade - noviruses in 36% of the samples that they collected in diverse freshwater and marine sites in Europe. The finding that 60 of 90 (67%) water samples collected in our study were contaminated with adenovirus material, is likely attributable to the absence of adequate urban wastewater treatment in Serbia. While it is clear that the only long-term and comprehensive solution to this problem would be a coordinated action of all stakehold - ers to prevent the contamination of surface waters, the elimination of raw sewage entering rivers may require a number of important measures (e.g. management and improvement of sewerage networks and treatment plants, efforts to reduce spills of sewage during rainfall events by storm tanks, separation of surface and foul infrastructure, sustainable urban drainage schemes) and may not be imminent. Therefore a more extensive control of bathing waters may be considered. Indeed, viral infectivity doses for enteric viruses are very low (10-100 virions) and such viruses persist longer (up to 120 days in freshwater) and are more resistant than enterobacteria to some environmental factors (UV radi - ation, chemicals) [8].The presence of viral material in freshwater is moreover not limited to Serbia [12,33-36], and in some EU Member States such as Ireland, raw sewage entering environ - mental water still represents a problem [37]. In this context, an adequate viral indicator for water, together with surveillance of waterborne virus infections, may generally contribute to a more comprehensive hazard assessment for users of this water. In some countries, such as the US, a special surveillance system for water - borne diseases has been put in place [38,39]. Our study additionally suggests that despite a correla - tion between adenovirus material and coliforms, bacte - rial analyses alone cannot always predict the presence of viral material in the water. Even when water sam - ples were found to be suitable for recreational use, 75% of these samples tested positive for adenovirus genetic material. An explanation for this may lie in the fact that adenoviruses have a double stranded DNA genome, which is more sturdy and resistant to vari - ous environmental factors than e.g. RNA, which forms the base of rotaviruses' genome. Human adenoviruses are also known to persist longer in the environment than bacterial indicators of faecal contamination and are frequently the most abundant type of virus in sur - face waters [32]. Because infections with adenovirus may produce serious, even lethal diseases especially in immunocompromised persons, children and elderly [32], monitoring such viruses in recreational water may be of importance. It should be noted, that the presence of viral material in this study was determined by PCR and does not neces - sarily mean the presence of infective virus, since PCR detects both non-infective and infective viral genetic material. However, according to the literature data on the survival of adenoviral particles in the environment [40,41] a risk for recreational use could possibly exist. Table 5 Association between the presence of adenovirus, class distribution and the number of faecal coliforms and total coliforms concentration in analysed recreational samples, Vojvodina, Serbia, 2014 Detection of adenovirusesFisher's exact test Water samples classesIndependent samples t test Log10 of faecal coliformsMann-Whitney U (79) 0.000303.08 0.39te = 2.218 df = 88 p = 0.017g30 999 - 0.002 (75) for adenovirus; SD: standard deviation. a According to national regulations the first three classes (I-III) allows using the coastal water for human recreational needs including for fish farming and, after adequate treatment, for drinking. b 10x, where X is the mean of log10 transformed values. c Z value of Mann-Whitney U test. d p significant (2-tailed). e t value of independent samples t test. f Equal variances not assumed (tested with Levine's test for variance). g Significant with 95% confidence interval: -0.47 to -0.04.32 www.eurosurveillance.orgIn order to establish the presence of infective viral par - ticles, more research using cell culture is needed. In contrast to adenovirus, rotavirus material was pre - sent in much lower proportions of our samples (31 samples with rotavirus vs 60 with adenovirus), and this corroborates with the findings of other authors who did similar testing and found rotaviruses much less pre - sent than adenoviruses in surface water contaminated with sewage [42]. Although it is difficult to compare the results from different parts of the world, it might be speculated that this result is due to the lower occur - rence of such viruses in the human population, as well as their structure [11]. Having RNA as genetic material might make rotaviruses more vulnerable to environ - mental conditions, as shown here by a significant cor - relation between rotavirus material presence and air and water temperature. Due to their lower occurrence, it may be concluded that, although of importance [43], rotaviruses would likely not be suitable candidates as a water viral indicator. Taken together, our data support the need for more measures to avoid faecal contamination of the Danube, and provide more evidence for the idea of having a viral indicator for recreational waters in order to fully assess public health safety. Such an indicator would be of par - ticular importance in regions like Vojvodina (and even in the whole of Serbia), where urban wastewater treat - ment is not adequate.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30193 Article submitted on 14 July 2015 / accepted on 14 April 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 An approach is proposed for environmental surveil - lance of poliovirus by concentrating sewage sam - ples with tangential flow filtration (TFF) followed by deep sequencing of viral RNA. Subsequent to test - ing the method with samples from Finland, samples from Pakistan, a country endemic for poliovirus, were investigated. Genomic sequencing was either per - formed directly, for unbiased identification of viruses regardless of their ability to grow in cell cultures, or after virus enrichment by cell culture or immunopre - cipitation. Bioinformatics enabled separation and determination of individual consensus sequences. Overall, deep sequencing of the entire viral population identified polioviruses, non-polio enteroviruses, and other viruses. In Pakistani sewage samples, adeno-associated virus, unable to replicate autonomously in cell cultures, was the most abundant human virus. The presence of recombinants of wild polioviruses of serotype 1 (WPV1) was also inferred, whereby cur - rently circulating WPV1 of south-Asian (SOAS) line - age comprised two sub-lineages depending on their non-capsid region origin. Complete genome analyses additionally identified point mutants and intertypic recombinants between attenuated Sabin strains in the Pakistani samples, and in one Finnish sample. The approach could allow rapid environmental surveil - lance of viruses causing human infections. It creates a permanent digital repository of the entire virome potentially useful for retrospective screening of future discovered viruses. Introduction Surveillance for the presence of pathogenic viruses is important for development of rational disease con - trol strategies. It is an integral part of the worldwide campaign to stop the transmission of wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV). The campaign uses oral polio vaccine (OPV) made from attenuated strains of three serotypes of poliovirus that can mutate and become virulent VDPVs. The progress of the cam - paign is monitored by detecting cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) followed by virological confirmation by serological methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and partial nucleotide (nt) sequencing [1-3]. AFP has infectious and non-infectious causes and therefore polio surveillance involves processing of a large num - ber of samples, most of which do not contain poliovi - rus. An extensive laboratory network is involved in this activity, making it labour-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. The sensitivity of AFP surveillance is inherently lim - ited because in a fully susceptible population only a small fraction of infections leads to AFP. In immu - nised communities, infection to paralysis ratio is even higher, allowing polioviruses causing AFP to transmit silently [4,5]. Confirmation that poliovirus circulation has stopped must be based on detection of poliovirus itself rather than its clinical manifestations. Poliovirus could be consistently isolated from the environment in regions with no recorded cases of paralytic polio [2,4,6]. Highly evolved VDPVs that may have been excreted by unidentified chronically infected individu - als have also been found [7-9]. Current sewage concentration methods are based on two-phase separation [10-12], absorption onto mem - brane filters [13], and other protocols [14]. While some of these allow only a qualitative characterisation of viruses present in a sample, others, such as two-phase separation can also provide quantitative data. The per - formance of these methods is however affected by sam - ple pH and the presence of different impurities [15,16]. Traditional size-selective ultrafiltration is impractical because filters are rapidly blocked by impurities. In contrast, devices in which liquid moves tangentially 35 www.eurosurveillance.orgto the filter surface (tangential flow filtration, TFF) pre - vent the significant reduction of flow rates. TFF was successfully used for concentration of viruses, bacte - ria, and parasites from environmental samples [17-19]. Conventional protocols for the identification of polio - viruses in sewage concentrates include cultivation in cell cultures susceptible to poliovirus [12,20], followed by identification using strain-specific PCR and partial sequencing of their genomes [21]. The process is quite laborious and is often complicated by the presence of a mixture of viruses. Massively parallel or deep sequenc - ing generates vast amounts of sequence information and is often used for the analysis of heterogeneous viral populations and metagenomic studies. Metagenomics have many applications in the environmental sciences [22-24] and were also successfully used for the identi - fication of respiratory viruses in clinical samples [25]. Here we explore the utility deep sequencing for the analysis of TFF-concentrated environmental samples. Methods Tangential flow ultrafiltration of sewage samples 0.5 L sewage samples were collected in 2013 in the Helsinki region of Finland (two samples) and Islamabad, Pakistan (eight samples). They were cen - trifuged for 10 min at 3,000 g resulting in a solid and liquid fraction. The solid (sludge) fraction was Figure 1 Depth of sequencing coverage and SimPlot analysis of recovered sequences generated by analysis of whole RNA libraries derived from two cell cultures, each infected with a different sewage sample collected in the Helsinki region, Finland, 2013 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000A.

The supernatant was combined with the pre - viously obtained liquid fraction and filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m MidiKros TFF filter (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) followed by rinsing the filter with 10 mL of 25% beef extract. In some cases liquid and solid (i.e. supernatant obtained from elu - tion with beef extract) fractions were processed sepa - rately. Next, virus concentration was performed using an automated Spectrum Laboratories KrosFlo Research IIi TFF system and 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off MidiKros filters at 9 psi trans-membrane pressure and 60 mL/min flow rate to the final volume of ca 5 mL (the void volume of the TFF system). The volume was further reduced to 0.5-0.8 mL by manually operating two 5-mL syringes attached to TFF cartridge disconnected from the TFF system. Isolation of viruses in cell cultures Sewage concentrates were diluted in Dulbecco minimal essential medium (DMEM) to a final volume of 3 mL and inoculated into cultures of rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C for 1-7 days until cytopathic effect (CPE) developed. The harvest from RD cultures was inoculated into L20B cell cultures (mouse L cells expressing human poliovi - rus receptor CD155) to selectively amplify polioviruses according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pro - tocol [13]. Culture media from CPE-positive L20B cells and CPE-positive RD cells were used for subsequent real-time PCR analysis and/or deep sequencing.Detection of polio and enteroviruses in sewage concentrates by real-time PCR RNA was isolated from samples prepared by different procedures described above using NucleoSpin RNA Virus F kit (Clontech Inc., Mountain View, CA) and used for real-time PCR with strain-specific primers [25]. All PCR duplicate on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The same RNA sam - ples were also used for deep sequencing. Titration of Sabin 1 poliovirus in spiked sewage samples 0.5 mL of 2x105 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of Sabin 1 poliovirus diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to 0.5 L of poliovirus-free sewage sample and incubated for 1 hour. Identical 0.5 mL virus sample served as a control. Virus titres were deter - mined in Hep2C cells by terminal dilutions method according to WHO recommendations [13]. Virus recov - ery was evaluated as a percentage of infectious virus relative to the control unspiked sample. Poliovirus enrichment ruses of serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were used for immuno - precipitation. Five L of stock solution containing 0.5 g rabbit IgG was added to 0.5 mL of TFF-concentrated sewage and incubated for 3 hours on a rocker. Ten L of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) washed with PBS were added to the TFF concentrate and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours on a rocker. Magnetic beads were then washed with DMEM and PBS and Figure 2 Comparison of sequence diversity profiles in two sewage samples with heterogeneous and homogeneous viral populations, Finland 2013 020406080100 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000020406080100 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000A.

The procedure was performed separately for each serotype of poliovirus. Isothermal amplification using REPLI-g WTA single cell kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was performed according to the manu - facturer's protocol. Deep sequencing RNA isolated from samples prepared by different procedures described above was used for total RNA Illumina library preparation using NEB NEXT Ultra RNA library kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). The quality of libraries was assessed using the qPCR Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or MiSeq to generate 100 to 300 nt long paired-end reads. In some experiments, samples were sequenced in multiplex format (up to eight samples per sequenc - ing lane) using unique index primers (barcodes).

The mapping procedure involved k-mer guided Smith-Waterman alignment that will be described elsewhere. Profiles of sequence heterogeneity were computed, and consensus sequences were built by identifying the most frequent nts at each genomic position. In cases where significant sequence heterogeneity was detected, sequence reads were separated into discrete sub-populations using the following algorithm. Sequence reads mapped against aligned reference genomes were segregated into discrete subsets by cluster analysis performed in overlapping 'windows' of 50-100 nt cov - ering the entire genome ('sliding window' method). The identity of each species defined in a particular window was matched with similar information obtained for the adjacent overlapping window, and propagated along the entire genome. Consensus sequences were com - puted for each subset of sequence reads as described above. Unique sequences of wild type polioviruses determined in this study were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KU161395-KU161399). Results Concentration of sewage samples by tangential flow filtration and recovery of viruses The entire concentration procedure of 0.5 L sewage samples took ca 2 hours. Final sewage concentrates in 0.5-0.8 mL volume were used for RNA isolation (see above) or inoculation into cell cultures. Analysis by the standard WHO procedure using strain- specific PCR [21] had previously shown that a sewage sample hereby named 'F1' and collected in Finland did not contain poliovirus, while another sample 'F2', from the same country, was positive for Sabin 2 poliovirus. To determine the efficiency of the TFF protocol, the F1 sample was spiked with 10 5 CCID50 of Sabin 1 poliovi - rus. The recovery of spiked poliovirus in the combined sludge/supernatant fraction was 62%, 84%, and 93% in three independent experiments. Sensitivity determined in spiking experiments may dif - fer from the sensitivity of virus detection in real sew - age samples. Therefore to validate the concentration method, another sewage sample F2 from Finland which was demonstrated to contain Sabin 2 poliovirus was processed by the TFF protocol. The concentrates of F1 (poliovirus-free) and F2 were used to infect RD and then L20B cell cultures. RD cultures were virus positive for both samples, while only F2 induced CPE in L20B cells. Deep sequencing of cell culture-grown viruses Whole-RNA Illumina libraries prepared from super - natants of RD and L20B cultures infected with F1 and F2 concentrates were deep-sequenced using Illumina Hiseq2000. Individual sequence reads were aligned to genomic sequences of 744 representative enterovi - ruses. Figures 1A and 1B show the depth of sequencing coverage along the viral genome in forward and reverse orientations. The most prevalent nt at each genomic position was considered to represent the consensus, and all others were assumed to be single nt polymor - phisms (SNP). Consensuses contained uninterrupted open reading frames coding for 2,196 and 2,208 amino acids for F1 and F2 samples. Their comparison with references and SimPlot analysis revealed that the closest relative of the virus present in the F1 sample was echovirus 11 with 82% similarity in the P1 region (Figure 1C). This level of homology does not allow us to unambiguously identify the serotype of this virus. The virus from the F2 sample was a recombinant of Sabin 2 and Sabin 3 viruses with the crossover at the boundary between regions coding for 3C protease and 3D polymerase (nt 5,959-5,981; Figure 1D). The distal part of the genome was identical to the Sabin 3 virus, while the proximal part differed from the Sabin 2 virus at six nt positions (two in 5'-untranslated region (UTR), two in viral protein VP2, one in VP1, and one in 2A pro - tein). This indicates that this was a minimally evolved vaccine poliovirus, however, it contained mutations at both sites associated with neurovirulence (A 481G in 5'-UTR and Thr143His in VP1). Sequences determined by the above procedure repre - sent consensuses of the majority component. Sequence heterogeneity profiles revealed that sewage sample F2 contained ca 16% of one or more viruses distinct from the predominant Sabin 2/3 recombinant (Figure 2A). For comparison, Figure 2B shows an example of the Table 2 Relative abundance of the most prevalent RNA viruses present in a sewage sample collected in Pakistan, 2013 VirusProportions of reads among all reads that match the sequence of a given virus (%) Tomato mosaic virus 41.20 Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus 26.10 Tobacco mild green mosaic virus 14.20 Pepper mild mottle virus 6.70 Tobacco mosaic virus 6.00 Youcai mosaic virus 2.00 Tomato mottle mosaic virus isolate MX5 1.10 Adeno-associated virus - 2 0.50 Melon necrotic spot virus 0.30 Poliovirus 0.20 Other 1.5041 www.eurosurveillance.orgSNP profile of a relatively homogeneous viral sample. To separate viruses present in the mixture, individual sequence reads mapped on the aligned reference dataset were subjected to cluster analysis in a 'sliding window' format (in a series of overlapping 50-100 nt-long sections). Sequence reads separated by this pro - cedure were assembled into full-genome consensus sequences. The majority species in F2 samples grown in L20B cells was identical to Sabin 2/3 recombinant determined by building the overall consensus. The minority species in F2 sample was close to echovirus 11 virus with ca 10% differences from the virus identi - fied in F1 sample (Figure 3). Analysis of sewage samples from polio-endemic environment The above results established the feasibility of using TFF concentration and deep sequencing for characteris - ing multiple viruses present in viral populations. Next, the utility of this approach for surveillance in a coun - try that is still endemic for poliovirus was explored. Eight sewage samples collected in Pakistan were pro - cessed as described above, concentrates were inocu - lated into RD and L20B cultures, and harvested viruses were deep-sequenced. Multiple enteroviruses present in most samples were separated bioinformatically as described above. Table 1 lists discrete viruses found in these samples. We found viruses that were very close to all three Sabin vaccine strains, as well as a number of wild type 1 polioviruses. In some samples, there were also sequences related to non-polio enterovi - ruses, predominantly of species B (coxsackievirus B1, B3, and B5). The approach used in this work to reconstruct genomic sequences resulted in complete or near complete genomes (in some cases missing 1-10 nt at the ends, due to low sequencing coverage of the terminal regions). It produced more phylogenetic and molecular-epidemi - ological information than would be available based on VP1 sequencing alone. For instance, some vaccine derivatives were found to be recombinants of two sero - types of Sabin virus, and the crossover point was easily identified by SimPlot analysis (Figure 4A,4C). Similarly, wild type 1 of south-Asian (SOAS) lineage currently prevalent in Pakistan and Afghanistan contained two sub-lineages that could be distinguished by a recom - bination event at the boundary between the P1 and P2 regions (Figure 4B,4D). Metagenomic approach TFF concentration followed by deep sequencing of viruses isolated in cell culture represents an improve - ment over the conventional protocol by providing sig - nificantly more information in a much shorter time. However, it still depends on the ability of viruses to grow in cell culture, potentially biasing the result. A totally agnostic approach based on the direct sequenc - ing of all RNA present in sewage concentrates could produce a more complete picture. Whole-RNA Illumina libraries were prepared directly from TFF concentrates of sewage collected in Pakistan and deep sequenced. Sequence reads were aligned to reference sequences of 5,301 full length viral genomes belonging to all major groups of viruses (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Approximately 5-8% of all sequence reads could be aligned to sequences in the viral database, and most hits belonged to plant viruses (Table 2). Separation of sequences of plant viruses into discrete subpopulations by the algorithm described above revealed the presence of full length genomes of several different viruses, including tomato mosaic Table 3 Relative proportion of sequence reads matching the most abundant viruses detected in a sewage sample before and after enrichment by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against poliovirus Virus found before enrichment Per centaVirus found after enrichment Per centa Tomato mosaic virus 41.20 Poliovirus 8.90 Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus 26.10 Tobacco mild green mosaic virus 8.30 Tobacco mild green mosaic virus 14.20 Circovirus-like genome RW-C 6.70 Pepper mild mottle virus 6.70 Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus 4.30 Tobacco mosaic virus 6.00 Tobacco mosaic virus 2.70 Youcai mosaic virus Cotesia Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 0.10 Clostridium phage phiMMP04 1.50 Other 0.80 Other 54.50 a The percentages represent the proportions of reads among all reads that match the sequence of a given virus.42 www.eurosurveillance.orgvirus, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, tobacco mild green mosaic virus, pepper mild mottle virus, tobacco mosaic virus, Youcai mosaic virus, and tomato mottle virus (Table 2). Surprisingly, the most represented of all animal viruses was adeno-associated virus (AAV, 0.5% of all reads) fol - lowed by poliovirus (0.2%). Mapping of sequence reads by alignment to sequences in reference databases of individual virus families that produced a substan - tial number of hits during the preliminary screening, allowed the assembly of full-genome sequences of viruses present in the sample. Sequence reads aligned to sequences in the database containing 18 reference AAV sequences assembled into a full-length genome of 4,675 nt containing two open reading frames corre - sponding to the non-structural and the capsid proteins of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it was 97.3% similar to AAV-2. A similar analysis performed for astroviruses revealed the presence of human astrovi - rus 4, Aichi virus 1, human parechovirus 1, as well as several other mammalian RNA and DNA viruses (data not shown). Enrichment of tangential flow filtration- concentrated sewage by immunoprecipitation The number of hits for most other groups of viruses was insufficient to generate good coverage allowing unambiguous assembly of complete viral genomes or reliable heterogeneity analysis. To enable a more sen - sitive search for specific viruses, polioviruses present in TFF concentrates were enriched by immunoprecipi - tation. TFF-concentrated sewage samples were incu - bated with biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-polio IgG and the virus was captured using streptavidin-coated microbeads. Complementary DNA (cDNA) from these samples was isothermally amplified using a uniform sequence-independent REPLI-g system. Table 3 shows the specificity of sequence reads from one sewage sample before and after the enrichment that resulted in poliovirus sequences becoming the predominant spe - cies. The consensus sequence assembled from these sequence reads was shown by phylogenetic analysis to be of SOAS WPV1 identical to the virus isolated from the same sewage sample in cell culture. Discussion This communication demonstrates that TFF can effec - tively concentrate viruses present in sewage by reducing the volume from ca 500 mL to ca 1 mL in approximately 2 hours. Unlike the conventional proto - cols [10,12,21] it does not require large volumes of toxic and noxious organic solvents, removes most impurities including PCR inhibitors, and is more amenable to high-throughput implementation. Traditionally, identification of viruses in sewage con - centrates is performed by using selective cell cultures such as mouse L20B cells that express human poliovi - rus receptor [20], followed by strain-specific PCR and partial nt sequencing [10,12,21]. The improvements proposed here include (i) the use of deep sequencing for virus identification, and (ii) direct metagenomic analysis of sewage concentrates allowing viruses to be identified without cell cultures. The main advantage of deep sequencing is that it is a universal procedure that detects multiple viruses present in mixtures, and gen - erates complete or near-complete genome sequences that contain more - tion partial sequencing. Thus several vaccine-related and wild type poliovi - ruses identified in this study were found to be inter - typic recombinants. Finding the recombinant Sabin 2/3 poliovirus in sewage from Finland was unexpected because this country does not use oral polio vaccine (OPV). Even though this 'young' vaccine-derivative contained only six mutations compared with Sabin 2, two of them were previously linked to neurovirulent reversion. Whole genome analysis of wild polioviruses revealed that currently circulating strains in Pakistan belong to at least two sub-lineages distinguished by different origins of their P2-P3 region (Figure 4B,4D). Most samples contained more than one virus, includ - ing non-polio enteroviruses, predominantly of species B, similar to coxsackievirus B1, B3, B5, and some echo - viruses. However, since no sufficiently close match was found in the published database, their serotype iden - tity could not be established unambiguously. Future expansion of the sequence database could enable more accurate identification. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that this approach could be also used for the surveillance of all non-polio enteroviruses. Deep-sequencing of the entire RNA content of sewage concentrates also revealed the prevalence of multi - ple plant viruses, consistent with previous studies of human stool samples [26]. Bioinformatic separation of deep-sequence reads belonging to different viruses allowed their assembly into several full-length genomes that were then identified by phylogenetic analysis. Surprisingly, the most prevalent animal virus in sewage from Pakistan was AAV-2. It has never been associated with any known pathology, and cannot grow in cell cultures without a helper adenovirus [27]. The epide - miology of this virus is unknown, and this observation could help to identify its niche in nature. Additional animal viruses were detected in uncultivated sewage concentrates collected in Pakistan, and their complete genomes sequenced. They included wild and attenu - ated polioviruses and other enteroviruses described in this paper, as well as cosaviruses, astroviruses, pare - choviruses, kobuvirus (Aichi), Saffold virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, cricket paralysis virus, and others that were not included in this communication and will be described elsewhere. The most intriguing aspect of this study is the pos - sibility of a direct metagenomic approach for routine surveillance, bypassing the need for viral cell cultures. The use of this 'agnostic' metagenomic approach 43 www.eurosurveillance.orgadditionally raises an interesting possibility of future retrospective search for viruses unknown at the time of sample collection by aligning sequences determined in the past to reference sequences of newly discovered viruses. Therefore, the deep sequence data could serve as a digital repository of the virome present in sewage samples without the need to preserve their viability or biocontainment. Depending on the sewage sample, a certain num - ber of viruses were represented by a small number of sequence reads. Although these could have poten - tially resulted from contamination, such as carryover of a small amount of genetic material from previous sequencing runs in the laboratory, we do not believe that findings described in this report resulted from such carryover. Indeed for the viral sequences that could be reconstructed, we do not work with the corre - sponding viruses in our laboratory. Moreover, bleach - ing between sequencing runs, which helps to eliminate this problem, was regularly performed. Low number of reads of certain viruses, however make the depth of the sequencing coverage insuffi - cient for reliable assembly of their complete genomes. Enrichment of polioviruses from sewage concentrates by immunoprecipitation resulted in poliovirus-specific sequence reads becoming predominant in uncultivated sewage concentrates, preserving the remaining mate - rial for further screening for other viruses. As a result, the complete genome of wild type 1 poliovirus was assembled and was found to match the sequence of the virus of the SOAS lineage that was identified in this sample by the cell culture method. In conclusion, the approach described in this paper can provide an effective alternative to current protocols used for environmental surveillance for wild poliovi - ruses and VDPV, other non-polio enteroviruses, as well as viruses of other families. Most countries in Europe have switched to the exclusive use of Inactivated Polio Vaccines (IPV). Good protection from paralysis that it induces combined with inadequate intestinal immunity [28] allows viruses to spread silently, which makes the traditional AFP surveillance less effective. Therefore environmental surveillance using metagen - omic approach in combination with TFF or other improved sewage concentration methods could be particularly useful in Europe and other countries that have switched to the use of IPV. Rapidly declining cost of deep sequencing makes this approach cost-effective compared with the conventional sequencing meth - ods. It could significantly shorten the time needed for the identification of pathogenic viruses in the envi - ronment, allowing for a much faster deployment of countermeasures.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.15.30197 Article submitted on 13 April 2015 / accepted on 22 January 2016 / published on 14 April 2016 Vibrio cholerae non-O1 serogroup (VCNO) bacteraemia is a severe condition with a high case-fatality rate. We report three cases diagnosed in the Netherlands, identified during a national microbiological congress, and provide a literature review on VCNO bacteraemia. A search strategy including synonyms for 'VCNO' and 'bacteraemia' was applied to PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and Embase databases. The three cases were reported in elderly male patients after fish con - sumption and/or surface water contact. The literature search yielded 82 case reports on 90 cases and six case series. Thirty case reports were from Asia (30/90; 33%), concerned males (67/90; 74%), and around one third (38/90; 42%) involved a history of alcohol abuse and/or liver cirrhosis The presenting symptom often was gastroenteritis (47/90; 52%) which occurred after seafood consumption in 32% of the cases (15/47).Aside from the most frequent symptom being fever, results of case series concurred with these findings. Published cases also included rare presentations e.g. endophthalmitis and neonatal meningitis. Based on the limited data available, cephalosporins seemed the most effective treatment. Although mainly reported in Asia, VCNO bacteraemia occurs worldwide. While some risk factors for VCNO were identified in this study, the source of infection remains often unclear. Clinical presentation may vary greatly and therefore a quick microbiological diagnosis is indispensable. Introduction The genus Vibrio is one of the six members of the Vibrionaceae family and includes ten species patho - genic to humans. Probably the most well-known spe - cies is Vibrio cholerae. Currently, there are over 130 known serogroups based on the presence of somatic O antigens [1,2]. Serogroup O1 and to a lesser O139, is notorious for cholera outbreaks of dysenteric diarrhoea due to toxin co-regulated pilus mostly confined tract [1]. In contrast, V. cholerae non-O1 (VCNO) i.e. all sero - groups except O1, rarely causes cholera-like outbreaks in form of mild diarrhoea due to toxin-producing VCNO strains but can cause severe extra intestinal infections such as wound infections and bacteraemia [3,4]. Cases of VCNO bacteraemia are reported in various countries and known risk factors are liver disease/cirrhosis and immunosuppression/immunocompromising condi - tions [1,3,4]. Sources of infection include seafood and contaminated water [5]. In the Netherlands, VCNO has indeed been isolated from recreational surface water (fresh and brackish) and sporadically from livestock [5,6]. In contrast, a Dutch study from 2010 showed that none of the examined shellfish tested positive for V. cholerae [7]. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobic Gram-negative curved comma-shaped motile bacillus. It can be iso - lated from blood by using standard culture media such as blood agar [1]. Biochemical properties of this organ - ism include catalase positivity, oxidase positivity, sucrose fermentation and susceptibility for the vibri - ostatic compound O129. Identification methods are various and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 16S and target genes like toxR, ompW and sodB. The non-O1 serogroup can be distinguished from other serotypes by a lack of agglutination with O1-Ogawa and O1-Inaba antigen [1]. In 2013, a patient with a fulminant VCNO sepsis and extensive bullae on the lower extremities was admit - ted to the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). When searching for literature on VCNO sepsis to help 46 www.eurosurveillance.orgdetermine the source of infection and the optimal treatment strategy, we realised that the available liter - ature appeared to be limited to case reports and small case series. In order to provide evidence for clinicians and public health experts about VCNO bacteraemia we report on a series of three cases and summarise the available literature on VCNO bacteraemia. Methods Clinical case reports During the presentation of the LUMC case at the annual Dutch convention for medical microbiology, we inquired if any of the attending medical microbiologists was aware of additional cases of VCNO sepsis detected in the Netherlands. There is no mandatory notification for VCNO isolates in the Netherlands and VCNO sepsis is rare. Thus, retrieving VCNO sepsis cases detected in the Netherlands in another fashion was not feasible. Literature review In collaboration with an experienced information spe - cialist of the LUMC library, we formulated a search strategy including synonyms for ' V. cholera non-O1' and 'bacteraemia' and applied it to PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and Embase databases (Table 1). Articles published before 15 September 2014 were included. Additional articles were identified by check - ing the references of relevant articles and duplicates were excluded.Retrieved articles were screened based on title and abstract, and exclusion criteria were: Vibrio spp. other than V. cholerae non-O1, article not available through the journal's archive/the main author i.e. unanswered email after three months, in vitro data only, environ - mental samples only, no bacteraemia, no humans, limited clinical data, languages other than English or Dutch. No date limits were applied. Data of individual case reports were merged and dis - cussed as one patient group. Articles discussing case series were reported separately to prevent overlapping data. Extracted data included: patient demographics, medical history, risk factors i.e. exposure, clinical pres - entation, laboratory identification method, antimicro - bial susceptibility, toxin production, samples cultured aside from blood, treatment and clinical outcome. If antimicrobial resistance was reported for 10 cases or more, they were reported in this article. Results Clinical case reports In addition to the LUMC case, two additional cases were detected in different Dutch medical centres in 2006 and 2007. A relevant selection of the available data per case is presented; none of the isolates were tested for toxin production. All cases were men and above 50 years of age, with infections during the sum - mer season. Case 1 Case 1 was a man in his 50s, with a medical history of tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, marihuana and excessive alcohol use. One day prior to admission, he felt lethargic and developed a painful discoloration on his right ankle. Three days before hospital admission he had walked barefoot along the Dutch shoreline and ate a ready-made tuna salad. Upon admission at the emergency department (ED) he was hypothermic (34.1\u00b0C, norm: 36.5to37.5), blood pressure was 115 per minute to 100), O2 satura - tion was 90% without additional O2 (norm: 93 to 100). While in the ED he developed circulatory failure. There were no abnormalities on chest auscultation. Inspection of the lower extremities showed oedema, blue discoloration and large bullae on both lower extremities. The chest X-ray showed patchy bilateral abnormalities of which the differential diagnosis com - prised acute respiratory distress syndrome, bilateral pneumonia and pre-existing abnormalities after pul - monary tuberculosis. Analysis of arterial blood at admission showed severe metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation: pH 7.24 (norm: 7.35 to 7.45), pCO2 4.5 kPa (norm: 4.5 to 6.0), pO2 2.9 10.6 to 13.3), base to 2), O2 to 99), glucose 1.3 mmol/L (norm: 3.5 Figure 1 Flowchart with results from literature search for Vibrio cholera non-O1bacteraemia Initial search (N=318) Unique records title/abstract available (n=2)Limited clinical data (n=12) Not in English or Dutch (n=3) No human study (n=5)Included records through reference checking (N=2) Unique records (N=165) Articles included (N=88) Case reports (n=82) Case series (duplicates) (N=155)47 www.eurosurveillance.orgto 5.5), lactate 11.4 mmol/L (norm: 0.5 to 2.2). Blood analysis showed a leukopenia, a thrombopenia and elevated liver enzymes. Specifically relevant labora - tory results were: haemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 0-45), creatinine was normal. The putative diagnosis was septic shock due to deep skin infection. Empirical antimicrobial treatment with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and selective digestive decontamination with polymyxin E, tobramycin and amphotericin B, was initiated, and the patient was resuscitated, started on vasopressors and admitted to the intensive care unit. Necrotising fasciitis was excluded upon surgical exploration. As VCNO non-O139 was isolated from blood and bullae content on admission day 3, antimicrobial treatment was switched to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. On the eighth admis - sion day, the patient developed multi-organ failure (MOF). With the working diagnosis 'hospital acquired infection', gentamicin and flucloxacillin were added. The next day, blood cultures showed Candida albi - cans and before additional treatment was started the patient died from MOF and sepsis. At post-mortem examination C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, but no Vibrio spp. were cultured from several organs including lungs, spleen, liver and intestine.Microbiology findingsWithin 24 hours from presentation at the ED blood cul - tures and cultures of bullae content grew rod-shaped/curved Gram-negative bacteria which were oxidase-, katalase- and DNase-positive. MALDI-TOF analysis showed V. albensis with a score of 2.0 which corre - sponds with a secure identification on genus level and probable identification on species level (norm: 2.0 to 2.3). Additional biochemical testing (i.e. API 20E, Biomerieux) indicated V. cholerae . The microorganism did not agglutinate with O1-Ogawa or O1-Inaba anti - sera, was sensitive to the vibriostatic compound O/129 and was therefore labelled VCNO. This finding was con - firmed and supplemented i.e. non-O 139, by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM). In house susceptibility testing by disk diffusion showed ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole sensitivity. Cultures of the tuna salad packaging did not reveal any Vibrio spp. Case 2A man in his late 60s with a medical history of heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type II, a cholecystectomy and an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, presented to the ED with severe diarrhoea. Two weeks earlier, while on one of the Dutch islands, he suffered from severe diarrhoea for two days after hav - ing eaten raw herring. There was initial improvement, but the watery diarrhoea recurred and he consulted a general practitioner who referred him to hospital. There was no blood or mucus in his stool. He did not report any surface water contact. Upon hospital admission, the patient was mildly icteric and had dyspnoea (respiratory rate 29/minute; norm: 12 to 18), lowered O2 saturation of 91% without supple - mental oxygen. He was tachycardic (129/minute), blood pressure was slightly elevated (132/92 mmHg) and he had a temperature of 38 \u00b0C. Aside from abdominal dis - tention, physical examination of the abdomen, heart, lungs and skin on the extremities showed no abnor - malities. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed no abnormalities except steatosishepatis and liver cysts (4 cm in diameter). The electrocardiogram and abdomi - nal X-ray were normal. The chest X-ray revealed signs of congestive heart failure. Parameters of the arterial blood analysis were within normal range. Other laboratory findings at admission showed a mild leucocytosis of 14.0 x10 9/L (norm: 4 to 11) and Laboratory results 3.5 to 7.8), sodium 137 mmol/L (norm: 135 to 145), potassium 3.4 mmol/L (norm: 3.5 to 5.0), creatinine 60 \u00b5mol/L (norm: 50 to 110), urea 2.5 7.5), LDH \u00b5mol/L (norm: 0 to 17), bilirubin direct 66 \u00b5mol/L Figure 2 Cases of with Vibrio cholerae non-O1bacteraemia reported annually in Europe and worldwide, (n=172 including case reports and case series) Num ber of cases Year051015202530 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Worldwide Europe48 www.eurosurveillance.orgTable 1 Literature search strategy for OR MeSH: medical subject headings; TS: title/summary. a No additional records were retrieved through searching the Medline database after searching the PubMed database.49 www.eurosurveillance.org(norm: 0 to 5), amylase 12 U/L (norm: 0 to 100), lipase 15 0 to 70) and lactate 2.3 mmol/L (norm: 0 to 1.8). The diagnosis was sepsis and after obtaining blood cultures, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and gentamicin was initiated according to the local sepsis treatment protocol. On the second admission day, the Gram-negative rod was isolated and sus - pected to be Salmonella spp. Treatment was switched to co-trimoxazole. Later that day, as the isolate tested oxidase-positive, the working diagnosis was changed to Pseudomonas spp. and treatment was switched to ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin was continued after the identification of V. cholerae . The patient recovered fully, was discharged after five days with oral cipro - floxacin, and returned to his island holiday. Microbiology findings One day after hospital admission, blood cultures became positive with Gram-negative rods, later iden - tified as V. cholerae (Phoenix Automated Microbiology System, BD diagnostics and API E, Biomerieux). The isolate was sent to the RIVM and the biochemical pro - file, fatty acid analysis 16S rDNA PCR showed V. non-O139. Stool Vibrio spp..

Case 3 A man in his early 70s presented at the ED with general malaise, dizziness, decreased appetite, coughing and dyspnoea that had been lasting for one week. Relevant medical history comprised heart failure and a hepato - jejunostomy for chronic cholangitis more than a dec - ade before presentation. He had not been travelling or swimming, but habitually caught eel in the Ijsselmeer lake that summer and cleaned the eel himself. He did not report having consumed the eel or having had con - tact with lake water other than taking eel out of fishing nets, or of wounds or lacerations on his hands before his illness. Upon hospital admission, he had a temperature of 39\u00b0C, heart rate of 66/minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mm/Hg and oxygen saturation was normal without oxygen administration. He was disorientated and had trouble concentrating. There were no signs of gastroenteritis or abnormalities on chest examination. No apparent skin lesions were reported. Arterial blood analysis showed a pH 7.46, pCO2 4.4 O2 satura - tion 86%. Analysis of venous blood showed raised inflammatory parameters, impaired renal and liver function tests. CRP 181 mg/L (norm: (norm: 01 to 05), AP gamma-GT 0 32), ALAT 104 U/L, glucose 7.9 mmol/L (norm: 0 to 7.8). The patient was initially empirically treated for sepsis with ceftriaxone and gentamicin, then switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. He recovered completely and was discharged after seven days of hospitalisation. Microbiology findings Within 24 hours after admission, blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods. On TCBS agar, yellow colonies appeared which tested oxidase negative. Identification through API NE (Biomerieux corporation) showed V. cholerae (code 7074745, ID 99.0%), which was con - firmed with 16S PCR. The isolate's susceptibility was tested using standard disk diffusion on Muller Hinton agar plates. It was susceptible to for Vibrio spp.. The eel were not examined microbiologically, therefore the source of infection remained unclear. Review The initial search yielded 163 unique articles and 155 duplicates (Figure 1). Reference checking resulted in identification of two additional unique articles. Of the 165 retrieved articles, 77 were excluded based on title or abstract, leaving 88 articles including 82 case reports [8-89] and six articles reporting case series [90-95]. Case reports The 82 articles retrieved covered 90 patients; 23 (26%) of them were female and the mean age was 49 (0-84) years. Cases were reported worldwide; 22 (25%) were identified in Europe, 19 (21%) in the United States of America, 30 (33%) in the Asian continent and 19 (21%) in the remaining continents. The remaining case char - acteristics are presented in Table 2 (extraction table for data available from authors upon request). The most frequently reported symptom was gastro - enteritis (51/90; 57%) followed by 29%) and bullae (18/90; 20%). However, as endophthal - mitis and neonatal meningitis were reported. Overall known risk factors such as consumption or handling of seafood or consumption or contact with possibly contaminated water were reported in 45 cases (45/90; 50%). Of the 47 patients (47/90; 52%) presenting with gastroenteritis and no bullae, 15 (15/47) reported prior seafood consumption, five (5/47) reported fishing (possibly implying consumption) and for nine cases (9/47) no exposure data were reported; no information 50 www.eurosurveillance.orgon exposure was available for the remaining 18 cases. In five cases (5/90; 6%) authors hypothesised on addi - tional risk factors such as indirect contact with raw seafood e.g. contaminated baby bathwater/bottle (2/5) and administration of the oral V. cholera e vaccine (3/5). However, the vaccine contains killed whole V. cholera cells with or without recombinant B-sub unit and the nature of the alleged link to VCNO infection was not clarified by the authors. As our case definition of VCNO sepsis included bacteraemia, a positive blood culture was reported for all patients. Additional samples that were positive for VCNO are shown in Table 2. Thirty-one patients died due to their VCNO infection, which results in an overall case-fatality rate of 348 per 1,000 for this selected sample. For 62 cases (62/90; 69%), susceptibility data of the V. cholerae non-O1 isolates were provided (extraction table available from authors upon request). Overall, in vitro resistance was observed to amoxicillin (4/50 Table 2 Characteristics of clinical cases with Vibrio cholerae non-O1 bacteraemia (n=3), and published case reports (n=90) and case series (n=82) identified through literature research CharacteristicsDutch cases (n=3)Literature review Case reports (n=90)Case reports (n=82) Number (%) or mean (min-max) Demographics Femalea0 23 (26) 12 (15) Age 65 (57-72) 49 (0-84) NR (28-83) Origin Europe 3 22 (25) 0 United States of America 0 19 (21) 0 Asia 0 30 (33) 74 (90) Otherc0 19 (21) 6 (7) Medical history Uneventful 0 12 (13) NR Liver cirrhosis and/or alcohol abuse 1 38 (42) 27 (33) Liver or bile duct disease (including cholecystectomy) 2 6 (7) 7 (9) Immunocompromisedd0 14 (16) NR Not provided 0 6 (7) NR Risk factors Consumption of seafood 2 21 (23) 12 (15) Surface water contact 1 8 (9) 3 (4) Surface water contact and seafood handling (e.g. fishing) 1 11 (12) 8 (10) Consumption of possibly contaminated water 0 5 (6) NR Other risk factorse0 5 (6) NR Not provided 0 15 (17) NR Symptoms at presentation Gastroenteritis (nausea and abdominal pain/vomiting/mild diarrhoea)1 47 (52) 32 (39) Fever, no gastroenteritis 1 26 (29) 51 (62) Bullae 1 14 (17) 8 (10) Bullae and gastroenteritis 0 4 (4) NR Vibrio cholerae isolatedb Faeces 0 5 of 32 0 of 19 Ascites/peritoneal fluid 0 8 of 20 8 of 33 Food or water 0 5 of 7 2 of 2 CSF (meningitis) 0 3 of 5 NR Bulla fluid 1 of 1 6 of 6 NR Clinical outcome Recovery 2 56 (62) 51 (62) Irreversible trauma (e.g. severe neurological impairment) 0 2 (2) NR Death 1 31 (34) 29 (35) Unknown 0 1 (2) NR CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; NR: Not reported or insufficient data. a The sex of one patient (newborn) was not provided. b Aside from positive blood cultures which were confirmed for all cases. c Australia, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritius, Ottawa (Canada), Puerto Rico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia. d non-O1 isolates appeared to be suscepti - ble in vitro, without exception, were cephalotin Toxin production of the iso - lates was not consistently reported in literature and therefore not included in the analysis. Case series Details of the six retrieved case series were extracted and analysed briefly given the selected nature of the sample (Table 2). Altogether, 82 patients with VCNO bacteraemia were retrieved, the majority of reports originating from the Asian continent. As in the three case reports described above, most patients were male. In contrast, fever was the most frequent present - ing symptom and risk factors could be identified in only a minority of patients (24/82; 29%). Overall, the number of cases reported peaked in 1996, 1998, 2007 and 2011 (Figure 2). Discussion We presented three cases of VCNO bacteraemia that were identified in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2013as well as 172 cases from literature occurring between 1980 and 2014. Corresponding with current knowledge, both the recently identified cases and the previously reported ones show that patients are typically male, often have a history of liver/bile duct disease and the presenting symptoms often include gastroenteritis, fever and bullae [1]. The suspected sources while seldom confirmed microbiologically, are commonly fish and surface water. In contrast to previ - ous reports, however, we found that a great variety in clinical presentation does occur, ranging from lethargy to meningitis, endophthalmitis, cough and dyspnoea [1]. Severe outcomes include neurological impairment, lower limb amputation and death. All three Dutch cases presented during summer, the season of recreational activities such as fishing, swimming and of flourishing microorganisms in surface waters due to rising temper - atures [96-98]. A major strength of our analysis is that it provides a complete overview of what is known about VCNO bac - teraemia, whereas other reports merely describe indi - vidual cases or a selection of case reports. The search was formulated by an experienced scientist (MFE) and an information specialist (JS) and articles were pro - vided by the LUMC library which has access to over 9,000 leading (bio-)medical journals. Therefore, we consider that this review includes all relevant pub - lished articles published in Dutch and English and pro - vides a complete overview of the available literature on VCNO bacteraemia.The summary of data on antimicrobial susceptibil - ity provided here may assist physicians in choosing an adequate treatment regimen. The data indicate that administration of a cephalosporin is likely to be the best option when dealing with VCNO bacterae - mia. However, an important factor that hinders the extrapolation of our data to clinical practice is publi - cation bias, many authors did not report susceptibility data. This is crucial when evaluating resistance data, as many authors solely reported the susceptibility to antimicrobials administered to the patient in question. Additional relevant data on antimicrobial resistance that may very well have been available to the authors was not published. After searching current literature for the aetiology of VCNO bacteraemia, we could not reveal why males are affected more frequently than females, but found a similar trend in infections with other Vibrio spp [99]. The role of immunocompromising conditions in acquir - ing VCNO bacteraemia seems clear and the influence of liver cirrhosis can probably be attributed to high fer - ritin levels which are required for the metabolism of Vibrio spp [100]. Aside from predisposing conditions and exposure, bac - terial virulence may very well play a significant role in the pathogenesis of VCNO bacteraemia. VCNO toxins are being studied and several are known e.g. ctx; large excretion of fluids and electrolytes into the heat-stable enterotoxin. The clinical significance of these toxins (e.g. their role in bulla formation, remains yet to be determined [101,102]. In conclusion, VCNO bacteraemia is a disease that can be fatal and poses a threat around the globe especially to patients with a history of alcohol abuse and/or liver cirrhosis. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of VCNO bacteraemia in patients presenting with gas - troenteritis, fever or bullae after consumption of or con - tact with seafood or potentially contaminated water. However, risk factors often remain unidentified, the clinical presentation varies greatly and a quick microbi - ological diagnosis is indispensable. Cephalosporins are likely the best treatment option for VCNO bacteraemia. Acknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Mr. J.
