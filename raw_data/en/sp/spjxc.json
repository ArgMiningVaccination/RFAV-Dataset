SUMMARY Project HOPE is implementing a five -year Child Survival Project aimed at improving the health status of children under five and women of reproductive age in the Department of Jinotega, Nicaragua \u2014with a focus on rural populations, including those worki ng on coffee plantations. The main partners in implementation are: Ministry of Health (MOH) at the Departmental level (SILAIS), Health Cente rs/Posts, and private sector coffee growers. Specific program health interventions and level of effort include: maternal and newborn care (30%), nutrition/micronutrient deficiencies (13%), breastfeeding promotion (10%), control of (15%) , pneumonia case management (10%), immunization (7%), child spacing (10%), and HIV/AIDS/STIs (5%). The proposed interventions are being implemented in accordance with Nicaragua's PROCOSAN initiative, a program based on community growth monitoring sessions as an opportunity for incorporating IMCI. Other MOH programs being implemented include c ommunity -based family planning, Maternal Newborn Care; and the newly introduced supervisory system for health facilities. Key strategies include: \u00a7 building the servi ce-delivery capacity of health facilities and improving the quality of care; \u00a7 strengthening cooperation among public, private and community stakeholders; \u00a7 empowering consumers, particularly women, to take greater responsibility for personal and family healt h maintenance decisions; \u00a7 improving timely care - seeking behaviors, through recognition of danger signs, system of referral and counter -referral, and the formation of emergency committees; \u00a7 improving the knowledge and skills at the community level by streng thening the work of Brigadistas and TBAs and strengthening of the Community Information System. The target population includes the entire population of Jinotega department due to the project focus on strengthening the SILAIS and all health units within th e department. The population includes 62,451 children under five and 67,461 women of reproductive age (129,912 total beneficiaries). The MOH and CSP selected 80 priority communities where the project provides more direct support, but all HC/HP staff has b een involved in institutional strengthening activities The main accomplishments d uring the first half of the project were: \u00a7 Support to ongoing or newly introduced MOH programs in child health, maternal health, quality improvement, and family planning; \u00a7 Provision of logistical support (transportation), materials, and medicines; \u00a7 Monthly or bimonthly meetings as linkage between MOH and community; \u00a7 Improved access to health services, by working in isolated communities \u00a7 Training for Brigadistas, TBAs, community co mmittees and MOH staff; 368 Brigadistas had attended at least one training event and 234 TBAs had attended at least one training event \u00a7 A KPC Survey was conducted as part of the mid term evaluation and showed an increase in vaccination coverage, use of mode rn family planning methods, improved knowledge of prevention of HIV/AIDS and improved care seeking during diarrhea; \u00a7 Committees for emergency transportation during obstetrical emergencies have been formed in 63 communities with 104 committee members traine d in the formation of emergency 2 brigades, collecting funds to help cover medical emergencies, recognition of danger signs, etc. \u00a7 PROCOSAN has been implemented in 76 priority communities, selected by the MOH. \u00a7 Community based child spacing has been establi shed in 36 of the 80 priority communities, plus an additional 22 communities selected by the CSP and MOH (total 58), with trained counselors who distribute some contraceptive methods in the communities. Project records show there are 49 counselors in the 8 0 priority communities and 27 counselors in other communities. \u00a7 The CSP is supporting, through training, materials and supervision, the implementation of the official national MOH program for Maternal Newborn Care in 58 of the 80 priority communities plus f ive additional communities \u00a7 A qualitative study was carried out by HOPE/MOH on maternal preferences for home vs. institutional birth. \u00a7 The Humanitarian Assistance Program provided donations of pharmaceutical products. The national donation level during the l ife of this project has been 9.5 million dollars, 2.77 million of that going to Jinotega The project however has some weaknesses which need to be addressed : \u00a7 No monitoring of process indicators; \u00a7 Deviation from M&E plan due to misunderstanding of the use of some instruments and introduction of SIGHOPE; \u00a7 Lack of follow -up on the CSTS Sustainability Framework and HOPE Nicaragua Institutional Assessment. \u00a7 Greater emphasis on the use of information for decision making Priority Recommendations \u00a7 The institutional a ssessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored. \u00a7 An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS to identify specific actions for capacity building based on the needs of SILAI S. \u00a7 Develop a sustainability plan based on the work started with the CSSA model, including planning with communities, based on the use of local resources for problem solving. \u00a7 Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH an d HOPE staff. The CSP staff and partners will develop a revised work plan as part of the MTE process according to the following schedule. June 1 - 10 - MTE report and Chapters A& E of the DIP translated into Spanish; - Develop guides regarding work to be done by CSP and partners in preparation for writing the work plan and revised DIP June 13 - July 15 - CSP team follows guides to study the MTE recommendations and begin writing work plan and revised DIP - Develops the workshop plan July 19 - 22 or August 1 -4 Workshop to finalize work plan and revised DIP 3 B. Assessment of progress made in achievement of program objectives 1. Technical Approach: a. General Overview Project HOPE is implementing a five -year Child Survival Project (CSP) aimed at improv ing the health status of children under five and women of reproductive age in the Department of Jinotega, Nicaragua \u2014with a focus on its rural populations, including those worki ng on the region's many private coffee plantations. The program builds on HOPE' s long term work in other departments of Nicaragua and previous work in three municipalities of Jinotega. HOPE has an office in the city of Jinotega, capital of Jinotega Department, as well as a central coordinating office in Managua. The main partners in the implementation of this project are: the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the SILAIS (Departmental level of MOH) and Health Centers (HC) and Health posts (HP), and private sector coffee growers. According to the DIP, the overall objective of the CSP in Ji notega is \"Improved the health of women of reproductive age and children younger than 5 years old in Jinotega's rural areas\". This is being done by: \"building the service -delivery capacity of HC/HPs; increasing the skills of health care providers; streng thening cooperation among public, private and community stakeholders; and empowering consumers, particularly women, to take greater responsibility for personal and family health maintenance decisions.\" Key health objectives include: improve the quality o f prenatal and postpartum care, and nutritional practices for pregnant women; increase the percentage of newborns and infants who are breastfed; improve nutritional status of children through better feeding practices; improve case management of diarrheal d isease and practices to prevent diarrheal episodes; improve management of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and care -seeking behaviors; increase immunization coverage for young children; increase the use of family planning methods and extend birth interv als; and increase knowledge regarding prevention of HIV/AIDS/STIs. Specific program health interventions and level of effort include: maternal and newborn care (30%), nutrition/micronutrient deficiencies (13%), breastfeeding promotion (10%), control of diarrheal disease (15%), pneumonia case management (10%), immunization (7%), child spacing (10%), and HIV/AIDS/STIs (5%). The proposed interventions are being implemented accordance Nicaragua's PROCOSAN ( Programa Comunitario de Salud y Nutrici\u00f3n) a n evolving national program based initially on the AIN model for child health from Honduras with later phases to incorporate maternal health. The program is based on community growth monitoring sessions as an opportunity for incorporating IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses) services. Other MOH programs being implemented by the CSP include ECMAC (Entrega Comunitaroia de M\u00e9todos AntiConceptivos Obst\u00e9tricos y el Mejoramiento de la Atenci\u00f3n en Salud) the newly introduced supervisory system for health facilities. Other key strategies include: 1) improving the quality of care; 2) improving timely care - seek ing behaviors, through recognition of danger signs, system of referral and counter -referral, and the formation of emergency transportation committees, 4 3) improving the knowledge and skills at the community level by strengthening the work of Brigadistas an d TBAs and strengthening the SICO (Community Information System). The target population includes the entire population of Jinotega department due to the project focus on strengthening the SILAIS and all health units within the department. The revised popu lation presented in the DIP is 62,451 children under five and 67,461 women of reproductive age (129,912 total beneficiaries). The MOH and CSP selected 80 priority communities (approximately 10 in each of the eight municipalities of Jinotega) where the pro ject would provide more direct services, but all HC/HP staff has been involved in institutional strengthening activities which benefit the entire department (731 communities). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Municipalities Jinotega San Rafael La Concordia Yal\u00ed Pantasma Wiwil\u00ed El Cu\u00e1 Bocay Total # Health Centers 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 # of Health Posts 11 3 2 5 6 5 9 2 43 During the month of May 2005, a Mid Term Evaluation (MTE) was conducted utilizing a participatory methodology with a 15 -member multi -disciplinary evaluation team, lead by an external evaluator, principal author of this document. Recommendations within this document are written in Bold and summarized in the Conclusions and Recommendations section. The MTE team visited nine communities during a three day period to interview mothers, health committees, Brigadistas (community volunteers), Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) and MOH staff. (For complete details on the MTE methodology, see Annex C, Evaluation Assessment Methodology, Annex B, Evalua tion Team Members, and Annex D, Persons interviewed and contacted.). These visits also provided an opportunity to share and analyze some results from the recently conducted KPC survey with mothers and health committees. The following tables summarize the r esults of the KPC Survey conducted in March 2005. A complete report from the KPC Survey is included in Annex F.

Progress Made 1. The CSP is supporting, through training, materials and supervision, the implementation of the of ficial national MOH program for MNC (Plan de Parto) in 58 of the 80 priority communities plus five additional communities. The program includes aspects of essential care; emergency care, including recognition of danger signs, referral and establishment of emergency transportation committees; and use of a birth plan. One of the limitations to implementation has been numerous changes on a national level with this program; including revisions to the format used for birth planning, and implementation policies. 2. A colorful well designed format for birth planning has been developed which includes monitoring of prenatal control, who will attend the birth, where the birth will take place, who will accompany the woman, savings to pay for transportation and other expe nses, 7 transportation, who will donate blood in case of an emergency, who will take care of other children, and danger signs during pregnancy, labor, postpartum and in the newborn. MOH staff uses the format at each prenatal visit to work with the woman and her family on making decisions to facilitate a safe and healthy birth. 3. The Birth Planning program includes the establishment and use of Maternal Waiting Houses. Maternity Waiting Houses has been adopted by the MOH as part of the Health Sector Modernization program of the World Bank and are a valuable tool for reducing maternal mortality by providing access to institutional births. Project HOPE supported the Community of Wamblan for the drafting of a proposal for construction and equipping of the Maternity W aiting Home and provision of labor and delivery medical equipment for the Health Unit. With the technical support of Project HOPE and financial support of the Japanese Embassy, the home was built equipped and commissioned. The Wamblan Maternity Waiting Hom e is now averaging 4.5 pregnant women guests per month. Proposals for the construction of two Maternity Waiting Houses were developed, but only one has been approved so far. 4. There are five maternity houses in the department. A strong link has been establi shed with the houses both through the birth planning process and the referral/counter -referral system which includes referrals to the Maternity Waiting Houses. 5. Committees for emergency transportation during obstetrical emergencies have been formed in 63 co mmunities with 104 committee members trained in the formation of emergency brigades, collecting funds to help cover medical emergencies, recognition of danger signs, etc. An additional training in community mobilization was conducted for 48 committee membe rs. 6. A qualitative study was carried out by HOPE/MOH on maternal preferences for home vs. institutional birth. One of the results from this study has been a greater openness to involve TBAs within the institutional setting. It was reported that the TBA acco mpanies women to the HC and in some places are able to assist with the delivery at the center. 7. Maternal death analysis is carried out by each municipality with assistance from the Central MOH. 8. Training TBAs, Brigadistas and counselors with the ECMAC (com munity based family planning) were all trained in topics related to MNC. A summary of the number of training sessions provided to personnel by subject and by position is included in the following table (see Annex E for a summary of CSP training). Training Topic TBA Brigadistas ECMAC counselors Life Saving Skills 65 14 Danger Signs (Maternal) 205 Birth Planning 66 23 Reproductive Risks 37 Low Risk Births 30 Maternal Health 68 MNC phase 1 100 MNC phase 2 21 Essential Obstetric and Neon atal Care 112 Preparation before birth 22 8 The target for training TBAs (incorrectly referred to as midwives) is confusing in the DIP. According to the Two -Year Operative Plan (Attachment 10 of DIP) 80 midwives will be trained in MNC (Maternal Newbor n Care) \"according to midwife curricula\" and 240 CHVs (Community Health Volunteers) will be trained in IMCI related topics, including educational methodologies. In the body of the DIP, the number 400 is used, alternately 400 midwives and 400 CHVs. It is difficult to interpret whether 240 is the target for the first two years (although this is further confused by use of the target 400 in the two year work plan (pp 31 -46 of DIP) or if the term CHV does not include TBAs and the DIP proposes to work with 400 TB As and 400 Brigadistas. At the time of the MTE, the CSP staff was proposing to train 240 Brigadistas (80 communities times 3 Brigadistas) and 80 TBAs (one per priority community). According to project training records 368 Brigadistas had attended at least one training event and 234 TBAs had attended at least one training event. A further complication is that in many cases a single person could be both Brigadista and TBA. A further discussion on training is included in section B.2c.v. Training. Health pers onnel The target for training MOH personnel is much clearer as it is stated as 110 (80 nurses and 30 doctors) in both the education plan (Attachment 10 of the DIP) and the two -year work plan. Information reported by the CSP showed only 17 staff trained in Birth Planning (Plan de Partos) in 2004. This information is alarming in that either the proposed training has not been completed, or the system for collecting training information is not accurate. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks A review of the th ree results indicators for MNC show s a favorable trend, although none of the changes are statistically significant. It was not possible to review the process indicators for the project, as they are not being monitored. Baseline MTE Final Target 1. % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who report having had at least one prenatal visit with a doctor or nurse. 89% (85.2 -92.8) 94% (91.1 -96.9) 95% The above indicator was chosen by the project as a results indicator, but if a more in -depth analysis had be en conducted at the time of the baseline, a much more serious problem would have been revealed. At baseline only 36% of mothers interviewed in the KPC Survey had received two or more prenatal visits with a doctor or nurse as verified by maternal card, duri ng the MTE KPC the percent had declined to 35%. It is suggested that Results Indicator 1 be changed to measure two or more prenatal visits, since the data is available for baseline and MTE surveys and represents a more alarming trend in adequate prenatal a ttention. Baseline MTE Final Target 2. % of children aged 0 -23 months old whose birth was attended by a doctor or nurse. 51% (45.2 -56.8) 54% (48.3 -59.7) 60% 3. % of mothers who report having had at least one postpartum visit. 32% (24.1 -39.9) 33% (25.1-40.9) 45% A postpartum visit is defined by the MOH as within 45 days of delivery. In order to have an impact on neonatal deaths by increasing postpartum consultations those consultations need to happen soon after delivery. This could be a good advocac y opportunity for the CSP to work with the MOH on changing this definition of postpartum care. 9 d. Follow -up and Next Steps In the original project design a Specialist in Maternal Health was included. That position was initially filled but has been vacant since September 2004 (except for < 1 month when a person was hired who later left). This has weakened the staff's ability to implement MNC and they admit that the MNC component is weak due to the huge time commitment needed to implement PROCOSAN. Specifi c recommendations will be made in later sections for improving training, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the CSP. Child spacing 10% a. Activities proposed in DIP \u00a7 improving access to family planning (FP) in remote areas; \u00a7 providing quality services, including improving provider performance in registering, screening, counseling, and tracking clients; \u00a7 piloting of Community -based Distribution Agents (ECMAC counselors) in areas where there is poor access;. \u00a7 collaborating with PROFAMILIA, o ne of Nicaragua's premier FP organizations, using their model, and training and teaching materials; \u00a7 training to MOH staff to supervise the counselors in their catchment area;. \u00a7 training of ECMAC counselors and 110 FP, counseling, distri bution, and management; \u00a7 establish 80 distribution points, phased in gradually over the project; 20 to be piloted in the first 2 years; \u00a7 400 CHVs trained in providing information about FP and making referrals; \u00a7 development of a system for monitoring client s including FP use, numbers of new acceptors, number of referrals and the reasons for the referrals; \u00a7 assessing the efficacy of FP activities using techniques including exit interviews and verbal case reviews; \u00a7 improving the tracking of contraceptive supply to ensure the timely and consistent supply of resources and training all health facility staff in logistics management. b. Progress Made 1. The CSP provides support through training, materials and supervision to the national MOH program ECMAC (community b ased distribution of family planning methods). The program is just beginning in the department, and the CSP is piloting in communities that were prioritized by the MOH according to number of pregnancies and access to FP services. 2. ECMAC has been established in 36 of the 80 priority communities, plus an additional 22 communities selected by the CSP and MOH (total 58), with trained ECMAC counselors who distribute some FP methods in the communities (mainly injectables and pills). Project records show there are 49 ECMAC counselors in the 80 priority communities and 27 counselors in other communities. Most communities have one trained counselor. According to interviews with mothers during the MTE, access to FP methods at the community level was one of the activiti es of the project they thought had the most impact. 10 3. Training sessions for 81 ECMAC counselors and 94 MOH staff, plus 497 Brigadistas in ECMAC. Training sessions were also held for 265 Brigadistas and 47 TBAs in Family Planning. 4. HOPE/MOH staff has received training in CycleBeads which is based on the Standard Days Method , a natural family planning method, which has proven to be more than 95% effective in preventing unplanned pregnancies. CycleBeads were developed by the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University . The method offers a natural alternative which has achieved acceptance on a small, but important, scale . 5. Through advocacy and negotiation during the roll out of ECMAC activities the counselors have been able to improve easy access to FP methods. They used to be able to distribute methods for coverage for only one month, now they can provide coverage for two months. 6. ECMAC Counselors have received training in the ACCEDA (Attend, Converse, Communicate, Elect, Describe and Agree on follow -up visit) approach developed by Johns Hopkins University, Center for Communication Programs. This approach has been shown to be an effective counseling tool. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks The following results indicators relate to Child Spacing: Baseline MTE Final Target 1. % of children aged 12 to 23 months old that were born at least 24 months after previous surviving child 84% (79.5 -88.5) 86% (81.6 -90.4) 90% 2. % of mothers with children aged 12 to 23 months old who are not pregnant, desire no more children or are not sure and report using a modern family planning method 65% (56.3 -73.7) 90% (84.6 -95.4) 70% The first indicator demonstrates a positive trend and will probably meet the final target. The second indicator showed excellent progr ess and has surpassed the final target. The difference between the baseline and MTE results is statistically significant. It was not possible to include the analysis of the process indicators, as they have not been monitored. A discussion of the indicator s will be included in the M&E section. The indicators for family planning used by the MOH are different from those used by the CSP making follow -up difficult to monitor. As a review of indicators will be recommended, this would be a good time to try and in corporate MOH indicators if at all possible. d. Follow -up and Next Steps The ECMAC implementation has been the crown jewel of this project; a significant increase was seen in the percentage of women using modern family planning. HIV/AIDS/STIs 5% a. Act ivities proposed in DIP \u00a7 integrate HIV/AIDS prevention education into health staff training at all levels \u00a7 encourage prevention counseling at health facilities \u00a7 educate the population about HIV/AIDS reinforcing the key message that a person can avoid gettin g HIV/AIDS through the use of condoms, abstinence, and reducing the number of sexual partners. 11 b. Progress Made This intervention represents a very small level of effort and the activities mainly focus on incorporation of HIV/AIDS education within othe r CSP activities. Training sessions have been held for 125 Brigadistas and 21 TBAs on HIV/AIDS. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks Baseline MTE Final Target % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who know at least two ways to prevent HIV / AIDS / STIs 6% (2.8-9.2) 14% * (9.8-18.2) 15% This indicator also showed impressive gains, the difference is statistically significant and almost reached the final target. d. Follow -up and Next Steps The technical level of CSP staff is low in this intervent ion, staff admits they have little basic knowledge in HIV/AIDS and need technical assistance (TA). The MOH has not received training due to this gap. HOPE staff should receive technical assistance on HIV/AIDS. IMCI (Combined level of effort 55%) The IMCI approach is being used by the project within the official framework of the MOH to include the interventions of Nutrition, Breastfeeding, Control of Diarrheal Disease (CDD), Pneumonia Case Management (PCM) and Immunizations (EPI). Each intervention will be assessed separately, but as the five interventions have many common elements within IMCI, a general discussion on IMCI strategies will serve to introduce the interventions. a. Activities proposed in DIP \u00a7 implement a community -focused IEC approach to promo te care -seeking practices and timely recognition of danger signs;. \u00a7 explore cultural barriers to find a way to overcome them;. \u00a7 training and supervising of 400 CHWs to support and monitor community -based activities, including providing counseling to mother s; \u00a7 peer-to-peer counseling among community members, including those who are participating in mothers' groups;. \u00a7 coordinate with other agencies (e.g., agricultural associations, women and men clubs, NGOs and PVOs conducting Title II and other food programs ), that are carrying out other interventions and to improve the effectiveness of activities and t o avoid duplication of efforts; \u00a7 identify 10 communities per municipality (80 priority commun ities) for conducting PROCOSAN; \u00a7 teach facility -based IMCI and cou nseling - providers to use every contact with mothers as a integrated health (including vaccinatio ns) and counseling opportunity; \u00a7 strengthen referral networks for emergency cases through training health facility staff and community volunteers in making app ropriate referrals and counter -referrals, using tools and processes developed by the MOH; \u00a7 endeavor to procure antibiotics for use in the CSP through HOPE's Humanitarian Assistance Program. \u00a7 facilitate improvements in the HIS and planning at SILAIS and mu nicipality levels including timely feedback to the community for local decision making ; 12 \u00a7 conduct health facility worker and Brigadista performance assessments and develop organized approaches with partners to diminish gaps and weaknesses in performance; \u00a7 provide training for MOH staff facilitators in quality assurance; \u00a7 train 54 MOH facilitators in collaboration with the SILAIS and work with them during training sessions to strengthen their training skills; \u00a7 establishment of Municipal Quality Committees. b. Progress Made 1. PROCOSAN - the adaptation in Nicaragua of the AIN ( Atenci\u00f3n Integral del Ni\u00f1ez Integrated Childhood Attention) project from Honduras provides some IMCI services at the community level based on participation in monthly growth monitoring acti vities for children under two. The PROCOSAN program will eventually include an MNC component. Currently it focuses on growth monitoring, counseling on child nutrition, education on danger signs and home management in CDD and ARI, monitoring of vaccination status and breastfeeding practices, and the presence of MOH staff during growth monitoring sessions. PROCOSAN has been implemented in 76 priority communities, selected by the MOH. In MTE interviews, the most frequently observed changes in practice were the attendance at PROCOSAN sessions and an increased use of health services. 2. A large amount of training has taken place in topics related to IMCI. (See Annex E for complete summary of training) but the most important training is shown in the following table that represents the number of training sessions provided to personnel by subject and by position. 2003 Brigadistas 2004 Brigadistas 2005 Brigadistas 2003 TBA 2004 TBA 2005 TBA ARI 213 221 14 18 CDD 717 263 11 34 19 5 EPI 258 259 203 8 9 13 BF 96 19 59 20 6 Nutrition 38 28 PROCOSAN 218 6 ARI/CDD 121 22 SICO 471 137 90 4 ARI/CDD Refresher 51 8 MOH staff was also trained in CDD (18), Nutrition (5) EPI (80), PROCOSAN (75) and SICO (68). 3. Clinical IMCI was introd uced in Nicaragua several years ago. SILAIS estimates that 90% of the staff is trained in IMCI and has the basic materials for implementation, some of which were provided by HOPE. During the MTE all three of the Health facilities visited had basic IMCI materials, particularly drugs. One was lacking a refrigerator for vaccines, one lacked IMCI algorithms, and two lacked both a watch and a chronometer for counting respirations. There is some report of IMCI not being consistently used, although it is one of th e main focuses during supervision visits. All MOH staff is encouraged to ask mothers if their child has been ill (diarrhea, respiratory infection, fever) whenever a child makes contact with the health system, (whether through growth monitoring sessions, d uring immunization campaigns, etc). and will be 13 treated according to IMCI protocols and guidelines. The CSP has provided some Clinical IMCI training. According to training records, 97 people received training in Clinical IMCI phase 1 (or a non -specific c linical IMCI session) and 38 received clinical IMCI phase 2 training. 4. Supervision of PROCOSAN is carried out periodically by HOPE and MOH staff. 5. The CSP strategy of training a cadre of 54 MOH trainers has not been implemented. The project has form ed MOH training teams in each municipality of two people. Other NGO projects have also trained additional trainers in some municipalities. SILAIS staff have also been trained in some topics, for example 12 SILAIS staff are currently receiving training in AMATE/IDRE educational methodology during weekly sessions. All training carried our by the CSP is facilitated by HOPE and MOH trainers. 6. MOH Municipal Quality Committees have been established in seven of the eight municipalities to monitor the quali ty of the health services. These committees include representatives from the health centers and posts and theoretically meet each month to monitor service statistics, review maternal deaths reported, and discuss current issues and problems that need to b e resolved. This activity needs further strengthening as many of the committees are not active and do not link to a related committee formed at the SILAIS, as was originally planned. 7. Revolving drug funds have been established in six haciendas primarily in coordination with private sector coffee grower partners. The funds are managed by PROSALUD (a local NGO), with the capital being provided by the coffee growers. HOPE provides technical and logistical support for the establishment and ongoing implementa tion of the funds. The funds provide access to low cost essential drugs for employees of the coffee growers, as well as surrounding communities. PROSALUD has an office in Dario, Matagalpa that works with the revolving drug funds. Resupply orders are coordi nated among haciendas and PROSALUD delivers drugs to each hacienda. Efforts are being made to open a sub -office in Jinotega to provide services to the drug funds within the department. 8. The project has strengthened the referral/counter -referral system t hrough training and supervision. The MOH format is a three part form; 1.) A copy for the CHW on diagnosis and patient identification, 2) Information for the HC/HP about the patient and the reason for the referral; including high risk pregnancy, difficulty breastfeeding, referral to a maternal waiting house, and other morbidity, to be taken by the patient to the HC/HP 3.) Counter -referral to be filled out by health staff and returned to the CHW by the patient with instructions for follow -up. According to inf ormation collected during the MTE the system is functioning well. 9. Educational materials have been provided by the CSP, through the reproduction of standardized PROCOSAN materials including flipcharts for counseling on child feeding and morbidity, remin der charts for agreements reached with the mothers, and charts plotting the child's growth status, as well as registration books for tracking children participating in PROCOSAN. 10. Mothers' Clubs have been formed in 52 of the 80 priority communities and five additional communities. The purpose of the clubs is to receive health talks from community, MOH and CSP workers and to provide support for the PROCOSAN weighing sessions. Some of the clubs are also linked to Breastfeeding Support Groups, a concept bei ng implemented in a variation 14 from the traditional \"support groups\". Fifteen HC/HPs have established support groups, with representatives from various communities. These groups receive additional health education, not necessarily in breastfeeding, which th ey share with the Mothers' Club in their respective community, thus \"supporting\" the Mothers' Club. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks There are no project indicators specific to IMCI d. Follow -up and Next Steps Some of the issues pending in relation to IMCI are: The PROCOSAN program is a modified IMCI model based on monthly growth monitoring of children and customized counseling for mothers. The Nicaraguan MOH conceives of PROCOSAN as an integrated community based health package, linking communities and health facilities and including services for children and eventually, women. HOPE is in an excellent position to support the implementation of the model to ensure that all interventions (immunization, ARI, diarrhea and maternal interventions) are stren gthened. Using the PROCOSAN methodology all communities are supposed to have quarterly meetings to discuss health issues based on children's growth. These are rarely carried out and would be an excellent future activity for the CSP to strengthen the use of nutrition, and IMCI information. The principal method for the dissemination of IMCI messages currently is through individual counseling. A complementary activity could be the dissemination of messages on a larger scale. Recommendations from the MTE te am included the use of murals and radio spots to increase knowledge of IMCI messages. Radio time is expensive but given the number of PVO/NGOs in the department implementing maternal -child health interventions, the project should look into cost sharing of messages with other organizations. The MOH is currently introducing a new communication strategy. The CSP should develop a comprehensive IEC plan for the remainder of the project taking into account the new MOH strategy and the use of alternative means for the dissemination of IMCI and MNC messages. Control of diarrheal disease (15%) a. Activities proposed in DIP operations research analyzing the utilization of Community Oral Rehydration Units (CORUs or \"casa bases\" in Spanish ) where Bri gadistas manage children with diarrheal episodes and offer ORS/ORT, counseling, and referrals ; training and supervision of the use of diagnosis and treatment guidelines in compliance with MOH IMCI norms ; distance -learning modules on case management of diarrhea; create linkages with agencies working on water and sanitation programs in Jinotega. training for the MOH in the management of ORS/ORT supplies and antibiotics ; obtain antibiotics to treat diarrheal diseases through its Humanitarian Assistance Program; teach mothers when it is important to wash their hands; use the AIN/IMCI guidelines, an existing and validated flowchart/procedure chart and a photographic album , to assist with proper classification and referral of cases. 15 b. Progress Made Progress made in t his intervention was previously covered in the IMCI section. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks The following results indicators correspond to the CDD intervention. Baseline MTE Final Target % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months with a diarrheal episode in the last two weeks who report giving as much or more food to their child 46% (36.5 -55.5) 45% (34.6 -55.4) 55% % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months with a diarrheal episode in the last two weeks who report giving as much or more liquids or breast milk to their child 69% (60.2 -77.8) 71% (61.6 -80.4) 80% % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who report having sought assistance or counseling from a health unit or CORU during the child's last diarrheal episode. 36% (27.2 -44.8) 53% (43.1 -62.9) 50% % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who report washing their hands with water and soap before the preparation of meals, before feeding children, after defecation and after tending a child that has defecated 19% (14.1 -23.9) 11% (7.1-14.9) 35% % of mothers of who can identify at least two danger signs for diarrhea 27% (21.5 -32.5) 17% (12.4 -21.6) 35% Three of the five indicators showed a negative trend, but none of the changes are statistically significant. The decline in the indicator for ha nd washing is of concern and in future projects, the indicator should reflect the suggested format for measuring hand washing in the KPC 2000+ module. Further discussion on this issue is included in Annex E KPC Issues. There are a number of problems with the last indicator -recognition of danger signs. As the indicator is stated in the KPC 2000+, the correct responses would be prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and dehydration. The CSP has interpreted this indicator as the signs of dehydration - sunken eyes, decreased urination, dry mouth, etc. During the MTE, the only responses collected were those related to dehydration. Due to an outbreak of rota -virus caused diarrhea, the MOH conducted a massive national campaign on danger signs which merited a visit to a HC/HP beginning in February 2005 and continuing to the present. The signs promoted were fever, vomiting and abundant diarrhea. The signs the project is promoting (and measuring in the KPC) are signs of dehydration. This has caused a decline in the recog nition by mothers of the signs of dehydration. There is also some concern by HOPE staff that the question is not clearly understood by mothers, the staff has begun some initial investigation as the understanding of this question, for example the use of the words signo, senal or sintoma as the best translation for \"signs\". This same campaign probably influenced the percentage of mothers seeking health care during a diarrheal episode. d. Follow -up and Next Steps The qualitative study planned for utilization of the CORUs should be completed. The project needs to take a serious look at the effectiveness of this activity. Is the CORU worth doing? If the main function of the CORU is to distribute ORS packets, is it necessary to have a \"site\" for this activity? F ew of the CORUs have basic materials (container for mixing, cup, spoon) to actually rehydrate a child, even though all CORUs were equipped in the past, most recently in some 16 municipalities by CRS. In MTE interviews with mothers they said out of five functi oning CORUs all distribute ORS packets and show mothers how to prepare it; most CORUs reportedly provide malaria treatment (4/5); and three of the five CORUs are used for weighing sessions, meetings or as a point for vaccinations during campaigns. Of the n ine Brigadistas interviewed during the MTE, only four said that they actually had ORS available. During MTE interviews a number of people mentioned the use of homemade sugar and salt rehydration solution when ORS packets were not available. It is generall y not recommended to use homemade sugar and salt solutions due to the difficulty in correctly measuring the quantities of sugar and salt. The CSP should investigate traditional locally available liquids such as rice water, barley water or coconut water and encourage the use of these liquids during episodes of diarrhea. Pneumonia case management ( PCM) 10% a. Activities proposed in DIP Provide on -the-job training and supervision of facility and community health providers to ensure compliance with both Clin ical and Community IMCI norms; Include identification and referral protocols in training and supervision for clinic and community -based volunteers in areas where access to clinical services is difficult; Promote the early recognition of danger signs of pne umonia/ARIs by mothers and early visits to health facility for classifica tion and appropriate treatment; Pilot distance -learning modules on identifying pneumonia signs and case management; Provide TA to the MOH in logistics management of supplies and resou rces, including antibiotics; Improve epidemiological surveillance of ARIs; Increase the number of sources for IEC messages, such as radio spots and health fairs; Discourage mothers from obtaining or purchasing antibiotics unless a trained health provider has directed her to do so; Reactivate CURIM ( Committee for Rational Use of Medical Supplies) and conduct workshops for CHWs and health facilities to educate them about the rational use of antibiotics; Train 240 CHWs on effective counseling techniques to i mprove healthcare for children with ARIs at community level. b. Progress Made Progress made in this intervention was previously covered in the IMCI section. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks Baseline MTE Final Target % of children aged 0 -23 months with cough and fast breathing in the last two weeks taken to a health unit 60% (49.4 -70.6) 55% (44.3 -65.7) 85% % of mothers who identify fast breathing as a danger sign of pneumonia 76% (70.8 -81.2) 78% (72.9 -83.1) 85% It is difficult to interpret the re sults of the first indicator, especially when the same survey showed increases in care -seeking behaviors when children had diarrhea. This tendency requires further study by the project to identify barriers to care seeking, particularly since the percentag e of women that recognize a danger sign of pneumonia essentially did not change. 17 Nutrition/micronutrient deficiencies (13%) a. Activities proposed in DIP \u00a7 monthly community -based growth monitoring and counseling for mothers/caretakers regarding improved feeding practices; \u00a7 identify nutritional deficiencies and those children who are failing to thrive; \u00a7 train health personnel in home -based nutritional rehabilitation; \u00a7 use Positive Deviance/Hearth methodology to identify the \"positive deviants\" and to develo p messages based upon health nurturing practices; \u00a7 explore amongst mothers preparations using local foods and recipes ; \u00a7 increase both the coverage and quality of \"routine\" anthropometric data collected during growth monitoring and promotion as an early war ning system; \u00a7 create links with PVOs conducting Title II and other food programs in case there is a need for a rapid response; \u00a7 improve the capability of the SILAIS to monitor micronutrient deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency (anemia) by monitoring hemoglobin levels through the use of the Hemocue; \u00a7 support the MOH by providing resources in the field to facilitate Vitamin A and Iron campaigns. b. Progress Made \u00a7 The PROCOSAN program has been implemented in 76 communities consisting of monthly growth m onitoring and counseling for mothers, and community and MOH staff trained as outlined in the IMCI section \u00a7 Two weighing sessions were observed during the MTE, using an observation checklist which focused on correct weighing procedure and counseling. Some of the observations included not calibrating the scale, incorrectly using the educational materials, and not reaching an agreement with the mother on a behavior change. In general the CHWs doing the weighing were able to correctly calculate the nutritional s tatus of the child and correctly read the weight. Counseling sessions observed were generally of good quality. \u00a7 Measurements for weight, height, and hemoglobin levels were taken for children under two years of age, and hemoglobin levels for mothers during t he KPC Survey at baseline and midterm. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks Baseline MTE Final Target % of children aged 0 -23 months, weighed in the last four months according to growth monitoring card. 68% (62.0 -74.0) 86% (81.5 -90.5) 91% % of child ren aged 0 -23 months old with satisfactory growth according to weight (<2Z) 92% (88.5 -95.5) 0 -23 months old with no anemia. Hb (51.9 -64.1) 53% The first indicator showed a sta tistically significant improvement in the percentage of children being weighed, clearly showing the impact of the PROCOSAN program. The indicator for children with anemia demonstrated an increase in cases; this may be due to the lack of an adequate supply of iron, resulting in it only being used for the treatment of anemia, not for prevention. 18 The indicator on malnutrition (weight for age) was a maintenance target, which the project achieved. The way in which the indicator is expressed: percent of childr en with \"satisfactory growth\", is misleading, as the anthropometric measurement weight for age gives the nutritional status at a specific point in time, it is an indication of underweight or normal weight, but does not necessarily measure \"growth\". The way the indicator is worded as a Rapid Catch Indicator more clearly defines what the weight for age measurement actually measures (% of children aged 0 -23 months with low weight (weight for age) (<2Z)). d. Follow -up and Next Steps One of the planned activiti es in IMCI was the training of MOH staff in logistics management. This has not been done, but obviously logistics could be one of the factors limiting the adequate supply of essential drugs and supplies. PD Hearth was included in the DIP but is not recomm ended due to other priorities on staff time, the lack of sufficient MOH staff to monitor the strategy, and the level of malnutrition which at 31%, (according to the MTE KPC survey for children <1 z score below the mean) is lower than the 35% suggested by H earth guidelines. During MTE interviews various stakeholders were asked about the changes in health behaviors which resulted from CSP activities. One of the most commonly mentioned changes was an increased appreciation and validation of local foods. The high use of overly processed foods is increasingly becoming an important issue in Nicaragua. An educational emphasis on the detrimental effects of soda pop, snack foods, candy, etc. and on use of locally available nutritious foods, particularly sources of Vitamin A and iron is critical. There is an important issue in the comparison between the traditional child's health card (Road to Health) and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth (based on expected weight gain), both of which are routinely used. A child could be classified as growing well in one system and growing poorly in the other. The issue came up during the MTE at both the community and the health facility level. The CSP should work with SILAIS and/or NICASALUD to identify guidelines for reso lving the discrepancy between the child health cards and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth. Breastfeeding promotion (BF) (10%) a. Activities proposed in DIP \u00a7 conduct formative research to identify the key determinants that influence the early in itiation of BF and exclusive BF for the first six months of life ; \u00a7 400 CHW will be trained in BF and Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM); \u00a7 110 MOH providers will be trained in counseling techniques; \u00a7 create an environment of support and encouragement for optimal BF within health facilities and among staff; \u00a7 increase awareness among community members about the benefits of breastfeeding; \u00a7 mothers' clubs will be formed in the 80 priority communities and fathers will be invited to participate in select activities; \u00a7 suppo rt the MOH's Baby and Mother Friendly strategy; \u00a7 200 communities will receive educational materials on BF. 19 b. Progress Made In 1998 all of the HCs and the hospital were certified by UNICEF as baby friendly health units. The annual recertification was ne ver conducted. There was good evidence in the facilities visited during the MTE that a focus on encouraging breastfeeding continues as a priority and the 11 steps for breastfeeding are being followed. Mothers' Clubs are formed in 52 of the 80 priority co mmunities. The involvement of men in these groups was not documented, but anecdotal information suggests that at least some of the groups involve men. Completed training was detailed in the IMCI section. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks Baseline MTE Final Target % of children aged 0 - 23 months old who were breastfed within the first hour after birth 68% (62.1 -73.9) 71% (65.4 -76.6) 75% % of infants aged 0 -5 months who received only breast milk in the past 24 hours 56% (43.5 -68.5) 52% (43.0 -61.0) 70% The changes in the two indicators for BF were not statistically significant, but it is of concern that the percent of infants who are exclusively breastfeeding shows a declining tendency. d. Follow -up and Next Steps Due to the decrease in exclusive breastfeeding the CSP needs to further study the key determinants that influence the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life . The formation of support groups was an activity mentioned in the DIP, b ut the conception of this strategy differs from what is normally thought of as support groups. The MOH, on the municipal level, forms a group of women from different communities who receive training in health topics to act as support to mothers' clubs for their community. The topics covered include all maternal - child health topics. Follow -up is needed to determine the effectiveness of this approach and to determine what additional support is needed to make these groups more effective in encouraging exclusiv e BF. Immunization (EPI) 7% a. Activities proposed in DIP \u00a7 provide technical and logistical assistance to the MOH to increase immunization coverage; \u00a7 strengthen the skills of health staff in applying IMCI protocols for child immunization; \u00a7 work with the SI LAIS to strengthen the management of vaccine supply and fortify the cold chain; \u00a7 support the MOH during Campaigns; \u00a7 diminish the 'lost opportunities' to vaccinate children. b. Progress Made \u00a7 The CSP has provided logistical support for national vaccination campaigns; 20 \u00a7 Immunization status is routinely monitored during PROCOSAN weighing sessions; \u00a7 Children without vaccinations are referred to nearest \u00a7 Training in EPI for Brigadistas, TBAs and MOH personnel was detailed in the I MCI section. c. Progress in Relation to Benchmarks Baseline MTE Final Target % of children 12 -23 months fully immunized (BCG, OPV3, (74.1 The indicator for immunization showed an inc rease, and has surpassed the final target. The difference is not statistically significant. d. Follow -up and Next Steps The main focus of the CSP has been to provide logistical support to the MOH in national vaccination campaigns. This methodology is inc reasingly being questioned as to its effectiveness when vaccination rates are relatively high. The provision of vaccines house -to-house encourages people to not go to the health facility for integrated care, but to only receive the vaccine. This would be a n interesting topic for research on the effectiveness of campaigns when coverage is high. Some facilities do not offer routine immunizations, particularly health posts, some of which lack refrigerators. c. New tools or approaches Operations Research According to the DIP, the following Operations Research was planned: Operations research will be implemented to 1) evaluate the perceived quality of care for mothers having deliveries in health units using tools from the Guide ; 2) evaluate adequacy of the Guide's (FFHU) tools to monitor quality in health facilities; 3) identify barriers for early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding; 4) document the introduction of Community Based Distribution Agents in areas that lack access to FP and asse ss the quality of FP counseling offered by the Community Based Distribution Agents, and 5) to identify success stories and lessons from CORUs. Additional Operations Research opportunities may be identified in cooperation with the SILAIS, and may include 1 ) evaluating distance learning modules and methodologies (in collaboration with the Automous University of Nicaragua), 3) field testing new HIS forms, and 4) creating job aids for health facility staff, especially in the area of normal births. Only the first mentioned qualitative study has been carried out. It is not recommended to simply complete the other planned research. The CSP needs to develop a workplan for the next two and a half years, including well defined qualitative studies to help guide th eir work in the future. Involvement of Private Sector An interesting new approach taken by this project has been the involvement of private sector coffee growers. Some of the growers are part of an association which works with the CSP, while others collab orate individually. The coffee growers helped to plan the project and provided information about their population for the development of the DIP. 21 The work with the project varies from farm to farm, but in general the coffee growers are providing: \u00a7 A place to have PROCOSAN sessions (14 per month); \u00a7 Time off for the Brigadista to conduct the weighing and time off for mothers to attend ; \u00a7 Some overseers encourage the attendance of mothers at the sessions ; \u00a7 Capital and training for revolving drug funds through PRO SALUD; \u00a7 Purchase of some materials -scales, etc.; \u00a7 A salary for one person to run the health clinic who is trained and supported by MOH/HOPE through monthly visits; \u00a7 Infrastructure for the clinic. Some had a health post previously, but now have medicines available; \u00a7 Health services for the surrounding communities and their permanent staff; \u00a7 Formation of mothers' clubs in some haciendas in coordination with nearest health facility; \u00a7 Transportation in cases of health emergencies. HOPE and PROSALUD provide supervis ion of the revolving drug funds and MOH supervises epidemiological reporting, hygiene and living conditions, and use of pesticides. The organization PROFAMILIA provides FP services. The use of SODIS (Solar disinfection of water) is encouraged on the coffee growing haciendas. Recommendations for Section B.1 . Technical Approach include the following: 1. It is suggested that Results Indicator 1 be changed to measure two or more prenatal visits, since the data is available for baseline and MTE surveys and repres ents a more alarming trend in adequate prenatal attention. 2. HOPE staff should receive technical assistance on HIV/AIDS. 3. Using the PROCOSAN methodology all communities are supposed to have quarterly meetings to discuss health issues based on children's gro wth. These are rarely carried out and would be an excellent future activity for the CSP to strengthen the use of nutrition, and IMCI information. 4. The CSP should investigate traditional locally available liquids such as rice water, barley water or coconu t water and encourage the use of these liquids during episodes of diarrhea. 5. The CSP should work with SILAIS and/or NICASALUD to identify guidelines for resolving the discrepancy between the child health cards and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growt h. 6. Due to the decrease in exclusive breastfeeding the CSP needs to further study the key determinants that influence the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life . 22 7. The CSP needs to develop a workplan for the next two and a half years, including well defined qualitative studies to help guide their work in the future. 2. Cross -cutting approaches a. Community Mobilization In general, communities have responded favorably to the project activities and s ee a potential role in the future for sustaining activities through increased organization. The three main strategies for community mobilization used by the CSP are: 1. Use of community health workers to provide community level health activities and a link with governmental health services (Brigadistas and TBAs) 2. Formation of mothers' (and in some cases fathers') clubs for education sessions and to help with PROCOSAN sessions 3. Formation of community committees for health emergencies Brigadistas and TBA s The longevity of the Brigadistas and TBAs is impressive. Of the nine Brigadistas interviewed during the MTE, four had worked for longer than five years, and an additional four had worked between two and five years. Of the eight TBAs interviewed, five had more than 20 years of experience. More than half of the Brigadistas and all of the TBAs interviewed were women. The CSP staff feels that the Brigadistas and TBAs are not motivated, and that the project should provide some material stimulus such as hats, r aincoats, or tee shirts. All staff and volunteers, at all levels, need to be motivated, mainly through non -economic stimulus such as public recognition of good work, opportunities to exchange experiences, diplomas for completing training activities, ident ification cards, etc. Simple things like hats or tee shirts should also be considered for stimulus and team building. Most Brigadistas and TBAs said that they received regular supervision and many specified that either HOPE or MOH visited on a monthly bas is. Two mentioned that they were not visited regularly, but they were able to coordinate activities during the bimonthly meetings. The majority of Brigadistas and TBAs are reporting monthly and using the referral system. Formation of community committees for emergency planning in cases of adverse obstetric and/or pediatric health situations is a major focus of the MNC strategy. Their role includes the organization of emergency transportation brigades and the collection of funds (usually through raffles) th at can be borrowed by community members for transportation to a HC or hospital. There have been differing experiences in the pay back rates of these \"loans\". The committees interviewed during the MTE were composed of approximately 50% women. This strateg y provides an opportunity for women to develop leadership skills within the community. The current committees are focused on a narrow task. In MTE interviews they expressed their main role as transportation and secondary role as providing counseling when someone was ill. They also provide a support system for the Brigadista and TBA (who are usually also members of the committee). 23 The strengthening of community organizations was not a specific project strategy, but from a sustainability point of view is an important component of any health or development project. One of the keys to sustainability is having social involvement and a strong community structure, linked with municipal authorities. HOPE and MOH should jointly develop a strategy for the formatio n of community committees; to expand their role in the community if there is a gap, or to coordinate with existing community structures. The role of the committee should be determined according to the needs of the community. Part of the strategy should be to encourage coordination with other organizations and the municipality and to obtain recognition by Mayor's office. The CSP has had several positive experiences in the development of community committees with a wider area of influence than caring for hea lth emergencies. Barriers An important factor that has impacted project implementation is competing community priorities due to the presence of multiple organizations in the department. Project Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Carita s and the Partners of the Americas -Wisconsin projects all implement similar USAID funded maternal child health activities within Jinotega, as well as other governmental projects. Some of the projects provide cash stipends through paid community members, ra ther than volunteers. Other projects provide food donations. All of these factors make working within the department a challenge of coordination and because of differing levels of benefits, especially food distribution. Some community members are not moti vated to participate in a project that offers no tangible benefits. When community members were asked during the MTE if there were families with small children who were not participating in project activities, in most communities the response was \"yes, so me\". The reasons for the non -participation included: People seek care from private clinics/doctors Children are being weighed by another project (Red de Proteccion) Lack of interest The CSP is active in coordinating with other organizations at both a local and national level through involvement in networks such as NicaSalud and departmental committees. According to interviews as part of the MTE process, community workers actively seek out families that do not participate in PROCOSAN activities. b. Communic ation for Behavior Change The main strategy for BCC is the use of counseling during PROCOSAN sessions, home visits and at health facilities. The ECMAC (family planning) counselors have received training in counseling using the ACCEDA method, as was previou sly discussed in the section on Child Spacing. Counseling skills are also incorporated into other training courses, for example PROCOSAN. The PROCOSAN counseling method incorporates negotiating with the mother on new practices which she can adopt. A post er is given to each mother on child feeding behaviors as a reminder of the new practice she has agreed to try. Brigadistas have flipcharts on child feeding to use in counseling sessions. Both of the above mentioned materials are very complex and require excellent training and follow -up with the Brigadistas to ensure they are being used effectively. 24 The quality of all training activities needs to be monitored so that if strategies are not working, they can be modified. If they are effective in transferring knowledge, a system for monitoring how that knowledge is being put into practice needs to be developed. A system for monitoring the quality of training and the effectiveness of counseling and other communication methods needs to be developed. This monitor ing system should include a definition of indicators, selection of instruments for monitoring, and planning of follow -up activities. The CSP has introduced a good system for adult education (see Highlights page); AMATE -for training of more than four hour s and IDRE -for training of less than four hours. These methods are also used for planning monthly meetings for Brigadistas and TBAs and have been taught to Brigadistas for planning health talks with mothers. The DIP described the methodology as follows. The methodology used in this approach is called AMATE in Spanish and consists of five components: Animation ('Liveliness') \u2014getting the audience prepared and interested in learning; Motivation \u2014stimulating the curiosity of the audience, introducing the topic and finding out what the audience already knows; Appropriation \u2014testing what the audience knows and challenging assumptions through exchange of knowledge, ideas, experiences and the introduction of new information and constructing/incorporating the new ide as/knowledge; Transference \u2014applying the theory to practical situations, working with new knowledge and skills creatively; and Evaluation \u2014demonstrating the integration and connection of new knowledge and skills as evidenced by the results (products) created . IDRE is a simplified version for shorter training sessions and includes the steps of Introduction; Development of the topic; Reflection on use of the new information; and Evaluation. AMATE - IDRE is well liked as a methodology and has had a wider impac t outside of the CSP as MOH and other NGO staff adopt the methodology. SILAIS staff has been receiving weekly training on its use. The CSP has received good technical assistance from Hope's Regional Health Education Specialist, Marta Arce. Two manuals w ere developed -Yes, You Can Play with Health , for AMATE and Good Advice Is Easy to Follow for counseling. HOPE, MOH and other NGOs received training on the use of these two manuals. In addition to the PROCOSAN materials, Project HOPE has t he Mothers' Remi nder Material Project, funded by GlaxoSmithKline as a multi -country initiative to provide mothers and caregivers with basic information to enable them to recognize and respond to the danger signs of childhood illness and before, during and after delivery . Nicaragua, along with Malawi and Ghana, was among the first of 9 countries where testing of these materials has taken place (prior to this CSP). These materials, which take into account the low literacy rates in Jinotega, have already been tested and refi ned by Project HOPE in Nicaragua. The materials, for mothers and mother -to-be, are in the form of two attractive, attention -getting calendars. The Mothers' Reminder Material on childhood illnesses was distributed prior to the beginning of this project. The CSP will distribute 10,000 copies of the Mothers -to-be Reminder Materials on maternal danger signs in Jinotega in the near future. Community members felt that the project had been able to change behaviors in: increased use of FP and prenatal care, impr oved levels of vaccinations, and better hygiene. The CSP staff felt the 25 project had been able to change behaviors in: improved hygiene and use of latrines, more institutional births, more involvement of men, use of FP, and community organization. MOH staff felt that improved practices were the use of local resources for better nutrition and encouraging parents to be more involved in caring for their children. Results from the KPC were mixed; some behaviors have changed, such as increased use of contracept ives and children being weighed. Other behaviors were not changed such as exclusive breastfeeding and home management of diarrhea. The CSP should develop a comprehensive BCC plan which would include an IEC strategy and Training Plan, for the remainder of the project, including the uses of alternative means for the dissemination of IMCI and MNC messages. The plan should include how the quality of training can be monitored and how the effectiveness of different approaches can be measured; for example, how e ffective is counseling? Is the cascade approach working? Are home visits and mothers' clubs an effective way to reach families? The focus should be on checking assumptions that what is being done is having a real effect on the behaviors of the population. The plan should consider and respond to the following questions. \u00a7 What is the optimal size of groups to participate in training events? \u00a7 What are the training needs of the Brigadistas and TBAs as defined by their job descriptions and knowledge/ skills requir ements and taking into consideration the training they have already received? \u00a7 What does a basic competency -based curriculum for Brigadistas and TBAs look like? \u00a7 What is the optimal length of time for training considering the needs of participants? \u00a7 How can training be made more practical? \u00a7 What system do we need to monitor changes in knowledge and practices amongst Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff? \u00a7 How can other actors (men) be involved in educational events? \u00a7 How can the needs of the participants be tak en into consideration? c. Capacity Building Approach There were no capacity building objectives or indicators developed for this project. i. Strengthening the PVO Organization Headquarters Since January 2002, Project HOPE HQ has been engaged in a proces s of defining the strategic direction for its growth and development. The process has involved HOPE's staff, Board, donors, and partners in thirty -two countries. The process was led by a management consulting firm with experience in organizational strength ening, technology and operations. This process helped Project HOPE develop a focused strategic approach centered on excellence in six \"core themes\": infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis), women and children's health, health professional educati on, health systems and facilities, humanitarian assistance, and the Health Affairs Journal. The inclusion of women and children's health was primarily due to Project HOPE's 20 years of experience implementing maternal and child health programs worldwide. Through USAID's CSHGP, Project HOPE has directly benefited more than 1.2 million children under five and more than 1.2 million women of reproductive age since 1985, when HOPE received a USAID Child Survival grant during the first funding cycle (CS -1). 26 Project HOPE has made strategic changes in its organizational structure, including the composition of HQ -based technical directors to provide expertise in core themes, particularly in HIV/AIDS and health of women and children. HOPE has recently adopted monit oring and evaluation standards for all its programs worldwide. These standards, aimed to improve Project HOPE's capacity to implement quality projects, are based on the \"results -based\" management practices followed by Project HOPE primarily from the 28 gra nts awarded by the USAID's CSHGP since 1985. HOPE is continuously improving global knowledge dissemination through the use of innovative Information Technology tools and shares experiences with more than 35 PVOs at the international level through its act ive participation in the CORE group. Capacity Assessment The organizational capacity building assessment plan was described in the DIP as follows. Project HOPE also plans to conduct a capacity assessment of Project HOPE /Nicaragua and its main partne r, the SILAIS. The capacity assessment is an intensive effort that will start with an assessment of Project HOPE/Jinotega starting in October 2003, followed later by an assessment of the SILAIS. The outside organization that will lead Project HOPE though the capacity assessment is Pact, the same entity that successfully worked with Project HOPE/Guatemala in a similar exercise last year. The assessment of Project HOPE/Jinotega will last about three weeks and leads the organization through a series of self -assessments in key areas of management, human resources, processes, etc. that influence organizational capacity. An Institutional Assessment was carried out by PACT in October of 2003. PACT staff conducted a one -week workshop in Jinotega working with f ield staff to assess organizational strengths and weaknesses at Project HOPE/ Nicaragua with the purpose to improve overall performance. Some results were seen from this exercise, but in general, there was no follow -up to the action plan of sixteen lines o f action developed during the process. The lack of follow -up may be attributed to the fact that the many tasks were not prioritized, making the effort seem unmanageable. A strategic planning session, lead by an outside consultant, was conducted during 20 04 which helped HOPE/Nicaragua to redefine their future directions and potential expansion. No institutional assessment was conducted with SILAIS. The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, impl emented and monitored. It is suggested that the implementation of the work plan be evaluated as part of the final evaluation. An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS (not the PACT methodology ) to identify specific actions for capac ity building based on the needs of SILAIS. If HOPE does not have the expertise to provide capacity building, links with organizations that can provide TA should be investigated. Assistance should be explored in management training, logistics, strategic pla nning , supportive supervision, and human resource management. Networking/Coordination The need for good coordination with other PVO/NGOs is critical in this project. PCI, CRS/Caritas and the Partners of the Americas -Wisconsin projects all implement simil ar USAID 27 funded maternal child health activities within Jinotega, as do other governmental projects. The Ministry of the Family (Red de Protecci\u00f3n ) receives funds from the World Bank as part of the poverty reduction initiative to provide services to the po orest families in two municipalities in Jinotega. They provide quarterly growth monitoring, vaccinations and cash stipends through paid community members, rather than volunteers. Other projects, such as Cuculmeca and PCI provide food donations in the area. All of these factors make working within the department a challenge of coordination with competing priorities and community perceptions of tangible vs. intangible benefits. Project HOPE is the only one with department wide coverage, the other organizatio ns work within select municipalities. HOPE maintains good relations with the other organizations in Jinotega, as well as with CARE in neighboring Matagalpa. There are opportunities for sharing experiences and defining geographical areas but there is still substantial overlap. Many training sessions for MOH staff are conducted through cost -sharing between two or more PVOs, as most of the organizations have a joint objective of strengthening the MOH. In Jinotega, Project HOPE represents all NGOs working in th e region on the Departmental Health Committee. Project HOPE/Nicaragua is an active member, and currently a member of the Board of Directors, of NicaSalud, a PVO/NGO Network in Nicaragua that provides a forum for coordination and sharing of experiences, as well as providing technical assistance for its members. NicaSalud has improved coordination and sharing among organizations and advocacy has been strengthened through membership in NicaSalud. There are also regional sub -committees, for example PVOs in Jinotega and Matagalpa work together on information systems (CARE, HOPE, Partners in the Americas -Wisconsin, CRS, and PCI). Another opportunity for networking exists through HOPE's involvement in USAID/Nicaragua's SO3 group. USAID arranges quarterly meeting s of the organizations receiving funds in health and social development for sharing experiences and reporting advances. PROSIC is a USAID funded maternal child health with approximately the same objectives and goals as the CSP, working also in Jinotega. F unds are channeled through NicaSalud, with TA provided by FANTA. In Jinotega PROSIC is being implemented by Project HOPE, PCI, CRS/Caritas and the Partners of the Americas -Wisconsin, and by CARE in Matagalpa. There are two other PROSIC projects, one being implemented by Plan International and Save the Children, and a third by ADRA. ii. Strengthening Local Partner Organizations Feedback from the MOH and other partners is generally positive as to the importance of the role HOPE is playing in providing tech nical and logistical support. In interviews it was mentioned that because the CSP implements MOH programs, the coordination is much easier than with other projects that utilize differing strategies. Some MOH staff reported being involved in the planning pr ocess and a few had copies of project objectives. There is a positive view that HOPE, is still able to motivate communities to participate, even though food is not distributed as part of health activities, This is attributed to health talks and counseling and encouraging people to use local resources. Another important positive observation by the MOH concerning the CSP is that PROCOSAN is being implemented in at -risk communities, which were selected by the MOH and the project is working in isolated commun ities, not just the most accessible ones 28 One problem is that MOH staff sees the health strategies as \"belonging\" to the implementing NGO, not to them and as adding on extra work to their already busy schedule. PVOs need to learn to better negotiate with t he MOH with a focus on how to change institutional culture and behaviors. One step that has fortified ties between the MOH and HOPE has been the institutionalization of some pilot programs such as Birth Planning, PROCOSAN, and SICO on a national level. Though planned, no institutional assessment has been conducted with the principal partner, SILAIS, the departmental level of the MOH. No joint plan was developed for strengthening the capacity of SILAIS based on what SILAIS felt they needed strengthened. Du ring the MTE, MOH team members were able to identify very concrete ways which the CSP could provide support, such as management strengthening, further guidance on TQM, management of files and strategic planning. SILAIS staff has received training in TQM ( Total Quality Management) and AMATE -IDRE and many were involved in the sustainability workshop conducted by CSTS. The training in AMATE -IDRE is an ongoing training being held in weekly sessions. The CSP Specialists felt that institutional strengthening of SILAIS has led to improved leadership at both that level and the municipal level. Work with the MOH has lead to a shared visio n of quality and sustainability. There is a need to improve planning, monitoring, and evaluation between HOPE, SILAIS and the municipal levels. Additional activities conducted for strengthening health facilities and health workers are included in the next section. According to the DIP: With respect to capacity building, HOPE will facilitate the establishment of Department - and Municipality -level Health Councils \u2014to include representatives of SILAIS (MOH Department - level), municipalities, private coffee plantations and associations, PVOs, NGOs, community leaders, health providers, and international donors \u2014to guide and extend the pro ject. Program staff will work with constituent groups to train key leaders and supervisors, establish planning systems, develop informational tools and procedures for evaluation, and develop their overall capacities to design and effectively implement CS activities. This strengthening of the municipal and departmental councils has not occurred, as the councils are formed by the MOH as ad hoc committees and only used for specific tasks, such as a disease outbreak or the national vaccination campaign. They are not an ongoing decision making body. Members include the MOH, HOPE and other international and local NGOs, such as AVODEC, Cuculmeca, PCI, CRS, etc. Human resource problems dominate the MOH reality there is not sufficient staff, many are not adequat ely trained and they rotate very frequently. Some HPs are closed frequently due to staff shortages. Jinotega is considered by many to be an undesirable place to work due to the isolation and there is no financial incentive for working there. There are sev eral supplementary funds for hiring staff, which also contributes to the frequent turnover. Due to the number of projects in the area, there is also a migration from the MOH to projects. SILAIS reported that there are 90 29 unfilled positions in the departm ent according to MOH's plan. These limitations have made progress difficult and underscore the need for improved planning, coordination, and training. One of the realities of working in Jinotega is the continuous rotation and shortage of human resources. HOPE and MOH should develop strategies for working within the human resource limitations of the department, such as a self guided system for continuous training continuing education opportunities, and orientation for new staff. iii. Health Facilities/ Hea lth Worker Strengthening The CSP has focused their efforts on strengthening health facilities and health workers in four principal areas: 1) training (which will be discussed in the next section); 2) establishing links with the communities; 3) supervision ; and 4) quality of care. Links with the Community The referral system has been strengthened through training, supervision and provision of referral forms. This vital link to the communities will need additional strengthening in the future but the majorit y of community workers interviewed during the MTE reported that the system was working well. This system provides a good means of improving communication between MOH staff and community workers. The use of regularly scheduled monthly or bimonthly meeting s has been an excellent strategy for indirect supervision of Brigadistas and TBAs. The meetings provide an opportunity for training, collection of information, re -supply of materials, and sharing of experiences. This strategy is a very sustainable way for the HC/HP staff to link with the vital community workers. This strategy could be further strengthened by limiting the size of the groups (some groups being as large as 50 -60 participants), through having sector meetings and using the meetings as an opport unity to analyze and use information for decision making. A potential link, which has not been sufficiently exploited, is to strengthen the MOH involvement with community committees. During the MTE, one of the health facilities reported that they work wi th the community development committee with good success. Models where civil society is being involved in the functioning of health facilities could be identified and replicated. Supervision One of the main tools the MOH has for supervision and health fa cility assessments is the former Fully Functioning Health Unit tool, now called AMAS (Abordaje para el Mejoramiento de la Atenci\u00f3n en Salud Carrying out the Improvement in Health Care) . AMAS consists of standards and checklists focusing on thirteen key a reas that impact quality of care and service delivery and focuses on the physical environment of the health facility, including equipment and supplies; the management and the quality of care provided by the staff; existence and stability of human resources ; the satisfaction of clients; and the involvement of the community in creating a culture of quality health care. Each facility (health center and post) is expected to be assessed once every six months. The tool was recently modified with TA from Managem ent Sciences for Health but has had limited use to date. There is software available for computerizing the results. The original plan in the DIP was to identify gaps in the AMAS system and supplement it with tools from the COPE (or similar) methodology, pa rticularly focusing on health worker 30 knowledge and skills. The project decided they would not introduce additional tools. Other tools are available for supervision such as the IMCI Supervision checklist, and monitoring of quality standards. Quality Qualit y standards have been established by central level MOH for all major interventions. The Nicaraguan National University trained six municipal teams and the Project HOPE technical team in Total Quality Management (TQM). . S even of the eight municipalities ha ve a quality committee with responsibility for leading quality initiatives and monitoring quality standards. In an interview with the chairman of the quality committee in one municipality, she stated that activities have been started, but enthusiasm for me eting regularly and continuing with quality initiatives was limited. Several studies were conducted by the CSP on organizational climate at the health facility level. These studies included patient flow, time studies, and user satisfaction. One was done in Bocay in August 2002 before this project started. An improvement plan was developed in Yali in March 2003, another in El Cua in September 2004 which included a presentation of steps to improving. A study conducted in one HC in Pantasma in March 2004 f ound that 91% of a person's time was spent waiting and 9% in contact with health staff, this was repeated in July 2004 and improved to 83% spent waiting and 17% time with health personnel. In September 2004 a similar study was conducted in one HC in Bocay which found 86% of time is spent waiting and 14% in contact. There was no evidence of follow -up to this study but results were shared with the SILAIS. CSP Staff felt there has been an improvement in the quality of health services, especially in caring att itude of health staff, prioritization of services based on triage, use of the birth plan, and referral system. MOH staff felt it has been beneficial for them to receive feedback from the communities through the monthly meetings and that there was now a bet ter flow of information and counseling. During MTE interviews with community members the most common definition of quality of health care services is if they were given drugs. They also felt they were treated faster, that priority was given to very sick pe ople, and that there was more education. iv. Training According to the DIP: The project's approach to training is somewhat different than what was presented in the proposal. Project HOPE had characterized its approach to training as a cascade \u2014where the project would train master trainers, who would train the highest level of health care worker, who would in turn train the next level down, etc. This approach assumes that those trained are good trainers, and that little quality is lost as one progresses d own through the system to the level of the community health volunteers, who are often the first point of contact for clients entering the system. In discussions with the SILAIS, the project developed an alternative approach to training where: 1) Project H OPE will assist the MOH to train a cadre of 54 facilitators who work for the SILAIS across Jinotega; 2) the facilitators will train other MOH staff, at first with assistance from Project HOPE, and 3) wherever possible, the facilitators would train teams of health care providers from the same area together, eliminating to the greatest extent possible the number of health providers who are not directly trained by a facilitator. 31 The training of a cadre of 54 trainers has not been done due to the rotation of personnel. Only 1 -2 people per municipality have been trained. PROSIC and other NGOs have also trained additional trainers in some municipalities. In some cases Central MOH personnel trained national facilitators (including NGOs) to replicate the training at the municipal level. Other times Central MOH trained the SILAIS to replicate the training events at the municipalities. The CSP is currently training the SILAIS technical team in the AMATE/IDRE methodology so that they will be the multiplying agents for the methodology at the municipal level for trainers and educators of the MOH. One of the strategies planned in the DIP was to offer self -learning modules for health staff as a way to improve skills and provide accreditation to staff through the universit y system. The proposal was to use a series of comprehensive distance -learning modules developed by MSH/Prosalud. Early feedback on the use of these modules indicated resistance to the onerous reading requirements in this type of training. Therefore, Projec t HOPE proposed to adapt the materials to be more user -friendly, i.e. experimenting with audiotapes and virtual interactive media. This strategy has not been implemented. CSP staff reported an adverse experience by other organizations in using this strat egy as the reason for not implementing it. This was based on the experience of Prosalud and MSH in other parts of the country. As a substitution for the planned activity, the project decided instead to focus on improving health staff knowledge and skills through supportive supervision in coordination with MOH. d. Sustainability Strategy There were no sustainability objectives or indicators developed for this project. CSTS provided technical assistance to the HOPE CSP in February 2004 in the use of the Ch ild Survival Sustainability Assessment Framework (CSSA). The HOPE/Nicaragua team and local partners engaged in a process of visioning a positive future for the community; classifying their key project activities along the dimensions of the framework; analy zing existing data to determine their present state in relation to the vision created, and planning strategically to improve the present state through building community and partner capacity to maintain health outcomes. The outcome of this technical assis tance was the development of an action plan for increasing community and local partner capacities for implementing PROCOSAN, and identification of next steps required to secure partner buy -in to the action plan. This action plan focused on the gradual tra nsition of implementation responsibilities to partners and communities over the remaining years of the project. Because the CSSA was not conducted during the first half -year of the project the specific activities related to sustainability were not includ ed in the DIP. Nevertheless, the TA did allow HOPE and partners to reflect on the multi -dimensional nature of sustainability within the context of the PROCOSAN program. Detailed work was only carried out on component 1 of dimension 2: Local organizational capacity. There has been little follow -up on the sustainability exercise and the action plan which was developed has not been monitored. A separate analysis using TQM tools was carried out on the same component. An action plan was developed, but not monito red. 32 During the MTE, community members were asked about what actions they felt they could take to sustain the health activities. Mothers in almost half of the groups interviewed said they could help the Brigadistas by paying for their transportation when they attend training, others said by helping them during weighing sessions, preparing lunch for them when they had to walk a distance, encouraging them to attend training, telling them how important their work was, and having raffles to help them. Communit ies have positive ideas but this potential means to promote sustainability is not being tapped by the project. The CSP is using a revolving fund strategy for eight drug funds, the majority of which are being implemented by private sector coffee growers. B y working within the existing PROSALUD structure the sustainability of these important activities to provide access to drugs is very plausible. Many of the MOH programs which are being supported by the CSP rely heavily on expensive material inputs, partic ularly PROCOSAN. Currently educational materials are paid for by the project for PROCOSAN and maternal health. The question for the future is whether the MOH has sufficient funds, and political will, to pay for these inputs. A positive role for the CSP cou ld be to investigate alternative sources of funding and cost -saving measures which would make the programs more sustainable. One example was the use of black and white Birth Plans rather than the more expensive color copies. Project HOPE has an active Hu manitarian Assistance Program, through which a large amount of pharmaceutical products are obtained as part of Gift -In-Kind (GIK) donations. The national donation level during the life of this project has been 9.5 million dollars, 2.77 million of that going to Jinotega. The long term impact of these donations has not been well studied and the long term commitment of the organization to continue is not ensured. Donations of medicines to the MOH have been an important role for HOPE and one of the most visible impacts of the CSP. There are some issues still pending which will need to be addressed in the future. \u00a7 With improvements in referrals, links with communities and quality of care, demand has increased. This leads to improved coverage ; but the question i s, can the demand be met with current resources? \u00a7 Community definition of quality is whether drugs are available; the CSP is supplying drugs outside of the MOH's ability to provide them. When the CSP ends, will a shortage of drugs result in decreased use o f health services? These issues need to be addressed by all stakeholders and with continuing dialogue concerning the transition plan and long term sustainability. Develop a sustainability plan based on the work started with the CSSA model, including plan ning with communities, based on the use of local resources for problem solving. There have been a number of positive experiences within the project area and in neighboring departments that can be drawn upon in the development of this plan. Recommendation s for B.2.Cross Cutting Approaches include the following: 1. All staff and volunteers, at all levels, need to be motivated, mainly through non - economic stimulus such as public recognition of good work, opportunities to exchange experiences, diplomas for compl eting training activities, identification 33 cards, etc. Simple things like hats or tee shirts should also be considered for stimulus and team building. 2. HOPE and MOH should jointly develop a strategy for the formation of community committees; to expand their role in the community if there is a gap, or to coordinate with existing community structures. 3. A system for monitoring the quality of training and the effectiveness of counseling and other communication methods needs to be developed. 4. The CSP should develop a comprehensive BCC plan, which would include an IEC strategy and Training Plan, for the remainder of the project, including the uses of alternative means for the dissemination of IMCI and MNC messages. 5. The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua shou ld be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored. 6. An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS to identify specific actions for capacity building based on the needs of SILAIS. 7. HOPE and MOH should develop st rategies for working within the human resource limitations of the department, such as a self guided system for continuous training, continuing education opportunities, and orientation for new staff. 8. Develop a sustainability plan based on the work started with the CSSA model, including planning with communities, based on the use of local resources for problem solving. C. Program Management 1. Planning Project staff, partners and the community were all involved in developing the DIP. Staff reportedly revie w their workplans every two weeks and have a monthly meeting for evaluation and planning purposes. An annual analysis of KPC results is conducted, and a joint meeting held with MOH and HOPE to present information on project advances. Although communities a nd partners understand the general project goals (decrease infant/maternal mortality), they do not understand the project strategies and indicators. The DIP has never been translated from English to Spanish so the document could be effectively shared with partners. Only the workplan with results and process indicators was translated, but almost no partners reported that they had a copy. Program monitoring of process indicators has not been used for planning and/or revising program implementation because t he project has not been monitoring process indicators; only results indicators. Information collected during annual KPC Surveys was processed, discussed internally and then shared with the MOH and other partners. Data from this analysis is included in the preparation of the annual work plans HOPE and SILAIS. One of the main suggestions made in MTE interviews with MOH staff was that the planning system between HOPE and the MOH needs to be improved and be based on decisions made as equal partners. 2. Staff Tra ining The eight HOPE/Nicaragua staff members entitled Educators came to the CSP with very good prior knowledge and substantial experience with other PVO/NGO projects. A test of technical knowledge was reportedly given to the Educators at the beginning of t he project. The Educators 34 report receiving training in counseling, IMCI, AMATE -IDRE, Information management and use of Portable Digital Assistant devices (PDAs), Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), Obstetric Emergencies, PROCOSAN, FP, ECMAC, MOH's HIS, and solar disinfection of water (SODIS). All of the four original technical specialists held key roles in prior Project HOPE/Nicaragua projects. All of them have experience working for the MOH in Nicaragua, and many also have prior work experience with NGOs or PVOs. The IEC Specialist had the opportunity to travel to Peru to take part in a Regional Training activity of the Education Coordinators for all Latin American countries. The specific task for this meeting was the identification of key indicators for the monitoring process of the educational component of the projects. 3. Supervision of Program Staff Supervision of the Educators and Specialists could be improved as there are no standards for the frequency of supervision visits, or a standardized supe rvision format, except for an IEC checklist for educational activities. Educators feel that they get good support for their activities, but joint field visits would strengthen their work and help in problem solving. 4. Human Resources and Staff Management The Educators are a cohesive group who come to HOPE with good previous experience. They feel that HOPE has a very good reputation in the country and area and has become a major player in health activities and a leader in the department of Jinotega. They fel t that the benefits received from HOPE were good in comparison with other NGOs, such as support for educational activities and the opportunity to purchase their own motorcycle. Currently three administrative staff, three Specialists and three Educators ar e receiving educational subsidies, as well as two MOH staff. Morale is good amongst the Educators and they provide good mutual support. The Educators were given the option (which they all took) of buying the project motorcycles through an installment pla n over the life of the project ($32 X 92 payments= $1750). They thought this was a very fair arrangement and recognized the advantages of this opportunity. Specialists were offered a similar contract to purchase laptops ($1460) over a period of time. Comments from HOPE Specialists include that there is good participation of staff within HOPE, without undue bureaucracy or rigid structures. They did note a confusion with the dual role they play as having both a geographical responsibility (each Specialist i s responsible for two municipalities and supervises two Educators) and their specialty (child health, maternal health, IEC, M&E). Staff turnover has been minimal amongst the Educators. All eight have been with the CSP for over two years. The position of Specialist for maternal health has essentially been vacant since October 2004 (the position was briefly filled April 2005 to May 2005). All other positions are filled with people who have been with HOPE for 5 -7 years. There is a human resources manual a nd all positions have written job descriptions. There were weaknesses identified with the administrative manual during the institutional assessment carried out in 2003. The problems were that the document was in English, was not available to staff, and 35 was a generic manual written by HQ and not specific to HOPE Nicaragua. These issues have been corrected and the Finance Manual was also translated into Spanish Project HOPE has a good reputation for helping staff to gain new skills making them more employabl e when the project ends. Whenever possible HOPE transitions e xisting staff into new projects; all of the Specialists were employed in prior HOPE projects. 5. Financial Management The CSP has an administrator in Managua and an Administrative Assistant in Jinotega. (The Administrative Assistant is also responsible for the PROSIC project implemented by HOPE.) There is good communication between the two via telephone or direct visits. There were some problems in the past with the accounting system, but a modi fied system was introduced in March 2004 which appears to be working well. Project HOPE HQ has established an Internet web page - based pipeline reporting system which has the most recent financial information updated monthly for use by the field offices. 6. Logistics There have been no limitations to project implementation due to logistical concerns, nor are any anticipated in the future. The project has good transportation and communication systems available. A good strategy for ensuring the care of proje ct motorcycles was described in point 4 above. Each of the Educators has a motorcycle. 7. Information Management The CSP needs to seriously re -evaluate the purpose of their M&E activities. The system has numerous problems despite that fact that there are two full time staff (M&E Specialist and MIS Coordinator; who was not included in the proposal and not funded as a full time position in the budget), and receipt of outside technical assistance. There was a misunderstanding about how the KPC should be used within the project as an evaluation, not a monitoring tool, and there has been a deviation of project focus on the development of SIGHOPE, a computerized information system for HOPE with PROCOSAN information. The PROCOSAN information is collected for al l children monthly by HOPE Educators with Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) from the PROCOSAN 'List of Children under 2 Register' in each community. This information includes: Child's name, date of birth, birth weight, age, weight, and monthly updates on weight gain compared with expected weight gain, growth tendency, use of iron supplement, completed immunizations, early stimulation, breastfeeding, introduction of food, morbidity treatments and referral to health unit. This system is being developed in d isregard for the statement in the DIP which says that the main activity would be to \" Support SILAIS in updating and streamlining the government HIS so that managers can collect, analyze and use data at every level\" and that \"t he collection of health inform ation data by CHVs and health units will be the main source of information for monitoring of program indicators and activities progress. Project HOPE purposely will avoid creating a parallel system of data collection\". The SIGHOPE system is linked with a Geographical Positioning System. The DIP states; \"Project HOPE is recently introducing the use of a Geographical Positioning System (GPS) that uses the same PDAs to map out all the rural communities in the program target area. To do so, a 36 geographical inf ormation system will be part of the overall HIS for program management decisions. Adding the GPS component will allow spatial presentation of data analysis results and more effective sharing of information with partners and stakeholders. These tools will e xpand the concept of the use of data for program management at all levels of project implementation with continuous feedback according to progress and problems identified during the monitoring process.\" Quite the opposite has occurred. The GPS, after 2 \u00bd y ears, still does not provide usable information and the focus has not been on the use of data . The system is dependent on technologies which the MOH will be unable to replicate and focuses on the input of information, without having a clear idea of results , or how the information will be used for decision making. Training Database Training information on who has been trained, in what topics, and when is included in a training database in Access. Training is being tracked on an individual basis for all TBAs and Brigadistas. SICO Community Information System The CSP has developed a system in Excel for monitoring the official MOH community information system (SICO), which appears to work well. The SICO itself, however, suffers from problems in implementati on. For example, in the nine communities visited during the MTE, four did not have the SICO Daily Register and three did not have the monthly report form. Further to this, the information is not being used effectively. The CSP has an opportunity to help st rengthen this system, particularly the use of information by the communities for problem solving and decision making. Technical Assistance by the CSP related to Information Management HOPE/Nicaragua's MIS person has provided technical assistance to the M OH in ECMAC and Birth Planning programs. During the month of September 2003, he traveled to Guatemala to provide training to Project HOPE's CSP staff in Quetzaltenango on how to use PDAs for their KPC mid -term survey scheduled for October 2003. KPC When CSP staff was asked about changes in behaviors attributable to the project, the most common response was that behavior change takes time. In view of this truism, it is difficult to understand the logic of completing four complete KPC surveys within two and a half years (March 2003, September 2003, September 2004, March 2005). There has been a miscommunication about the role of the KPC and the LQAS sampling method, in monitoring project progress. This has unfortunately resulted in an unnecessary investment i n staff time and budget with little benefit. A study on the utility of using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in collecting field interview information for the KPC survey was planned but has never been conducted. During the baseline survey 100 cases (c hildren 0 -11 months) were collected through dual methods but a verification study was never run. During the MTE, all 300 cases were collected both on PDA and manually. A detailed discussion concerning problems with the KPC is included in Annex E, and the full report of the KPC conducted at mid -term is included in Annex F. 37 Recommendations on how the KPC/LQAS could be used in the future to enhance project activities include: \u00a7 The KPC survey should not be repeated until the final evaluation; \u00a7 LQAS could be used more creatively, for example, to monitor changes in Brigadistas, TBAs or health staff, not just mothers; \u00a7 Process indicators and a simple monitoring system need to be developed, and utilizing, when possible, existing instruments; \u00a7 MOH indicators should be incorporated into the CSP monitoring system when possible; \u00a7 Take into consideration the precision of evaluation methodologies when setting targets for results indicators. Many of the targets could never be shown to be statistically significant from the baseline; for example, the indicator for percent of mothers with children aged 12 to 23 months old who are not pregnant, desire no more children or are not sure and report using a modern family planning method showed at baseline a level of 65% and the fina l target was set at 70%. The KPC instrument, especially only measuring mothers with children 12 -23 months old, would never show a significant difference between these two numbers. This is a limitation related to the number of interventions selected by the project (8) making it difficult to show measurable change in so many different areas, \u00a7 Information from the KPC is currently in Epi -Info and Access; one person has one system, another person the other. Project Management should select one software system fo r KPC data and define who will be responsible for analyzing KPC information; \u00a7 HOPE, with concurrence from the donor, should consider conduct the end -of-project KPC in the 80 priority communities, not the 730 total communities in the department, due to the large number of other PVO/NGOs working in the same area and the consequence inability to attribute changes to any one agency; \u00a7 LQAS should be part of an ongoing supervision system, not a separate survey activity. Qualitative investigation A qualitative s tudy was carried out in June 2004 on maternal preferences related to where they give birth and who attends them. Eleven focus groups were conducted with mothers, TBAs and health personnel looking at factors influencing of institutional vs. home delivery a nd being attended by health staff vs. TBAs. The investigation was conducted by HOPE and MOH in six of the municipalities of Jinotega and has been used to improve institutional practices, specifically in the involvement of TBAs in institutional births. Use of Information One of the main strategies for guiding the use of information, as presented in the DIP was the use of \"Salas Situacionales\" a forum which would provide Brigadistas and TBAs an opportunity to discuss findings from the information they routin ely collect. This has not been done. The CSP has an excellent strategy of monthly meetings which would be a very appropriate opportunity for teaching analytical skills for decision making. The monthly meetings for Brigadistas and TBAs should be strengthene d to include analysis of information for improved decision making. The concepts of problem solving and evidence -based decision making need to be the focus in the future. The use of information at all levels for decision making needs to be a project priori ty during the second half of the funding cycle. Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, 38 Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff. The use of monthly meetings is an excellent strategy as a first step, but opportuni ties for using information need to be expanded to all levels. 8. Technical and Administrative Support The following technical assistance visits were received by the project: \u00a7 November 2002 by Marta Arce, Regional Health Education Specialist to help draft new job descriptions and define the roles of each of the technical specialists and the introduction of AMATE \u00a7 January 2003 by Juan Carlos Alegre, HQ M&E Specialist to support field staff in the design and preparation for conducting the baseline assessment \u00a7 February 2003 by Ann Davenport, consultant and Virginia Lamprecht, HQ backstop to write the DIP and review objectives and strategies, select and 'finalize' key indicators, and create a \"HOPE vision\" for the project to be used in discussions SILAIS and stakeholders as part of the DIP proc ess. Additional TA was received from Rob Northrup in his role as Acting Director of MCH Unit at HQ from October 2002 through April 2005. Juan Carlos Alegre also provided some technical support for the same period. Bonnie Kittle was hired in April 2005 a s the Director of the Health of Women and Children Unit and is now the technical backstop person for the CSP in Nicaragua. Ms Kittle attended the second half of the MTE. The Regional Director for the Americas (Bob Grabman) visited the project on four occa sions for managerial oversight. The project also received the visit of Dr. Randy Wykoff, Senior VP of Project HOPE's International Division during the second quarter of the project. Administrative support has been ongoing with the assistance of two HQ st aff: the Assistant Regional Director and the Financial Program Manager mostly for financial issues as well as administrative support from the Administrative Assistant. Marta Arce, Regional Health Education Specialist, has made annual visits to the project and conducts very specific V -classes (Internet conferencing) for staff on IEC issues. The CSP staff felt that this TA had been extremely useful. Other v -class sessions were felt to be too general to be of help with specific problems and were conducted in English. The staff expressed frustration at what they perceived as a lack of adequate TA during the first half of the project. The project will need further technical support in the use of data for decision making, and HIV/AIDS. Recommendations for C. Pro ject Management include the following: 1. Recommendations on how the KPC/LQAS could be used in the future to enhance project activities include: \u00a7 The KPC survey should not be repeated until the final evaluation; \u00a7 LQAS could be used more creatively, for example, to monitor changes in Brigadistas, TBAs or health staff, not just mothers; \u00a7 Process indicators and a simple monitoring system need to be developed, and utilizing, when possible, existing instruments; \u00a7 MOH indicators should be incorporated into the CSP monit oring system when possible; \u00a7 Take into consideration the precision of evaluation methodologies when setting targets for results indicators. 39 \u00a7 Information from the KPC is currently in Epi -Info and Access; one person has one system, another person the other. P roject Management should select one software system for KPC data and define who will be responsible for analyzing KPC information; \u00a7 HOPE, with concurrence from the donor, should consider conducting the end-of-project KPC in the 80 priority communities, not the 730 total communities in the department, due to the large number of other PVO/NGOs working in the same area and the consequence inability to attribute changes to any one agency; \u00a7 LQAS should be part of an ongoing supervision system, not a separate survey activity. 2. The monthly meetings for Brigadistas and TBAs should be strengthened to include analysis of information for improved decision making. 3. Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff. D. Conclusions and Recommendations The CSP in Jinotega being implemented in partnership by Project HOPE, SILAIS/MOH, and private sector coffee growers has been able to move forward during the first half of the project on a number of fronts: \u00a7 Support to ongoing or newly i ntroduced MOH programs in child health, maternal health, quality improvement, and family planning; \u00a7 Provision of logistical support (transportation), materials, and medicines; \u00a7 Monthly or bimonthly meetings as linkage between MOH and community; \u00a7 Improved acce ss to health services, by working in isolated communities \u00a7 Training for Brigadistas, TBAs, community committees and MOH staff; 368 Brigadistas had attended at least one training event and 234 TBAs had attended at least one training event \u00a7 A KPC Survey was co nducted as part of the mid term evaluation and showed an increase in vaccination coverage, use of modern family planning methods, improved knowledge of prevention of HIV/AIDS and improved care seeking during diarrhea; \u00a7 Committees for emergency transportati on during obstetrical emergencies have been formed in 63 communities with 104 committee members trained in the formation of emergency brigades, collecting funds to help cover medical emergencies, recognition of danger signs, etc. \u00a7 PROCOSAN has been impleme nted in 76 priority communities, selected by the MOH. \u00a7 Community based child spacing has been established in 36 of the 80 priority communities, plus an additional 22 communities selected by the CSP and MOH (total 58), with trained counselors who distribut e some contraceptive methods in the communities. Project records show there are 49 counselors in the 80 priority communities and 27 counselors in other communities. \u00a7 The CSP is supporting, through training, materials and supervision, the implementation of the official national MOH program for Maternal Newborn Care in 58 of the 80 priority communities plus five additional communities \u00a7 A qualitative study was carried out by HOPE/MOH on maternal preferences for home vs. institutional birth. 40 \u00a7 The Humanitarian Assi stance Program provided donations of pharmaceutical products. The national donation level during the life of this project has been 9.5 million dollars, 2.77 million of that going to Jinotega The project has experienced some serious constraints during impl ementation: \u00a7 The finalization of the new MOH programs took longer than expected, causing delays in implementation and several times, having to redo previous work when changes were made \u00a7 Lack of ownership of initiatives by MOH staff; \u00a7 Rotation of MOH staff; \u00a7 Because of differing levels of benefits, especially food distribution, some community members are not interested in working with a project which offers no tangible benefits. The project however has some weaknesses which need to be addressed : \u00a7 No monitoring of process indicators; \u00a7 Deviation from M&E plan due to misunderstanding of the use of some instruments and introduction of SIGHOPE; \u00a7 Lack of follow -up on the CSTS Sustainability Framework and HOPE Nicaragua Institutional Assessment. \u00a7 Greater emphasis on the use of information for decision making Recommendations B.1. Technical Approach It is suggested that Results Indicator 1 be changed to measure two or more prenatal visits, since the data is available for baseline and MTE surveys and represents a more ala rming trend in adequate prenatal attention. HOPE staff should receive technical assistance on HIV/AIDS. Using the PROCOSAN methodology all communities are supposed to have quarterly meetings to discuss health issues based on children's growth. These are rarely carried out and would be an excellent future activity for the CSP to strengthen the use of nutrition, and IMCI information. The CSP should investigate traditional locally available liquids such as rice water, barley water or coconut water and enc ourage the use of these liquids during episodes of diarrhea. The CSP should work with SILAIS and/or NICASALUD to identify guidelines for resolving the discrepancy between the child health cards and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth. Due to the decrease in exclusive breastfeeding the CSP needs to further study the key determinants that influence the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life . The CSP needs to develop a workplan for the next t wo and a half years, including well defined qualitative studies to help guide their work in the future. 41 B.2.Cross Cutting Approaches All staff and volunteers, at all levels, need to be motivated, mainly through non -economic stimulus such as public recog nition of good work, opportunities to exchange experiences, diplomas for completing training activities, identification cards, etc. Simple things like hats or tee shirts should also be considered for stimulus and team building. HOPE and MOH should jointly develop a strategy for the formation of community committees; to expand their role in the community if there is a gap, or to coordinate with existing community structures. A system for monitoring the quality of training and the effectiveness of counseli ng and other communication methods needs to be developed. The CSP should develop a comprehensive BCC plan, which would include an IEC strategy and Training Plan, for the remainder of the project, including the uses of alternative means for the disseminati on of IMCI and MNC messages. The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored. An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS to identify specific actions for capacity building based on the needs of SILAIS. HOPE and MOH should develop strategies for working within the human resource limitations of the department, such as a self guided system for continuous training, continuing education opportunities, and orientation for new staff. Develop a sustainability plan based on the work started with the CSSA model, including planning with communities, based on the use of local resources for problem solving. C. Project Management Some recommendations on how th e KPC/LQAS could be used in the future to enhance project activities include: \u00a7 The KPC survey should not be repeated until the final evaluation; \u00a7 LQAS could be used more creatively, for example, to monitor changes in Brigadistas, TBAs or health staff, not ju st mothers; \u00a7 Process indicators and a simple monitoring system need to be developed, and utilizing, when possible, existing instruments; \u00a7 MOH indicators should be incorporated into the CSP monitoring system when possible; \u00a7 Take into consideration the precisio n of evaluation methodologies when setting targets for results indicators. \u00a7 Information from the KPC is currently in Epi -Info and Access; one person has one system, another person the other. Project Management should select one software system for KPC data and define who will be responsible for analyzing KPC information; \u00a7 HOPE, with concurrence from the donor, should consider conducting the end -of-project KPC in the 80 priority communities, not the 730 total communities in the department, due to the 42 large n umber of other PVO/NGOs working in the same area and the consequence inability to attribute changes to any one agency; \u00a7 LQAS should be part of an ongoing supervision system, not a separate survey activity. The monthly meetings for Brigadistas and TBAs sho uld be strengthened to include analysis of information for improved decision making. Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff. 43 E. Results Highlight Implementation of AMATE -IDRE: An Adult Learning Metho dology for Health Education Project HOPE's Child Survival (CS) project in Jinotega, Nicaragua has adopted the AMATE -IDRE adult learning methodology for conducting health education activities to key project partners: SILAIS -Jinotega (MOH) staff and commun ity volunteers. The AMATE -IDRE methodology addresses the promotion of health as a physical, mental, and social well -being, within a dynamic and dialectic process between the person and her/his environment. The methodology, which promotes positive models, a ctive decision making, taking responsibility, and adoption of key behaviors, focuses on improving on -the-job performance, increasing efficiency, building capacity to solve problems, and adopting reflective praxis. The adoption of the AMATE -IDRE methodolog y in the five -year CS project implemented by Project HOPE in Jinotega, Nicaragua started since the beginning of the project (2002) and involved three phases as follows: Phase I: Introduction of the methodology through the identification and training of Pr oject HOPE health educators staff in Jinotega, with direct support from Project HOPE's regional educator for the Americas region. This phase included the provision of tools to promote the introduction and adoption of this methodology to the SILAIS -Jinotega . Phase II: Strengthening Project HOPE -Nicaragua and SILAIS -Jinotega staff in planning health education sessions with the AMATE -IDRE methodology. It also included the supervision of Project HOPE -Nicaragua health educators in conducting effective health ed ucation sessions to community volunteers and traditional birth attendants. Phase III: Strengthening skills of Project HOPE and SILAIS -Jinotega staff in designing and implementing health education training workshops to improve counseling skills among healt h workers and community volunteers. The adoption of the AMATE -IDRE methodology by Project HOPE's CS project in Jinotega, Nicaragua has provided the following results: Thirty staff members (15 from Project HOPE -Nicaragua and 15 from SILAIS -Jinotega) traine facilitators planning with SILAIS -Jinotega and other NGOs staff training workshops targeted to health personnel, health promoters, TBAs, and mothers in all municipalities of the department of Jinotega ; All Project HOPE -Nicaragua health educators conduct health education sessions following the AMATE -IDRE methodology. In response to SILAIS -Jinotega request, a cascading model for training health personnel at all municipal levels is being implemented; SILA IS-Jinotega is currently validating its \"Plan de Parto\" (birth plan) designed with the AMATE - methodology; Today, SILAIS -Jinotega staff uses the AMATE -IDRE methodology in most of their health education sessions without direct intervention from Project HOPE staff. 44 ACTION PLAN In response to the mid -term evaluation recommendation s, Project HOPE put together an action plan through a process that included active participation of Project HOPE -Nicaragua CS staff and SILAIS -Jinotega feedback. Project HOPE HQ staff provided technical support during a four-day workshop held in Jinotega and throughout the entire process. The following three matrices summarize the activities and results in response to the mid -term evaluation recommendations. Matrix 1 shows a s ummary of the findings, conclusions and recommendations form the mid -term evaluation. Matrix 2 shows the recommendations analysis, with decisions to accept or reject recommendations with respective evidence and explanations. Matrix 3 shows the detailed wo rk plan for the period 2005 -2007, with specific activities, timeframe, and persons responsible for those activities. The detailed work plan in Matrix 3 replaces any previous workplans. 45 Review of Mid -Term Evaluation Results and Workplan Matrix 1: Finding s, Conclusions and Recommendations Intervention: Maternal and Newborn Care: 30% Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned 94% of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months report having had at least one prenatal visit with a doctor or nurse. (BL: 89 %, Goal: 95%) The above indicator was chosen by the project as a results indicator, but if a more in-depth analysis had been conducted at the time of the baseline, a much more serious problem would have been revealed. It is suggested that Results Indica tor \"1\" be changed to measure two or more prenatal visits, since the data is available for baseline and MTE surveys and represents a more alarming trend in adequate prenatal attention. Intervention: Nutrition / Micronutrients: 13% Findings Conclusi ons Recommendations Lessons Learned There is an important issue in the comparison between the traditional child's health card (Road to Health) and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth (based on expected weight gain), both of which are routinely used . A child could be classified as growing well in one system and growing poorly in the other. The CSP should work with SILAIS and/or NICASALUD to identify guidelines for resolving the discrepancy between the child health cards and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth. Communities are supposed to have quarterly meetings to discuss health issues based on children's growth. These are rarely carried out Using the PROCOSAN methodology all communities are supposed to have quarterly meetings to discuss hea lth issues based on children's growth. These are rarely carried out and would be an excellent future activity for the CSP to strengthen the use of nutrition, and IMCI information The level of malnutrition which at 31%, (according to the MTE KPC survey f or children <1 z score below the mean) Is lower than the 35% suggested by Hearth guidelines PD Hearth was included in the DIP but is not recommended due to other priorities on staff time, the lack of sufficient MOH staff to monitor the strategy 46 Intervention: Breastfeeding: 10% Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned % of infants aged 0 -5 months who received only breast milk in the past 24 hours . BL: 56%, EMT: 52%, Meta: 70% It is of concern that the percent of infants who are e xclusively breastfeeding shows a declining tendency Due to the decrease in exclusive breastfeeding the CSP needs to further study the key determinants that influence the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life Intervention: Control of Diarrheal Disease: 15% Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned In MTE interviews with mothers they said out of five functioning CORUs all distribute ORS packets and show mothers how to prepare it; most CORUs reportedly provide malaria treatment (4/5); and three of the five CORUs are used for weighing sessions, meetings or as a point for vaccinations during campaigns. Few of the CORUs have basic materials (container for mixing, cup, spoon) to actually re hydrate a child, even though all CORUs were equipped in the past, most recently in some municipalities by CRS The qualitative study planned for utilization of the CORUs should be completed. The project needs to take a serious look at the effectiveness of t his activity During MTE interviews a number of people mentioned the use of homemade sugar and salt rehydration solution when ORS packets were not available It is generally not recommended to use homemade sugar and salt solutions due to the difficulty in correctly measuring the quantities of sugar and salt The CSP should investigate traditional locally available liquids such as rice water, barley water or coconut water and encourage the use of these liquids during episodes of diarrhea % of mothers of c hildren aged 0 -23 months who report washing their hands with water and soap before the preparation of meals, before feeding children, after defecation and after tending a child that has defecated decreased with respect to baseline BL: 19%, MTE: 11%. The decline in the indicator for hand washing is of concern In future projects, the indicator should reflect the suggested format for measuring hand washing in the KPC 2000+ 47 Intervention: Pneumonia Case Management: 10% Findings Conclusions Recommendati ons Lessons Learned % of mothers with children 0 to 23 months old who can identify fast breathing as a danger sign of pneumonia . BL: 76% MTE: 78%, Goal: 85% % of children aged 0 -23 months with cough and f ast breathing in the last two weeks taken to a health unit . BL: 60% MTE: 55%, Goal: 85% This tendency requires further study by the project to identify barriers to care seeking, particularly since the percentage of women that recognize a danger sign of pneumonia essentially did not change A further study is required by the project to identify barriers to care seeking Project HOPE has an active Humanitarian Assistance Program, through which a large amount of pharmaceutical products are obtained as part o f Gift -In-Kind (GIK) Donations of medicines to the MOH have been an important role for HOPE and one of the most visible impacts of the CSP Support the provision of antibiotics, IV therapy and medical supplies for he alth units that admit patients. Intervention: Child Spacing: 10% Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned It was not possible to include the analysis of the process indicators, as they have not been monitored The indicators for family planning used by the MOH are different from those used by the CSP making follow -up difficult to monitor A review of indicators will be recommended, this would be a good time to try and incorporate MOH indicators if at all possible Before developing indicators, review the ones used by the MOH Intervention: HIV / AIDS / STIs: 5% Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned Staff admits they have little basic knowledge in HIV/AIDS and need technical assistance (TA) The MOH has not received training due to this gap HOPE staff should receive technical assistance on HIV/AIDS 48 Intervention: Project Management Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned PACT staff conducted a one -week workshop in Jinotega working with field staff to assess organizational strengths and wea knesses at Project HOPE/ Nicaragua with the purpose to improve overall performance. Some results were seen from this exercise, but in general, there was no follow -up to the action plan of sixteen lines of action developed during the process The lack of fol low-up may be attributed to the fact that the many tasks were not prioritized, making the effort seem unmanageable The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored The KPC survey should not be repeated until the final evaluation LQAS could be used more creatively, for example, to monitor changes in Brigadistas, TBAs or health staff, not just mothers The project has not been monitoring process indicators; only results indicators Program monitoring of process indicators has not been used for planning and/or revising program implementation Process indicators and a simple monitoring system need to be developed, and utilizing, when possible, existing instruments MOH ind icators should be incorporated into the CSP monitoring system when possible Many of the targets could never be shown to be statistically significant from the baseline; for example, the indicator for percent of mothers with children aged 12 to 23 months old who are not pregnant, desire no more children or are not sure and report using a modern family planning method showed at baseline a level of 65% and the final target was set at 70%. The KPC instrument, especially only measuring mothers with children 12 -23 months old, would never show a significant difference between these two numbers. This is a limitation related to the number of interventions selected by the project (8) making it difficult to show measurable change in so many different areas Take into consideration the precision of evaluation methodologies when setting targets for results indicators 49 Information from the KPC is currently in Epi-Info and Access; one person has one system, another person the other. Project Management should select one software system for KPC data and define who will be responsible for analyzing KPC information HOPE, with concurrence from the donor, should consider conduct the end -of-project KPC in the 80 priority communities, not the 730 total communities in the department, due to the large number of other PVO/NGOs working in the same area and the consequence inability to attribute changes to any one agency LQAS should be part of an ongoing supervision system, not a separate survey activity One of the main stra tegies for guiding the use of information, as presented in the DIP was the use of \"Salas Situacionales\" a forum, which would provide Brigadistas and TBAs an opportunity to discuss findings from the information they routinely collect. This has not been done The use of information at all levels for decision making needs to be a project priority during the second half of the funding cycle. Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff Only the first mentioned qual itative study has been carried out It is not recommended to simply complete the other planned research The CSP needs to develop a workplan for the next two and a half years, including well -defined qualitative studies to help guide their work in the future . 50 Intervention: Capacity Building Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned Human resource problems dominate the MOH reality there is not sufficient staff, many are not adequately trained and they rotate very frequently One of the real ities of working in Jinotega is the continuous rotation and shortage of human resources HOPE and MOH should develop strategies for working within the human resource limitations of the department, such as a self guided system for continuous training continu ing education opportunities, and orientation for new staff. PACT staff conducted a one -week workshop in Jinotega working with field staff to assess organizational strengths and weaknesses at Project HOPE/ Nicaragua with the purpose to improve overall pe rformance. Some results were seen from this exercise, but in general, there was no follow -up to the action plan of sixteen lines of action developed during the process. The lack of follow -up may be attributed to the fact that the many tasks were not prioritized, making the effort seem unmanageable The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored No institutional assessment was conducted with SILAIS Project HOPE also plans t o conduct a capacity assessment of Project HOPE /Nicaragua and its main partner, the SILAIS An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS (not the PACT methodology) to identify specific actions for capacity building based on the needs of SILAIS Intervention: Sustainability Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned There have been a number of positive experiences within the project area and in neighboring departments that can be drawn upon in the development of this plan. These issues need to be addressed by all stakeholders and with continuing dialogue concerning the transition plan and long term sustainability Develop a sustainability plan based on the work started with the CSSA model, including planning with communiti es, based on the use of local resources for problem solving 51 Intervention: Community Mobilization Findings Conclusions Recommendations Lessons Learned Some of the projects provide cash stipends through paid community members, rather than volunt eers. Other projects provide food donations All of these factors make working within the department a challenge of coordination and because of differing levels of benefits, especially food distribution. Some community members are not motivated to participa te in a project that offers no tangible benefits. The CSP staff feels that the Brigadistas and TBAs are not motivated, and that the project should provide some material stimulus such as hats, raincoats, or tee shirts All staff and volunteers, at all levels , need to be motivated, mainly through non-economic stimulus such as public recognition of good work, opportunities to exchange experiences, diplomas for completing training activities, identification cards, etc. Simple things like hats or tee shirts shoul d also be considered for stimulus and team building . The current committees are focused on a narrow task. In MTE interviews they expressed their main role as transportation and secondary role as providing counseling when someone was ill. They also prov ide a support system for the Brigadista and TBA (who are usually also members of the committee). The role of the committee should be determined according to the needs of the community . HOPE and MOH should jointly develop a strategy for the formation of com munity committees; to expand their role in the community if there is a gap, or to coordinate with existing community structures - One of the keys to sustainability is having social involvement and a strong community structure, linked with municipal authori ties. - The CSP has had several positive experiences in the development of community committees with a wider area of influence than caring for health emergencies. 52 Intervention: Communication for Behavior Change Findings Conclusions Recomm endations Lessons Learned The ECMAC (family planning) counselors have received training in counseling using the ACCEDA method, as was previously discussed in the section on Child Spacing. Counseling skills are also incorporated into other training courses , for example PROCOSAN Both of the above mentioned materials are very complex and require excellent training and follow -up with the Brigadistas to ensure they are being used effectively A system for monitoring the quality of training and the effectiveness of counseling and other communication methods needs to be developed Community members felt that the project had been able to change behaviors in: increased use of FP and prenatal care, improved levels of vaccinations, and better hygiene. The CSP staff f elt the project had been able to change behaviors in: improved hygiene and use of latrines, more institutional births, more involvement of men, use of FP, and community organization. MOH staff felt that improved practices were the use of local resources fo r better nutrition and encouraging parents to be more involved in caring for their children. Results from the KPC were mixed; some behaviors have changed, such as increased use of contraceptives and children being weighed. Other behaviors were not changed such as exclusive breastfeeding and home management of diarrhea The CSP should develop a comprehensive BCC plan which would include an IEC strategy and Training Plan, for the remainder of the project, including the uses of alternative means for the dissemi nation of IMCI and MNC messages Matrix 2: Recommendations Analysis Intervention: Maternal and Newborn Care: 30% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all. Why? It is suggested that Results Indicator 1 be changed to measure two or more prenatal visits, since the data is available for baseline and MTE surveys and represents a more alarming trend in adequate prenatal attention A new indicator will be added without changing the prior one 53 Intervention: Nutrition / Micronutrients: 13% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the reco mmendation at all. Why? The CSP should work with SILAIS and/or NICASALUD to identify guidelines for resolving the discrepancy between the child health cards and the PROCOSAN definition of adequate growth. No, since there are no two cards. PROCOSAN use s a reminder material in the form of a poster used for monthly weighing sessions, which is totally different form the Health Card used by Health personnel to chart growth development. Using the PROCOSAN methodology all communities are supposed to have qua rterly meetings to discuss health issues based on children's growth. These are rarely carried out and would be an excellent future activity for the CSP to strengthen the use of nutrition, and IMCI information No, the audience at these meetings is compo sed of community members an other organizations representatives (City Hall representatives in the communities, religious leaders, CHVs, MOH, NGOs, and other government organizations. The objective of the meeting is to share information about PROCOSAN ad factors that may be affecting advances (ware, sanitation, etc.) This space is used for strengthening of community committees. Child development nutrition and health issues are addressed at monthly weighing sessions and meetings of mothers and CHVs with Heal th Units PD Hearth was included in the DIP but is not recommended due to other priorities on staff time, the lack of sufficient MOH staff to monitor the strategy Yes, this is not a priority or necessary since there is only a 7% of malnourished children 54 Intervention: Breastfeeding: 10% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all. Why? Due to the decrease in exclusive breastf eeding the CSP needs to further study the key determinants that influence the early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life Yes, the qualitative study will be conducted to identify key factors that influence early Breastfeeding initiation Intervention: Control of Diarrheal Disease: 15% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all. Wh y? The qualitative study planned for utilization of the CORUs should be completed. The project needs to take a serious look at the effectiveness of this activity The study will be conducted only in the Bocay Municipality, prior agreement of participatio n by the MOH and commitment to use the findings. The CSP should investigate traditional locally available liquids such as rice water, barley water or coconut water and encourage the use of these liquids during episodes of diarrhea No, the MOH alread y has clearly defined the liquids to be used and how, for children with diarrhea In future projects, the indicator should reflect the suggested format for measuring hand washing in the KPC 2000+ No, this recommendation is for future projects Intervention: Pneumonia Case Management: 10% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all. Why? A further study is required by the project to identify barriers to care seeking Yes, this is a priority intervention and no changes are observed on mothers' behavior Support the provision of antibiotics, IV therapy and medical supplies for health units that admit patients Support the provisio n to Health Units of antibiotics for ambulatory care of pneumonia cases 55 Intervention: Child Spacing: 10% Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recom mendation at all. Why? The indicators for family planning used by the MOH are different from those used by the CSP making follow -up difficult to monitor . A review of indicators will be recommended, this would be a good time to try and incorporate MOH ind icators if at all possible Yes, incorporate MOH indicators but without proposing a review to MOH indicators. The CS project will use process indicators form the MOH for monitoring purposes Intervention: HIV / AIDS / STIs: 5% Recommendations Accept t he recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? HOPE staff should receive technical assistance on HIV/AIDS No, the level of effort is too low, the goal was almost reached and knowledge of staff is adequate to continue with activities of this intervention Intervention: Communication for Behavior Change Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? A system for monitoring the quality of training and the effectiveness of counseling and other communication methods needs to be developed Yes, it is necessary since it permits that strategie s can be evaluated and weaknesses identified, allowing a better informed decision making process The CSP should develop a comprehensive BCC plan which would include an IEC strategy and Training Plan, for the remainder of the project, including the us es of alternative means for the dissemination of IMCI and MNC messages Yes, the program requires of a standardized plan regarding content, methodology, and results measuring techniques, which is also flexile to modifications in case of need 56 Intervent ion: Community Mobilization Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? All staff and volunteers, at all levels, need to be motiv ated, mainly through non -economic stimulus such as public recognition of good work, opportunities to exchange experiences, diplomas for completing training activities, identification cards, etc. Simple things like hats or tee shirts should also be consider ed for stimulus and team building . Provide non -economical stimulus to CHVs in the communities of direct intervention HOPE and MOH should jointly develop a strategy for the formation of community committees; to expand their role in the community if there is a gap, or to coordinate with existing community structures To standardize and document the formation and performance of community development committees, according to the citizen participation law and through the PROCOSAN and Plan de Parto stra tegies, working with the committees but not with CHVs (Brigadistas and TBAs) individually 57 Intervention: Capacity Building Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specifica tion Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? HOPE and MOH should develop strategies for working within the human resource limitations of the department, such as a self guided system for continuous training continuing education opportunities, and o rientation for new staff. Yes, due to the high rotation of personnel and the need to train new ones. The institutional assessment for HOPE Nicaragua should be revived and the original work plan reviewed, implemented and monitored Continue the proce ss, documenting and systematizing current and future achievements and advances toward goals established in the workplan (HR and Administrative -Finance Manuals, organizational climate, HR development, fundraising identification of donors, networking, propos als, etc. An institutional assessment should also be conducted with SILAIS (not the PACT methodology) to identify specific actions for capacity building based on the needs of SILAIS No, the MOH is not interested, they only would like to become acquain ted with the tools Intervention: Sustainability Recommendations E. Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? Develop a sustainability plan bas ed on the work started with the CSSA model, including planning with communities, based on the use of local resources for problem solving Yes, current experience, already taking steps in this direction for communities to gather funds to replace materials, necessary for continuation of the community strategies activities being implemented, show good progress 58 Intervention: Project Management Recommendations Accept the recommendation as it is Why? Accept the recommendation with some modification or specification Do not accept the recommendation at all Why? Strengthen analytical abilities in the communities, Brigadistas, TBAs, MOH and HOPE staff Yes, in order to strengthen the decision making process at all project levels The CSP needs to develo p a workplan for the next two and a half years, including well -defined qualitative studies to help guide their work in the future. Yes, a workshop has already been carried out to develop the workplan for the next 2 \u00bd years of the project LQAS could be u sed more creatively, for example, to monitor changes in Brigadistas, TBAs or health staff, not just mothers No, for monitoring of process indicators, the project records will be used LQAS should be part of an ongoing supervision system, not a separate s urvey activity No, LQAS is not appropriate for continuous supervision, it is best used for Monitoring and Evaluation Take into consideration the precision of evaluation methodologies when setting targets for results indicators Yes, quantitative goals wi ll be revised for all results' indicators, the same as the number of interventions Process indicators and a simple monitoring system need to be developed, and utilizing, when possible, existing instruments Review and adjust process indicators so that they can be monitored periodically 59 Matrix 3: Workplan 2005 -2007 Intervention: Maternal and Newborn Care: 42% 2005 2006 2007 Activities III IV I II III IV I II III Responsible Lifesaving Skills for health personnel 1.

The activities presented in the workplan are the result of a detailed anal ysis performed by the Project HOPE -Nicaragua Child Survival Project staff and the SILAIS -Jinotega, the project's main partner. In order to select and set priorities for the activities, two main criteria were used, the feasibility and viability of each acti vity. For the feasibility the following parameters were considered: Beneficiaries, Human resources, materials, and SILAIS expressed level of interest. For the Viability, the following were considered: The Project HOPE -Nicaragua CS project commitment, SILAI S Policies, management commitment, cost, and financial resources available. 2. For the Maternal and Neonatal Care intervention, the project will adopt the fo llowing additional indicator: \" % of mothers with children 0 to 23 months old that report having had a t least 2 prenatal control visits with a doctor or a nurse during the last pregnancy .\" This indicator will be calculated with already available data from the Baseline (2003) and Mid Term Evaluation (2005) studies. 3. The \"Plan de Parto\" referred to in the ma ternal and newborn care intervention is defined in the following manner: Plan de Parto for Safe Motherhood is a strategy which has the main purpose to contribute to the reduction of maternal and peri -natal mortality, through the development of capabilities of \"Self Care\" for pregnant women's health and the newborn. The Pl an de Parto facilitators' guide is a document that will serve health personnel as a work tool to define roles and develop activities with stakeholders in the community, to guarantee safe ma ternity and correct care of the newborn. This strategy has seven structured units, which lead the facilitator in a simple and clear manner to achievement of proposed goals of each training activity. 4. The MOH -SILIA S curricula for training of TBAs include th e following training subjects: Prenatal care, low risk delivery, post -partum care, family Planning Methods, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Community Participation, Immediate care of the Newborn. This training activity will be reduced systematically in ef fort all the way through the last quarter of the year 2006. 5. Follow up and supervision: The following definitions have been taken from official MOH strategy documents, in order to allow for a standardized terminology to be used with MOH partners in all pro ject activities. Monitoring: is the continuous and periodic vigilance of objectives, processes and established activities that allow for early detection of facilitating factors or barriers, for immediate decision making. Supervision: is the process of ass istance and training, provided to personnel, to ensure compliance with a norm. Evaluation: is the measuring and comparison of the structure, processes and results obtained with respect to established objectives, goals, criteria or indicators for different programs or services1. 1 Definitions taken form the National Monitoring, Supervision and Evaluation Norm of the Ministry of Health o f Nicaragua, Managua 1996 ANNEXES Annex A. Baseline information from the DIP Annex A. Baseline information from the DIP There have been no substantial changes in the DIP in terms of population, geographical area, level of effort, or interventions.

Evaluation Assessment Methodology Annex C. Evaluation Asses sment Methodology I. OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION The purpose of the Midterm Evaluation was to; 1. Assess progress in implementing the DIP; 2. Assess progress towards achievement of objectives or yearly benchmarks; 3. Assess if interventions are sufficient to r each desired outcomes, 4. Identify barriers to achievement of objectives, and 5. To provide recommended actions to guide the program staff through the last half of the program. The evaluation was carried out in accordance with USAID/GH/HIDN/CSGHP MTE guidelin es August 2004 and the evaluation report follows the suggested format. The objectives of the evaluation were: Identify the principal achievements of the project, focusing on which strategies were most effective and the barriers which were overcome during the implementation. Develop recommendations for improving project strategies in order to achieve greater impact during the next two and a half years. Develop recommendations on how to obtain sustainability in all aspects of the project using the CSSA focus . II. COMPOSITION OF EVALUATION TEAM The team was composed of Project HOPE staff, MOH staff, and community volunteers, plus an external consultant who served as team leader. The team leader was responsible for coordinating all evaluation activities, su pervision of the team, meeting all specified objectives, collaborating with HOPE and MOH, and submitting a draft and a final report according to the defined timeline. Three team coordinators functioned as the coordinators of the teams for field data collec tion, including overall coordination, planning and logistical support of the team. The analysis phase of the evaluation also included the participation of HOPE Headquarters' representative and Regional Director, HOPE Nicaragua's Country Director, staff fr om other NGOs, USAID Nicaragua representative, and municipal MOH representatives. See Annex C for a complete list of participants in the evaluation. III. METHODOLOGY Using both a participatory approach and participatory methodologies, a multi - disciplin ary term of key project stakeholders examined the implementation of CS activities using a variety of qualitative methodologies. Field visits allowed project participants and community volunteers to provide their inputs and suggestions to the evaluation pro cess. The evaluation focused on the process of activities including; capacity building, communication for behavior change, planning, HIS, community participation, coordination with partners, and sustainability. The methodologies used to obtain information for the evaluation included: o Document Review o Key Informant Interviews with Brigadistas, TBAs and Health Center/Health Post Staff, and others listed in Annex D. o Group Interviews with mothers and health committees o Feedback and Analysis of KPC results with mo thers and health committees o Observations of Growth Monitoring Sessions (2), and UROS (Community Oral Rehydration Points). The three teams involved the following people in community activities: 99 Mothers 9 Brigadistas 8 TBAs 64 Committee Member s 6 Health Staff IV. EVALUATION PLAN The evaluation was divided into four phases: Phase I Planning Preplanning (Formation of team, logistics, document review, selection of communities) Planning Workshop (Content, methodologies, development of instr uments, review of KPC) Phase II Data Collection Field Work visits Other interviews Document review Phase III Data Analysis Team members summarized and organized information collected in the field Analysis of information by the evaluation team and o ther stakeholders (2 day Analysis Workshop) Phase IV Presentation Written report in English Formal presentation and action plan is scheduled for after the report is finalized The evaluation team was divided into 3 small groups to collect information from the field. Each team consisted of 5 -6 people. The teams were in the field for 3 days to visit 9 randomly selected communities and 3 Health Centers/Posts previously selected for visits.

A two -day Analysis Workshop was held for all team members and other key stakeholders to present the results of the field work and to formulate recommendations for improvi ng project implementation during the second half of the project. K. EVALUATION OF THE PR OCESS Twenty -one evaluation team members and resource people completed an evaluation of the MTE process, during the Analysis Workshop. The results from the questionnaire s were: 5/21 (24%) of participants felt that the process used was very effective, and 16/21 (76) % that it was effective. What people liked best about the process was the participatory nature of the evaluations, inclusion of representatives from the commu nity the community visits, and the methodology for sharing the KPC results. The negative aspects of the evaluation were (10) that there was limited participation of the MOH, six people felt the time was inadequate, and other comments were that they did no t like the defensive attitude of some presenters and that when people were tired, the activities were not dynamic. 13/21 (62%) felt the recommendations formulated by the team were adequate for guiding the project in the future. 8/21 (38%) felt the recomme ndations were very adequate.

A discussion of this indicator was included in the technical section on Maternal Newborn Care. It is recommended that this indicator be changed to women who had two or more prenatal visits. Indicator 9 % of children 12 -23 months fully immunized (BCG, OPV3, Pentavalente 3, an d MMR) by 12 months It is difficult to determine if indicator 9 was corrected calculated, the Indicator Construction Table in Table 4 of the KPC report only states as the numerator if the child received all required vaccines. The indicator states received all vaccines before their first birthday. It is unclear whether that was taken into consideration. The denominator used was all children 12 -23 months, not just those children with cards. According to the KPC 2000+ the calculation should be: Indicator 10 % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months with a diarrheal episode in the last two weeks who report giving as much or more food to their child Indicator 11 % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months with a diarrheal episode in the last two weeks who repor t giving as much or more liquids or breast milk to their child The translation into Spanish for in dicators 10 and 11 is incorrect; it states the % of mothers who gives more food /liquids/breastmilk rather than the same or more. The calculation of indicator 10 was correctly made according to Table 4 of the KPC report Indicator Construction; indicator 11 however was incorrectly calculated as it should include either intake of breastmilk or intake of liquids (numerator should be: DM4=2 or 3 or DM3=2 or 3) . Th e KPC 2000+ has simplified this question, for future reference: 3. \"When (NAME) was sick, was he/she offered less than usual to drink , about the same amount, or more than usual to drink?\" 1. LESS THAN USUAL 2. SAME AMOUNT 3. MORE THAN USUAL Increased Fluid Inta ke During a Diarrheal Episode Percent of children aged 0 -23 months with diarrhea in the last two weeks who were offered the \"same\" or \"more\" fluids during the illness No. of children with response= \"2\" or \"3\" for Q.3 _____________________________________ _ x 100 No. of children with responses to Q.3 Indicator 13 % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who report washing their hands with water and soap before the preparation of meals, before feeding children, after defecation and af ter tending a child that has defecated It is very difficult to measure when a woman spontaneously mentions four instances for hand washing. For future reference, the KPC 2000+ recommends dividing the question into subcomponents. Maternal Handwashing Befor e Food Preparation Percent of mothers who usually wash their hands before food preparation No. of mothers with response= \"A\" for Q.3, sub -module B ______________________________________________ x 100 Total no. of mothers with responses to Q.3, sub-module B Maternal Handwashing Before Infant/Child Feeding Percent of mothers who usually wash their hands before feeding children No. of mothers with response= \"C\" for Q.3, sub -module B ______________________________________________ x 100 Total no. of mothers with responses to Q.3, sub -module B Maternal Handwashing After Defecation Percent of mothers who usually wash their hands after defecation No. of mothers with response= \"D\" for Q.3, sub -module B ____________________________ __________________ x 100 Total no. of mothers with responses to Q.3, sub -module B Indicator 14 % of mothers of who can identify at least two danger signs for diarrhea The project is actually collecting the signs are of dehydration, not diarrhea . It is recommended that the indicator be changed to reflect the emphasis on dehydration. Indicator 18 % of mothers with children aged 12 to 23 months old who are not pregnant, desire no more children or are not sure and report using a modern family plann ing method According to the Indicator Construction Table, the indic ator was incorrectly calculated; the filters for women desiring no more children or who were not sure were not used. The correct calculation is as follows: 5 Do you want to have do you want to have your next child? WITHIN of nonpregnant mothers who desire no more children in the next two years, or Use Among are not sure, who are using a modern method of child spacing Mothers Who Want to Limit or Space Births No. of mo thers with (response=2 or 8 for Q.5 or Q.6) AND (response= 2 through 10 for Q.7) ______________________________________________ x 100 Total no. of mothers with responses=2 or 8 for Q.5 or Q.6 Indicator 19 % of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months who know at least two ways to prevent HIV / AIDS / STIs It is difficult to determine if indicator 19 was corrected calculated, the Indicator Construction Table incorrectly states the indicator as % mothers who identify one way to prevent HIV/AIDS> The actual indi cator is two ways. F. RAPID CATCH INDICATORS Rapid Catch indicator 10 -% of mothers of children aged 0 -23 months that know at least two signs of childhood illnesses indicating the need for treatment was incorrectly calculated as including only those mothers t hat said dehydration was a danger sign. The Rapid Catch is trying to capture information on IMCI danger signs with the following question (responses B -H are correct): 10. Sometimes children get sick and need to receive care or treatment for illnesses. What ar e the signs of illness that would indicate your child needs treatment? DO NOT PROMPT. CIRCLE ALL MENTIONED. A.

The KPC survey, which sampled communities from all eight municipalities in the Department of Jinotega, served to provide key information on maternal and child health knowledge and practices . Results of the survey provided quantitative data to identify advances and successes achieved during the first half of the life of the Child Survival (CS) project. The technical team of Project HOPE Jinotega and external personnel with experience in th is type of surveys carried out the KPC survey. Also, technical support was provided by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua (UNAN), the Ministry of Health (MINSA) for the training process and monitoring of the anthropometrical measurement sampli ngs, the Director of Project HOPE Nicaragua, and technical assistants of Project HOPE Headquarters personnel. To obtain the MidTerm information, the Project HOPE team used the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), a stratified random sampling methodolo gy. In addition, parallel sampling was used to better understand two groups: mothers with children 0 -11 months of age, and mothers with children aged 12 -23 months. For each of these groups, slightly different instruments were used, which have already been validated by the Child Survival Technical Support (CSTS) These instruments had already been used in prior KPC surveys with some adaptations and inclusion of questions about reproductive health, danger signs, diarrhea, feeding practices and fluids intake during infant diseases episodes, and HIV/AIDS. Measurements for weight, height, and hemoglobin levels were also taken for children under two years of age, and hemoglobin levels for mothers, using the universally accepted HEMOCUE equipment. The team compos ed of UNAN, MINSA Central, and Project HOPE provided training for weighing, height measuring, hemoglobin, sampling, and LQAS methodology. The sample size was 19 mothers with children under two years of age in each of the two groups 0 to 11 and 12 to 23 mo nths of age, for each Supervision Area (SA=8), with a subtotal of 152 mothers by age group, and a grand total of 304 interviewed mothers selected randomly. Data collection took place approximately within a two -week period. Ten survey teams were formed wit h one supervisor and one interviewer in each team. Three staff members from Project HOPE and stakeholders did the quality control, using a quality control checklist during the interview process. In addition, this CS program pilot - tested the use of electro nic Portable Digital Assistants (PDAs) for data capturing and analysis. The analysis was done using LQAS tabulation forms in the field. Average coverage rates (non -weighted) were calculated for CS indicators \u2014including Rapid CATCH ones \u2014 for the entire pro gram area. In addition, adjusted coverage rates (weighted) were calculated for each indicator based on population size. Finally, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for each indicator considering population size for each SA. The KPC survey infor mation collected provided the following results : The average age for interviewed mothers was 25 years old, with the youngest being 16 years old and the oldest 45 years of age. Breastfeeding practices for mothers of children from 0 to 23 months of age sho wed an average of 71 % of the children receiving breast milk during the first hours after birth. The municipality found below this average was Bocay. All municipalities were found to be equal or above this average. The percentage of children 0 to 5 mont hs of age that received breast milk in the last 24 hours was 52.0% (95% CI = +/ - 12.5%). Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 2Regarding the nutritional practices of mothers, more than two thirds (86%) of children 0 to 23 had weight measurements recorded in their health cards in the last four months. The municipality of Bocay was found below the average. Stunting in the 0 to 11 months old group was 6.6% (non -weighted average) and for the group of children 12 to 23 months of age was 26.3% (non -weighted average). This number is higher than the national average of 22.2% for the 12 to 23 months old group according to ENDESA 2001. The results for hemoglobin determination for the project area showed that 47% of children under two years of age have anemia (levels below 11mg/dl.) The results of the immunization coverage for the project area reflect that more than 3/4 (81%) of children 12 to 23 months old received all vaccines at the moment of their first birthday. The municipality of Cua and Bocay was found to be below this average coverage. Regard ing diarrhea, the KPC survey revealed low knowledge of danger signs re cognition by the mother. Surveys results found that 15.79% (non -weighted average) of mothers could recognize at least two danger signs (dehydration signs) during diarrhea episodes for c hildren aged 0 to 11 months old. In the 12 to 23 months old group 21.71% (non -weighted average) of mothers could recognize at least two danger signs. The municipality of Wiwili is the only one below this average. As for the demand of services, results showed a significantly low rate of utilization. The average number of children with diarrhea seen by qualified medical personnel or at the Community Oral Rehydration Unit (CORU) was 50% (non -weighted average) for the 0 to 11 months old group. For the 12 to 23 months old group the result was 49.06% (non -weighted average). Overall, only 53% of children aged 0 -23 months with diarrhea sought help at a health facility or CORU (95% CI= +/ - 8.8%). Regarding the percentage of mothers that reported having given equal amount or more food to their child during the last diarrheal episodes for both groups (0 to 11 and 12 to 23 months old), the result was 45%. The percentage of mothers that reported having given equal amount or more liquids to their child during the l ast diarrheal episodes for both groups (0 to 11 and 12 to 23 months old) was 57%. With respect to Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) management, the percentage of children 0 to 23 months old with fast breathing that were seen at a health unit was 55%. Re garding pneumonia danger signs knowledge, 80.3% (non -weighted average) of mothers for children 0 to 11 months old can identify fast breathing as a danger sign. The municipality of San Rafael Norte and Bocay was found to be below the average coverage. For the 12 to 23 months old group the result was 77.6% (non -weighted average) and the municipality of Cua were found below the average. Regarding maternal and newborn care, the percentage of mothers who reported that during their last pregnancy received the tetanus vaccine (dT) was 90.1% (non -weighted average) for the 0 to 11 months old group and 89.5% (non-weighted average) mothers with children 12 to 23 months of age. For both groups, the municipality found to be below the project area average was Bocay. Only 37.5% (non -weighted average) of mothers with children 0 to 11 months old reported having at least one postnatal visit. The municipality of Cua and Bocay is the only one below the project area average. A more half of children (54%) 0 to 23 months of a ge had their birth attended by qualified medical personnel (doctor or nurse). The municipalities of Pantasma, Wiwili, Cua and Bocay were found to be below the average. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 3With respect to birth spacing, the percentage of children 0 to 11 months old that were born at least 24 months after their previous surviving child was 88.2% (non -weighted average). The municipality of Bocay was found to be below the average for the project area. For the 12 to 23 months old group, the average was 84.9% (non -weighted avera ge). The municipality of Jinotega was found to be below the project area average. Regarding mothers with children 12 to 23 months of age that stated using some type of modern family planning method, the average coverage was 90%. With regard to STIs and HIV/AIDS, the percentage of mothers that know at least one way to prevent was 15.1% (non-weighted average) for the 0 to 11 months group. For the mothers with children 12 to 23 months of age the result was of 19.7% (non -weighted average). In general, th e municipalities that present the greatest limitations regarding knowledge, practices and coverage for child survival interventions are, in order of priority: Bocay, El Cua, Wiwili, Jinotega, Yali and Pantasma. I. BACKGROUND The department of Jinotega i s located in the north region of Nicaragua, with an area of 9,389 km 2 (8% of the total country surface). The estimate of population for the year 2005, according to the Instituto Nicaraguense de Estadisticas y Censos (INEC), is 248,162 inhabitants, with a density of 26.2 person per km 2, much lower than the national average of 75 people per km 2. Jinotega borders at the north with Honduras, to the south with the department of Matagalpa, to the east with the Region Aut\u00f3noma del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte (RAAN) and to t he west with the departments of Nueva Segovia, Madriz and Esteli. Politically, the department is divided into eight municipalities: Jinotega, San Rafael del Norte, La Concordia, San Yali, Santa Maria Wiwili, El Cua, and San Jos\u00e9 de Bocay. The department can be described as mountainous, with warm weather but with specific weather characteristics in each municipality, ranging from very humid to dry. The city of Jinotega is the capital of the department, and is located 161 kilomete rs from the country's capital Managua. Accessibility by road with Matagalpa and Managua is good through paved roads and with Esteli via unpaved roads usable all year. The municipalities are joined between them by unpaved roads in poor conditions, some mu nicipalities such as Wiwili and San Jose de Bocay have communities that are accessible via the rivers in a large portion of the territories. The main rivers in the department are: the Coco River, the longest and largest in Central America, the Bocay and A maka Rivers which feed into the Coco River and cross the municipalities of El Cua, and San Jose de Bocay. Jinotega is characterized by being a region producing staple grains, coffee, and non -traditional products, and a limited cattle industry. The mounta inous areas of Jinotega, Wiwili, El Cua, Bocay, Yali and San Rafael are perfect for the production of coffee. The municipality of Pantasma produces different crops such as staple grains, vegetables, and tobacco. Some of the areas are classified as \" zona seca \" (very hot climate) in which there is no production whatsoever due to lack of rain. Jinotega also generates electricity by means of the hydroelectric plant of Lake Apanas, which produces about 30% of the national electrical energy. The social and ec onomic situation of the department of Jinotega has been depressed in the latest years by the return of large populations to their original homes after the war, and by the fall of the international coffee prices, the main source of financial income for Jino tega. Housing The percentage of families that own a house is 52.3%; from these, 51.4% are made out of wood. Only 23.2% of the houses have electricity (ENDESA 2001). Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 4 Water and sanitation In the urban area 40% of the houses have drinking water as compared to only 10% in the rural area. The percentage of houses that have latrines is 41.3% for the whole department of Jinotega (ENDESA 2001). Poverty The dependency relation is 11:1. According to the poverty map of the UNDP and the Technical Secretariat of th e Presidency for the year 2000, the municipalities of El Cua, Bocay and Wiwili are classified as of extreme poverty; Yali, San Rafael del Norte and Pantasma are classified as high poverty; La Concordia and Jinotega are medium poverty. The municipalities w ith severe poverty represent 41% of the department's population. The Ministry of Education (MECD) estimates that the number of education centers covers only 40% of the territory. According to ENDESA 2001, a 39.9% of the population cannot read or write and 41.5% of women have never attended school. Regarding the education level of heads of family, 55% do not know how to read or write, only 10% have attended secondary school or higher studies and 35% completed primary education. Of the heads of family, 20% are single mothers. The depressed social and economic conditions, directly impact on health indicators of the general population with a greater risk of illnesses or death. Women of reproductive age and children younger than five years old are the group at greater risk, comprising 51.2% of the total population. The latest survey carried out by the MINSA's Nutrition Office in 1994 ranked Jinotega as high risk regarding micronutrients deficiency. L.

In the case of the infant mortality rates of the SILAIS -Jinotega, it is clear that this reductio n is a direct effect of the reduction of the mortality rate from diarrhea among children younger than five years of age. ** This information corresponds to the infant mortality for the period of five years before the survey (1996 -2001), calculated from t he history of births and deaths obtained from the interviews to women of reproductive age. The women's health indicators for the year 2004 present a coverage of prenatal control of 84.1% with a concentration of 3.2 visits per pregnant woman. Coverage for postnatal care was 52%, family planning coverage was 31.6% with a preference for injections (Depo -Provera). The ENDESA 2001 presents a coverage for modern family planning methods of 52% and the knowledge of women regarding HIV/AIDS as 81% of them having heard about the subject and 42.6% knowing two or three forms to avoid the disease. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 5Table 2: Department of Jinotega Demographics Municipalities Population 2003 % Km2 Density Yali ription (September 2002 - March 2005) Project HOPE is implementing the Child Survival Project in all 8 municipalities of the Jinotega Department. The identified strategies and activities have been implemented thorough the: Programa Comunitario de Salud de M\u00e9todos Anti Conceptivos -Community Planning Methods and Obst\u00e9tricas y Neonatales en las Comunidades -Obstetrics and Neonatal Emergencies in the Community (currently known as Plan de Parto para la Maternidad Segura -Birth Plan for Safe Motherhood), carried out in cooperation with our main partner, the Ministry of Health -SIALIS Jinotega, Community Health Volunteers, Private Sector Coffee Growers and partner NGOs, such as CARE, CARITAS -CRS, Wisconsin, PCI and other local civil society organizations. The target population includes 60,031 children under five and 70,827 women of reproductive age (130,858 total beneficiaries). The goa l of this program is to reduce morbidity and mortality rates of children under five and women of reproductive age in the department of Jinotega's primarily rural communities. This is being accomplished by building the service -delivery capacity of local he alth facilities and organizations; increasing the skills and elevating the morale of health care providers; strengthening cooperation among public, private and community stakeholders; and empowering consumers, particularly women, to take greater responsibi lity for personal and family health maintenance decisions. The program includes a specific set of capacity -building activities and objectives as well as health -related interventions. With respect to capacity building, HOPE will facilitate the establishme nt of Department - and Municipality -level Health Councils \u2014to include representatives of SILAIS, municipalities, private coffee plantations and associations, PVOs, NGOs, community leaders, health providers, and international donors \u2014to guide and extend the pr oject. II. PROCESS AND PART NERSHIP BUILDING A. Specific roles of local partners/stakeholders in the KCP Survey Project HOPE/ Jinotega coordinated the planning and the implementation of the Midterm KPC survey. The following is a list of local partners and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the KPC and their specific roles. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 6MINSA \u2014At national level, MINSA provided one facilitator, Lic. Mirna Zelaya, who participated in the training of interviewers in how to weigh children with the special Salter scales. At the SILAIS level, MINSA provided population (census) data and detailed local maps that were used to select communities and households, and loaned equipment, including HEMOCUE machines that were used to take hemoglobin measurements. The maps had been drawn in January 2005 by local \"Brigadistas\" (Community Health Volunteers), and were very helpful in orienting the survey team and locating households once they arrived in a particular community. B. Constraints in making the process more part icipatory The participation of the MINSA personnel during the data collection process of this MTE was mainly with coordination of visits to the communities, partaking in some of the visits, and supervision for quality control of some of the survey activit ies. One of the factors limiting the participation of the MINSA during the period of the surveys, 15 days, was the impossibility of medical personnel to abandon their duties for such an extended period of time from their Health Centers or Posts. C. Participa tory research used in the study Data collection in the field for the KPC survey was carried out in two manners: Using Handheld Computers (Portable Digital Assistants -PDAs) to improve data collection practices and minimize data errors, which are part of the Project HOPE Project Information Management System SIGHOPE), and using printed versions of the questionnaires, to double check for possible errors with the PDAs, which were negligible. III. METHODS A. Questionnaires Questionnaire development process The sections and questions included in the midterm Project HOPE/ Jinotega KPC Survey are based on the model questions and modules contained in KPC 2000+ Questionnaire Manual (Spanish version). Project HOPE Jinotega staff is experienced in developing and im plementing cross -sectional maternal and child health surveys: four surveys have been carried out for monitoring of the project (1 Base Line, 2 Monitoring and 1 Midterm). The two monitoring rounds did not include size and weight measurements, and were condu cted during regular work using the same tools of the baseline study, avoiding in this way any extra cost and providing valuable information. Project HOPE/ Nicaragua staff has also participated in numerous workshops and trainings on LQAS hosted by NicaSalud . The questionnaires used are the same ones that were adapted and validated during the Baseline Study, 2002, including new variables to collect data for the USAID Rapid Catch indicators not researched during the Baseline survey for the program. The re search methodology used during this midterm evaluation is the same one utilized for the Baseline Study and annual monitoring rounds conducted during the first half of the project, LQAS was chosen as the sampling methodology (versus the more traditional 30 -cluster sampling developed by WHO). It was also decided to use parallel sampling, thus two questionnaires were developed, one for those mothers with infants 0 -11 months, and the other for mothers with children 12 -23 months. Parallel sampling is designed to target the most appropriate sub-target group with the most appropriate questions for that subgroup, allowing for a relatively fewer number of questions to be administered to any one subgroup. Another advantage is that recall bias may be reduced, as th e question content will focus on behaviors or experiences relatively recent or current to a particular subgroup. Parallel sampling may also provide higher quality data, as shorter interviews are less likely to trigger 'interview Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 7fatigue' compared to longe r ones. Lastly, parallel sampling may produce more precise point estimates, because data from questionnaires with common questions can be pooled, allowing relatively larger sample sizes for particular items. Scope of survey, survey length, and versions o f the questionnaire Modules included in the survey questionnaires correspond roughly to the proposed interventions included in the project proposal submitted to USAID/ Washington in December 2001. The two questionnaires included the following modules: Table 3: Number of Questions by Questionnaire Number of Questions* Module 0-11 months 12-23 months Identification 14 14 Background 5 5 Nutrition and Breastfeeding 7 7 Growth and Monitoring 8 8 Immunization - 2 Sick Child 4 2 Diarrheal Management 9 9 Acute Respiratory Infections 9 9 Malaria ** 4 4 Prenatal Care *** 8 5 Intrapartum and Newborn Care 5 2 Family Planning 5 7 HIV/AIDS 3 3 Water and Sanitation 2 2 Anthropometry and Hemoglobin 4 4 Total 87 83 * A few questions contain fields fo r more than one variable ** This module was not included in the baseline study. Starting with the first monitoring, 4 questions were included in both questionnaires (0-11 y 12 -23 months old), to include the missed Malaria Rapid Catch indicator. *** This m odule also had one question added, to obtain another Rapid Catch indicator. The final versions of the questionnaires for both age groups can be found in Appendix B . Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 8B.

Sampling Design Universe : 248,162 in habitants of the Department of Jinotega Sampling size : A random stratified sampling method, known as LQAS (Lot Quality Assurance Sampling), was used. Through LQAS, a sample size of 19 interviews per lot was obtained. Eight lots were identified, correspondi ng to each municipality in the Department of Jinotega. In addition, parallel sampling was used to better understand the knowledge, practices, and coverage of mothers with children 0 -11 months, and mothers with children 12 -23 months. Thus, slightly differe nt questionnaires were used for each group (see Appendix D for the instruments used). The sample sized used gave a total of 38 interviews per supervision area, or 152 interviews from each age group, or a grand total of 304 interviews for the total area of the project (Department of Jinotega). Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 11For the purpose of the KPC midterm study, eight supervision areas were defined as follows: SA 1: Jinotega SA 2: San Rafael del Norte SA 3: La Concordia SA 4: San Sebastian de Yali SA 5: Santa Maria de Pantas ma SA 6: Wiwili SA 7: El Cua SA 8: San Jose de Bocay For the selection of the communities, a random sampling framework was used based on the population of communities within each supervision area. The result was the identification of communities to b e sampled, which are listed in Appendix E. For each selected community the census and maps were updated, all of this in close coordination with MINSA personnel and CHVs. According to the sampling framework, each one of the homes was numbered within the r espective community map, selecting at random the homes to be interviewed. Following, also at random, if there was more than one informer or a mother had children both 0 to 11 and 12 to 23 months old, only one of them was selected for each home. In case t hat at the selected homes there were no informers to complete the sampling set, the nearest home was identified. No two interviews were ever made to the same mother, nor were two interviews carried out at the same home. A sampling set was considered comp lete after having completed both interviews (0 to 11 and 12 to 23 months old). An interview was considered complete after filling out the questionnaire, weighting and measuring the child and taking the blood sample both from the mother and child. Only at this point a new home was selected to start the new sampling set. Following this procedure all sets identified for each community were completed until finishing the 19 corresponding set for each supervision area. D. TRAINING In preparation for the use o f the LQAS methodology, technical and support personnel received training from Project HOPE \u00b4s Specialists , with expertise in the use of LQAS methodology for baseline and other assessments in Nicaragua. Training was also provided to all personnel in anthro pometrical measurements, blood sampling and hemoglobin determination, with the support of the MINSA Central and the Facultad de Medicina, UNAN, Managua. For the hemoglobin determinations, HEMOCUE 2 photometers were utilized, which used the principle that a fter erythrocytes are hemolyzed by sodium deoxycholate, hemoglobin is released. Hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin by sodium nitrate, which together with sodium azide, give azidemethemoglobin. The absorbance is then measured at two wavelengths (570 and 880 nm) in order to compensate for turbidity in the sample. The sample is collected from arterial or venous blood and place on a microcuvette. For the sampling and survey, procedures and recommendations outlined in the HEMOCUE Operating Manual were f ollowed. For the measurement of weight on children, SALTER scales graduated in kilograms were used; and for height measurement locally manufactured measuring boards graduated in centimeters were used. Procedures outlined in the Manual for Determination o f Nutritional Status 3 were followed. In order to achieve the standardized performance of the survey teams for all these procedures, field tests were conducted to assure quality of measure among survey personnel. 2 HemoCue, Blood Hemoglobin Photometer.

DATA COLLECTION A ND QUALITY CONTROL The technical team from Project HOPE Jinotega and external personnel conducted the KPC data collection with experience in this type of surveys. The collection of data took place approximately within an intensive two -week fieldwork period. Project HOPE Jinoteg a used ten survey teams, which were composed by one supervisor and one interviewer in each team. Quality control was done by two staff members from Project HOPE and stakeholders who used a quality control checklist (see Appendix F) during the interview pr ocess. The Child Survival project manager, Dr. Mario Ortega was responsible for quality control with the technical assistance from the following persons: Ing. Marlon Rizo (Project HOPE Jinotega - Responsible for Information Systems and Dr. Doris Gonz\u00e1lez ( SILAIS Jinotega - Responsible for Maternal Care). The average time of the interview for anthropometrical measurements and hemoglobin determination was forty -five minutes. Project HOPE's technical personnel collected the information using the PDAs (Surve yors), and supervisors (mainly external personnel used pen and paper. Both roles were performed by personnel with vast experience in these types of studies. Surveyors were selected based on their experience with the use of the PDAs, which obviously are al l members of the technical staff of the Project HOPE CS project in Jinotega. The supervisors were members of different organizations, the MINSA - SIALIS Jinotega, PCI -San Rafael del Norte and Project HOPE. This methodology also served to validate the effec tiveness of the technology now being used by Project HOPE for all processes related to data collection and analysis supporting each one of the strategies and indicators monitored by the project. MAIN SURVEY PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD Giving the survey process it was found that some women declined to be interviewed but an effort was made to collect basic information about them and possible reasons for their decision. TABLE 6: RESPONDENTS REJECTION TO THE SU RVEY BY MUNICIPALITY Municipalities No. Age Background Child's Age Reasons for denial 1 18 Rural 0-11 The decision was the mother's El Cua 2 19 Rural 0-11 The decision was the mother's San Jos\u00e9 de Bocay 3 26 Rural 0-11 The decision was the mother's Mothers that refused to be interviewed did it mainly bec ause they did not want to have blood samples taken from their children and themselves for the hemoglobin test. F. DATA ANALYSIS The information systems specialist of Project HOPE Jinotega entered all the information -collected data into the Access program. Data analysis was made by comparing the specific results obtained for each supervision area with the average project coverage and with statistical data from the SILAIS and ENDESA 2001. The results of the survey are presented in LQAS summary tables in th e Appendices, Appendix B. The information regarding weight, size and age was analyzed by way of the statistics program EpiNut of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) using the 1978 reference population of the US National Center for Health Statistics recom mended by the World Health Organization, which is used to describe the nutritional status of children through the indicators of height for age and weight for age. The use of this reference population is based on the premise that all well nourished children , from all population groups, follow very similar growth patterns. For this MTE, with the support of the Ministry of Health at the central level, field personnel were standardized for size and weight measurements. Size determinations were made with childre n lying down (length) Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 13WEIGHTED POPULATION It is important to remark that when information from different areas is collected, the specific estimates obtained for each area will not be exact, for this reason an estimation of coverage (with respective confid ence intervals) must be calculated for the total project area with enough precision by combining all areas. This is accomplished by weighting the results of each supervision area according to the total population in the project area. In other words, the weighted population is simply the proportion of the total programmed area population living within a specific lot or area. Furthermore, this weighted population can be used to calculate coverage for the total project area as well as confidence intervals. Even though the weighted estimates are considered more precise than the non -weighted, the difference between this two is generally not big. In order to carry out the comparison of data between all supervision areas and the total project area the populati on was weighted for each one of the areas. Table 7: Total estimate sample with weighted population: Supervision area Sampling size (n) Population (N) Weighting (w i) 1. Jinotega 38 58,788 58,788 / 248,162 = 0.24 2.

Results: Discussion and Analysis A total of 304 mothers with children 0 to 23 months old were interviewed, mothers had an average age of 25 years, 7% were less than 18 years old, and 4% were more than 39 years old. The young est and oldest mothers were 16 and 45 years old respectively. The distribution for children less than two years old by gender was 53% females, 47% males. For the age group of 0 to 11 months of age, the distribution was even (50% for both genders) The av erage age for children 0 to 11 months old was six months, with a standard deviation of 3.4 months. The mean for this group was 9 months. 50% 0f children were less than 6 months old, 24% was between 6 and 8 months old, and 26% was between 9 and 11 months o ld. The average age for the group of children 0 to 23 months old was 18 months, with a standard deviation of 3.5 months and a mean of 18 months. 83% of mothers had attended some level of grammar school, and only 15% had attended some level of high school. 34% of mothers do not know how to read or write. 16.5% of all interviewed mothers do some kind of work to earn money, 29% take their children with them when they go out of their homes, 27% leave the younger children under the care of older siblings, and grandmothers cared for 31.3% of children. The 19 key Project indicators are presented in the following graphs, also showing the confidence intervals for all 4 studies conducted: Baseline study, March 2003; Annual monitoring rounds, September 2003 and 2004 ; and Mid Term Evaluation, March 2005. Maternal and Newborn of children aged 0-23 months who report having had at least one prenatal visit with a doctor or nurse. One of the main strategies of the MOH, to try to reduce maternal mortality, is the prenatal care, which must have the following characteristics: early, periodi c, complete, and of wide coverage. The Project investigates, through references from the mothers, the coverage rates for prenatal care for mothers with children 0 to 23 months old. There was not a statistically significant variation between the baseline an d midterm studies (as shown by de confidence intervals) and is close to the proposed goal of 95%. The result of the midterm study is also above the results obtained by the MOH for 2004 period, 84%. See Fig 1. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua aged 0-23 months old whose birth was attended by a doctor or nurse. The same as with the prior indicator for reduction of maternal mortality, the MOH has included the institutional delivery as one of the four pillars for a safe motherhood. The geographical characteristics of the Jinotega Department make it difficult to get close to the op timal accessibility for institutional deliveries (above 80%). In this study it was found that deliveries attended by a doctor or a nurse were only 54%. Even though there was a 2 percent points improvement over the Baseline, this is not significant (includ ed within the confidence interval), but it is close to the proposed goal of 60%. See figure 2. In order to improve the coverage for institutional deliveries, the MOH with support of other organizations -including Project HOPE, is developing the Delivery Pl an for safe motherhood strategy, which is now being implemented in 56 who report having had at least one postpartum visit. More than half the maternal deaths in Nicaragua occur during the puerperal period. According to the MOH norms, mothers should rece ive at least one pos -natal control after the first week following delivery. The Mid term study Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 17found that 33% of mothers with children 0 to 23 months old stated having had at lest one post -natal visit with a doctor or a nurse. No significant difference is observed in comparison with the Baseline Study. According to the MOH the coverage for the puerperal period care is 52%, but his may be due to the fact that the first post natal care performed at the time of birth, before being released, is sometimes count ed wrongly as a post natal visit. Besides this, the denominator used by the MOH for this indicator is a population estimate. See fig. 3 Nutrition aged 0-23 months, weighed in the last four months according to growth monitoring card. For Growth Monitoring and Promotion of children less than two years of age, the MOH with support of other organizations -including Project HOPE, is implementing the PROCOSAN strategy in approximately 30% of all communities accessible by land in the Jinotega Department. According to the program, children must be weig hed every month in the community. In the last two years a 20 -point improvement is observed for children weighed during the last 4 months, according to the health card. With a change form 68% at the time of the Baseline study to 86% during the midterm evalu ation, an adequate progress is observed with respect to the proposed goal of 91%. See fig. 4. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 0-23 months with low weight (weight for age) (<2Z). The main problem associated to child mortality by diarrhea and pneumonia is malnutrition. The PROCOSAN emphasis is to improve the nutritional status of children through the use of locally available high nutritional value foods associated to behavioral changes related to childcare. The study does not show significant differences as compared to the baseline. Still, it is worth noting that this result is one third of the number of children with low weight reported by the MOH. In three municipalities ((Jinotega, El Cu\u00e1 y Bocay), the World Food Program and the DAP programs implemented by CRA -CARITAS and Project Concern International, pro vide food to communities in extreme poverty. This indicator was not monitored during the annual monitoring rounds, only for the baseline and MTE. See months old with anemia. Hb > 11 mg/dl Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 19One of the MOH strategies to reduce the prevalence of Anemia is the fortification of flour with Iron and provision of iron supplements to all children younger than 5 years of age. This study shows a 5% increase in anemia as compared to the baseline, from 41.9% to 47%, for children 0 to 23 month old. The group with the hig hest prevalence was the 0 to 12 months old (See annexes, table 11). This could be associated with an early introduction of complementary foods in children less than 6 months old, and the reduction of exclusive breastfeeding (See annexes, table 10). The num bers found during this study almost double the numbers reported by the MOH, 26%. The variability in this indicator is due to the difference between age groups (IC > 6). This indicator is now farther from the proposed goal of 30%. See fig 0- 23 months old who were breastfed within the first hour after birth One of the eleven steps for successful breastfeeding is early latching; the MOH has continued the work with \"Mother and Child Friendly Health Units\". In this study, the number of mothers with children 0 to 23 month old that breastfeed their children within the first hour was maintained, with a 3% improvement over the baseline, but this increase is included within the CI. Improvements to this indicator depend on the coverage for Institutional childbirth and support of the TBA s, regarding counseling about breastfeeding done during the prenatal care. See fig. 7. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 aged 0-5 months who received only breast milk in the past 24 hours One of the sixteen healthy practices promoted by the WHO is Exclusive Breastfeeding. The results of this study indicate that 525 of chil dren less than6 month of age received exclusive breastfeeding in the last 24 hours before the survey, with a 4 percent decrease as compared to the baseline. The CI for this indicator is wide, depending on the sample size. The result of the MTE study is wit hin the CI limits (12.5). See fig. 8. OPV3, Pentavalente 3, and MMR) by 12 months One of the main efforts of the MOH in support of children, is to provide necessary vaccination to all children according to the national vaccination schedule, in order to av oid preventable diseases. The MTE study shows an 81% coverage for children 12 -13 months old with all vaccines, 12% higher than the one found during the baseline. Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 21The two main strategies used by the MOH are: the National Health Campaigns and the systematic vaccination of children though the reduction of missed opportunities both for sick and healthy children who are seen at the health units or during the visits of health personnel to the communities. The communities where Project HOPE and other partner organ izations implement PROCOSAN are beneficiaries of these two strategies. This indicator cannot be compared with information from the MOH, because the EPI program registers coverage by individual vaccines and the denominator is an estimated population. Even t hough for this indicator, the original goal of 80% is surpassed, the quality of the immunization related to the interval between doses is low (a 6 month old child must be immunized with BCG, OPV and three doses of Penta -Valente, and at 12 months of age, he must receive a Measles dose in order to be considered having completed the schedule). The goal of the MOH is to immunize 100% of children with all vaccines. See fig. 9.

No significant differences were found with respect to the baseline study, even though a decrease in the number of diarrhea cases was observed. See Fig. 10 Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 of children aged 0-23 months with a diarrheal episode in the last two weeks who report giving as much or more liquids or breast milk to their child The same as with the prior indicator, this behavior is promoted for the management of children with diarrhea, no significant differences are shown with respect to the baseline study. See Fig of children aged 0-23 months who report having sought assistance or counseling from a health unit or CORU during the child's last diarrheas episode. The behavior analysis of mothers with children having a diarrhea episode in the last two weeks before the study, indicates an almost 20% improvement for healthcare or counseling seeking practices from a Health Unit or CORU, Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 23as compa red to the baseline study, from 35% to 53%. This could be a side effect of the strong campaign carried out by the MOH a few months before the study, to combat a Rotavirus outbreak, which focused precisely on seeking care for any child with diarrhea, even w ithout dehydration signs. See of children aged 0-23 months who report washing their hands with water and soap before the preparation of meals, before feeding children, after defecation and after tending a child that has defecated The most important behavior to reduce the incidence and prevalence of diarrhea is hand washing at key moments. The MTE study shows a decrease of almost 50% for the knowledge of key moments when mothers with children younger than two years of age, must wash their hands. This result could be influenced by the strong campaign of the MOH, reorienting the preferred behavior towards seeking immediate medical attention above all others for diarrhe a cases, in order to combat the Rotavirus outbreak during the first quarter of 2005. See fig. 13 Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 mothers of who can identify at least two danger signs for diarrhea The main problem of diarrhea is dehydration. Learning to recognize it in time to avoid death is the challenge proposed by the WH O and UNICEF. The knowledge of mothers regarding dehydration signs decreased with respect to the baseline study and annual monitoring rounds, going from 27% to 17%. At the time of this study, the country faced a diarrhea outbreak caused by Rotavirus and to fight it, the MOH and other organizations working in health, focused all their efforts on a national campaign for prevention of diarrhea. The dissemination of messages through mass media, such as radio, was the main information strategy. The messages to which the mothers were exposed focused on recognition of symptoms caused by the Rotavirus (vomiting, fever and increased frequency and amount of bowel movements), without mentioning any signs of dehydration. See fig. 14. Pneumonia Case aged 0-23 months with cough and fast breathing in the last two weeks taken to a health unit Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 25One of the main causes of child mortality in Nicaragua is pneumonia and its complications. The key sign for diagnostic of pneumonia is fast breathing according to the IMCI norm; the behavior promoted when this sign is identified is to quickly seek medical attention. The behavior of mothers to go to a health unit when a child presented fast breathing, showed a 5% decrease during this study, with respect to the baseline. Still, the smaller sample size increased the Confidence Interval (the denominator is equal to the number of cases), in this way the result is included within the CI of the baseline study. See fig. mothers who identify fast breathing as a danger sign of pneumonia With fast breathing as the most important sign of pneumonia (not exclusive), the identif ication of this sign by mothers becomes crucial to opportunely seek attention. The MTE study does not shows a significant difference when compared to the baseline study. See fig. 16 Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC children aged 12 to 23 months old that were born at least 24 months after previous surviving child In order t o ensure the survival of children less than 2 years of age and improve the quality of life of mothers and children, the UNFPA recommends a child spacing greater than 24 months. The MTE study found that 86% of children 0 to 23 months old had a spacing of at least 24 months with the older brother or did not have any brothers at the time of the survey, with the greatest difference shown by the 0 to 11 months old group. No significant differences are observed between the baseline and MTE studies. The proposed g oal 90% is found within the confidence interval, mothers with children aged 12 to 23 months old who are not pregnant, desire no more children or are not sure and report using a modern family planning method Family planning is one of the four pillars for safe motherhood, supporting the effort dedicated to FP, since it allows women to increase Child Spacing. The MTE found that 90% of mothers that; are not pregnant, do not desire more children or are not sure, use a modern FP method. This is an increase of 25% over the baseline study and Project HOPE CS -18: Jinotega, Nicaragua 2005 KPC Midterm Report Page 27surpasses the proposed goal by 20% (70%) In order to achieve these results t he CS Project is supporting the efforts of the MOH to implement the Community Delivery of Family Planning Methods strategy. The provision of FP methods to the Health Units is being supported with improved logistics at all levels of the MOH. HIV / AIDS of children aged 0-23 months who know at least two ways to prevent HIV / AIDS / STIs The MOH promotes two forms of preventing AIDS, the use of condom and fidelity. The CS project supports these two and includes a third one, Limiting the Number of Sexual Partners. The MTE study found an 8% increase in the knowledge of mothers about at least two form of preventing STI/AIDS, as compared with the Baseline study. This result is still very low when compared to the results of the ENDESA 2001. See fig. 19. V. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Espeut, D., CSTS., The CORE Group . Manual de Actividades de Campo, 2001, ENDESA.
