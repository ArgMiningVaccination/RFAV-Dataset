By CVB definition, a production platform is a manufacturing process that relies on a single vector or expression system (\"backbone\") and a standard process for inserting a gene or genes of interest (GOI) into the system to generate different recombinant master seeds or constructs, which are then used to produce product following a standardized method for manufacture. The GOI is selected to be one that codes for a protein that is known to convey immunity against the agent in question, so that the final product will be expected to produce disease coverage in vaccinated animals. PRESCRIPTION VACCINE PROCESS Since the beginning of animal domestication, owners and producers have been dealing with the effects of animal diseases. Past efforts to combat them have included such things as herbal and antibiotic treatments, dietary modifications, alterations in management practices, and vaccination. Until recently, vaccination has been limited to the use of either commercial or autogenous vaccines, both of which have their own distinct advantages and drawbacks.

Medgene Labs is currently in the process of licensing our products with the USDA. As an immunological services provider, Medgene Labs plans to do more than produce state-of-the-art, precision vaccines. We help veterinarians and producers monitor their herd with diagnostic surveillance and data analytics to proactively provide treatment that is customized for each herd. By partnering with veterinarians and producers, we create a system of checks and balances to provide tools resulting in healthier herds and improved production. Infected HerdClean HerdCurrently Available Constructs for Future Vaccine Production At Medgene Labs, we are continually striving to develop and expand our construct library. Here is a list of our currently available constructs. If what you need is not listed below, please reach out to your representative to discuss available options. Viral Homology Viral homology is critically important to successful treatment of a herd. Viruses with a higher variability in homology need a more proactive approach to monitoring and responding to changes as the virus mutates and spreads. Prescription services help us to fulfill the monitoring and adaptation required to maximize the production of your herd. Swine Production Pipeline: IAV (H1, H3) CONSTRUCT BANK * If you do not see a disease listed that is currently affecting your herd, please contact your representative. Additional constructs may be available or could be created based on your needs. ISPRIME SERVICE The ISPrime Service was developed to rapidly respond to new and rapidly changing diseases. Through diagnostics and monitoring, we partner with our customers to rapidly rollout vaccines to protect and enhance the health of their herds. The process works by collecting a customer's sequence and comparing it to our construct library. If your sequence matches with one of our existing constructs, we will be able to deliver a precise vaccine in a matter of weeks. If one of our current constructs from our library is not a match, we develop a new construct and vaccine with 100% homology to the disease affecting your herd. Medegene Labs is currently in the process of licensing our products with the USDA. At the core of the ISPrime Service is a dedication to a dynamic and customized response for the health of your herd. Reliable and predictable response times are critical to managing herd health. With ISPrime services, you can count on on-time and on-budget delivery.

These are vaccines which are prescribed by a veterinarian to proactively target emerging diseases, such as viruses that change frequently or are difficult to grow. As an Immunological Services ProviderTM, Medgene Labs monitors the production environment for new viruses, continuously updates its virus sequence and vaccine construct bank to rapidly counter production health risks, and serologically monitors vaccinated animals for effectiveness. Medgene Labs provides these immunological services to its ISPRIME\u00ae community of leading livestock producers and their veterinarians in support of delivering consistent and reliable health management tools. Additional general information regarding Prescription Product Vaccines can be found in Veterinary Services Memorandum Nos. 800.213 and 800.214. Medgene Labs is in the process of licensing RxPP products for their ISPRIME service with the USDA. For more information on Medgene Labs, please visit www.medgenelabs.com .

Why and When to Choose Prescription Vaccines When it comes to the health of your herd, it is important to consider a variety of variables to ensure the best outcome for your circumstances. At the top of the list, speed of delivery, safety, and cost of any vaccine should be high priorities for responsible veterinarians or producers during their evaluation. Autogenous vaccines have a long history. However, there are some viruses that cannot be isolated and others that mutate very rapidly, rendering vaccines ineffective. Prescription vaccines are designed to fill the gap left by autogenous vaccines. Sequencing your herd's pathogen can create exceptionally effective vaccines for herds affected by viruses that can not be isolated or that mutate very rapidly. Medgene Labs has produced a library of constructs to build a precise vaccine for the virus affecting your herd. In the event your herd is not a good match with one of our existing constructs, we are able to rapidly build and deploy a customized vaccine for your current situation. Medegene Labs is currently in the process of licensing our products with the USDA. PRESCRIPTION VS AUTOGENOUS VACCINES Prescription Derived from a Gene of Interest (GOI) sequence - High success rate for viruses that are hard to grow. Only the relevant protective targets are produced. The targeted proteins are formulated with adjuvant and bottled. Use based on Veterinary Client Patient Relationship (VCPR). Recent target, GOI sequence only. Master seed constructs do not expire. Efficacy unproven (initial product is fully licensed with proven efficacy).Autogenous Derived from an isolate - Low success rate for viruses that are hard to grow. The entire organism is isolated from the originating farm and killed. The killed organism is formulated with adjuvant and bottled. Adjacent/non-adjacent documents and VCPR needed to use on other farms. Reactive target, whole virus or bacteria. Master seed isolates expire. Efficacy unproven.VS www.medgenelabs.com Copyright \u00a9 2021 VST LLC Ave., Brookings, South Dakota 57006\"I started working with Medgene Labs to help our clients address health challenges in various production areas. I was able to be part of a field trial with their prescription vaccine and had positive responses on several farms. Medgene's vaccine has helped me serve my clients, and the Medgene team has been very responsive to my needs.\" Dr. Luke Strehle, DVM "}
