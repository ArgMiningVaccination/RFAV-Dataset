The goal of the project is thus to develop new visualization techniques and tools that support research into the \"Republic of Letters\" by facilitating interpretation of the complex data sets that have been materialized from this predominantly textual archival collection. - Notes: - This project will focus on a body of 53,000 18th-century letters and analyze the degree to which the effects of the Enlightenment can be observed in the letters of people of various occupations. The project is lead by humanities scholars, librarians, and computer scientists from Stanford University, the University of Oklahoma, and Oxford University. - Metadata: [xml](https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:12353/descMetadata/xml/) - Status: - Published - Last Updated: - 6 years ago - License: [Attribution-NonCommercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) Downloads: 97 "}
