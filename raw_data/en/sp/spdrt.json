Purpose This notice announces the opportunity to apply for funding under the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program. The purpose of this program is to increase the number of dental and dental hygiene faculty in the workforce by assisting dental and dental hygiene training programs to attract and retain dental and dental hygiene facult y through the operation of a loan repayment program . Program Requiremen ts Award recipients must plan, develop, or operate a loan repayment program for individuals who agree to serve full -time as faculty members within the disciplines of general dentistry, pediatric dentistry, dental public health, or dental hygiene. Recipients must create a Selection Committee to identify and determine the individual loan repayment recipient(s). The Selection Committee is encouraged to include, as part of its review/scoring process, consideration for individual loan repayment recipients from a rural or disadvantaged background or from underrepresented minorit ies. To support the repayment of student debt, applicants are encouraged to identify and select potential faculty who are willing to pursue scholarly activity, precept students and faculty in community based sites, and have an interest in formal training in teaching methodologies to ensure their long -term commitment and engagement in an academic career. Recipients must select loan repayment recipient(s) prior to the end of the first budget period of the award (September 1, 2022 - August 31, 2023). No member on the Selection Committee, or the Project Director (PD), is eligible for loan repayment through this program. The recipient 's loan repayment program will pay an amount equal to 10 percent after year one of service, 15 percent after year two, 20 percent after year three, 25 percent after year four, and 30 percent after year five, of the individual's student loan balance, as calculated based on principal and interest owed at the ini tiation of the agreement. Loan repayments are to be obligated at the start of an individual's year of service, but paid only upon completion of each year of service and may not be prorated. Applicants may not request more than the following amounts through this NOFO (see Section II.2: Summary of Funding for additional details): Up to $100,000 - Year 1 Up to $150,000 - Year 2 Up to $200,000 - Year 3 Up to $250,000 - Year 4 Up to $300,000 - Year 5 HRSA -22-046 2 Direct and indirect cost s associated with the creation and management of the loan repayment program at the institution must be paid for out of these above- listed amounts or absorbed by the institution. Indirect costs are limited to eight percent of modified total direct costs. Please note that subsequent funding increases are contingent on the appropriation of funds. Funding Priorities 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 293k -2(c) (Section 748(c) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act) provides funding priorities for the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program. The approval of a funding priority adds points to an applicant's score. Up to seven points are available across seven funding priorities for applicants that qualify. Applicants are permitted to apply for more than one priority, but no applicant c an receive more than seven priority points. Refer to Section V.2 of this NOFO for detailed information on qualifying for the funding priorities. General Emergency Preparedness Statement Eligible entities must be ready to continue programmatic activities in the event of a public health emergency - both those that are expected and unexpected. A training - focused emergency preparedness plan is critical for HRSA -funded projects and helps ensure that recipients are able to continue programmatic activities, can co ordinate effectively, and can implement recovery plans when emergencies disrupt project activities. You must develop and maintain a flexible training -focused emergency preparedness plan in case of public health emergencies to ensure continuation of program matic and training activities, including but not limited to operating the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program . 2. Background Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program is authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 293k -2 (section 748 of the Public Health Service Act). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for dentists is projected to grow 8 percent from 20 20 to 20 30. 1 However, even if the number of oral health providers grows, significant unmet need exists for vulnerable and underserved populations particularly for primary care dentists. Demand for general dentists is predicted to exceed supply by 2030. 2 There are 6, 578 Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)3 and HRSA estimates that over 10,964 additional dental providers would be needed to remove those shortage designations4. 1 Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job Outlook. Available at : https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/dentists.htm#tab -6 2 HRSA's (HPSA) Dashboard. National Summary. Dental Health. https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health- workforce/shortage- areas Data as of 09/09/2021. 4 recruitment and retention of faculty to train future dental health professionals is critical to address the dental health professional shortages. In academic year (AY) 2018- 19, there were 280 vacant full -time positions at dental schools, the majority in general dentistry . 5 Sixteen percent of faculty positions have been vacant for more than 12 months6. Of the full -time faculty who separated from U.S. dental schools, 39 percent retired, up from 31 percent in AY 2013- 147. Eighteen percent of faculty left to go into private practice, and another 18 percent went to another dental school8. Salary and budget limitations influence the ability for dental schools to fill vacant positions, as student debt continues to rise9. Accor ding to the American Dental Association, \" five out of six dental school graduates (83%) reported having educational debt [in 2019]. Average educational debt among dental school graduates has grown from $157,327 to $292,169 (adjusted for inflation) from 200 0 to 2019, for those graduates who had debt. \"10 Diversity is still an issue among dental faculty. Only 11 percent of full -time and part -time faculty in dental schools are of historically underrepresented and marginalized (HURM) 11 background. Representative faculty role models are particularly important to encourage trainees from underrepresented groups, improve the diversity of the health workforce and address health inequities. Promoting equity is essential to the Department of Health and Human Service's mi ssion of protecting the health of Americans and providing essential human services. 12 Studies have shown that trainees from underrepresented groups are more likely to provide health care services in underserved communities. 13,14,15 5 American Dental Education Association's table \"Number of Vacant Budgeted Faculty Positions at U.S. Dental Schools, 2000- 01 through 2018- 19\" https://www.adea.org/data/Faculty/2018- 2019- Survey/ 6 American Dental Education Association's table \"Length of Time Dental School Faculty Positions Were Vacant, 2018- 19 Academic Year\" https://www.adea.org/data/Faculty/2018- 2019 -Survey/ BJ, Slapar F, & Valachovic RW.

In addition, t he following de finition appl ies to the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program for Fiscal Year 2022: Equity - [T]he consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, (LGBTQ+) disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Addressing issues of equity should include an understanding of intersectionality and how multiple forms of discrimination impact individuals' lived experiences. Individuals and communities often belong to more than one group that has been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Individuals at the nexus of multiple ide ntities often experience unique forms of discrimination or systemic disadvantages, including in their access to needed services. For latest poverty guidelines to determine environmentally disadvantaged background refer to ''Low Income Levels'' Used for Var ious Health Professions and Nursing Programs Authorized in Titles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Service Act: , for the purposes of this NOFO, are individuals who have completed a pediatric dental residency, have an appointment in a division or department of pediatric dentistry, and who teach in the field of pediatric dentistry at either the predoctoral or postdoctoral residency lev el. Primary Care Dentistry , for the purposes of this NOFO, is defined as general dentistry, pediatric dentistry, dental public health or dental hygiene. Underserved Communities - [The] populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of 'equity '.

Restrictions on Loan Repaym ent Awards Every person receiving support from award funds must be employed in the United States or territories. Every person receiving loan repayment through the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program must be a citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident of the United States. Recipients of award funds cannot receive financial support from another federally - funded program requiring the fulfillment of a service commitment that would run concurrently with the contracted Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Progr am commitment. This includes, but is not limited to, scholarship and loan repayment programs through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), the Indian Health Service (IHS), HRSA's Faculty Loan Repayment Program, and the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Programs. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is not considered a service obligation. In addition to the listed examples, a more complete list can be found on page 12 of the NHSC guidelines. Those listed programs include qualifying and non-qualifying educational loans: https://nhsc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/NHSC/loan- repayment/nhsc -students2service -LRP-application- program -guidance.pdf Loan repayment is taxable income and must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Loan repayment recipients are ultimately responsible for paying the federal, state, and local tax liabilities associated with the loan repayment funds provided through this program. However, it is the award recipients' responsibility to verify that program participants apply the payments to their loans. To assist loan repayment recipients, the awardee institutions may elect to withhold applicable taxes utilizing their existing payroll or payment systems. However, Dental Faculty Loan Repayment funds cannot be considered additional salary for the purposes of calculating the faculty's fringe benefits. Faculty who have previously participate d in a HRSA Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program may still participate but cannot: Exceed 5 years of participation, including prior history of participation AND Deviate from the statutorily prescribed repayment structure and receive more than a total of 100 percent re payment (payments from previous program cycles need to be taken into account).

Up to seven (7) priority points are available across the seven (7) priorities for applicants that qualify. Applicants are permitted to apply for more than one priority, but no applicant can receive more than seven (7) priority points. The instructions/c riteria for each funding priority are provided below, and funding priority requests and justification narratives/data must be uploaded and labeled as Attachment 6. Funding priorities are approved or denied by HRSA staff. Failure to clearly request or provide the requested information, documentation, or sufficient detail may result in the denial of your request.

Funding Special Considerations and Other Factors A special consideration is the favorable consideration of an application by HRSA funding officials, based on the extent to which the application addresses the specific area of special consideration. Applications that do not receive special consideration wi ll be given full and equitable consideration during the review process. In making final award decisions, HRSA may take into consideration the geographic distribution of awards. In order to achieve the distribution of awards as stated above, HRSA may need t o fund out of rank order. HRSA -22-046 31 3. Assessment of Risk HRSA may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial instability that directly relates to the organization's ability to implement statutory, regulatory , or other requirements 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 ). HRSA reviews a pplications receiving a favorable objective review for other considerations that include past performance, as applicable ; cost analysis of the project/program budget ; assessment of your management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibility ; and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requiring just -in-time submissions.

However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that HRSA will make an award. Following review of all applicable information, HRSA 's approving and business management officials will determine whether HRSA can make an award, if special conditions ar e required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Award decisions are discretionary and are not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. HRSA is required to review and consider any information about your organization that is in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) . You may review and comment on any information about your organization that a federal awarding agency previously entered. HRSA will consider your comments, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about your organization's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk as desc ribed in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 HHS Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants .
