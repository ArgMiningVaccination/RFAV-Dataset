The Texas Association of Naturopathic Doctors is incredibly moved by her life, and it is a true honor to be the recipients of her memorial fund. Dr. Nova wanted to practice naturopathic medicine in her home state of Texas. We will carry her in our hearts in our mission to foster the growth of naturopathic medicine through education, community service, and licensure to support the wellbeing of Texans. In Memory of Dr. Sharon Nova A precious angel has left us to fulfill her calling with the Lord. Dr Sharon Nova San Juan was born June 22, 1990 in San Antonio, Texas. She attended O'Conner High School and gradated in 2008. She graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelors Degree in Respiratory Care from the University Of Texas Health Sciences in 2012. During her Freshman year she was diagnosed with Chron's disease and struggled with pain and depression which she overcame when she joined the Chron's and Colitis Foundation in San Antonio, Texas. Therapy for the foundation's members was running, so then began her training for the Rock-n-Roll Marathon. She completed the Rock-n-Roll Marathon (1/2 marathon) in 2012 and 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada. Sharon was a Respiratory Therapist at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Methodist Children's Hospital and touched the lives of so many babies, children and their families. After two years and deep soul searching she decided to apply for the Doctorate Program of Naturopathic Medicine in San Diego California. Sharon was ecstatic when she was accepted and during her first semester called home to share with her family that this was her true calling - to educate and heal those in need. On June 22, 2019 she received her Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (on her birthday) and was coming home to San Antonio to fulfill her dream of opening her own clinic, and was a strong advocate for licensure of Naturopathic Doctors in the state of Texas. Sharon loved to cook and always shared her creations with her colleagues, teachers and family. Always trying to find a healthy approach to prepare food. She had a passion for all genres of music and even dabbled in writing her own rap song. Sharon touched the lives of so many people, she inspired her colleagues at Bastyr University and loved life! Anyone who knew Sharon would know what mattered most to her was making sure everyone around her felt loved! She was strong, compassionate and true in her pursuit of healing those around her. She knew true healing came from the heart and hers was PURE GOLD. Nothing would make her happier than to know her spirit will continue to live on in the recipients of her most precious gifts. Sharon is survived by her parents Belinda and Curtis Elliott, her sister Lani and her children Malia, Junior, Avishai and Noel, her brother Ryan and his wife Clarissa and their son Rylee, her little brother Jason, grandfather Leopoldo M. Nova, father Ephraim San Juan, and all her loving Uncles, Aunts and cousins. She leaves behind her loving boyfriend Derek Schilling and their adorable miniature schnauzer Pickles. \"There are two pillars of a great clinician: Cognitive Dimension - the ability to figure out what's wrong with a patient and have technical expertise in treating them. Interpersonal Dimension - the ability to relate to patients on a personal basis and really understand not just what is the matter with them but to know WHAT MATTERS to them.\" -- Dr. Sharon Nova "}
