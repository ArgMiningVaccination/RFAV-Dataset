The ancient Chinese honored the Tao, the wisdom of the natural universe, and thought it embodied guidance for human conduct, to ensure health and longevity, as well as right relationship with other humans and the vast cosmos. Through a detailed lens of numerology, the I Ching, they studied the cycles of the seasons, linking five essential elements found on earth to each season, and attributing each with a color, odor, flavor and emotion. As the seasons progress through the year, expressing the natural cycle of our planet, so they model the life cycles of humans and all creatures (macrocosm/microcosm) and can instruct us how best to conduct our activities. For example, the colder shorter days of winter suggest more quiescent indoor activity, more rest and sleep, so as to replenish energy stores for the reopening of the year in spring. By synchronizing our lives to be in accordance with nature, we may expect to attain optimum health and well being. Chinese medicine is a conservative approach to healthcare. We believe that through proper nutrition, herbs and gentle, non-invasive therapies, moderate exercise and lifestyle, as well as proper rest, we may reduce the overall burden upon our bodyminds, liberating our energy so that we may come into greater health and vitality. \"Mount Kunlun was thought to be the abode of the immortals, a massive rampart of gold surrounding its embattlements of precious stones.
