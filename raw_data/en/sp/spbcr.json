By Donna Stark It's easy to understand the divide between sports teams, political parties, and flavors of Oreo cookies, but it's not so easy to reconcile the division between doctors of chiropractic and traditional medical doctors. After all, both professions are centered around helping people manage their medical conditions and heal their bodies. So, why does it seem like some allopathic doctors aren't enamored by, or fans of chiropractic care? And why are they hesitant to refer their patients to this all-natural, holistic approach? Let's take a look at the relationship between doctors, chiropractors, and the business of healing. It's a relationship that might be more complicated than you think. The Difference Between Medical Doctors and Doctors of Chiropractic Although both types of doctors treat and advise patients who are suffering from specific health conditions, several differences stand out and separate the two. To start, chiropractors don't attend the same post-undergraduate schools that traditional medical doctors do. After receiving their undergraduate degree, those who would like to become a chiropractor attend an accredited chiropractic program, and those who wish to become a medical doctor attend one of the many accredited medical schools. It's important to note that both chiropractic and medical schools are equally long and rigorous, but the scope of a chiropractor's education is focused more on the health and function of the spine and nervous system, while medical doctors are educated on a broader range of topics. Chiropractors may also spend a part of their training working with patients, though this training is not set up like the traditional residency programs that other doctors must go through. But perhaps the biggest difference between medical doctors and doctors of chiropractic is the approach that each profession takes when it comes to treating and taking care of their patients. Choosing the Right Treatment Option Doctors of chiropractic focus on a variety of conditions that are generally caused by issues in the musculoskeletal system of the body, such as back and neck pain, sciatica, scoliosis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. They place much of their attention on the overall health of the body's spine, nervous system, joints, muscles, and other soft tissue. Chiropractors do not prescribe medications, nor do they perform invasive procedures. Instead, they treat their patients with spinal manipulations and other types of adjustments under the notion that doing so will help reduce pain, improve function, and restore optimal health and wellness to the body's nervous system. Chiropractic services may also include tips and advice on how to improve the body's overall health and wellness through stretching and exercises, lifestyle changes, and behavior modifications. Medical physicians, such as primary care doctors, treat a wide variety of patients and health conditions. The list of issues they provide medical care for can range from skin infections to colds and flu to more serious chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer. Unlike chiropractic treatment, which looks at the body as a whole and encourages it to heal itself naturally, allopathic medicine focuses mainly on the symptoms that are presented and supports healing through modern medicine modalities. These treatments include, but aren't limited to, prescription medications, injections, and surgical procedures. Why Doctors May Not Like Chiropractic Care Though it may seem as if doctors don't like chiropractors, a better way to put it is that they have their own unique hesitancies when it comes to chiropractic care. From the very beginning, the chiropractic approach has faced many challenges in its attempt to be accepted by the traditional medical community. In its early years, it faced a decades-long campaign that tried to undermine its value. Then it faced years and years of misunderstanding from patients and doctors alike. Now, more people are starting to acknowledge chiropractic's benefits, which has helped the profession gain increasing acceptance from those who initially questioned its worth. If there are some doctors out there who still don't like chiropractic care, it's mostly because they don't understand it, and that is because they aren't taught very much about it in school. Medical schools place a lot of emphasis on how to treat symptoms and manage disease mainly by utilizing prescription medications -- and why wouldn't they? Many of these schools are receiving funds from the very same pharmaceutical companies that sell the medicines doctors prescribe! And although these prescriptions may be an effective treatment in masking symptoms or eventually removing pain, their use certainly isn't warranted for every health issue that afflicts us. Thankfully, there is some positive news. In recent years, there have been a few traditional medical schools that have started to [integrate a small sampling of complementary and alternative medicine instruction into their programs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17895652/). Although this good news isn't widespread or completely accepted as a whole, it is a great start for the future of healthcare and for those patients who are searching for all-natural alternatives. Another reason why some doctors won't refer their patients to a chiropractor is that they may end up losing the business of that patient. Essentially, it boils down to money, and as much as we don't want to think about our health being someone else's livelihood, that's exactly what it is. When you visit The Joint Chiropractic and receive chiropractic manipulation, you aren't seeing your primary care doctor for a refill on your pain prescription. And although you are still giving your business to one doctor over another, you won't be sacrificing your present and future health by choosing chiropractic care and manipulation therapy. Eliminating the need for prescription pills and surgeries means you are also eliminating the risk of dealing with unpleasant and dangerous side effects in the future which may include addiction Building a Lasting and Trusting Friendship At the heart of it all, all healthcare professionals should recognize who is the most important practitioner at the moment, whether it's a chiropractor who acknowledges that a medical doctor is needed, or an MD who realizes a chiropractor could provide the necessary relief. The needs and wishes of every patient must be placed above anything else no matter what philosophy of care the doctor believes in. Therefore, chiropractors and medical practitioners need to work hand in hand. That's the only way the best and most healthy outcome for patients will be achieved.
