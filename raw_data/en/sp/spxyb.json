ADDITIONAL INFO: INDICATIONS: A homeopathic remedy that promotes a healthy upper and lower urinary tract. May aid in the relief of stress-related urination, often indicated by frequent urination often with a strong smell. ADMINISTRATION: Optimally, the liquid preparation should be dropped directly into the mucous membrane of the mouth, including lips, ideally in cats by raising the head until the mouth opens. Where an animal finds this distressful or an owner is unable to comply, the medication can be put in the water or milk. In the case that a pet is sensitive to the odor of the alcohol preservative, a 10 to 20 minute period should be allowed for the alcohol to evaporate before the liquid or food is presented to the patient. Occasionally, when dosed directly into the mouth, the animal may shake their heads as a response to the alcohol preservative. Cats may salivate excessively; in these cases, presenting it in food, water or milk alleviates these effects. Contact your veterinarian if the problem persists. DRUG INTERACTIONS: None known for animal use only. Keep out of reach of children. PHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS: Store at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, and away from strong odors. USER SAFETY: No adverse effects have been recorded. There have been reports to the company of beneficial rather than adverse effects during trial periods. While homeopathic medicine used in humans shows a very high safety margin, care is advised when handling any product. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: None found "}
