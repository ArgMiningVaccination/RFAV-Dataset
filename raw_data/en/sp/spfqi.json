The first is all the Ayurvedic therapies and preparations that utilize and contain aromatic plants, and therefore have essential oils as their primary active constituents. The second is all the ways that essential oils can be classified and used according to Ayurvedic concepts. Ayurveda could be said to be a system of \"eco-physiology,\" meaning that it describes the functioning of the body in terms of ecological and environmental phenomena. These include cosmological energies such as agni (solar heat and metabolic fire), soma (cooling and moistening lunar influences), the pancha mahabhutas (five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space), prana (life force), and the gunas (sensory qualities and mental states). Using these systems and concepts we can classify a large number of essential oils into broad categories of therapeutic functions, which allows us to easily learn and understand the primary nature of these oils so that we can apply them safely and effectively.
