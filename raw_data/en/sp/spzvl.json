Designed to foster interagency collaboration and integration between Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) and LifeLong, the Trust Clinic REVISEDThe Honorable Board of Supervisors June 21, 2019 2 of 3 suppo rts chronically disabled individuals with social, behavioral, and medical treatment. The Trust Clinic has served a diverse and primarily African -American, very low -income homeless or at -risk of homeless patient population located in downtown Oakland and No rth County. As of April 30 in the current fiscal year, Lifelong Trust Clinic has provided integrated primary care services to 68 new patients, which represents an increase of more than 50% of the annual goal of 45 new patients. In addition, 363 Trust patie nts had more than two visits with a primary care physician and received screening for five diseases/conditions during this same period. Approval of the Amendment would allow LifeLong Trust Clinic to provide uninterrupted medical services to the target pop ulation until 6/30/20. HCSA requests your Board to approve a Master Contract Amendment with Alameda Health System (AHS) to provide primary care, behavioral health, enabling, recovery and preventative services to persons experiencing homelessness in Alamed a County as part of the Alameda County Health Care for the Homeless (ACHCH) Program. HCSA requests your Board to approve an MOU amendment that includes no payment terms, with LifeLong to include the provision of a mental health clinical team to the Trust Clinic with specific expertise in serving homeless populations. Approval of this MOU amendment will amend and replace employment of three full -time equivalent (FTE) staff to two FTE staff consisting of one FTE of psychiatry and one FTE of community health worker. The County staff would provide expertise in homeless health care to deliver psychiatry and psychological services at the Trust Clinic and work as an integral part of the clinic's treatment team. AHS is the primary safety net provider for familie s and individuals experiencing homelessness throughout Alameda County and provides services to over 4,000 homeless patients in some 20,000 visits annually, at seven sites on the ACHCH health center federal Scope of Services, including Highland Wellness, Ea stmont Wellness, Highland Same Day Clinic and Specialty Care, Hayward Wellness, Newark Wellness and Mobile Health. Highland Wellness and Eastmont Wellness primary care clinics feature multi -disciplinary teams of clinicians to serve patients impacted by hom elessness and/or substance use disorders. The Substance Abuse Services Expansion (SASE) Team, initially funded through ACHCH health center funding, provides substance use treatment, counseling and case management services based at AHS' Highland Wellness cl inic. AHS also operates a Mobile Health Program in collaboration with the ACHCH program, providing primary and urgent care services at homeless locations throughout Alameda County, which would be the focus of services from AHS for ACHCH patients during the contract term 1/1/19 - 12/31/19. As a result of the 2018 HRSA Operational Site Visit, ACHCH received grant conditions requiring the program to revise governance and monitoring systems within the sub -recipient relationship with AHS. This lengthy correct ive action process meant a delay in finalizing the sub -recipient agreement however services have not been impacted due to this delay. Approval of this contract would continue to allow AHS to provide Mobile Health portable clinical care services that incl ude face -to-face visits with a physician at least 24 hours per week; case management; and health and housing services to a population experiencing homelessness as defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HRSA/HHS). AHS is a sub -recipient to HCSA under the ACHCH grant and has partnered with AHS since the inception The Honorable Board of Supervisors June 21, 2019 3 of 3 of the ACHCH federal health center grant in 1988 to ensure that homeless individuals are able to obtain the care they need . ACHC H intends to continue the partnership with AHS so homeless individuals are able to live healthier lives. SELECTION CRITERIA On December 2013, HCSA released a formal Request for Proposal (RFP No. 900386) for Trust Clinic Integrated Primary Care and Behavioral Health Services. Only one response was received from LifeLong Medical Care. The County Selection Committee conducted an interview of this bidder and recommended LifeLong for the award according to the terms of the RFP. Since 2001, HCSA has appl ied for and been awarded the HRSA grant award every five years. The HRSA grant award is to provide comprehensive health care services to people experiencing homelessness . AHS was selected and approved by HRSA as the sub -recipient for this award and is cont inuously monitored through out the HRSA grant award period to ensure that HRSA -required services continue to be provided to homeless individuals. LifeLong Medical Care and Alameda Health System are community -based organizations that provide direct services to Alameda County residents and; therefore, are exempt from the Small, Local and Emerging Business (SLEB) program requirements. FINANCING Funding for the Second Amendment with LifeLong Medical Care, Inc. ($1,576,211) comes from the State Mental Health S ervices Act (MHSA ) revenue and is included in the Fiscal Year 2019 -20 Final Budget. This funding augments existing funding for medical services included in the 2018 -2021 Homeless ness Action Plan . Funding for the agreement with Alameda Health System ( $785 ,176 ) comes from Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA ) federal revenue and is included in the Fiscal Year 2019 -2020 Final Budget. This funding augments existing funding for primary care, behavioral health care, and recovery and preventative services included in the 2018 -2021 Homeless Action Plan.

ACHCH is housed within the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, governed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (\"Alameda County BOS\"). ACHCH health center operations are currently governed by co-applicant board Alameda County Health Care for the Homeless Commission (\"ACHCH Commission\"). The ACHCH Commission shares health center governing authority with the Alameda County BOS and Alameda Health System Board of Trustees. The Co-Applicant Agreement signed on 9/2016 between ACHCH Commission, Alameda Health System Board of Trustees (\"AHS BOT\") and the Alameda County BOS delineates health center governance authority between these parties. By July 31, 2019 AHS will implement a new subrecipient health center governance structure, with a new AHS Co-Applicant Board and a new Co-Applicant Agreement. The Co-Applicant agreement delegates the required authorities and functions to the AHS Co-Applicant Board and delineates the roles and responsibilities of AHS and the AHS Co\u00ad Applicant Board in carrying out the Health Center program. Awardee ACHCH provides a sub award of its federal grant funding to Alameda Health System to carry out a part of its Health Center program. AHS is a public hospital authority governed by the AHS BOT.

Page 3 of 3 Exhibit A, ATTACHMENT 1H ACHCH DATA AND PATIENT VISIT REPORTING REQUIRMENTS AND DEFINITIONS ACHCH Patient Visit Utilization Data Reporting Reportable Visits: Reportable visits are documented, individual, face-to-face contacts between a P,atient ;md a licensed or credentialed provider w.ho exercises independent, professional judgment in providing services. Health centers should count only visits that meet all these criteria. To count as reportable visits, the services must be documented in a chart that is kept by the contracted provider. Included in patient visit documentation maintained by contracted provider should be consent documentation and verification of release of information signed by patient. Submission of Reportable Visits ACHCH contractors are required to submit a monthly report of all reportable health center visits provided by contractor. This report should be submitted before the 15th of the following month. Submission must be made in excel format through a secure FTP system arranged by the ACHCH program. Required patient data for each reported visit Required patient data for each reported visit is sent to and stays in the possession of ACHCH. Date required for each reported visit includes the following: Visit Provider Type Visit Subsite Patient First Name Patient Last Name Patient Gender Identity Patient Ethnicity Patient Sex assigned at birth Patient Sexual Orientation Patient Diagnosis for clinical Visit Enabling Service Codes for encounters enabling service encounters Patient Monthly Income Patient Income Source Patient Homeless Status Patient Translation Needed This required patient data is detailed later in this document. Provider Types Patient Social Security Number Patient Birth Date Patient Race Visit CPT Codes for clinical encounters Patient Medical Payer Source Patient Veteran Status Health center staff must be a provider for purposes of providing countable visits. Please note: Not all health center staff who interact with patients qualify as providers. The 2018 UDS Manual provides a list of health center personnel and the usual status of each as a provider or non-provider for UDS reporting purposes. Independent Professional Judgment To meet the criterion for independent professional judgment, providers must be acting on their own, not assisting another provider, when serving the patient. Independent judgment implies the use of the professional skills gained through formal training and experience and unique to that provider or other similarly or more intensively trained providers. For example, a nurse assisting a physician during a physical examination by taking vital signs, recording a history, or drawing a blood sample does not receive credit as a separate visit. Counting Multiple Visits by Category of Service Multiple visits occur when a patient has more than one visit with the ACHCH health center in a day. Most commonly, a patient may receive both a medical visit and an enabling visit at the same time. These distinct services must be provided by two distinct providers working in the capacity of their credentialed position (for example an MD does not Page 1 of 4 report enabling services encounters). Multiple visits must be reported as distinct visits (i.e. separate rows when electronically reported). On any given day, a patient may have only one visit per service category, as described below.
