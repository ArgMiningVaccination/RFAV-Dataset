Avaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. [CDC] Avaccine is a substance that helps in protecting against certain diseases. Vaccines contain a dead or weakened version of a microbe. It helps your immune system recognize and destroy the living microbe during a future infection. [Web MD]Definitions https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus -vaccine -tracker.html5What is COVID -19? It is a coronavirus disease identified in 2019. Symptoms usually appear from 2 -14 days after exposure to the virus. People with the following symptoms may have COVID -19 Fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? It is a legal mechanism in the US that allows FDA during a public health emergency to facilitate the availability of medical products. Use of an unapproved medical product (e.g., drug, vaccine, or diagnostic device) or Unapproved use of an approved medical product during an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life -threatening disease or condition Emergency is caused by a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) agentsDefinitions Note: For current FDA information on Authorized for Testing 25 Personal Protective Equipment and Related Devices 27 Ventilators and Other Medical Devices Drugs/Biologics Moderna that (RCA) of the extracorporeal Propoven 2% Emulsion (Fresenius Kabi) to maintain sedation for patients who require mechanical ventilation. Fresenius Medical, multiFiltrate PRO System and multiBic /multiPlus SolutionsEmergency FDA's COVID guidance toxicity studies from previously approved platforms for delivery of the vaccines if scientifically justified can be used as a surrogate to start clinical trials. FDA is willing to use draft toxicology reports to start clinical trials provided the reports are available within 120 days of the start of trials Identify a safe dose and dosage regimen in humans No adverse effect level (NOAL) and safety factor Phase I -Healthy and diverse population considered to be low risk for severe COVID 19, people older than 55 are acceptable to be enrolled provided they do not have any other medical comorbidity Phase 2 or 3 trials -Placebo -controlled randomized trials in diverse population with one to two year follow -up. COVID -19 vaccine is effective, the primary efficacy endpoint for a placebo -controlled efficacy trial should be atleast 50%, and the statistical success criterion should be that the lower bound of the appropriately alpha -adjusted confidence interval around the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate is >30%. Data and Safety Monitoring Board is monitoring the data coming out of the 4110 clinical studies on COVID -19 Phase 1 -378 Phase 2 -911 Phase 3 -552 Phase 4 -112 World Health Organization Database 3,369 studies on COVID -19 Ref: WHO Trial Registry Network: COVID -19 studies Development the World https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus -vaccine -tracker.html 12Vaccines that deliver one or more of the coronavirus's own genes into cells to provoke an immune response. DNA Vaccines -mRNA -protein (antigen) -antibodies and cell -mediated immunity RNA Vaccines (antigen) and Pfizer/ BioNTech Vaccine are mRNA vaccines strands of mRNA for the spike protein that facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell. It is authorized for use for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older . The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection administered as a series of two doses (0.5 mL each) 1 month apart .

Fact Sheet: https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download19Vaccines that contain viruses engineered to carry coronavirus genes. Viral vectors will invade cells and cause the cells to make viral proteins The coronavirus proteins go the surface of the cells causing the immune response. COVID -19: Russian Vaccine (Sputnik) approved for early use and a Chinese vaccine for special use by military; Astrazeneca /Oxford vaccine is approved for emergency use in UK and India. Johnson & Johnson vaccine is still in developmentViral proteins but no genetic material. Some vaccines contain whole proteins and some contain fragments of them. COVID -19: One approved for early use in Russia; Novavax vaccine that have been killed with chemicals.
