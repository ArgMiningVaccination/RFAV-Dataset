Scheme at a glance - Where the administering organisation of the lead applicant is based: - UK, Republic of Ireland, [Low- or middle-income countries (apart from India and mainland China)](/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries) - Level of funding: You should ask for the resources you need for your research programme - see the 'What we offer' section on this page. You will need to justify this in your application. - Duration of funding: Usually 8 years, but may be less for some disciplines, and may only be longer if held on a part-time basis. Eligibility and suitability You can apply for a Wellcome Discovery Award if you are a researcher who wants to pursue bold and creative research ideas. You must aim to make a major contribution to your research field by: - generating significant shifts in understanding and/or - developing methodologies, conceptual frameworks, tools or techniques that could benefit health-related research. You will be expected to actively promote a diverse, inclusive and supportive research environment within your team and across your organisation. Your research can be in any discipline - including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), experimental medicine, humanities and social science, clinical/allied health sciences, and public health - as long as it has the potential to improve human life, health and wellbeing, and aligns with our [funding remit](/grant-funding/guidance/discovery-research-schemes-remit). The research can be in a single discipline or multidisciplinary. An award can be held by an established researcher or a team of researchers led by an established researcher. Lead applicant Whether you are applying as the sole applicant or the lead applicant for a team, you must have: - international standing as a research leader in your field - experience of leading innovative and creative research - a track record of managing and training others. If you are the lead applicant for a team, you must also be able to demonstrate you can drive and lead a substantial collaborative research programme. You must be able to contribute at least 20% of your research time to the programme. You must be based at an eligible host organisation that can sign up to our [grant conditions](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/grant-conditions). It must be in one of the following: - UK - Republic of Ireland - a [low- or middle-income country](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries)(apart from India and mainland China). It must be a not-for-profit organisation. It can be a: - higher education institution - research institute - non-academic healthcare organisation - charity or social enterprise. At the point of application, you should have a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract, or the guarantee of one. The contract should not be conditional on receiving this award. Your salary must be paid by your host organisation for the duration of the award. If you are based in a low- or middle-income country, you can ask for a contribution to your salary if you hold a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that you have to get your salary from external grant funding. If you have less than three years remaining on your contract at the point of application, you must have secured your next position at an eligible organisation and provide a letter of support from them. Coapplicants Coapplicants can be at any career stage and based anywhere in the world apart from mainland China. Each coapplicant must make a significant and essential contribution to the research proposal, for example designing the research, writing the application and/or managing the programme. They must be able to contribute at least 20% of their research time to the programme. Coapplicants must be based at an eligible organisation that can sign up to our [grant conditions](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/grant-conditions). The organisation can be a not-for-profit: - higher education institution - research institute - non-academic healthcare organisation - charity or social enterprise. It can also be a commercial organisation. Coapplicants can request their salary if they have a permanent, open ended or long-term rolling contract that states they have to get salary recovery from external grant funding, or they are employed by a charity, social enterprise or commercial organisation. The amount they request must be proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. Coapplicants without a permanent, open ended or long-term rolling contract can only request salary if they: - Will spend at least 80% of their time on this grant. They can request their full salary. Their post does not need to be underwritten and can be contingent on the application being successful. - Will spend less than 80% of their time on the grant. They can request salary proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. The host organisation must guarantee space and salary support if they cannot get it from other sources for the period of time they are working on the grant. Their post cannot be contingent on the application being successful. - Are employed on the award as postgraduate research assistants. If they are to spend 100% of their time on the award their post does not need to be underwritten by the host organisation and can be contingent on the application being successful. Alternatively, coapplicants may get their salary through employment on another grant or from their employer. Coapplicants can be based in the same or in different organisations, and come from any discipline, but the added value of the team approach must be clear. Team size will depend on the proposed research. It will usually range from two to eight applicants, including the lead applicant. We encourage lead applicants to put together [diverse teams](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/diversity-and-inclusion). Time spent away from research You can apply if you've been away from research (for example a career break, maternity leave, or long-term sick leave). We'll allow for this when we consider your application. If you have retired, please contact us before applying. Resubmissions If you are unsuccessful with an application to this scheme, you can submit one more full application for the same project. Significant changes are needed for the second application. You do not need to contact us first. Other Wellcome awards - An early-career researcher can hold one [Early-Career Award](/grant-funding/schemes/early-career-awards)and be a coapplicant on one other Wellcome award. - A mid-career researcher can hold one [Career Development Award](/grant-funding/schemes/career-development-awards)and be a coapplicant on up to two other Wellcome awards. In their application for the second award the co-applicant must explain: - why no other applicant or co-applicant can provide the expertise that they bring to the project - how they will manage their research commitments across the three awards. - An established researcher can be a lead applicant on two Discovery Awards, one as sole applicant and one as lead applicant for a team, or both as a lead applicant for a team. They can also be a coapplicant on up two other Wellcome awards. Current holders of Investigator Awards and Senior Research Fellowships cannot be a sole applicant for a Discovery Award. They may be the lead applicant for a team on a Discovery Award and a coapplicant on up to two other Discovery Awards or Collaborative Awards. Researchers cannot be a coapplicant on more than two Discovery Awards. Assessment criteria We will review your research proposal, skills and experience, and research environment.

Who can't apply You are not eligible to apply as a lead applicant on a Discovery Award if you are the lead applicant on two other Discovery Award applications and you are waiting for a decision. You cannot apply if you intend to carry out activities that involve the transfer of grant funds into mainland China. What's expected of your host organisation You must be based at an [eligible organisation](/grant-funding/guidance/eligibility-information-grant-applicants) that can sign up to our [grant conditions](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/grant-conditions). We expect organisations based in the UK to meet the responsibilities required by the [Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/supporting-career-development-researchers) for institutions, managers and researchers. Any organisation with Wellcome funding that is based outside the UK is expected, at a minimum, to follow the principles of the Concordat. We also expect your host organisation to: - Guarantee that the space and resources you need have been agreed and will be made available to you from the start date through to the end date of your award. - Explain how your research fits with the strategic aims of the organisation. - Give you, and any staff employed on the grant, 10 days a year (pro rata if part-time) to undertake training and continuing professional development (CPD) in line with the Concordat. This should include the responsible conduct of research, research leadership, people management, diversity and inclusion, and the promotion of a healthy research culture. - Provide a system of onboarding, embedding and planning for you when you join the organisation and/or start the award. If your host organisation is a core-funded research organisation, a Discovery Award should not replace or lead to a reduction in existing or planned core support. What we offer A Wellcome Discovery Award provides funding for research expenses. The award usually lasts for 8 years, but may be less for some disciplines, such as humanities and social science. The award may be held on a part-time basis. We will extend the duration of the award to reflect this. You should ask for a level and duration of funding that's appropriate for your proposed research. You will need to justify these costs in your grant application. The award includes: Lead applicant You must contribute at least 20% of your research time to this award. If you are based in the UK or Republic of Ireland, you cannot ask for your salary. If you are based in a low- or middle-income country, you can ask for a contribution to your salary if you hold a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that you have to get your salary from external grant funding. The amount we pay will be proportionate to the time you contribute to the award, for example if you contribute 30% of your time to the award we will fund 30% of your salary. You will have to contribute at least 20% of your research time to this award. Your host organisation must confirm: - that your employment contract states you must get salary recovery from external grant funding - that they will underwrite the post, including any salary costs not covered by Wellcome, for the period of time that you will be working on the grant. Coapplicants Coapplicants must contribute at least 20% of their research time to this programme. If any coapplicant employed on your grant holds a permanent, open-ended or long-term rolling contract that states that they have to get their salary from external grant funding, you can ask us for a contribution to their salary in your application. The amount we pay will be proportionate to the time they contribute to the award, for example if they contribute 30% of their time to the award we will fund 30% of their salary. Your host organisation must confirm: - that the coapplicant's employment contract states they must get salary recovery from external grant funding - that they will underwrite the post, including any salary costs not covered by Wellcome, for the period of time that the person will be working on the grant. Coapplicants can also ask for salary where they: - Are employed by a charity, social enterprise or commercial organisation. The amount they request must be proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. - Don't have a permanent, open ended or long-term rolling contract and they: - Will spend 80% of their time on this grant. They can ask for their full salary. Their post does not need to be underwritten and can be contingent on the application being successful. - Will spend less than 80% of their time on the grant. They can request salary proportionate to the time they will spend on the grant. The host organisation must guarantee space and salary support if they cannot get it from other sources for the period of time they are working on the grant. Their post cannot be contingent on the application being successful. - Are employed on the award as post graduate research assistants. If they are to spend 100% of their time on the award their post does not need to be underwritten by the host organisation and can be contingent on the application being successful. Alternatively, coapplicants may get their salary through employment on another grant. Staff working on your programme We will cover the salary costs of all staff, full or part-time, who will work on your grant. Staff members may include: - research assistants or technicians employed on your grant - specialist service staff, for example data analysis, fieldwork and clinical studies - project manager, if you have multiple applicants on your programme - support if you or a member of staff employed on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition - see 'Disability-related adjustment support'. Teaching buyout If you're a humanities and social sciences researcher, you can ask for funds for teaching replacement to cover the cost of a temporary replacement lecturer. You must retain at least a 10% commitment to teaching. Costs: - can cover up to 33% FTE of your contracted time - are usually for a person at a more junior level than the postholder - can be spread across the full period of the grant. If you already get buyout costs from another grant (funded by Wellcome or elsewhere), you can ask us for this cost, but only for the period of time on your Discovery Award when you won't receive buyout costs from another grant. You must provide a letter from your employing organisation, confirming that your contract includes a teaching commitment. You should include this in your grant application. PhD/Research Masters fees We do not provide studentships on this award. But if applicants employ a research assistant or a technician on the grant, they can ask for the costs to cover their PhD/Research Masters fees. Each applicant can ask for fees for one research assistant or technician at a time on the grant. We will only pay the international student fee rate for low- and middle-income nationals who are registered to study for a PhD/Research Masters in a high-income country. In all other situations, we will pay home student fees. Staff salaries should be appropriate to skills, responsibilities and expertise. You should ask your host organisation to use their salary scales to calculate these costs, which should include: - basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (for example, National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - Apprentice Levy charges for UK-based salaries - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. If the pay award is not yet known, applicants should use the International Monetary Fund inflation rate, selecting the 'inflation, average consumer price' option as indicator. From Year 2 onwards, you should use your organisation's current pay rates. We'll provide a separate inflation allowance for salary inflation costs. Read about the [responsibilities of grantholders and host organisations for people working on a Wellcome grant](/grant-funding/guidance/people-working-wellcome-grant). If you have named people on your grant whose salaries will be funded by Wellcome, you can ask for visa or work permit costs to help them take up their posts at the host organisation. You can also ask for: - visa costs for the person's partner and dependent children - essential associated costs, such as travel to attend appointments at a visa application centre or embassy, and essential English language tests - Immigration Health Surcharge costs for the person, their partner and dependent children if they will be in the UK for six months or more. If you or a member of staff working on your grant is disabled or has a long-term health condition, you can ask for adjustment support to help you carry out your project. Costs can include, but are not limited to: - additional costs for staff to help with day-to-day activities related to your project - assistive technology to help use computers, research equipment or materials - for example, text to audio software - care costs for assistance animals if you need to travel. We will not pay for capital or building costs, such as access ramps. You can ask for these costs if your government and/or employer: - does not cover any of the costs - only covers some of the costs (if they do, we will only meet the shortfall). The costs we provide must not replace the support you may get from the government or your organisation, who are responsible for providing these costs. If you don't know what these costs are now, you can [ask for them after we've awarded your grant](/grant-funding/guidance/disability-related-support-for-grantholders). You can ask for costs to cover the following types of training. Continuing professional development and professional skills training You can ask for a contribution towards these costs. Types of training can include: - research leadership, professional and people management skills - career development support - responsible conduct of research - diversity and inclusion - promotion of a healthy research culture. We expect your host organisation to provide and fund this training. However, if these types of training are not available, or the quality is inadequate, you can ask for up to \u00a3500 a year for you and each member of staff employed on your grant who will be: - in a post of 12 months duration or more only and - working on Wellcome funded awards for at least 50% full time equivalent. You will need to justify these costs in your application. Research skills training You can ask for costs to cover training for the technical and research skills you need to deliver your proposed research. You can ask for whatever research skills training you need for you, and each member of staff employed on your grant, who will be: - in a post of 12 months duration or more only and - working on Wellcome funded awards for at least 50% full time equivalent. You will need to justify these costs in your application. We will pay for the materials and consumables you need to carry out your project, including: - laboratory chemicals and materials (for example reagents, isotopes, peptides, enzymes, antibodies, gases, proteins, cell/tissue/bacterial culture, plasticware and glassware) - project-specific personal protective equipment (PPE) that is above the standard expected for the setting - printing associated with fieldwork and empirical research - associated charges for shipping, delivery and freight. You can ask for funds to buy animals if they are essential to your project. We will also fund the charge-out rates for animal house facilities if your organisation uses full economic costing methodology. These costs include: - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - appropriate estates costs - cage and equipment depreciation costs, but not building depreciation costs. We may not pay the full charge-out rate for an animal house facility if we've provided significant funding towards the infrastructure and/or core support of the facility. If your organisation does not use full economic costing methodology to establish charge-out rates for animal house facilities, you can ask for funds to cover: - the cost of buying animals - running costs (including animal maintenance, any experimental procedures, licences and relevant staff training) - staff costs, for example, contributions towards the salaries of animal house technicians. We will not provide estates or depreciation costs. Equipment purchase You can ask for basic items of equipment that are essential to your research project. Costs may include purchase, delivery, installation, maintenance and training, where necessary. We will cover VAT and import duties if: - the usual UK exemptions on equipment used for medical research don't apply - you're applying from a non-UK organisation, and you can show these costs can't be recovered. You can also ask for specialised equipment if: - it is essential to the success of the proposed research project - it is not available at your host organisation or through collaboration, and - you'll be the main user and have priority access to the equipment. If a complete piece of specialised equipment costs \u00a3100,000 or more, we expect a contribution of at least 25% of the total costs, including maintenance, from the host organisation or another source. In some cases, we may expect a larger contribution. We'll discuss this with you after we've assessed your application. Contributions can include benefits in kind, such as refurbishment or the underwriting of a key support post. Multi-component items must not be broken down into component parts to avoid this contribution. Equipment maintenance We will cover maintenance costs for equipment if: - you are requesting it in your application - it is existing equipment that is: - funded by us or another source - essential to the proposed research project - more than five years old - cost effective to keep maintaining it. We won't cover maintenance costs for equipment if there is a mechanism in place to recoup these costs through access charges. Computer equipment We will cover the cost of one personal computer or laptop per person up to \u00a31,500. We won't pay for: - more expensive items, unless you can justify them - installation or training costs. You can ask for the cost of access to shared equipment, facilities or services if they're essential to your project. These may include materials and consumables, plus a proportion of: - maintenance and service contracts - staff time costs for dedicated technical staff employed to operate the equipment or facility. We don't cover the costs of: - estates and utilities - depreciation or insurance - other staff, for example, contributions towards departmental technical, administrative and management staff time. We do cover these costs if related to animal housing facilities. If the facilities or equipment were paid for by a Wellcome grant, you can only ask for access charges if: - the grant has ended - any support for running costs and maintenance contracts has ended. You can ask for overheads if your grant will be based at a: - university outside the UK or Republic of Ireland - research organisation that does not receive core funding for overheads - charitable or not-for-profit organisation - small or medium-sized commercial organisation. You can also ask for overheads on any part of your grant that is sub-contracted to any of the organisations listed above. If you're based at a UK university you can't ask for overheads for sub-contracted activity if your university will include the sub-contracted funding in its annual report to the UK Charity Research Support Fund. Overheads can include: - estates, for example building and premises - non-project dedicated administrative and support staff - administration, for example finance, library, and room hire. The total cost for overheads should not be more than: - 20% of the direct research costs if you're based in a low- or middle-income country - 15% of the direct research costs if you're based anywhere else. These costs must directly support the activity funded by the grant. How to apply for these costs In your grant application you must: - give a full breakdown of costs (you can't ask for a percentage of the research costs) - explain why these costs are necessary for your research - include a letter from the finance director of your host organisation, or the sub-contracted organisation, confirming that the breakdown is a true representation of the costs incurred. Travel costs Conference attendance You can ask for a contribution towards the costs of attending scientific and academic meetings and conferences, including registration fees. The limits are: - Lead applicant - \u00a32,000 a year - Coapplicants on your grant - \u00a32,000 each a year - Research and technical staff on your grant - \u00a31,000 each a year. We provide costs to cover caring responsibilities for any staff employed on your grant attend a conference. This includes childcare and any other caring responsibility they have. We will pay these if: - Wellcome is providing the salary - the conference is directly related to the research - the caring costs are over and above what they would normally pay for care - the conference organiser and their employing organisation are unable to cover the costs. You can ask for up to \u00a31,000 per person for each conference. Collaborative travel You can ask for travel and subsistence costs for collaborative visits for you and any staff employed on your grant. You'll need to justify each visit and its duration. Other travel We will pay for other essential visits, for example to facilities, libraries, archives, sample collection and for fieldwork. You can include subsistence costs. Carbon offset costs This applies to all types of travel costs Wellcome provides. You can ask for: - The cost of low carbon travel where practical, even if it's more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying). - Project-related resources or activities that provide an alternative to travel, such as video conferencing, communication and file-sharing software. - Costs to offset the carbon emissions of the journeys you make. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval before submitting an application. We won't pay for the core infrastructure that your host organisation should provide, unless you're eligible to ask for these costs under our [overheads policy](/grant-funding/guidance/overheads-policy). Examples of these costs include: - organisation-wide video conferencing packages - high-speed broadband - HD screens. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. Subsistence costs If you're away for up to one month you can ask for subsistence costs. These include accommodation, meals and incidentals (for example, refreshments or newspapers). If your administering organisation has a subsistence policy, use their rates. If your administering organisation doesn't have a subsistence policy, please use the [HMRC rates](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/expenses-rates-for-employees-travelling-outside-the-uk). If you're away for more than one month and up to 12 months, we will pay reasonable rental costs only, including aparthotels. You should discuss appropriate rates with your administering and host organisations, or Wellcome, as appropriate. We expect you to choose the most economical options, booked in advance where possible. If you're from a low- or middle- income country and will be working in a high-income country for more than one month and up to 12 months, you can also ask for up to \u00a310 a day to cover extra costs, such as transport and incidentals. If you're away for more than 12 months, we will pay the costs of your housing. You should discuss your needs with your administering and host organisations. The allowance we provide will be based on family and business need. We will set the maximum allowance we pay for each location. This will be based on current market data or, where data is unavailable, in consultation with your administering organisation, using equivalent market rates. Please [contact us](/who-we-are/contact-us/funding-enquiry) if you need help calculating the costs. We will cover the direct expenses you have to pay to find and rent a home. We will not cover the cost of utilities or any refurbishment. Overseas research If you or any research staff employed on your grant will be doing research away from your home laboratory, we'll help with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Please see the 'Overseas allowances' section for details. If you or any staff employed on your grant will be spending time in another country, we'll help you with the additional costs of working on the project overseas. Our overseas allowances are: - a contribution towards the personal cost of carrying out research overseas, to ensure that you are not disadvantaged - provided on the assumption that you'll be paying income tax, either in your home country, or the country you will be working in (your personal tax is your responsibility). - provided on the understanding that you or your partner will not receive equivalent allowances from elsewhere - determined by the amount of time you will spend away from your home country. Carbon offset costs We expect the people we fund to choose travel that has a lower carbon impact, where practical, even if it's more expensive (for example travelling by train instead of flying). You can ask for costs to offset the carbon generated by the travel, as part of your overseas allowances. If carbon offsetting for travel is not part of your organisational sustainability strategy, you can ask us for a similar level of support for other sustainability initiatives. Your organisation must get our approval for other sustainability initiatives to be included in applications. See our [carbon offset policy](/grant-funding/guidance/carbon-offset-policy-travel) for travel for information on what you and your organisation need to do. If you will be away more than 12 months, we will provide overseas allowances for your partner and any dependants if they are travelling with you. If you will be away for 12 months or less and can justify why your partner and dependants must travel with you, we may provide overseas allowances for them. We define your partner as the person: - you're married to - you're not married to but with whom you've been in a relationship for at least a year and - you live with at the same permanent address and share some form of joint financial commitment with, such as a mortgage. See a list of [low- and middle-income countries](/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries), as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

We will cover the cost of providing special needs education as far as possible. Please contact us to discuss your needs. We would not usually expect to provide an education allowance if you will be working in a high-income country.

This is in addition to your outward and return travel costs and depends on how long you will be away: - 12-24 months - 1 annual leave trip - 25-36 months - 2 annual leave trips - 37-48 months - 3 annual leave trips - 49-60 months - 4 annual leave trips - 61-72 months - 5 annual leave trips - 73-84 months - 6 annual leave trips - 85-96 months - 7 annual leave trips.

If you will be away for more than 12 months, you can ask for up to 100 hours of lessons in the local language for you and/or your partner during the first 12 months of your visit. We will cover 100% of the costs for local language school classes or up to 50% of the costs of individual tuition. We will not cover the cost of examinations or personal learning materials such as DVDs and books. We cover fieldwork costs if they're essential and you can justify them.

You can ask for other fieldwork costs that aren't listed here, but you'll need to justify them. How we calculate your inflation allowance We will add an inflation allowance to your award. Your inflation allowance is based on your total eligible costs and the duration of the award. We will use an inflation allowance that reflects the inflation rate of the country where the host organisation is based using data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). You'll receive the following allowance if the costs in your application are in pounds sterling. |Award in your application must be based on current known costs, excluding inflation. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. These should be based on pay awards already agreed; if you don't know what the pay award is yet then use the IMF rate for the currency your award will be made in. If your organisation receives [open access block grant funding](/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-funding), you can ask them to cover your open access article processing charges. If you're at an organisation that does not receive block grant funding, we'll [supplement your grant](/grant-funding/guidance/supplementary-grant-funding) when your paper has been accepted for publication. You cannot ask for these charges in your grant application. If you need to carry out clinical research using NHS patients or facilities, we will cover some of the research costs. Annex A of the [guidelines for attributing the costs of health and social care research and development (AcoRD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-attributing-the-costs-of-health-and-social-care-research) sets out the costs we cover, and which costs should be funded through the Department of Health and Social Care in England, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. If you're based in the Republic of Ireland, we would expect you to adhere to the spirit of these principles. Read [more information on our clinical trials policy](/grant-funding/guidance/clinical-trials-policy).
