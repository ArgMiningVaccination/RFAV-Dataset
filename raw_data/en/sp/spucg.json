Many patients tend to shy away from using natural or herbal supplements because they aren't as familiar with them as western medicine supplements, but there are ways to educate patients letting them know their benefits, proper dosage, and reassure them that they are safe to take. Herbal Supplement Basics Natural supplements are beneficial at ensuring that patients keep their bodies functioning at their best, and boost what may be lacking within the body. The main difference between natural supplements and other supplements is that natural supplements are derived from natural resources like plants and herbs, and other supplements tend to be made synthetically. When they are made synthetically, you are not getting the full benefit from the supplement you're taking. Reasons natural supplements should be considered by patients: - Natural and herbal supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) - while they do fall under the category of dietary supplements, but companies are required to include specific information on their natural and herbal products to assure that dangerous products are removed from the market. Supplements must be free of contaminants and be accurately labeled, have research to support claims of the product benefits, and avoid making specific medical claims. The FDA requires that the supplement labels include the name of the supplement, the name and address of the manufacturer, complete list of ingredients, and serving size. - Boost acupuncture treatment for specific healthcare needs - especially if a patient is trying to ween off of prescription medications so that they are on a lower dose or avoid starting them at all, taking a natural supplement can be an effective way to improve many conditions without the need for medications. They are helpful for such specific health needs as digestive function, improve skin, boost immunity, improve mood, and more. Above all, the most important thing to let the patient know is to follow your instructions and/or the package for dosage. It is also vital as an acupuncture provider to go over any and all over the counter or prescription medications that the patient is currently taking. Herbal and natural supplements can sometimes change the way prescription and over the counter medications work and process the medicines in the body. Conditions & Natural Supplements Natural and herbal supplements are beneficial because: - Lower risk of side effects - these supplements tend to be better tolerated by those who have aversions to components of prescription or over the counter medications. - Cost effective - it is well known that many prescription medications that are needed for various conditions, one of the most well-known being insulin for diabetes, are insanely expensive. Natural supplements as a whole are much more affordable and available without a prescription, although it is important to let patients know not to take any natural or herbal supplements without recommendation from their acupuncture provider.
