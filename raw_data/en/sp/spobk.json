His focus is on the major figures who have defended natural law theory, from Cicero and Aquinas to Grotius. He concludes with a few reflections on the importance of natural law theory to the development of law and especially on its role in American history. Brian Bix is professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. We take it for granted that the laws and legal system under which we live can be criticized on moral grounds: that there are standards against which legal norms can be compared and sometimes found want\u00ad ing. The standards against which law is judged have sometimes been described as \"a (the) higher law.\" For some, this is meant literally: that there are law\u00ad like standards that have been stated in or can be de\u00ad rived from divine revelation, religious texts, a careful study of human nature, or consideration of nature. For others, the reference to \"higher law\" is meant metaphorically, in which case it at least reflects our mixed intuitions about the moral status of law: on the one hand, that not everything properly enacted as law is binding morally; on the other hand, that the law, as law, does have moral weight. (If it did not, we would not need to point to a \"higher law\" as a justification for ignoring the requirements of our society's laws.) \"Traditional\" natural law theory offers arguments for the existence of a \"higher law,\" elaborations of its content, and analyses of what consequences fol\u00ad low from the existence of a \"higher law\" (in partic\u00ad ular, what response citizens should have to situations where the positive law-the law enacted within par\u00ad ticular societies-conflicts with the \"higher law\"). CICERO While one can locate a number of passages in ancient Greek writers that express what appear to be natu\u00ad rallaw positions, including passages in Plato (Laws, Statesman, Republic) and Aristotle (Politics, Nico\u00ad machean Ethics), as well as Sophocles' Antigone, the b.e~t known ancient formulation of a natural law po\u00ad sitIon was offered by the Roman orator Cicero. Cicero (Laws, Republic) wrote in the first cen\u00ad tury B.C., and was strongly influenced (as were many .Roman writers on law) by the works of the Greek Stoic philosophers (some would go so far as to say that Cicero merely offered an elegant restatement of already established Stoic views). Cicero offered the following characterization of \"natural law\": True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts from wrongdoing by its prohibitions. And it does not lay its ,commands or prohibitions upon good men in vain, though neither have any effect on the wicked. It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside our\u00ad selves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is dis\u00ad obedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is com\u00ad monly considered punishment. In Cicero's discussions of law, we come across most of the themes traditionally associated with tradi\u00ad tional natural law theory (though, as might be ex\u00ad pected in the first major treatment of a subject, some of the analysis is not always as systematic or as pre\u00ad cise as one might want): natural law is unchanging . over time and does not differ in different societies; every person has access to the standards of this higher law by use of reason; and only just laws \"re\u00ad ally deserve [the] name\" law, and \"in the very defi\u00ad nition of the term 'law' there inheres the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true.\" Within Cicero's work, and the related remarks of earlier Greek and Roman writers, there was often a cert ral\" the fror bee, ties cau: that bim rall iSSU exa higl hen writ h for: (reI ers exp the, higl nat1 the a (arr by] AQI Tht pro Aq . tee tal eet bel ree, I certain ambiguity regarding the reference of \"natu\u00ad ral\" in \"natural law\": it was not always clear whether the 'standards were \"natural\" because they derived from \"human nature\" (our \"essence\" or \"purpose\"); because they were accessible by our natural facul\u00ad ties (that is, by human reason or conscience); be\u00ad cause they derived from or were expressed in nature, . that is, in the physical world about us; or some com\u00ad , bination of all three. i As one moves from the classical writers on natu\u00ad ! ralla wto the early Church writers, aspects ofthe the\u00ad ory necessarily change and therefore raise different Y issues within this approach to morality and law. For .t example, with classical writers, the source of the d higher standards is said to be (or implied as being) in\u00ad herent in the nature of things. With the early Church lS writers, there is a divine being who actively intervenes 1\" in human affairs and lays down express commands \" n for all mankind-though this contrast overstates mat\u00ad :s ters somewhat, as the classical writers referred to a I, (relatively passive) God, and the early Church writ\u00ad a ers would sometimes refer to rules of nature which It express divine will. To the extent that the natural lawh theorists of the early Church continued to speak of Y :-higher standards inherent in human nature or in the nature of things, they also had to face the question of e lr the connection between these standards and divine ,11 commands: for example, whether God can change d natural law or order something which is contrary to it it, a question considered by Ambrose and Augustine ts (among others) in the time of the early Church and ,\u00adby Francisco Suarez more than a thousand years later. rn f ~r I I-f AQllINAS '! I ,t The most influential writer within the traditional ap\u00ad I- proach to natural law is undoubtedly Thomas e- Aquinas (Summa Theologiae), who wrote in the thir\u00ad e teenth century. The context of Aquinas's approach ~- to law, its occurrence within a larger theological proj\u00ad .g ect that offered a systematic moral system, should S', be kept in mind when comparing his work with more IS recent theorists. Aquinas identified four different kinds of law: i- the eternal law, the natural law, the divine law, and d human (positive) law. For present purposes, the im\u00ad portant categories are natural law and positive law. )f According to Aquinas, (genuine or just) positive a law is derived from natural law. This derivation has Traditional Natural Law Theory 113 different aspects. Sometimes natural law dictates what the positive law should be: for example, natu\u00ad rallaw both requires that there be a prohibition of murder and settles what its content will be. At other times, natural law leaves room for human choice (based on local customs or policy choices). Thus, while natural law would probably require regulation of automo,bile traffic for the safety of others, the choice of whether driving should be on the left or the right side of the road, and whether the speed limit should be set at 55 miles per hour or 65, are matters for which either choice would probably be compatible with the requirements of natural law. The first form of derivation is like logical deduction; the second Aquinas refers to as the \"determination\" of general principles (\"determination\" not in the sense of \"finding out,\" but rather in the sense of making specific or concrete). The theme of differ\u00ad ent ways in which human (positive) law derives from natural law is carried on by later writers, including Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries on the Laws of England, Vol. I [1765]), and, in modern times, John Finnis. As for citizens, the question is what their obliga\u00ad tions are regarding just and unjust laws. According to Aquinas, positive laws which are just \"have the power of binding in conscience.\" A just law is one which is consistent with the requirements of natu~al law-that is, it is \"ordered to the common good,\" the lawgiver has not exceeded its authority, and the law's burdens are imposed on citizens fairly. Failure with respect to any of those three criteria, Aquinas asserts, makes a law unjust; but what is the citizen's obligation in regard to an unjust law? The short an\u00ad swer is that there is no obligation to obey that law. However, a longer answer is warranted, given the amount of attention this question usually gets in dis\u00ad cussions of natural law theory in general and of Aquinas in particular. The phrase lex iniusta non est lex (\"an unjust law is not law\") is often ascribed to Aquinas, and is isometimes given as a summation of his position and the (traditional) natural law position in general. While Aquinas never used the exact phrase above, one can find similar expressions: \"every human law has just so much of the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature. But if in any point it deflects from the law of nature, it is no longer a law but a perversion of law\"; and \"[unjust laws] are acts of vi\u00ad olence rather than laws; because, as Augustine says, 114 Brian Bix a law that is not just, seems to be no law at all.\" (One also finds similar statements by Plato, Aristotle, Ci\u00ad cero, and Augustine-though, with the exception of Cicero's, these statements are not part of a system\u00ad atic discussion of the nature of law.) Questions have been raised regarding the signif\u00ad icance of the phrase. What does it mean to say that an apparently valid law is \"not law,\" \"a perversion of law,\" or \"an act of violence rather than a law\"? Statements of this form have been offered and in\u00ad terpreted in one of two ways. First, one can mean that an immoral law is not valid law at all. The nine\u00ad teenth-century English jurist John Austin (The Province ofJurisprudence Determined [1832]) in\u00ad terpreted statements by Sir William Blackstone (for example, \"no human laws are of any validity, if con\u00ad trary to [the law of nature]\") in this manner, and pointed out that such analyses of validity are of lit\u00ad tle value. Austin wrote, Suppose an act innocuous, or positively beneficial, be prohibited by the sovereign under the penalty of death; if I commit this act, I shall be tried and condemned, and if I object to the sentence, that it is contrary to the law of God ... the Court of Justice will demonstrate the inconclusiveness of my reasoning by hanging me up, in pursuance of the law of which I have impugned the validity. Though one must add that we should not conflate questions of power with questions of validity-for a corrupt legal system might punish someone even if shown that the putative law was invalid under the system's own procedural requirements-we under\u00ad stand the distinction between validity under the sys\u00ad tem's rules and the moral worth of the enactment in question. A more reasonable interpretation of statements like \"an unjust law is no law at all\" is that unjust laws are not laws \"in the fullest sense.\" As we might say of some professional, who had the necessary degrees and credentials, but seemed nonetheless to lack the necessary ability or judgment: \"she's no lawyer\" or \"he's no doctor.\" This only indicates that we do not think that the title in this case carries with it all the implications it usually does. Similarly, to say that an unjust law is \"not really law\" may only be to point out that it does not carry the same moral force or offer the same reasons for action as laws consistent with \"higher law.\" This is almost certainly the sense in which Aquinas made his remarks, and the prob\u00ad able interpretation for nearly all proponents of the position. However, this interpretation leaves the statement as clearly right as under the prior (Aus\u00ad tinian) interpretation it was clearly wrong. One won\u00ad ders why such declarations have, historically, been so controversial. To say that an unjust law is not law in the fullest sense is usually intended not as a simple declaration, but as the first step of a further argument. For ex\u00ad ample: \"this law is unjust; it is not law in the fullest sense, and therefore citizens can in good conscience act as if it was never enacted; that is, they should feel free to disobey it.\" This is a common understanding of the idea that an unjust law is no law at all, but it expresses a conclusion that is controversial. There are often moral reasons for obeying even an unjust law: for example, if the law is part of a gen\u00ad erally just legal system, and public disobedience of the law might undermine the system, there is a moral reason for at least minimal, public obedience to the unjust law. This is Aquinas's position (he stated that a citizen is not bound to obey \"a law which imposes an unjust burden on its subjects\" if the law \"can be resisted without scandal or greater harm\"), and it has been articulated at greater length by later natu\u00ad rallaw theorists (for example, by John Finnis). Finally, it should be noted that the proper inter\u00ad pretation of certain basic aspects of Aquinas's work remains in dispute. For example, there is debate within the modern literature regarding whether Aquinas believed moral norms could be derived di\u00ad rectly from knowledge of human nature or experi\u00ad ence of natural inclinations, or whether they are the product of practical understanding and reason\u00ad ing by way of reflection on one's experience and observations. NATURAL LAW IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE In the period of the Renaissance and beyond, dis\u00ad cussions about natural law were tied in with other issues: assertions about natural law were often the basis of or part of the argument for individual rights and limitations on government. Such discussions were also often the groundwork offered for princi\u00ad ples of international law. Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf (writing in the early and late seventeenth century, respectively) were prominent examples of theorists whose writings on natural law had signifi\u00ad cance in both debates. (Grotius and Pufendorf, along with other prominent seventeenth-century theorists, Francisco Suarez, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke, were also central in developing the concept of indi\u00ad vidual rights in the modern sense of that term.) A further significance of Grotius' work was its express assertion that natural law, the higher law against which the actions of nations, law-makers, and citizens could be judged, did not require the exis\u00ad tence of God for its validity. (However, one can find hints of such a separation of natural law from a di\u00ad vine being at least as far back as the fourteenth-cen\u00ad tury writings of Gregory of Rimini.) From that time to the present, an increasingly large portion of the writing on questions of natural law (and the related idea of \"natural rights\") was secular in tone and pur\u00ad pose, usually referring to \"the requirements of rea\u00ad son\" rather than divine command, purpose, will, or wisdom. PERSPEmVE It is normally a mistake to try to evaluate the dis\u00ad cussions of writers from distant times with the per\u00ad spective of modern analytical jurisprudence. Cicero, Aquinas, and Grotius were not concerned with a social-scientific-style analysis of law, as the REVIEW AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS Traditional Natural Law Theory 115 modern advocates of legal positivism could be said to be. The~e theorists were concerned with what leg\u00ad islators, citizens, and governments ought to do, or could do in good conscience. It is not that these writ\u00ad ers (and their followers) never asked questions like \"what is law?\" However, they were asking the ques\u00ad tions as a starting point for an ethical inquiry, and therefore one should not be too quick in comparing their answers with those in similar-sounding discus\u00ad sions by recent writers, who see themselves as par\u00ad ticipating in a conceptual or sociological task. Natural law has, from time to time and with vary\u00ad ing degrees of importance, escaped the confines of theory to influence directly the standards created and applied by officials. For example, natural law (or standards and reasoning that appear similar to natural law, but which are characterized as \"sub\u00ad stantive due process,\" \"natural justice,\" or simply \"reason\") has been offered as the source of legal standards for international law, centuries of devel\u00ad opment in the English common law, and certain as\u00ad pects of United States constitutional law. Natural law also appears to have played a significant role in American history, where its reasoning, or at least its rhetoric, has been prominent (among other places) in the Declaration of Independence, the Abolition (anti-slavery) movement, and parts of the modern Civil Rights movement. 1.
