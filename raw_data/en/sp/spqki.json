A vaccine against it has been found alright, but there is still growing fear of what the repercusions of getting the jab could be in, say, 10 or 20 years. We cannot dismiss this fear with a wave of the hand because some authorities are still linking the small pox vaccinations of the 1950s with today's high wave of cancer world wide. Already, there are fears that Coronavirus vaccines may cause blood clots in some people. This is frightening because blood clots are known to cause not only heart attacks, stroke and lung damage but, also, because the virus itself has been shown to kill its victims by inducing massive blood clots in them. I pity many Nigerians who, torn between the devil and the deep blue sea, as the virus is a reality, and the future of the jab is yet unknown, are compelled by their employers to be vaccinated in order to keep their jobs. A gentleman visited me last week after his jab to ask what he could do to avert blood clotting. His employers in the construction industry compelled all the staff to be vaccinated. This, no doubt, is better than asking them to work from home and not getting 100 per cent returns from the salary bill. So, we spoke for about one hour on dietary home remedies for averting and even dissolving blood clots, with emphasis against the tendency to overdo things, as this may cause the blood to be thinner than normal and cause other challenges. Our discussion covered the grounds below and more. Tumeric This herb is popular in Nigeria now as a digestive aid. I add the powder to my meals when I notice that I am not evacuating easily or well enough. It has two main components....tumeric, the \"big brother\", and curcumin, the yellow component which deals deadly blows at inflammation and blood clots. Some proprietary formulas separate them. Thus, I often mention, for example, Curcumin 2000x. This is a combination of Curcumin and Cayenne, another terrific blood thinner, which the producer claim makes the Curcumin 2,000 times more potent than its natural form alone or in Tumeric. When Tumeric, Curcumin or Cayenne or any other herbal blood thinner is used to confront blood clots, it should not be forgotten that blood clotting has its own good uses, one of which is to prevent needless blood loss internally or outwardly, and that an abuse may cause leakages through blood vessels if the blood is too thin and cause blood loss challenges. CBD oil The health tonics in Cannabis Sativa or Hemp, known in Nigeria as \"weed\", are finding their ways everyday into the prescription pads of many doctors. We now know that it is Tetra Hydro Cannabinol(THC) in Hemp is the psycho active stimulant which literally turns upside down the brains of some smokers of this week. But, as we say in Yoruba land, white meals do come out of black cooking pots. Thus, over about 30 years, medicine has discovered health benefitting oils in these plants which has led to the growth of a vibrant cannabidiol(CBD oil) industry. It took me some time to yield to these persuasive arguments, especially when the Food and Drugs Administration(FDA) in the United States approved it for seizures in children below five years and the equivalent authority in the United Kingdom did the same. Back home in Nigeria, I am witness to how this oil resolved the epilepsy of the nine year old grand daughter of an 84 year old man. She was a regular patient at Gbagada General Hospital in Lagos and always missed school until he gave CBD oil a try to the joy of many of us. CBD oil is now accorded herculian value in the upkeep of what has become known as the Master System of the body, or the Endocannabinoid System. It is now said that the body produces its own CBD oil for the maintenance of this system which, in turn, controls all other systems of the body. So enrapturing is the belief of some complementary and holistic medicine doctors in this new discovery of science and medicine that CBD oil is, for them, a front line prescription in all ailments. The idea seems to be.....straighten up the Endocannabinoid system, and all, including ailing systems, will fall in line. It is rare to find a health condition in which CBD oil is now not relevant. The only drawbacks may be if the doctor hasn't heard about it or if he doesn't believe in it or if the patient cannot stand the cost. In one of the many doctors' reports I have read about this oil, a dermatologist who had to remone a potentially cancerous mole from the skin of one of his patients was surprised that he bled beyond his expectations. The dermatologist had expected clots to form around the surgical wound and arrest the bleeding. The patient informed her he had taken a \"hefty dose\" of CBD oil just before the surgery to calm his nerves. Nevertheless, a study published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics said CBD oil did not cure Deep Vain Thrombosis(DVT), a clot in the deep vain which could cause, swelling and lung problems, but eased the inflammation and pain associated with it. But a 2010 literature review suggested that CBD oil prevent brain damage in stroke patients and support recovery by boosting brain function. In 2017, another review said CBD oil increased blood circulation in the brain during a stroke. According to Ferdinand H.Quinones, M.D.: \"A team of researchers at Fukuoka University in Japan recently made a breakthrough in stroke treatment. Their research investigated whether a Cannabinoid found within the cannabis plant called Cannabidiol(CBD) could be an effective treatment option during rehabilitation. This theory has been supported by other preliminary research studies, which all have found that CBD oil shows encouraging post stroke therapy for Ischemic stroke along(one or two types of stroke). The current body of research seems to show speedier and broader recovery in patients and incredible ever protection. Only two treatment options are available, so having another effective option for stroke recovery is compelling news for both stroke victims and their families. There is no hope that CBD therapy could allow more people to lead an independent life after suffering a stroke\". Ginger Like Tumeric, Ginger is now a regular feature in Nigerian kitchens and cuisines. The powder is added to fruit or vegetable juices, to peppers, corn pap, rice, beans, yam porridge, and what have you. It is anti-inflammatory. Its potent acid, acetylsalicylic, gave rise to Aspirin, the pharmaceutical drug for inflammation, pain and blood clots. For centuries in Indonesia and India, Ginger had been a major components of both folk medicine and cuisines. Modern research shows that those ancient people knew what they were doing. Now we know Ginger contains plant chemicals which world like the pharmaceutical Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs). It inhibits action of the genes which cause inflammation. When two researchers fed rats with different ratios of ginger extracts, the ones which received the high dosage \"exhibited a statistically significant reduction in blood clotting factors and cholesterol levels as compared with the placebo group\". The rats also had \"a reduction in inflammation markers\". So, the researchers concluded that Ginger was a useful agent and as a blood thinner. The University of Maryland Medical Centre lends its weight behind ginger as being anti-cholesterol and a blood thinner by citing studies which says so. it is noted that ginger is good for the heart because making the blood thinner reduces the risk of blood clot formation which may cause heart attack or travel to the brain to cause a stroke or a damage in the lungs. At the Cornell University, the gingeroles in ginger were found to help prevent abdominal blood coagulation. When it comes to blood Cholesterol levels, which is a pain in the neck for many people, ginger may lend a helping hand. Many people are too frightened by the mention of cholesterol. I hope the reader of this column in Benin I call \"Auntie\" is reading this. We all need cholesterol in our 100 trillion or so cells as adults. It is a part of the outer portion of the cell wall. It is in our brain, the heart, the genita organs etc. We hear of two major types always, although there are other variants. The two are High Density Lipoprotein(HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein(LDL). Cholesterol is fat and protein. HDL, the good cholesterol, is little fat and more protein, whereas LDL is more fat and little protein. LDL takes fat round the body to feed the cells. HDL returns it from the arteries to the liver which transforms the excess fat into bile salts in the night circumstances which includes availability of minerals and buoyant liver function. Many studies show that ginger cut total blood cholesterol levels, balances HDL with LDL(reducing LDL and increasing HDL), improve liver function, reduce oxidative stress and damage, lower blood pressure, thereby reducing the risk of heart disease. Garlic The Bible reports that the first major rebellion of the children of Isreal against Moses in the wilderness was because they no longer had garlic to eat everyday as they did in Egypt. In Egypt, they were slaves and the Egyptians gave them generous amounts of garlic in the diet to keep them healthy and energetic for slave work. Unfortunately, today's Bible reader and Christian does not take a cue from this. The smell of Garlic irritates many people, none the least of them my father who died of congestive heart failure due to enlarged heart, a condition Rex Adams says in his Miracle Medicine Foods is curable with Thiamine(Vitamin B1) and Garlic. Garlic has a molecule called AjoeneJ, which stops blood platelets from clumping to form blood clots. Its role in the successful treatment of hypertension is interesting. Cholesterol plaque blocks the arteries, narrowing them and reducing blood flow, thereby increasing tension in the pumping of the heart. The arteries can be damaged, and diminished supply of blood to the heart may gradually, if not eventually, cripple its muscles. Some scientists say diminished blood supply to the brain causes shortage of oxygen deliveries and that as many as 1.9 million brain cells may die every minute there is insufficient oxygen supply to the brain. Garlic not only consumes plaque in the arteries but also supports the regulation of Nutric Oxide. This helps the dialation of blood vessels, allows more blood flow, reduces hypertension and saves the heart from overwork and trouble. Stanford University Medical schools tells us of how useful Garlic is as a cholesterol manager and as an anti coagulant. I have a friend who grinds Garlic to paste and dissolves the paste in wine or spirit. He takes one teaspoonful in the morning and another at bedtime for \"police work\" in the night hours when most strokes are said to happen. Many women hate Garlic because of the odour and prefer odourless Garlic soft gels. But the healing effects comes from Allicin, the active ingredient which produces the odour when it reacts with atmospheric oxygen. Yet some of them who present dark menstrual blood clots, evidence of deoxygenation in the uterus, or a prospective health challenge such as fibroids in there, can be helped by Garlic. If Garlic is still a taboo to such women, after all said and done, shall we propose that they try the Paul Bragg(With Mother) brand of Apple Cider Vinegar. This Vinegar has two faces. It stops excessive bleeding, even during episiotomies in the birthing process, if it was taken six weeks from D-Day. Conversely, it dissolves all those menstrual dark clots, evidence that all is not well in, and with the uterus. Cayenne Reputed to be the King of Herbs, Cayenne relates with the heart and with the blood circulation. The blood is the River of Life which must flow unimpeded. But sometimes, it flows against blood clot impediments formed in blood vessels to prevent blood leakages when these vessels are broken. Trouble may arise in the heart, lungs and brain if these clots break and lodge in them. Cayenne pepper thins out the clots. Its power chiefly comes from Salicylates which it packs. Thus, eating Cayenne pepper in foods or taking it in food supplements offers good prospects for blood arculation challenges. Grape Seed Extract Thanks to Dr Raymond Strand, author of What Your Doctor Does Not knowAbout Nutrition May be Killing You. His wife was dying of Fibromyalgia and all his prescriptions could not help her. After she got well on herbs from a supposed lay person in medicine, he added natural medicine to his calling and began to eulogise in particular Grape Seed Extract, which is one of the substances which easily crosses the Blood-Brain barrier. It is such a powerful anti-coagulant in large doses that, it is not advisable to take it with pharmaceutical blood thinners. In fact, it is better to not take any natural blood thinner with a drug blood thinner such as Aspirin or Waffarin as they may potentiate effects of the drugs. Vitamin E Thanks to the Shute brothers, both doctors at Mayo Clinic who used it to treat difficult heart ailments. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and an anti-coargulant. In choosing Vitamin E, the d-alpha variant, the natural one, is preferred to the dl-alpha form derived from petroleum residues. Palm fruit contains not only all the six fractions of d-alpha tocopherols, but also the six variants of the more powerful tocotrienols. Vitamin E is helpful in the management of sickle cell anemia. It maximizes the use of oxygen, provides antioxidant protection for the sickle cell, thereby prolonging its life, and, also, preventing clumping of the cells which may obstruct blood flow. Ginkgo Biloba Traditionally known as Maiden Hair because it made the hairs grow long, strong and shiny on women's scalp, it is now recognised as a brain herb because it promotes unhindered blood arculation to the brain and eyes(the upper extremities) and enhances micro arculation as well in both regions. It is not advisable to take Ginkgo biloba before surgery. Lachesis This is the homeopathic dose of the poison Lachesis, the Bush Master, a snake which may grow up to 12 feet long and is second to the Cobra in size. It is useful for a wide range of complaints including fertility questions in women and Deep Vain Thrombis(DVT), among others. I wish Constantine Herring were alive. He probably would have found an homeopathic cure for Coronavirus by diluting its poison to such minutest levels that would effect a cure. Homeopathy is based on the principles that \"like cure like\" and that the more diluted a poison is the more curative it becomes for the problem it causes. Herring is widely believed to be the founder of homeopathy in America. In 1827, he was in Surinam, South America, to carry out some experiments on behalf of the government. He was working on the possibility of obtaining from the venom of Lachesis a vaccine that would cure small pox. Accidentally, he poisoned himself with a little dosage of the venom. This would enable him to prove that homeopathic medicine could come out of Lachesis. He became paralysed in his right side when he continued to try larger and larger doses of Lachesis on that side. This snake poison interferes with nerve impulses and destroys red bood cells. Today, Homeopathic Lachesis is used to treat four broad categories of problems, namely....\"menstrual and menopausal complaints, throat and mouth complaints, fear, paranoia, and associated mental complaints, nervous system complaints, circulatory complaints\". Gotu Kola, others We cannot forget Gotu kola, reputed for good blood circulation within the brain and in all organs. The Asians love it because of claims that it made some care givers of old who took it everyday live for about 200 years. We should remember, also, Ferrum Phos, the tissue salt which is reputable for clearing all circulatory blockages. We acknowledge also, Edta(Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid). A patient who used it for hypertension to clear blockages in the blood vessels suddenly experienced significant vision improvement. It turned out that vessels which brought blood to the eyes had significantly become blocked and the eyes were ailing from poor blood and oxygen delivery. Modern nature has in stock for us more help than can be mentioned here for the protection of blood circulation from clots which may cause heart attacks, strokes, and lung damage, all of which may lead to death. What we do not know as yet are those problems which COVID-19 vaccination may forment in the future.
