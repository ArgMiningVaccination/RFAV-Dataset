The vocation of being a Healer comes with a personal and universal responsibility to maintain the highest level of self-awareness and integrity in order to serve at your highest potential. Awakening Healing Axis has united an innovative approach and remarkable reverence for their mission to expand on concepts of energy healing.\" Barbara D. \"Thank you Jeannette, Franny, and Tim, for a wonderful week of amazing experiences and information. I again have elevated my consciousness and self-awareness to new heights. The frequencies that you bring forward to our collective is beyond description. My heart is open, my mind is clear, and I am ready to move forward with new-found excitement and joy. Thank you for what you do!\" Michele J. \"I love the AHA retreat and workshops. They bring such positivity and love into the world. They help us to expand the depths of our Souls. They teach advanced techniques that stretch our minds to all the possibilities of using the higher frequencies. The healing possibilities are endless for ourselves, others, the world, and the universe. It has created a desire in me to learn even more than the enormous amount that was covered, about the angelic realms, guides and Ascended Masters, crystals, neuroplasticity, our DNA, the physical body, and quantum physics.\" Penny M-H \"Thank you for being the hole in the flute that this consciousness shines through!\" Jon S.
