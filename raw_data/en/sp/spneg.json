Option to join the Kate's Magik tribe for the All Souls Procession** A life changing retreat dear to my heart! Our sisterhood retreat in Sedona was more than I could have ever imagined. So much healing, bonding, and rejuvenation of the heart took place. The Aroma Journeys quite literally took us to different worlds, as well as the singing and dancing in a safe space that we shared. I ate better than I have in my entire life. We honored our mind, body, spirits, and each other and formed real bonds. Coming back to the real world has proven a great task after leaving the magical world Kate and her amazing talented helpers created for us. I will always hold this life changing retreat dear to my heart and will continue to come to each one Kate's Magik hosts. Alisandi R. Exactly what my heart needed! To connect with the Divine Feminine in myself, my sister goddesses, and the world around me was a beautiful gift. In addition to learning about essential oils and the power of the voice, having the opportunity to dance and drum with Fountainetta allowed me to reconnect with a powerful and important part of my strength, sensuality, and grace. The laughter (even/especially the bawdy laughter!) healed a deep place within me like water in the desert. I came away feeling blessed by the power of women together and connected to my own Divine Core.I would recommend this retreat for anyone ready to move forward with their journey and awakening.

In the western world the fields have been turned and the harvest has been collected, and we go back into the seasons of darkness. The veils to the other realms are thin and it's an ideal time to shed, purify and let go of the old year. On this day we also give thanks for what has transpired over the past year and set intentions for the seasons ahead. **All Souls Procession is celebrated in many cultures during this time of year. With a close proximity to Mexico and large Mexican population, Tucsonans embrace, celebrate, and honor the traditional Mexican holiday \"Dia de los Muertos\" aka Day of the Dead - a time to express grief remember and mourn the lives of our loved ones and ancestors.
