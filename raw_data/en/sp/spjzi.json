Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports extramural research focused on understanding, controlling and preventing diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. In response to threats presented by emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has established research programs to facilitate development of countermeasures for certain pathogens. The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to solicit research applications for projects focused on preclinical development of lead candidate therapeutics, vaccines, or clinical diagnostics that address select NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens, as defined below. For the purpose of this FOA, \"lead candidate\" is defined as a candidate product, or a collection of optimized products (e.g. lead candidate series), for which proof-of-concept data have been obtained and \"preclinical development\" is defined as all activities beyond lead candidate identification (therapeutics or vaccines) or assay/platform/prototype development (diagnostics). Examples of supported research areas include: lead optimization; efficacy testing, safety evaluation; stability testing; manufacturing; development of broad spectrum platforms and/or production technologies; optimization of products or technologies; process development; scale-up; production of quantities sufficient for preclinical regulatory requirements; IND-enabling activities required for initiation of Phase I clinical trials; and diagnostic validation. Priority will be given to projects that address the greatest public health concerns. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support development of countermeasures to protect the public from infectious diseases. In 2002, the NIH initiated development of strategic plans to counter threats presented by emerging infectious diseases. As a component of these plans, NIAID was assigned responsibility for research leading to and development of candidate countermeasures (therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics and platform technologies) against a growing list of emerging pathogens. NIAID established the [Partnerships program](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/partnerships/Pages/default.aspx) to support discovery, preclinical research, product development and eventual commercialization of candidate products that address specific pathogens/agents. This FOA reflects current priorities outlined in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research, National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), National Action Plan for Combating Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis, HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Implementation Plan, the HHS 2010 Medical Countermeasure Review, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18: Medical Countermeasures against Weapons of Mass Destruction. The objective of this FOA is to support milestone-driven preclinical research that will advance the development and/or production of lead therapeutics, vaccines or medical diagnostics for select Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens described below. Each application must propose a research and development project whose goal is to advance an already identified lead candidate/platform. Proposed projects are not required to result in a \"final\" product, nor is it necessary to propose completion of the product development process up to the point of readiness for clinical trials or validation within the time frame of the project. Applications that would significantly advance a candidate product toward clinical or field usefulness are responsive and encouraged. Required industrial participation on applications from academic institutions (see below) will facilitate appropriate and validated product development activities. Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) are strongly encouraged to obtain expertise in the areas of product development planning and target product profile development in general, and regulatory matters in particular. Expertise needed to fulfill project objectives may be retained as defined effort or may be included as periodic consultation on specific issues. Descriptions of supported countermeasure development activities and targeted pathogen categories are presented below: Therapeutics This FOA will support preclinical development of therapeutics against select NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens (antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and emerging viral pathogens; see below), including immune-based and host-targeted forms, with emphasis on broad-spectrum therapeutics and those targeting pathogens for which no standard clinical treatment exists or for which drug resistance poses a significant public health concern. Therapeutics of interest include small molecules, biopharmaceuticals, nucleic acids, or peptides to be used as monotherapy or in combination, or as adjunctive therapy, with other drugs. Projects must initiate with a single candidate therapeutic or lead candidate series. For projects initiating with a lead series, down-selection to a single lead candidate must be accomplished within the first two years of the project period. Immune-based therapeutic projects may focus on broad-spectrum or pathogen-specific immunotherapeutics. Of particular interest are immunotherapeutics that would enable prevention of infection or intoxication in the face of an immediate threat, protection of immunocompromised individuals, or post-exposure treatment to suppress infection and disease. NIAID encourages development of immunotherapeutics that directly affect pathogens and/or therapeutic approaches to stimulate non-specific immunity. Passive treatments may be especially valuable during the acute emergence of infectious diseases and may complement the use of antimicrobial drugs or vaccination programs to optimize protection. Host-targeted therapeutic projects must focus on a host-encoded function required for infection, replication, spread and/or pathogenesis by one or more pathogens. Host-targeted therapeutic candidates that act primarily by stimulating the host immune response through direct regulation of interferon expression will be considered non-responsive. For host-targeted intervention projects, applicants must clearly define the specific required host-pathogen interaction(s) for development of the corresponding targeted therapeutic(s). NIAID encourages development of therapeutics that target specific host functions/pathways that are required for infection and pathogenesis by unrelated pathogens. Of particular importance for novel host-targeted therapeutics is consideration of proposed work that directly addresses the clinical and regulatory pathway to product registration and potential hurdles such as demonstration of pathogen susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy using non-standard in vitro assays and in vivo disease models, as well as potential toxicity issues. Applications for development of a broad spectrum anti-infective against multiple targeted Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens are encouraged. A broad-spectrum therapeutic is defined as a therapeutic agent that targets a common, invariable, or essential component of different strains or classes of microbes, or one that targets a host function required for infection and/or disease. Therapeutics projects supported by this FOA must focus on previously-identified, well-characterized, candidate leads or lead candidate series and/or targets for the following select pathogen categories: Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria This initiative will support development of new or improved therapeutics for select bacterial pathogens for which drug resistance poses a significant public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one bacterial pathogen listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 report](http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf)). Projects focused on drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis are limited to development and/or evaluation of therapeutic entities that are not currently licensed for another indication (repurposed drugs). Antibacterial categories supported by this FOA include, but are not limited to, narrow-spectrum drugs, broad-spectrum drugs, innovative therapeutic approaches/strategies, drugs targeting novel mechanisms, or adjunctive therapeutics. Emerging Viral Pathogens This initiative will support development of new or improved therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens of public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one viral pathogen on the [Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens list](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/Pages/CatA.aspx). Antiviral categories supported by this FOA include, but are not limited to, broad-spectrum antivirals, immunotherapeutics, or host-targeted therapeutics. Of particular interest are projects focused on development of a candidate antiviral effective against Zika virus (ZIKV). Therapeutics projects supported by this FOA may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following preclinical activities: Vaccines This FOA will support preclinical development of candidate vaccines against NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens, focusing on multivalent/universal forms, therapeutic forms, or vaccines targeting select pathogens (see below). Development of candidate vaccines should initiate with previously-identified, well-characterized immunogens. Projects are expected to include proof-of-concept in animal models, preclinical evaluation, and if warranted, scale-up production under GMP to provide sufficient quantities for pre-clinical FDA-required animal studies. Projects must focus on development of a candidate vaccine aligned with one of the following categories: Multivalent/Universal Vaccines Multivalent or universal vaccines are defined as broad-spectrum vaccines that provide protection against a group of taxonomically-related pathogens, or two or more unrelated pathogens. Vaccines characterized by broad-spectrum activity in this class include cross-protective forms, which induce an immune response against constant components of two or more microbes, and multiple component forms, which include elements that protect against microbes that are different, and may or may not be related. Examples of this vaccine category include, but are not limited to, a universal influenza vaccine or a multivalent vaccine that protects against multiple flaviviruses. Therapeutic Vaccines Therapeutic vaccines are defined as those vaccines that can be delivered post-diagnosis to simplify, reduce, and/or shorten, or eliminate complicated treatment regimens, or reduce development of antimicrobial resistance. Examples of therapeutic vaccines include, but are not limited to, forms used for combination treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Burkholderia pseudomallei. Vaccines with Small Market Potential NIAID encourages development of monovalent or multivalent prophylactic vaccines characterized by small market potential, particularly vaccines that target pathogens for which no licensed vaccine exits. Examples include, but are not limited to, vaccines against Coccidioides spp., Lyme borreliosis, and Zika virus (ZIKV). For all vaccine projects, approaches should consider the ultimate potential of a candidate vaccine to quickly induce safe and protective responses in a diverse civilian population. Vaccine projects may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following product development activities: Diagnostics This FOA will support development of rapid, sensitive, specific, simple, and cost-effective diagnostics for primary healthcare settings (hospitals and point-of-care). Of particular interest are technologies that analyze clinical samples more accurately than current platforms and ideally have a target diagnostic test time of 1 hour or less to final result, including time required for clinical sample processing. The following categories are supported: diagnostics that facilitate antibacterial stewardship and diagnostics for Zika virus (details below). Projects must focus on previously identified pathogen- or host-specific targets or technologies amenable to large-scale production and validation for clinical diagnosis and point-of-care use. It is anticipated that the medical diagnostics developed through this initiative will aid healthcare providers in diagnosing individuals exposed to and/or infected with targeted NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens and will be developed with the eventual and ultimate goal of obtaining FDA clearance. However, FDA clearance need not be the final result of the proposed research project period. Applications for projects that would significantly advance a candidate diagnostic product/platform toward clinical utility are responsive and encouraged. As detailed in the following sections, proposed diagnostics must be culture-independent and detect multiple targeted pathogens in human clinical samples. Culture-Independent Diagnostics The proposed diagnostic must directly detect targeted pathogens in a specified clinical sample type (swabs, sputum, blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, etc.) isolated from individuals at multiple stages of infection. Of particular interest are diagnostic technologies that detect the target pathogen(s) in at least one normally sterile specimen type (i.e. blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or pleural fluid), allowing for validation of the technology in a setting where colonizing organisms are not a complicating factor. For culture-independent diagnostics focused on sample types that may be affected by commensal/colonizing organisms, such as those analyzed for HAP/VAP, applicants must specify how contamination with colonizing organisms will be addressed. Note: A short incubation step which enables the platform to provide all relevant information < 3 hours is acceptable. Multiplex Platforms Proposed multiplexed diagnostic platforms should enable differential detection of multiple agents in clinical specimens and rapidly distinguish whether an individual is infected with a biological threat agent or a common infection with similar, generalized symptoms. Of particular interest are flexible platforms capable of integrating new tests for agents as required, including detection of modified or new targets, and innovative platforms that provide diagnostic information on potential early, non-specific symptoms. For this FOA, proposed diagnostics must also align to one of the following programmatic diagnostic priorities: Diagnostics that Facilitate Antibacterial Stewardship Proposed diagnostics must target at least three bacterial pathogens listed in the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 report](http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf). Priority will be given to diagnostic technologies that rapidly detect the targeted bacterial pathogens and simultaneously provide phenotypic information on corresponding drug-resistance and drug-susceptibility relevant to clinical decision making. Detection of host factors predictive of bacterial infection that may provide clinically actionable information may also be included. Diagnostics for Zika Virus (ZIKV) Projects may focus on development of improved, enhanced or novel diagnostic technologies and platforms for detection and identification of ZIKV and/or modification of a candidate diagnostic platform to target ZIKV. Of particular interest is the development of improved serologic assays that distinguish ZIKV from other flaviviruses (especially dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV)) in point-of-care diagnoses and/or clinical laboratory applications. For all diagnostics projects supported by this FOA, the following general diagnostic performance characteristics are of greatest importance: In addition, the following characteristics are desirable, but not essential to prototype diagnostics developed under this FOA: Examples of potential diagnostics development activities to be supported include, but are not limited to: Applications including the following will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed: All projects submitted to this FOA must demonstrate substantive investment by at least one industry participant. For the purpose of this FOA, \"industry\" is defined as a large or small, domestic or foreign, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, bioengineering, or chemical company, or a related non-profit entity with an established track record in product development. \"Substantive investment\" is defined as a significant commitment of one or more resources to the project including, but not limited to: product development support/guidance, personnel, in kind contributions of materials and/or reagents (i.e. chemical libraries, innovative biotechnology platforms, scale up of CGMP chemical synthesis or production, etc.), provision of animal or other laboratory models for evaluation, subcontracts, data management resources, regulatory support, or alterations/renovations of facilities or provision of equipment to address biohazard concerns. The PD(s)/PI(s) of the project may be affiliated with either industry or an academic organization; however, if the PD(s)/PI(s) is from academia, an industrial partner must be identified in the application. PD(s)/PI(s) are strongly encouraged to obtain expertise in the areas of product development planning and target product profile development in general, and regulatory matters in particular. There is no requirement for an academic participant on applications submitted by industrial organizations. NOTE: Refer to Section IV. Application and Submission Information for specific requirements for the PHS 398 Research Plan, and Other Project Information (for example, a Product Development Strategy Attachment). NOTE: PD(s)/PI(s) are strongly encouraged to obtain expertise in regulatory matters associated with product development. Expertise may be retained as defined effort or may be included as periodic consultation on specific issues. Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.

Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [NOT-OD-13-030](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-13-030.html). Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Is this project likely to significantly advance the development of a therapeutic, vaccine or diagnostic against one or more of the select pathogens identified in this initiative? If the aims of the application are achieved, are important biomedical countermeasures or products likely to result? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? For applications from academic institutions, does the research plan leverage appropriate industry involvement to accelerate therapeutic, vaccine or diagnostics product development, some aspects of which may not be inherently innovative? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Product Development Strategy Is the Product Development Strategy well-conceived and appropriate for the proposed countermeasure category? Are the Milestones and Timelines proposed to achieve the goals of the project appropriate and feasible? Is the proposed Product Development Plan feasible and appropriate for proposed and future product development? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Not Applicable Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria).

Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/laws/revisedlep.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.
