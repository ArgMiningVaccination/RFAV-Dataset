Participants will be screened and consented remotely. Both groups will receive blood draws at days 1 and 14, and will be sent study medication directly to their home from the investigational pharmacy. Baseline and end-of-study laboratory draws will be done at home via mobile phlebotomy. Adverse events and symptoms scores will be monitored by entry into a daily diary along with regular phone calls with the study coordinators. At the end of the study, safety will be assessed by laboratory measures and adverse event reporting. |Study Type Double Blind, Placebo Controlled RCT of Modified Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (mQFPD) for COVID-19| |Actual Study Start Date :||July Primary Date :||May Qing Fei Pei Du Tang | encapsulated modified Qing Fei Pai Du Tang | Drug: mQFPD | The dosage of mQFPD is 8 capsules three times a day for 14 consecutive days. It does not need to be consumed with food. It is best taken at least 30 minutes before OR at least 60 minutes after meals, in the morning, noon and evening. Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary. | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Organic brown rice | Drug: organic brown rice | The dosage of mQFPD is 8 capsules three times a day for 14 consecutive days. It does not need to be consumed with food. It is best taken at least 30 minutes before OR at least 60 minutes after meals, in the morning, noon and evening. Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary. - Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] [ Time Frame: 2 months ]Quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in order to detect early potential increases in SARS-CoV-2 viral load during treatment. The safety of the study medication will also be assessed through laboratory data collection at baseline, and at either the end of the treatments. - Feasibility of the intervention [ Time Frame: 2 months ]With the primary outcomes focusing on determination of the rates of recruitment and completion - Duration of viral illness [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by duration of COVID-19 acute viral illness (as measured by fever and self-reported symptom scores) - Hospitalization rate [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by hospitalization rate - ICU admission rate [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by ICU admission rate. - Ventilatory requirement [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by maximum ventilatory requirement during hospitalization, if applicable. - Lymphocyte count [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the lymphocyte count of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - Neutrophil count [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the neutrophil count of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - Ferritin [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the serum ferritin level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - D-dimer [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the serum d-dimer level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - Lactate dehydrogenase [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the serum Lactate Dehydrogenase level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - C-reactive protein [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the serum C-Reactive Protein level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - Troponin [ Time Frame: 6 months ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by comparing the serum troponin level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs or on hospital admission labs (for hospitalized patients). - Mid-turbinate SARS CoV-2 viral load [ Time Frame: 14 days ]A secondary exploratory objective will be to evaluate COVID-19 severity among subjects in each of the two medication arms, compared with placebo, as ascertained by changes in the SARS CoV-2 viral loads among mid-turbinate nasal swabs taken on days 0, 4, 7 and 14.
