Introduction 1.1. Importance of Research on Dietary Supplements [1](#B1-nutrients-10-00041)]. However, the prevalence of supplement use has increased dramatically over the past 20 years [ [2](#B2-nutrients-10-00041)], and they have become a matter of consumer interest [ [3](#B3-nutrients-10-00041), [4](#B4-nutrients-10-00041)]. At the same time, the application of state-of-the art scientific methods to explore issues involving dietary supplements has advanced rapidly. The other invited articles in this special issue illustrate progress in our understanding of supplement science as it applies to several nutrients, including vitamin D, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, and iodine. Progress on botanicals and other non-nutrient ingredients (e.g., glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), coenzyme Q10) has been more challenging [ [5](#B5-nutrients-10-00041)]. There is no global consensus in terminology for the category of products known variously as dietary supplements, NHPs, and food supplements in different countries and while we recognize this limitation, for the purpose of this article the term dietary supplement will be used to refer to such products as nutritional supplements, herbal medicines and traditional medicines. This article summarizes some of the scientific challenges in supplement research and some resources that may be useful in studying them. Most of the scientific challenges in supplement science are ubiquitous and global, so it is vital for scientists to collaborate across nations to help meet them without duplicating effort. A case study is provided by the work of the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) which has been pursuing this goal since 2000. Some freely available resources and tools that ODS has developed for advancing health-related scientific knowledge on supplements are presented. The supplement marketplace is increasingly international, making collaboration between regulators essential since national decisions have international implications. Since products are consumed world-wide, calls for global quality standards are emerging. The remainder of the article focuses on regulatory challenges involving dietary supplements, and perspectives on how the regulatory systems in a number of different countries deal with them. Key resources for learning more about these approaches are provided. 1.2. Areas of Scientific Consensus about Supplement Science 1.2.1. Quality [6](#B6-nutrients-10-00041)]. For example, in 1994, when the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) first became law in the USA, about 600 U.S. manufacturers of supplements were producing an estimated 4000 products. By 2000, more than 29,000 supplement products were on the US market but few documented analytical methods or reference materials (RM) were available for these products. This growth in the market has also been evident internationally. For example, there are anecdotal reports that over 100,000 product license applications have been approved in Canada since the Natural Health Products Regulations came into force in 2005. The need for improving quality continues today, since now there are estimated to be more than 85,000 supplement products in the US marketplace and concerns about ingredient misidentification, safety concerns, and quality assurance/control problems continue to be important for the industry and the public [ [7](#B7-nutrients-10-00041), [8](#B8-nutrients-10-00041)]. [9](#B9-nutrients-10-00041)]. Plant identification is a particular challenge. Even when easily identified whole plants or plant parts are used, unless the chain of custody is tight, and the exact manufacturing process is known and well characterized, the quality of extracts and blends such as those found in many botanical products is difficult to ascertain. Reliable analytical methods to characterize the bioactive components in supplements are helpful, but even for the nutrients in supplements, specific analytical chemistry methods must be often developed [ [10](#B10-nutrients-10-00041)]. The bioactives in supplements differ from those in foods in their matrices in that the forms, combinations, and doses in which they are consumed, and the circumstances under which they are used are likely to differ. Analytical techniques for other bioactives in supplements are further complicated because the active compound(s) are often unknown, and even when they are known, validated analytical methods may not exist for determining their content. Reference materials are often unavailable to compare results between different laboratories for research purposes and to monitor data and supplement quality. 1.2.2. Safety 1.2.3. Efficacy [11](#B11-nutrients-10-00041), [12](#B12-nutrients-10-00041), [13](#B13-nutrients-10-00041)]. These experiences led publishers and funders to demand better product characterization and funders to demand more mechanistic evidence of bioactivity. Once mechanistic plausibility is established, animal and small phase 1 and phase 2 trials should precede the launch of large phase 3 studies of efficacy. More and better clinical studies of the safety and efficacy of dietary supplements on \"hard\" health outcomes are also sorely needed. Health outcomes such as changes in validated surrogate markers for performance, functions, morbidity, and mortality from diseases or conditions are required rather than changes in biochemical measures in blood with unvalidated surrogate markers. The question of the use of evidence from traditional forms of health and healing such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) makes the question of efficacy often more complex. This is briefly explored in the regulatory section below. 1.2.4. Translation of the Science [14](#B14-nutrients-10-00041)]. Monitoring is especially important when supplementation is used as a public health strategy to fill nutrient gaps in deficient populations. It is also needed in other countries such as the USA where use of certain supplements is high, and where substantial proportions of total intakes of nutrients such as vitamin D and calcium come from supplements, especially among older adults [ [15](#B15-nutrients-10-00041)]. 2. Challenges and Resources: Regulatory Perspectives [16](#B16-nutrients-10-00041)]. This section provides a concise overview of how these regulations have been developed, and common themes as well as challenges faced in a global market. 2.1. Definition of \"Dietary Supplements\" [17](#B17-nutrients-10-00041), [18](#B18-nutrients-10-00041)], a fundamental challenge to any discussion on regulation is that there is no global consensus on either what falls within this category or even what the category is called. Intuitively many equate a dietary supplement in the USA with a NHP in Canada or a traditional herbal medicine in the European Union or a complementary medicine in Australia, but this is not the case. For example, while melatonin is regulated in the USA as a dietary supplement and in Canada as a NHP, in Australia it is considered as a prescription medicine [ [19](#B19-nutrients-10-00041), [20](#B20-nutrients-10-00041), [21](#B21-nutrients-10-00041)]. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is readily available as a dietary supplement in the US, while in many other jurisdictions it is regulated as a controlled substance and is subject to significant regulatory oversight [ [22](#B22-nutrients-10-00041)]. [23](#B23-nutrients-10-00041)]. [16](#B16-nutrients-10-00041)]. Although this classification does have significant limitations, it recognizes the fact that definitions for this category vary significantly globally. Descriptions of specific national/regional definitions and categories can be found through the list of resources in [Table 1](#nutrients-10-00041-t001). [24](#B24-nutrients-10-00041), [25](#B25-nutrients-10-00041)]. In other jurisdictions, notably those where a traditional form of health and healing is recognized, traditional and complementary medicine products are often prescribed, and in some cases supply is limited only to trained practitioners. 2.2. Regulatory Models 2.2.1. Where Does the Category Fall within Existing Legislation? [17](#B17-nutrients-10-00041), [18](#B18-nutrients-10-00041)]. That is, they \"hang from the hook\" that is set in existing legislation. In the past, this was largely a question of whether these products should be considered a subset of drugs or foods; increasingly though, a third option is to capture them under existing regulations for biologics. It is important to note that overarching legislation is often one of the most important factors impacting the type of claim that can be made and what level of scrutiny and oversight will exist. For example, countries that regulate these products as a subset of drugs or therapeutic goods such as Australia, Canada and the European Union (EU) for traditional herbal medicines allow far more specific clinical claims to be made than in a jurisdiction such as the USA, where dietary supplements are captured in regulations under the existing food legislation, with their advertising regulated by trade regulations [ [20](#B20-nutrients-10-00041), [25](#B25-nutrients-10-00041), [26](#B26-nutrients-10-00041)]. 2.2.2. Should They Be Regulated as a Group? [20](#B20-nutrients-10-00041), [24](#B24-nutrients-10-00041), [25](#B25-nutrients-10-00041)]. In the second model, specific regulations are developed to deal with these products. In this case, specific categories are developed with very structured regulatory frameworks for specific types of T&CMs. This is particularly the case in countries with a strong traditional form of health and healing such as Chinese proprietary medicines in China (TCM), Ayurvedic medicines in India and Kampo medicines in Japan [ [23](#B23-nutrients-10-00041)]. 2.2.3. Common Elements of Regulatory Frameworks 2.2.4. Risk-Based Approach [20](#B20-nutrients-10-00041)]. All products must carry a disclaimer on the label stating that claims have not been reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Provisions also include a post-market site audit process for manufacturing sites for Good Manufacturing Practice compliance and mandatory reporting of serious adverse effects by manufacturers. Companies must notify the Food and Drug Administration before marketing products with new dietary ingredients (NDI) [ [27](#B27-nutrients-10-00041)]. There is at present no indication that DSHEA will be substantially changed or modified by Congress, in recent years the regulatory authority has given more attention to the notification and classification of NDIs as well as the importance of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [ [20](#B20-nutrients-10-00041)]. [28](#B28-nutrients-10-00041)]. [29](#B29-nutrients-10-00041)]. The Commonwealth government accepted the majority of the recommendations from the panel and preliminary draft legislation was made public in September 2017. Although one of the recommendations was to keep complementary medicines as a distinct category, some significant changes are proposed, allowing mid-level claims through a new third regulatory route between the listed and registered therapeutic goods process as well as changes to how advertising is approved and compliance management [ [25](#B25-nutrients-10-00041), [30](#B30-nutrients-10-00041)]. [24](#B24-nutrients-10-00041)]. To address the growing number of NHPs sold in a food-like format, Health Canada has created a new category of food currently defined through regulatory policy called \"supplemented foods\". The category does allow for some health claims, but they are limited reflecting the nature of the products [ [31](#B31-nutrients-10-00041)]. [32](#B32-nutrients-10-00041)]. [Table 1](#nutrients-10-00041-t001). 2.2.5. Competing Types of Evidence [24](#B24-nutrients-10-00041), [28](#B28-nutrients-10-00041)]. In many countries such as the United States with no pre-market approval framework system, claims that can be made are more limited [ [17](#B17-nutrients-10-00041), [18](#B18-nutrients-10-00041)]. In countries with long-established traditional forms of medicines such as in China, India, and Japan, specific regulatory frameworks have been developed for these types of products with the type of claim that can be made and the evidence required to reflect this approach [ [23](#B23-nutrients-10-00041)]. 2.3. Evolving Regulatory Landscape\u2014Challenging Issues [Table 1](#nutrients-10-00041-t001)provides links to some of the regulatory frameworks of different countries that provide insights into the ways issues are dealt with in them. 2.3.1. Evaluating Evidence for Product Claims [33](#B33-nutrients-10-00041)]. The challenge faced by the regulator is to ensure that these are in play and to support consumers in making informed choices that are often made in a self-care setting. 2.3.2. Questions at the Regulatory Interface [31](#B31-nutrients-10-00041)]. In other jurisdictions such as Australia, authority has been given to the respective regulators to deem something to be either a therapeutic good or a food based a specific set of criteria [ [34](#B34-nutrients-10-00041)]. [32](#B32-nutrients-10-00041)]. 2.3.3. Working on the Global Stage [35](#B35-nutrients-10-00041)]. Even if regulatory harmonization is not possible, regulatory cooperation is often a viable option, taking into account inputs from stakeholder groups such as industry and not just governments. For example, to support cooperation between regulators, in 2005 in Ottawa, the World Health Organization supported the creation of the International Cooperation on Herbal Medicine (IRCH). IRCH now has over twenty members and provides a forum and mechanism for regulators to share information on safety issues and common challenges they all face [ [36](#B36-nutrients-10-00041)]. Increasingly governments are working together as well as with other stakeholders such as industry and consumers to address common problems and in some cases to provide regulatory decisions in one jurisdiction that can be used as a basis for action in another. 2.3.4. Strengthening Product Quality 2.4. Need for Continued Science in Support of Regulation 3. Challenges: Scientific Perspectives 3.1. Issues Involving Human Requirements [37](#B37-nutrients-10-00041)]. [38](#B38-nutrients-10-00041)] and to the proliferation of boutique \"personalized\" eating plans and \"precision\" dietary supplements supposedly tailored to an individual's genetic profile. The extent to which such supplements are efficacious in reducing chronic degenerative disease remains to be determined. 3.2. Supplement Quality, Safety and Efficacy 3.2.1. Quality [39](#B39-nutrients-10-00041)] where quality is seen as a cornerstone of the sector. Botanical extracts and blends present particular challenges for detecting misidentification and contamination. The presence of adulterants and contaminants of both a biological and chemical nature in supplements is also challenging. Certain categories of supplements, such as athletic performance, sexual performance, and weight loss products, are particularly prone to the deliberate \"spiking\" with unlabeled extraneous or synthetic substances to confuse analytical techniques and even occasionally the addition of active synthetic drugs. Purity is a special problem for individuals with inborn errors of metabolism for specific nutrients such as vitamin B-6 or choline who require reliable, high quality sources of the nutrient. In countries that do not require that added nutrients be pharmaceutical grade or provide nutrients free to such patients, afflicted individuals must buy products that vary greatly in their quality on the open market. 3.2.2. Safety [40](#B40-nutrients-10-00041)]. Very high doses of vitamin D may also cause adverse effects in people with normal kidney function [ [41](#B41-nutrients-10-00041)]. There is little evidence that usual doses and forms of these nutrients give rise to health problems [ [42](#B42-nutrients-10-00041)]. The possibilities of excessive intakes of nutrients from dietary supplements are greater in countries with programs to fortify their food supplies than in others, and therefore they must also be evaluated [ [43](#B43-nutrients-10-00041), [44](#B44-nutrients-10-00041), [45](#B45-nutrients-10-00041), [46](#B46-nutrients-10-00041)]. [47](#B47-nutrients-10-00041), [48](#B48-nutrients-10-00041)]. Some dietary supplements added intentionally (like germander as an adulterant for skullcap), or others such as black cohosh, kava extract, green tea and others have been associated with liver injures of various types even after taking into account concomitant use with acetaminophen and alcohol and consumption while fasting [ [49](#B49-nutrients-10-00041)]. Extracts that are used in bodybuilding and weight loss have also been linked to liver injury. This has led to studies of the composition of different supplements [ [50](#B50-nutrients-10-00041), [51](#B51-nutrients-10-00041)]. Causes of liver toxicity from supplements appear to be due to insufficient regulatory authority, inaccurate product labeling, adulterants and inconsistent sourcing of ingredients [ [52](#B52-nutrients-10-00041)]. There is controversy about whether evidence of causality is sufficient for regulators to take action against supplements that seem to pose a hepatotoxic risk [ [53](#B53-nutrients-10-00041)]. Some possible actions include requirements for warning labels with usage instructions as is done for drugs, or/and removal of products from the market. Adulterated or fraudulent tainted products sold as dietary supplements are already illegal and subject to recall [ [54](#B54-nutrients-10-00041)]. [55](#B55-nutrients-10-00041)]. In addition, much interest focuses around concomitant use of herbal medicines such as St. John's Wort which has been shown to alter drug metabolism of a number of drugs notably those used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, warfarin, insulin, aspirin and digoxin [ [56](#B56-nutrients-10-00041)]. 3.2.3. Efficacy [3](#B3-nutrients-10-00041)]. This is an area of controversy that is highly polarized with questions being raised that depend on the type of dietary supplement being used, notably herbal medicines, the quality of the studies included in the review, and additional factors such as product quality of the supplement being evaluated that need to be taken into account [ [57](#B57-nutrients-10-00041)]. 3.2.4. Standards of Efficacy for Traditional Natural Products 3.3. Policy 3.3.1. Nutrient Supplements Are Only One of Many Strategies for Improving Nutrient Intakes 3.3.2. Supplementation as a Strategy to Achieve Nutritional Adequacy [58](#B58-nutrients-10-00041)]. However, for some of these nutrients, intakes are already adequate, so that the increased intakes may do little good, and in some cases supplements may increase the risk of exceeding the upper safe level (UL) of intakes. 3.3.3. Monitoring of Supplement Use [59](#B59-nutrients-10-00041)]. Biochemical indicators of deficiency are often not well linked with adverse health outcomes, underscoring the need for more attention to be paid to the development of agreed on measures of deficiency and excess [ [60](#B60-nutrients-10-00041)]. Recent work on key nutrient biomarkers is now available, facilitating the monitoring of high risk groups, such as pregnant women for folate status [ [61](#B61-nutrients-10-00041), [62](#B62-nutrients-10-00041)]. 3.3.4. Authoritative Recommendations for Dietary Supplements 3.3.5. Inclusion of Dietary Supplements in Food Programs to Reduce Malnutrition 3.3.6. Stimulating Innovation 4. Case Study: Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA 4.1. Background [17](#B17-nutrients-10-00041), [18](#B18-nutrients-10-00041)] of 1994, the ODS is the lead federal agency devoted to the scientific exploration of dietary supplements. Its mission is to support, conduct and coordinate scientific research and provide intellectual leadership to strengthen the knowledge and understanding of dietary supplements in order to enhance the US population's health and quality of life. ODS's four goals are to: expand the scientific knowledge base on dietary supplements by stimulating and supporting a full range of biomedical research and by developing and contributing to collaborative initiatives, workshops, meetings and conferences; enhance the dietary supplement research workforce through training and career development; foster development and dissemination of research resources and tools to enhance the quality of dietary supplement research; and translate dietary supplement research findings into useful information for consumers, health professionals, researchers, and policymakers. [63](#B63-nutrients-10-00041)], iodine [ [64](#B64-nutrients-10-00041)], vitamin D [ [65](#B65-nutrients-10-00041)], and iron [ [66](#B66-nutrients-10-00041)]. 4.2. Research Resources and Tools 4.3. Analytical Methods for Dietary Supplements [67](#B67-nutrients-10-00041)]. [68](#B68-nutrients-10-00041), [69](#B69-nutrients-10-00041)]. In 2000, the US dietary supplement community tended to use proprietary or compendial methods for quality control operations, and scientists and laboratories often kept their proprietary methods to themselves. Negative publicity about discrepancies between label claims and the results of product testing performed by third parties led to some unsuccessful efforts on the part of the industry to pay a laboratory to develop and validate methods through the Association of Official Analytical Chemists International (AOACI). The program was not successful for several reasons, including lack of expert technical guidance and conflicting sponsor priorities. However, this early effort led to a collaboration between trade associations, ODS, the AOACI, the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), NSF International, and others in an attempt to establish standard methods for dietary supplement analysis. The ODS became involved because explicit wording in DSHEA required the Government to use \"publicly available\" analytical methods for enforcement actions involving dietary supplements. In response to the need for such publicly available methods and to support efforts to validate methods used in biomedical research on dietary supplement ingredients, ODS established the Analytical Methods and Reference Materials (AMRM) program in 2002. [70](#B70-nutrients-10-00041)] and the conduct of single-laboratory validation studies for dietary supplements, Appendix K, AOAC Official Methods of Analysis, and provided guidance to evaluation of the literature on botanical supplements [ [71](#B71-nutrients-10-00041), [72](#B72-nutrients-10-00041)]. The portion of the ODS website includes a searchable database of analytical methods; these can be accessed at: [https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/AMRMProgramWebsite.aspx](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/AMRMProgramWebsite.aspx). 4.4. Reference Materials [73](#B73-nutrients-10-00041), [74](#B74-nutrients-10-00041), [75](#B75-nutrients-10-00041)]. ODS is now expanding efforts to develop biomarkers of nutrient exposure and status in blood and other biological specimens in relation to chronic disease risk in individuals and populations. ODS has worked with NIST to produce and make available reference materials for calibration of various laboratory methods. [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-nutrients-10-00041)shows NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRM\u00ae) now available. [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-nutrients-10-00041)shows dietary supplement and nutritional assessment SRMs that are currently in progress. 4.5. Dietary Supplement Databases [76](#B76-nutrients-10-00041), [77](#B77-nutrients-10-00041), [78](#B78-nutrients-10-00041), [79](#B79-nutrients-10-00041), [80](#B80-nutrients-10-00041)]. The goal of the Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) is to include labels for virtually all dietary supplements sold in the USA. This provides all the information on the product label including composition, claims, and manufacturer contact information. It now contains over 72,000 dietary supplement labels, with new labels added at the rate of 1000 per month. Used together with food composition databases it is possible to estimate total daily intakes of nutrients and other bioactive ingredients from both foods and dietary supplements. A mobile version of DSLD is now available for use on smartphones to enhance consumer access to it [ [78](#B78-nutrients-10-00041), [80](#B80-nutrients-10-00041)]. It is primarily aimed at researchers and so contains information about products that are currently on the market, as well as those that have been removed from the market. [79](#B79-nutrients-10-00041)]. 4.6. Nutrition Research Methods and Review Methodology [81](#B81-nutrients-10-00041), [82](#B82-nutrients-10-00041), [83](#B83-nutrients-10-00041), [84](#B84-nutrients-10-00041), [85](#B85-nutrients-10-00041), [86](#B86-nutrients-10-00041)]. Staff have also collaborated in performing systematic reviews with other groups [ [87](#B87-nutrients-10-00041), [88](#B88-nutrients-10-00041)]. 4.7. Population-Based Monitoring of Dietary Supplement Use [89](#B89-nutrients-10-00041)], children [ [90](#B90-nutrients-10-00041), [91](#B91-nutrients-10-00041)], and others in the population and their supplement use. Other studies have focused on the contributions to total intakes of nutrients made by dietary supplements. Investigators at ODS have been active in funding monitoring efforts on the links between intakes of folic acid and health [ [92](#B92-nutrients-10-00041)]. They have devoted particular attention to blood levels of folic acid and dietary intake patterns that are associated with very low and very high intakes of the nutrient [ [93](#B93-nutrients-10-00041), [94](#B94-nutrients-10-00041), [95](#B95-nutrients-10-00041)]. The survey methods used are well documented and they may be useful for those in other countries planning similar population-based surveys to consult [ [96](#B96-nutrients-10-00041)]. 4.8. Translation of Supplement Science for Health Professionals and the Public [https://www.nccih.nih.gov](https://www.nccih.nih.gov). ODS also hosts an intensive, free 3-day course on issues in dietary supplement research annually for researchers. Further information about these and other projects is accessible at: [https://www.ods.od.nih.gov](https://www.ods.od.nih.gov). 4.9. Other Resources 4.10. Fostering Use of Systematic Evidence Reviews in Policy Making and Clinical Practice [https://www.ahrq.gov](https://www.ahrq.gov)). 5. Future Needs [97](#B97-nutrients-10-00041), [98](#B98-nutrients-10-00041)]. Finally there are issues of personal choice and values, sometimes involving the efficacy of supplements as complementary and alternative therapies that are part of a larger philosophical or religious world views and systems. These must be accommodated without abandoning safety. [99](#B99-nutrients-10-00041), [100](#B100-nutrients-10-00041), [101](#B101-nutrients-10-00041)]. More and better biomarkers need to be developed and their associations with health outcomes clarified [ [102](#B102-nutrients-10-00041)]. Supplements intended to enhance sports performance [ [103](#B103-nutrients-10-00041)] botanicals used for disease treatment [ [104](#B104-nutrients-10-00041)] and those ingredients thought to slow aging [ [105](#B105-nutrients-10-00041)] all require identification of valid biomarkers of efficacy as well as of exposure. The role of supplements and the gut microbiome also must be explored for its associations with common diseases and conditions [ [106](#B106-nutrients-10-00041)]. The associations between supplement ingredients and health outcomes in chronic degenerative disease must be clarified [ [47](#B47-nutrients-10-00041), [105](#B105-nutrients-10-00041), [107](#B107-nutrients-10-00041), [108](#B108-nutrients-10-00041), [109](#B109-nutrients-10-00041)]. High risk groups need more attention Certain subgroups within the population such as athletes consume very high amounts of some supplements and it is important to monitor them to prevent adverse outcomes and study the effects, if any, on athletic performance [ [110](#B110-nutrients-10-00041)]. Others use supplements in the hope that they will improve cognitive performance [ [103](#B103-nutrients-10-00041)]. Those who practice polypharmacy with prescription, non-prescription drugs and dietary supplements represent another high-risk group, and interventions to limit the potential for adverse events are needed [ [111](#B111-nutrients-10-00041), [112](#B112-nutrients-10-00041)]. Collaborations among scientists in many countries are needed to drive supplement science forward. [113](#B113-nutrients-10-00041)]. As mentioned earlier, the nature and diversity of the sector means that regulators face a number of very specific challenges for these low risk products. These include evaluating traditional evidence, dealing with products that contain multiple bio-actives and addressing the growing challenges of ensuring product quality. It is critical that scientists and regulators work together and learn from each other in both identifying issues and developing ways in which they can be addressed. Although regulatory challenges must be met at the national level, there must be due regard paid to the fact that national regulatory decisions about supplements have global implications. 6. Conclusions [114](#B114-nutrients-10-00041)]. The challenges in supplement science and its regulation provide new opportunities for scientists and regulators to work together both nationally and internationally, to learn from each other, and to cooperate and when appropriate harmonize approaches to improve the public health.
