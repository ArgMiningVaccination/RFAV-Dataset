Mundeir for my 12 daughter whom has special needs. Im very against typical pharmaceutical medicine. Dr. Mundeir was very nice, and, went thru each question of the questionnaire i filled out. I found her very professional. She didn't seem like a regular dr office but i wasnt really there for anything but advice. Going holistic cured my daughter from not only her seizures, but, most of her daily behavioral health and increased her appetite. All pharmaceutical products only cover up health problems. Dr. Mundeir was able to give me some good advice and provided a organic plant based blend of daily protein for her. Since we're vegans and my daughter loves dark greens but she's not getting her daily value this blend will help her. I will update my review after we see results from this protein blend. I would definitely come back to see her again. Her office is located in a shared building of other offices. She has her own private practice. The examination room is very small. She has her degrees and licenses on the wall. It's nicely designed and we felt very comfortable. - 1/21/2023 Great experience. Listened to my needs Quite refreshing after frustrating times with mainstream doctors. - 5/9/2022 Dr. Mundeir is the best doctor I've ever had. She is so kind, understanding, and has the most incredible bedside manner. Dr. Mundeir has helped me stabilize my thyroid issues through a very clear and realistic treatment plan! I adore her! - 1/6/2021 I would give Dr. Mundeir 100 stars if I could. She is fantastic. I have been suffering from migraines for almost 40 years with no relief from other Doctors. She addressed my problem on our first visit and gave me magnesium, B2 and Butterbur, and it worked. I have not had one migraine since I have been on this supplement and I feel great. She also addressed my high blood pressure which again all other doctors ignored. She put me on a supplement called Carditone and it worked too, immediately. I could not be more happy to have these two issues under control. Dr. Mundeir is kind, compassionate and very smart. I highly recommend her. - 7/1/2020 Dr. Mundier is kind, compassionate and very caring. After years and years of struggling with my health, Dr. Mundier found the underlying issue(s) and created a detailed treatment plan for me. I see a huge difference in my health and I am so grateful to have been referred to her. - 5/12/2017 I had been in and out of my doctor's office & ER so many times over the course of a year and a half with all kinds of infections, pain & general illness. They only prescribed me with antibiotics instead of trying to find the source to the problem. Dr. Mundeir actually took the time to ask about my lifestyle, diet, stressors etc. and was able to give me the proper supplements to help me recover and helped me discover that a lot of my pain was caused by food allergies (I had been told by other doctors that a change in diet would not help my pain etc.). Starting to feel more energy and less pain already. Thank you, Dr. Mundeir! - 12/18/2018 I have been going to Dc Mundeir for a few years now and I can only compliment her on her thoroughness and professionalism. I love her approach of curing the patient before you can cure the illness. She goes deep into the root of the problem through a series of questions about mental wellbeing and lifestyle. I went to her because suddenly I started losing a lot of hair and after going through a series of tests, she put me on a bio identical hormonal cure that has stopped the hair loss completely, and even reverted it...my hair is now growing back! I am feeling great even though things could not be more stressful at work. I have been coping with very high stress levels for months on end without a problem or hair loss. I feel better at 58 years old than I did at 40! Thank you Dc Mundeir, I look forward to many more years as your faithful patient. - 4/2/2019 Dr. Mundeir is not only extremely good at what she does, but she has an excellent bedside manner and really cares about what you have to say. She will go beyond what many doctors will do to help you become well and stay well. Her allergy treatment program provides a natural approach to allergy that doesn't just throw medications at the symptoms. It changes the underlying allergy for long-term relief. I recommend Dr. Mundeir without hesitation. - 9/20/2017 Words cannot express our gratitude to Dr Mundeir. She is a life changer for my daughter and our family. My teenage daughter had been suffering from chronic hives for 7 months by the time we found Dr Mundeir. After TONS of tests, medicine tries, and blood work with our standard insurance, we tried in desperation a different approach. What an amazing experience! Literally asks different questions and wants to get to the root cause of the Hives. After specialized blood work that is very affordable, Dr. Mundeir helped my daughter almost eliminate all of her hives. I cannot recommend Dr Mundeir more- we love her! - 7/8/2013 I wasn't even sure what naturopathic medicine when I met Dr. Mundeir, but I'm an advocate now! I have been having stomach problems for years, and was tired of feeling awful all the time. Dr. Mundeir met with me for a full hour to talk about every aspect of my current health, and determine what the next steps would be. She walked me through every supplement she gave me, and explained in basic terms what was happening in my body. I couldn't believe how much I learned from her that day. I've waited 6 months to write this review, as I wanted to see how her program would work, and I am THRILLED with the results. Staying on her program was a challenge, but today I can eat everything without hurting, and I'm no longer lactose intolerant! I refer friends and family to Dr. Mundeir all the time now, trying to help them heal their bodies correctly. What a difference it has made in mine. Thank you Dr. Mundeir, for everything! You Might "}
