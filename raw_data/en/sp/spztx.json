It continues to gain momentum as sophisticated consumers become disenfranchised by the pharmaceutically driven system of conventional medicine. The word \"homeopathy\" is derived from the Greek words homoios (similar) and pathos (suffering or disease). It is based upon the premise of the Law of Similars, which in essence means that \"like cures like.\" What does homeopathy treat? Classical Homeopathy is a system of holistic medicine that treats the individual; therefore, there is really no limit to how it can help you. It differs from conventional medicine, where a different medicine is taken to address each different symptom. Instead of suppressing symptoms, homeopathic remedies evoke the body's natural healing potential, and do so without interacting with prescription medicines. Conditions that can be treated include depression, anxiety, ADD, ASD, autoimmune disorders, hormone imbalances, weight gain, and more. Homeopathy utilizes remedies that are safe, cost-effective, and regulated by the FDA. What happens in a consultation? Classical homeopathic care starts with a detailed and focused consultation in which a full understanding of your health history, your current health concerns, and your life is obtained. The initial consultation will last anywhere from 2-2 1/2 hours, after which one remedy is selected that aims to treat all symptoms. What Homeopathy is not? Homeopathy is not a blanket term for complementary medicine. It is not a synonym for \"holistic\" or \"herbal\". It is not Reiki, psychotherapy, muscle testing, nutrition or acupuncture. Homeopathy is a unique system of medicine in which the practitioner matches your specific compilation of symptoms to a single remedy with similar indications. The remedy chosen for you will stimulate your system and arouse your unique healing response. How do I begin?
