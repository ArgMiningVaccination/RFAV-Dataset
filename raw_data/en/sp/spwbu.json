It is particularly important that ARP ESSER funding will enable States and local educational agencies ( \"LEAs \"), and more directly schools, to support students who have been most severely impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic and are likely to have suffered the most because of longstanding inequities in our communities and schools that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. The U.S. Department of Education ( \"Department \") is committed to working in partnership with States so that these unprecedented resources are quickly put to work to ensure students have sustained access to in -person instruction and that the resources are used to provide the effective support students need as they persist through and recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The thoughtful and timely use of these funds will have a lasting impact on our Nation's schools and help to address the inequities in resources, services, and opportunities available to our students. This template presents an opportunity for States to share their plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds with the public. The Department must approve a State educational agency's (\"SEA's \") plan in order to make the State's remaining ARP ESSER allocation available for use. Please note that the Department intends to issue ARP ESSER reporting requirements separately. Instructions Each SEA must provide descriptions and other information that address each requirement listed below. An SEA may use this template or another format as long as every item and element is addressed in the SEA's response . Throughout this document, questions that refer to an SEA's ARP ESSER funding are referencing the total allocation to be received by the SEA , including that which it allocates to its LEAs. Each SEA must submit to the Department by June 7, 2021, either: (1) its ARP ESSER plan or (2) the State requirements that preclude submission of the plan by that date and a date by which it will be able to submit its complete ARP ESSER plan . To submit the SEA's plan, please email the plan to your Program Officer at [State] .OESE @ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov ). In order to ensure transparency, the Department will post each plan on the Department's website when it is received and will indicate each plan's approval status .

On July 15, 1999, the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico enacted Law Number 149, \"Ley Org\u00e1nica del Departamento de Educaci\u00f3n Number 85-2018 1 \"Ley de Reforma Educativa de Puerto Rico del 29 de marzo de 2018\" . This law established Puerto Rico's public policy in the education field and created a public education system focused mainly on the students. In addition, it established free selection school and educational voucher program, among others. PRDE is the responsible entity for the planning and administration of all public elementary, secondary and some post -secondary education throughout Puerto Rico. The Secretary of Education is appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) is a unitary system serving as both the state educational agency (SEA) and a local education agency (LEA). The PRDE oversees one island - wide education system. From the SEA perspective, PRDE's Central Level develops policies and guidelines, provides materials and technical assistance, engages in oversight and monitoring and provides leadership to all schools and the seven (7) Regional Education Offices (OREs, per its acronym in Spanish). From the LEA perspective, PRDE provides direct services to schools and ensures the implementation of SEA level policies. PRDE's has 860 (K-12) public schools , including 4 public charter schools , that serve 271,685 students. PRDE also provides higher education, vocational, career technical courses, and alternative adult programs. PRDE's organization is composed of one central administrative office and seven educational regions, each of which are led by a Regional Superintendent. The Commonwealth is currently facing a severe fiscal, economic and liquidity crisis, due to multiple factors , including, significant governmental deficits, a 15- year long recession, high unemployment rates, population declination, and high levels of debt and pension obligations. These challenges have depl eted the Commonwealth's tax base such that its revenues no longer cover essential funding for other essential services such as PRDE. The Legislature approved, by joint r esolution, the allocation of $2,342,589,000, charged to the General Fund of the State Treasury, for ordinary operating expenses of the PRDE for fiscal year 2021-2022. This allocation resulted in a decrease of $152.4 million or 6 % when compared to the general budget approved in FY 2020-2021. COVID-19 related Federal Education Stabilization Funds , provide critically needed fiscal resources to support the safe reopening of schools, the maintenance of on- going educational programs, and the provision of evidence -based learning loss initiatives. Without this federal 1 https://www.de.pr.gov/wp -content/uploads/2019/03/ley -85-2018- enmendada.pdf Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 7 assistance, and the deep and disruptive cuts to education program , these funding have been necessary , due to the weakened ability of the Commonwealth to appropriately fund PRDE's ability to maintain state support during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic and associated economic slowdown. The American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund, authorized under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021, will provide nearly $2.9 billion to Puerto Rico to ensure a significant return of students in the modality of in -person instruction and maintain safe operations while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic. Moreover, these funds will help to address long- standing inequities in our communities and schools that were exacerbated by the pandemic so that we can ensure th at the students most severely affected by the pandemic are provided with t he opportunities, resources and support they need as they recover from its impacts. This document is intended to share PRDE's overall plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds with the public and the United States Department of Education (USDOE). PRDE considers this application to be a living document as needs and priorities may develop over the lifespan of the American Rescue Plan. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 8 A. Describing the State's Current Status and Needs The Department recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by States, LEAs, and educators to support students during the COVID -19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARP ESSER funding decisions, and their current and projected operating status. 1. Progress and Promising Practices : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 strategies that have been most effective in supporting the needs of students in your State during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially for students most impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. Please include, if applicable, how your State will submit and encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs. The Government of Puerto Rico c oordinated with the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) and other island -wide agencies, effort s to provide the necessary support to students that were most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Below, are includ ed the top strategies that resulted the most effective in supporting student's needs. Provided Affordable and Accessible Internet Services . Low-income households in Puerto Rico count ed on federal aid that granted discounts on internet service during the pandemic starting on May 12, 2021. Through the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program , eligible families were grant ed monthly discounts on internet service, ranging from $50 to $75 and up to $100 in a singular discount for the purchase of electronic equipment. Through this program, families were granted better resources for access t o education. Eligible households and consumers were able to subscribe to the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program and receive a discount or monthly subsidy on the cost of internet service as provided by more than eight participating internet providers. Devices for students and teachers , and Professional Development . On July 2020, a total of 159,330 computers were distributed, including 18,000 tablets, 132,330 laptops and mobile carts. From the month of May 2020 through August 2021, PRDE offered Professional Development for software program usage , digital lesson plan design, and integration of technology, among other topics. Devices allowed for the implementation of redesigned learning strategies to provide a rich and innovative learning experiences with technology for students. The acquisition of electronic books, tablets and other technological devices helped teachers anticipate their support to the needs of each student and allowed teachers to structure learning plans at a faster pace accordi ng to their needs. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 11 2. Overall Priorities : Provide your assessment of the top 2- 3 issues currently facing students and schools across your S tate as a result of or in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic including, to the extent possible, data illustrating why these are the most critical and/or most widespread issues facing schools and students. The pandemic ushered in a set of challenging learning conditions across the island. These circumstances created unique needs for educators and students , while exacerbating existing inequalities. The following issues listed below surfaced as the priorities: Addressing unfinished learning through asset -based acceleration strategies . The loss of in -person instruction made it difficult for some students to make expected academic gains. In many cases, teachers were unable to maintain traditional pacing guide schedules, resulting in students lacking exposure to essential concepts that s erve as building blocks in subsequent academic years. In order to increase student engagement and accelerate learning in response to the pandemic, students need access to high- quality, culturally sustaining and revitalizing instruction. Distance learning h as created conditions where many students from historically underserved communities are falling further behind because schools lack the resources to adequately engage with families. The inconsistent access to high - quality instruction will continue through 2021- 22 as some families will continue with the distance learning option and some others with the hybrid learning option. During distance learning last year and according to the available data, 52% of the students were disengaged during the months of February thru May. During that period, 39% of the students enrolled at the end of the year never connected to MS Teams sessions, while 13% connected less than 25 % of the enrolled time. The Educational Regions have struggled with online attendance, inconsistent work submissions, and in consistent engagement. While schools have been working diligently to keep students engaged through various means , such as by provi ding targeted PD to teachers on strategies to engage students through on- line teaching, the concern is that the students have not received the quality of education they would in a normal year due to COVID-19 related absences, lack of engagement, etc. Efforts to reach those most at -risk have already been under way during the 2020- 21 academic year and continued through the Educational Summer program. PRDE identified a total of 24,000 students with the highest risk factors to fail . Through the Regional Education Offices , PRDE was able to contact approximately 21,000 of those students and provided academic assistance through the Educational Summer Program. The decrease in enrollment between August 2020 and 2021, along with those students who were disengaged during distance learning are missing valuable learning, which could exacerbate learning loss. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 12 This priority includes investing in strategies and supports that strengthen instructional practices and lead to positive post -secondary outcomes. Thi s entails an investment in programs that provide relevant learning experiences for students that build off from their strengths, identities, and interests. In general, PRDE had an enrollment decrease of around 16,000 (5.5%). For the Primary level, prescho ol grades (PK and K) contributed to19% of the decrease in enrollment with just over 3,000 students, while grades 1 st through 8th accounted for 58% with an approximate loss of 9,400 students, being 2nd grade the one with a higher contribution at an 11%. At the Secondary Level, the net drop in enrollment was 16%, as 10th grade enrollment increased by 5%. At this level, the grade with the highest impact was 9th grade, representing a 12.5% loss of the total enrollment, or approximately 2,000 students. Full -time Special Education Classroom students decreased by a net factor of nearly 6%, as Secondary Level students in this population increased by 3%. Due to widespread school closures related to the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), USDE waive d the statewide assessment 3 for the 2020 and 2021 school years. Collected data demonstrates the impact of the pandemic on students and schools, including an approximate decrease of 600 students in Technological Institutes ; 117 schools offering 66 specialized CTE courses were paused and modified during the 2020- 2021 school year , as a result of lack of in -person instruction. All required course workshop hours could not be provided, due to the pandemic, and instead, PRDE had to modify courses by requesting students to complete their learning sessions through the Work Based Learning (WBL) strategy. At the end of the academic year, students submitted a portfolio as evidence that WBL was properly performed. Supporting the academic, social emotional, and health needs of students and educators . Achievement gaps in Puerto Rico have decreased persistently for approximately 5 years 4. School building closures, extended quarantines, and disrupted learning environments are expected to widen those gaps. While this is not a new challenge, the pandemic has served to highlight existing gaps in student achievement and opportunities. PRDE will provide statewide interim assessments by subject, in order to establish baseline data of student achievement. T hese interim assessments at 10 -week intervals are imperative for PRDE to focus its funding on an academic strategy for both elementary and middle grades. 3 PR Covid19 Waiver approved and PR Covid19 Waiver approved 2021 year 4 PRDE measures student academic achievement through a standardized test \"Measurement and Evaluation for the Academic Transformation of Puerto Rico\", hereinafter known as META -PR. This test is aligned to agency- approved content standards and grade expectations and measures content proficiency in the subjects of Spanish, math, English as a second language, and science. All 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 11th grade students participate, except science, which is administered only in 4th, 8th, and 11th grade. Data regarding achievement gap is available at. PERFIL ESCOLAR 2019- 2020 (dde.pr) Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 13 In addition to supporting the academic component , PRDE recognizes that many students are facing a mul titude of traumatic stressors resulting from the pandemic , such as the illness or loss of friends or family . PRDE was able to identify that more than 5005 students had lost a family member during 2020- 2021, due to the illness of COVID -19. According to increased numbers6 of child abuse , neglect reports , food and income insecurities have been identified as additional traumatic stressors for students. Their basic needs - including food, rest, emotional safety and sense of belonging - must be met before effective learning can occur. This hierarchy of needs applies equally to adults in the school setting. Social and emotional learning (SEL) and mental health are best addressed with a collaborative approach of building relationships with students and caring for the well -being of everyone in the school community during summer programming and the traditional school year. SEL helps support student mental health needs by fostering a sense of safety and security, building positive relationships with others and providing equitable support to learning. The combined impact is a strengthened school community. Unfortunately, students and families are facing higher incidences of crises during the COVID -19 pandemic. According to the most recent needs assessment performed by the PRDE's Social Worker Program (PTSE, per its acronym in Spanish), approximately 68,000 students have been identified to be in need of support by the school's social worker in the 2021 -2022 academic year, either due to an emotional, mental or behavioral situation. The impact of COVID -19 has the potential to exacerbate these numbers. The longer students are quarantined and isolated, there is a higher risk of exposure to more traumatizing, negative experiences such as abuse, neglect, and violence. It is imperative that PRDE take a proactive approach to address the mental health and well-being of students and staff. Staffing shortages and a lack of capacity in school and regions . These shortages include teachers and professional support staff, specialized staff , school mental health professionals , substitute teachers , paraprofessionals, school nurses , and other school administrators and leaders . Over the course of the years , the PRDE has taken proactive steps to address educator recruitment and retention challenges; however, the pandemic has exacerbated some of the challenges in this area. Therefore, understanding the pandemic's true impact on the education workforce will be paramount. 5 Data was collected during a recent statistics report generated by the PRDE's School Social Worker Program . 6 PRDE's School Social Worker Program - 2021 social well -being needs assessment Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 14 3. Identifying Needs of Underserved Students : Describe your State's 2-3 highest priority academic, social, emotional, and/or mental health needs for the re mainder of the 2020-2021 school year (if applicable) and for the 2021- 2022 school year related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on each of the following student groups: i. Students from low- income families, i. Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity), ii. Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender), iii. English learners, iv. Children with disabilities (including infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( \"IDEA \")), v. Students experiencing homelessness, vi. Children and youth in foster care, vii. Migratory students, and viii. Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , and LGBTQ+ students). To the extent possible, this description should include data on indicators such as estimates of the academic impact of lost instructional time , 7 chronic absenteeism, student engagement, and social -emotional well-being. Complete the table below, adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. As of the writing of the Puerto Rico State Plan, there is limited state -level data available. Therefore, as quantitative data becomes available (e.g., state assessment results, WIDA, interim assessments, certified 2021 student enrollment data (due on September 2021), among other ), PRDE has used information gathered from surveys, needs assessments performed by r egional offices and the limited state -level data that PRDE has available at this moment. PRDE conducted five (5) surveys and a focus group round table discussion to gather stakeholder perspective regarding the highest priorities in order to target strategies to support all students, especially those most impacted by the pandemic. As evidenced by the data collected from the surveys and focus groups, there is consensus concerning the supports needed the most by all groups and subgroups. Because, as it is known, the COVID- 19 pandemic has impacted all students, and 7 For the purposes of the plan, \"academic impact of lost instructional time \" refers to \"learning loss\" experienced by students as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act . Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 15 some trends have been identified on all subgroups, PRDE is including below a general description of these challenges. Lost instructional time. During the pandemic, many students did not have immediate access to internet services in order to connect to their remote learning. Students in foster homes, were not able to connect to their online learning for almost four (4) months , due to lack of acces sibility of laptops and to internet connectivity. It was not until July 2020, that PRDE initiated the distribution of computers, that included 18,000 tablets and 132,330 laptops. An additional 117 schools offering 66 specialized CTE courses were paused during the 2020- 2021 school year . As a result of the lack of in -person instruction, required workshop or lab hours could not be fulfilled. PRDE modified courses by requiring students to complete their learning sessions through the Work Based Learning (WBL) strategy. At the end of the academic year, students submitted a portfolio as evidence that WBL was dully performed. Students within the Juvenile and Correctional facilitie s, participated of educational modules . Teacher collected the completed modules and proceeded on doing corrections and assigning grades. During the 2020- 2021 school year, and in compliance with the Public Policy for the Regular Education Program and Adult Program, educational services were offered virtually . The PRDE Alternate Education Program highlighted that, both students and teachers , experienced a process of adaptation during this period of time . Initially , students showed resistance. At certain times the internet system failed, therefore, teachers had to distribute instructional m aterial in paper. This led to a one- size- fits-all approach , which does not effectively support our schools, students, or educators. PRDE must uniquely respond to school s and classroom needs. Each and every child has unique unfinished learning and has experienced different learning models throughout the pandemic. Each and every educator needs specific and targeted professional learning to support their content areas and academ ic disciplines, as well as training to support accelerated learning and instruction. Chronic Abse nteeism . Even before the pandemic, Puerto Rico 's vulnerable students were more likely to be chronically absent, a key risk factor in shaping students' opportunity to learn. For 2020-2021, \"All Students\" absenteeism rate was up for 3%, when compared to previous year; being the absenteeism rate in a 10% average for the 2020 -2021 academic year. Student engagement. In general, PRDE had an enrollment decrease of around 16,000 (5.5%). However, it is important to highlight that PRDE's 2021-2022 enrollment data is not yet certified, until the process is fulfilled in September 2021. This decrease in enrollment is yet to be updated once the certification is completed by the PRDE. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 21 4. Understanding the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on student learning and student well -being, including identifying the groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. Where possible, please identify the data sources the SEA will sug gest its LEAs use in thoughtfully diagnosing areas of need, including data on the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of lost instructional time . PRDE is supporting school educational regions and schools in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on student learning and student well-being. PRDE disaggregates the above -referenced data (sections A.2 and A.3) by educational school region and schools and shares this data with our educational school regions to help them understand the impact of the pandemic on their communities and students. PRDE wi ll support its educational school regions by providing and encouraging multiple avenues for data analysis. It will encourage its school educational regions to analyze different types of data such as attendance, discipline, grades, formative and summative assessment results, among others, to identify groups who might have suffered the most during the pandemic. PRDE is investing in supporting the use of and access to high- quality interim assessments to support schools' efforts to continue close monitoring of student progress and targeted interventions. PRDE is also making available a variety of professional learning sessions and supports for both school leaders and educators on assessing and accelerating student learning. Student well -being . To help schools identify and respond to the impact of the pandemic on student well -being, PRDE will support schools by performing initial screenings , identifying students at -risk for mental health concerns, and addressing students' mental and behavioral health needs. An interdisciplinary socio -emotional team will assist teachers through th is process. The socioemotional assessments will not only allow for collection of useful information for teachers, but also serves to strengthen relations between students and teachers, which often occur in the context of face -to-face education and that are necessary for the development of socio -emotional skills of our students. In ad dition to the socioemotional assessments, qualitative data such as counselor visits, social workers input and teacher relations will be analyzed to help determine the highest areas of needs among students, including student mental health and behavior. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 22 PRD E will also support school educational regions in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on student learning in a number of ways. Due to widespread school closures related to the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID -19), USDE waived the statewide assessment for the 2020 and 2021 school years. As part of our approved assessment waivers requested for statewide assessments, PRDE required all K -12 schools to report information about non- summative assessments administered in tested grades at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. PRDE has also developed and made available a variety of tools and resources to support schools in building multitiered systems of support, strong policies and procedures for handling aspects of loss of instruction. PRDE will use the information collected to target island -provided supports, technical assistance and oversight through annual monitoring and oversight activities. To assess the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on students with disabilities, PRDE has developed guidelines and protocols to assist in identifying any skill loss, lack of adequate progress, learning loss, or the emergence of new needs that students may have experienced. Later, during the 2021-2022 school year, PRDE will also examine how learning in remote, hybrid, and in- person environments affected outcomes including, but not limited to: Student academic achievement and growth on available assessment data; Academic growth; Attendance; Spanish Language Profi ciency gains Data Collection and Analysis . PRDE will also continue to expand its collection and communication of available student data. PRDE's data collection and reporting system will be leveraged to provide parents/guardians, school and educational school regions leaders, and the public with available data on how students are achieving and progressing. This data system is not limited to test result data and includes detailed information on student enrollment, attendance, course completion, and graduation as well as school climate. Collection of these data elements will directly support PRDE' s efforts to better understand the pandemic's impact on school communities and identify appropriate actions to meet the academic, social emotional, and physical heal th and safety needs of students. Guidance for prevention on COVID- 19 in schools . Faced with the public health emergency due to the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), the PRDE Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 23 has established prevention guidance to provide schools the necessary strategies for the safe operation of schools during the pandemic. The guidance is based on the guidelines of the Centers for the Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) and the recommend ations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), among others. The prevention strategies presented in the guide aim to achieve a safe operation of schools under strict health prevention and mitigation measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission SA RS-CoV- 2 on school sites while serving the educational needs of students, children and youth, including those receiving services from the Special Education Program. Accelerated Learning t hrough a SMARTS In tegrated System of Support . To achieve the acceler ated learning, PRDE will implement the SMARTS (Students, Measurable, Accelerated, Relevant, Teachers, and S ocioemotional and health) Integrated System of Support . The SMARTS In tegrated System of Support will be used as a structure of continuous planning and responding to address student and teacher's needs. The cycle will also support the most impacted groups of students with an individual academic improvement plan, if necessary . Through this strategy PRDE w ill provide a systematic process and technical support for school communities to make key decisions and establish a mindset that will lead to strategic vision, needs assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring, and adjusting, with each element integrated systemically. Key components within the associated SMARTS Integrated System of Support will include operational and system conditions, social and emotional wellness, academics, and scaffolded supports. Local Assessments. To assist education school regions and schools in gaining early and important insights into the impact of COVID -19 on student learning, PRDE provided a statewide interim assessment in order to have a baseline data on student achievement. Every 10 weeks, PRDE will be able to identify, in which subject, the student's performance is most affected. These interim assessments are imperative for PRDE to focus its funding on an academic strategy for both elementary and middle grades. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 24 5. School Operating Status : It is essential to have data on how students are learning in order to support the goals of access and equity, especially for student groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Des cribe the current status of data collection on operational status and mode of instruction of all schools in your State. This description must include: i. A description of to what extent, and how frequently, the State collects now and will collect in the future data for all schools in your State on: a. Mode of instruction: The number of schools in your State that are offering fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in- person instruction (hybrid full -time in -person instruction; b. Enro llment: Student enrollment for all students and disaggre gated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i- viii for each mode of instruction; and c. Attendance: Student attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i-viii for each mode of instruction. Mode of Instruction : During the 2020- 2021 academic year, all schools in the Puerto Rico Department of Education operated remotely (virtual) due to the COVID -19 pandemic. As of March 1, an order was issued for the gradual opening of schools, allowing approximately 75% of schools to resume face -to-face education. This guideline was reversed during the month of April due to the increase in positive cases of COVID -19, causing a return to remote (virtual) education for the rest of the academic year . For the new academic year, all 860 schools were given the option to provide in-person, hybrid or full virtual instruction for the 2021- 2022 academic year for the 261,485 students that are enrolled as of today. Ons ite instruction is traditional instruction where a student attends full- time (100%) of their time on campus; 770 schools are opting for this alternative, while 31 schools are providing a virtual option, in which students attend full -time off -site (either synchronous or asynchronous) and utilize technology resources for instruction. The last option for schools is a hybrid model where 59 schools are providing its students a combined virtual and on- site instruction and utilize a combination of resources. This data was collected on September 8, 2021. The state included a data collection process to capture the mode of instruction for each student. This data will be collected twice a week on the number of students who are on- site or virtual. Therefore, the map bel ow will periodically be updated.

However, PRDE certifies the enrollment data by September of each year. As of today, a total of 261,485 students have enrolled in the public education system. Attendance: PRDE has available the attendance data for the 2020-2021 school year. During distance learning last year and according to the available data, 52% of the students were disengaged during the months of February thru May. During that period 39% of the students enrolled at the end of the year never connected to MS Teams sessions, while 13% connected less than 25% of the enrolled time. ii. The data described in A. 5.i.a. and b. using the template in Appendix A (and to the extent available, the data described in A.5.i. c.) for the most recent time per iod available . Please note that this data can be submitted separately within 14 calendar days after a State submits this plan. The SEA must also make this data publicly available on its website as soon as possible but no later than June 21, 2021, and regularly provide updated available information on its website. The Department will periodically review data listed in A.5.i on SEA websites . PRDE will make data publicly available on the PRDE website at : Perfil Escolar2020-2021 (dde.pr) Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 26 iii. To the extent available, a des cription of the planned operational status and mode of instruction for the State and its LEAs for Summer 2021 and for the 2021-2022 school year. In the summer of 2021, PRDE determined to provide in- person instruction to the majority of the 24,000 students that were at risk of failing their grades. With the support of the Educational Regions, PRDE was able to contact approximately 21,000 of those students and provided in -person academic assistance through the Educational Summer Program. In the 2021- 22 school year, all schools were given the option to provide in- person, hybrid or full virtual instruction, depending on their local needs or when COVID -19 cases are identified at the schools. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 27 B. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining their Safe Operations The Department recognizes that safely reopening schools and sustaining their safe operations to maximize in -person instruction is essential for student learning and student well-being, and especially for being able to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID- 19 pandemic . In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in this vital area. 1. Support for LEAs : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in safely returning to in -person instruction and sustaining the safe operation of schools . This description must include: i. How the SEA will support its LEAs implementing , to the greatest extent practicable, prevention and mitigation policies in line with the most up- to- date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC \") for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff; PRDE has developed and made publicly accessible a series of guides to manage COVID -19 within the school community, including teachers and parents.10 Recently, on July 2021, the Puerto Rico Department of Health, also issued a prevention guidance for schools K through 12. 11 The PRDE aims to initiate the transition to face -to-face classes gradually, considering protection of students, teachers and school staff. It is essential that schools open their doors as soon as possible safely and that they remain open to take advantage of the benefits of face -to-face classes and social - emotional support services that are offer. In order for schools to start this opening process, PRDE considers important to systematically adopt and implement measures to slow the spread of COVID -19, both in schools and in the community. That is, all members from the community, students, families, teachers, and staff members take steps to protect themselves and others where they live, work, study and entertain themselves. Success in preventing COVID -19 in schools is related to preventing transmission in the community at large. 10 Teacher's manual for the reopening of school's facilities on the of Health - COIVD -19 prevention guidance for schools K -12: http://www.salud.gov.pr/Documents/Guia%20para%20la%20prevenci%c3%b3n%20de%20COVID- 19%20en%20escuelas%20K -12.pdf Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 31 The consistent and combined implementation of the se different prevention strategies in the K-12th grade schools is supported by the following fundamental concepts: K-12 schools should be the last venues to close after exhausting all other preventive measures in the community and the first to reopen when be safe to do so. K-12 schools should implement recommended physical distancing but should not exclude students from classroom instruction if school structures do not allow to implement the optimal distance between them. Removal of any of the preventive measures must be done one at a time, combined with close monitoring of increases or outbreaks of COVID- 19 cases. To the extent possible, schools should organize their students into cohorts (groups that stick together all day) during face-to-face instruction so that there is little or no interaction between groups. Face -to-face instruction should be prioritized over extracurricular activities, including sports and school events , to minimize the risk of transmission in schools and protect face- to-face classes. The low susceptibility and incidence of COVID -19 among the youngest children in relationship with adolescents suggests that younger students (for example, elementary grade students) are likely to have less risk of transmission in the school during face -to-face classes than older students (middle school and higher). Families of students at highest risk of becoming seriously ill (including those with special medical needs), or who live with people at high risk, must have the option of accessing virtual classes, beyond the education modality offered at the school. Despite careful planning and consistent implementation of prevention, there may be situations that call for the temporary closure of a school or parts of a school (such as a class, a cohort, or a grade) for classes face- to-face. These decisions will be made jointly by the officials of the Health Department and the PRDE , after careful consideration of various factors and with an emphasis on ensuring the health and well -being of students, their families, teachers and school staff. In such cases, schools should do their best to continue classes through synchronous remote learning or home activities. As mentioned on section A.1 of this state plan, PRDE has worked with the Puerto Rico Department of Health to host massive vaccination campaign for staff, students, and school communities across the island . With the authorization to administer the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine to children who are at least 12 years of age, the PRDE has approximately 46,000 student s (eligible for vaccination ) that have completed their vaccination doses . The Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 32 goal is to increase the number of fully vaccinated people on school campuses and in school communities. ii. Any Statewide plans, policies, estimated timelines, and specific milestones related to reopening and operation of school facilities, including any mechanisms the SEA will use to track, monitor, or enforce their implementation ; PRD E has also developed additional prevention and mitigation support strategies to effectively maintain the health and safety of students , educators , and other staff as school facilities continue to reopen. School staff vaccinations . The Central Government c oordinated a statewide, cross -agency effort to make vaccines available to all interested education and school support staff. Approximately 95% of in person educators and school staff throughout the island have already completed the vaccinat ion series. Puerto Rico central government launched a vaccine registration system and developed a series of logistical processes and forms. T hanks to the teamwork of three government agencies , the Department of Health, the Department of Transportation and the Office of Innovation and Information Services of Puerto Rico a vaccination credential against COVID -19 was launched (VACU ID, per its acronym in Spani sh). This mechanism will allow agencies to track, monitor, or enforce the vaccination process. In order to have access to the VACU ID, the person must have the complete dose series, as appropriate to the manufacturer of the vaccine, and must register thei r information in the electronic application made available for this purpose. Student Monitoring system . PRDE has also made available a monitoring system to identify students with any signs and symptoms of COVID -19, influenza and mycoplasma in schools. On August 24, 2021, PRDE shared its protocol for School Directors and Nurses to complete and identify any possible cases. It will be carried out in schools that offer face -to-face classes on a regular and interlocking schedule. School nurse suppo rt. PRDE p rovided, and will continue to provide , school nurses throughout its schools to maintain and monitor health services for students aimed at prevention, preparedness and response to the challenges PRDE will continue to face as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic during the 2021-2022 school year. Nurses will be responsible for the: Organization and management the evaluation processes of students, according to the identified needs. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 33 Referring students, in those that health situations have been identified, to the assigned health service provider. Collaboration on the development of a student intervention plan that includes the study plan when the student returns to attend school. Offering guidance to students, parents or guardians, teaching and non-teaching staff, on the health services offered by the Program and the established public policies. Visiting students' homes with school support staff when necessary. Following up and helping the school director with health situations that may cause a risk of outbreak and transmission of diseases among the school population, according to the policies established by PRDE. Healthy E nvironments at Classrooms . PRDE will invest ARP funds to create classrooms that meet standards for accessibility and safety, both considered fundamental for teaching and learning. PRDE will dispose contaminated furniture to limit contamination of mold, fungus, and rust that build up during the lockdown. PRDE will provide students and teachers appropriate desks, that are free of mold or any rust residues. In addition, PRDE will be addressing ventilation issues within classrooms. Natural ventilation through operable windows can be a n effective and energy -efficient way to supplement air -conditioning (HVAC) systems by providing outside air ventilation, cooling and thermal comfort when conditions permit (e.g., temperature, humidity, outdoor air pollution levels, precipitation). Windows that open and close properly can enhance occupants' sense of well -being and feeling of control over their environment. In order to improve air ventilation for the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, PRDE will replace and update windows that are not properly functioning. However, for most part of the year, Puerto Rico's climatic conditions require that outdoor air be cooled to provide acceptable thermal comfort for students, faculty, and staff, requiring the addition or replacement of air - conditioning (HVAC) systems. PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to purchase or replace outdated HVAC systems that meet standards identified by the EPA. According to the Department's regulation at 34 CFR \u00a7 75.616(c), PRDE will also comply by using the services of a certified electrical engineer, licensed by the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technicians College of Puerto Rico. PRDE will determine through an assessment, which schools require to update their HVAC systems and power substations. The acquisition pr ocess will consider the costs necessary to install the HVAC system, and repairs necessary to improve the school's energy consumption (i.e. power substations). Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 34 In order to ensure compliance with social distancing inside our classrooms, PRDE has applied many strategies to accommodate students and teachers in one place. However, PRDE has identified that some classrooms simply cannot accommodate a reasonable minimum of students. Therefore, PRDE is identifying schools with classroom spaces that need to be extended or modified. PRDE considers this a remodeling activity that is necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID -19. Once a rigorous assessment is properly performed, PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to perform school facility improvements allowing PRDE to create a learning environment that could better sustain social distancing. iii. To what extent the SEA and its LEAs consult with Federal, State, and local health officials. This description should include, if available, whether the SEA and its LEAs h ave received support for screening testing from their State or local health department based on funding awarded by the CDC ; and The Puerto Rico Department of Health in collaboration with central government is providing screening testing to all the population. These are held throughout the island and are available at different locations in order to become as reachable as necessary. An example of a recent screening testing calendar is included below: Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 35 As of August 23, 2021, 79.9% of the eligible population of Puerto Rico has at least one dose of the vaccine, and two million of the population has the total doses. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 36 The Puerto Rico Department of Health continues with its massive vaccination campaign and publicly announces its weekly calendar notifying all the island wide locations where vaccination is being applied. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 37 iv. Any guidance, professional learning , and technical assistance opportunities the SEA will make available to its LEAs. As mentioned above, at section B.1(i), PRDE has developed and made publicly accessible a series of guidelines for schools' community, teachers and parents reach a safely reopening of schools and sustain their safe operations to maximize in -person instruction. In addition to the guidelines that have been made publicly available, PRDE held a summit for educational leaders duri ng August 1- 4, 2021. PRDE invited to this summit all school director s, leaders of the Regional Educational Office (ORE , per its acronym in Spanish), regional superintendents, school superintendents, assistant superintendents, and teacher f acilitator s. The fundamental purpose of the Summit was to provide technical assistance and high- level professional development in the effective implementation of changes conducive to a safe return to in -person instruction, academic achievement and contin uous improvement of the school organizational culture. The professional development sections were provided by public and private entities that present ed their innovative ideas and alternatives to strengthen and develop changes in participant learning through the following c ore issues: Instructional loss Data analysis Implementation of mitigation plans Integration of technology in the school community Socio -emotional learning Emphasis on services for students with disabilities Use and management of virtual platforms Community agreement or school partners Staff empowerment Accelerated learning Management and supervision skills Transformational leadership for change in the academic environment. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 38 2. Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plans : Describe how the SEA will ensure that its LEAs that receive ARP ESSER funds meet the requir ements in section 2001(i) of the ARP Act and the requirements relating to the ARP ESSER funds published in the Federal Register and available at https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american- rescue-pl an/american -rescue- requirements) to either: (a) within 30 days of receipt of the funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services, or (b) have developed and made publicly available on the LEA's w ebsite such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, including: i. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan includes , or will be modified to include, the extent to which it has adopted policies and a description of any such policies on each of the strategies listed in table B1 ; ii. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services including but not limited to s ervices to address the students' academic needs, and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which may include student health and food services ; iii. How the SEA will ensure that the LEA periodically review s, no less frequently than every six months for the duration of the ARP ESSER grant period (i.e., through September 30, 2023) , 14 and revise s as appropriate, its plan, and how the SEA will ensure that the LEA seeks public input , and takes such input into account on (1) whether revisions are necessary and, if so, (2) the revisions to the plan; and iv. Describe, to the extent the SEA collects it, information about LEA implementation , to the greatest extent practicable, of each element of the most up- to-date CDC guidance listed in t able B1 and its LEAs' needs for support and technical assistance to implement strategies consistent, to the greatest extent practicable, with relevant CDC guidance. PRDE has made publicly available all information regarding the procedures and policies adopted to ensure the safe return to in -person instruction on its webpage: https://de.pr.gov/ prior to the 2020- 2021 school year and continuously has updated the guidance as necessary, as recently as in July 2021. Through the webpage , PRDE includes health and safety guidelines, information on the school models being implemented, relevant data reports, resources for staff and families, and announcements shared with staff and the community. Regional Educational Offices (OREs, per its acronym i n 14 ARP ESSER funds are subject to the Tydings amendment in section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1225(b), and are therefore available to SEAs and LEAs for obligation through September 30, 2024. Review and revisions of these plans, if necessary, are not required during the Tydings period. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 39 Spanish) and schools were notified of the safe return to in- person instruction and continuity of services for this new academic year. PRDE will also make publicly available the ARP ESSER State Plan and the use of ARP ESSER funds. PRDE is prioritizing student and staff needs to facilitate a successful return to in -person instruction, including the continuity of social emotional support and access to counseling services. Our State Plan assurances have been duly signed and have provided the Department with the link where the public can readily find data on school operating status and the URL of our website where the public can find the PRDE St ate Plan. As a way to ensure that the PRDE periodically reviews the ARP ESSER grant period, and revises the plan as needed , PRDE will adapt the use of its Early Warning System. On a quarterly interval, the Early Warning System is used to monitor the implementation and compliance of work plans, including, but not limited to ensuring funds are being expended i n a timely manner. In addition to the use of the Early Warning System, PRDE performs monitoring procedures. PRDE's monitoring process focuses on meeting program quality as well as compliance with federal requirements , providing oversight of fiscal and programmatic aspects of work plans , and ensuring the continuity of services including, but not limited to services to address the students' academic needs, and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which may include student health and food services . Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 40 C. Planning for the Use and Coordination of ARP ESSER Funds The Department recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholder s is essential to developing plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families, and educators. In this section, SEAs will describe their pl ans for consultation and for coordinating the use of ARP ESSER funds with other resources to meet the needs of students. 1. SEA Consultation: Consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements , describe how the SEA engaged in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, and incorporated input into its plan, including, but not limited to : i. students; ii. families; iii. Tribes (if applicable); iv. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations) ; v. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); vi. superintendents; vii. charter school leaders (if applicable); viii. teachers, principals, school leaders , other educators, school staff, and their unions; and ix. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated , and other underserved students. The description must include how the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan, a summary of the input (including any letters of support), and how the SEA took such input into account. Surveys. PRDE distributed online surveys related to the ARP ESSER plan to all stakeholders. The survey asked respondents to identify most pressing needs currently facing students and schools in their area; what lessons could be learned from the experience of the CO VID-19 pandemic to improve the K -12 education system; and what they saw as spending priorities for Puerto Rico's ARP ESSER funds. In response, the PRDE received : 5,944 questionnaires from parents, teachers, students from the 8 th grade and 12th grade, representatives of civil organizations, stakeholders representing children with disabilities, Spanish learners, children experiencing homelessness, children in foster care, and incarcerated children. Another 11,442 surveys were answered by students from 1 st grade and 7th grade, 2 surveys were answered by non- for-profit organizations, and 559 surveys were answered by school leaders, superintendents, and charter school leaders. While PRDE attempted to receive input f rom all stakeholder groups, none was received related specifically to unions. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 41 As a result of these surveys, PRDE was able to identify students from the 1st grade through 7th grade that they felt they learned the least in their English and Math subjects. (see appendix E , for survey results) On the social -emotional aspect, 57% of the participants, preferred to study at home, because they were afraid to get infected with COVID -19. (see appendix E , for survey results) From the parents, teachers and students of the 8 th grade through 12th grade, PRDE was able to gather their top priorities for the 2021- 2022 academic year. (see appendix E , for survey results) This group of stakeholders identified that it is necessary to facilitate schools with data, along with the analysis of the data. Another top priority is to provide social emotional support to the students, and school personnel. Continue with the distribution and access to technological devices. Provide accelerated learning strategies or activities to deal with learning loss. Distribution of learning materials for educators. Focus Group. From the beginning of the pandemic, PRDE has maintained focus on collaboration and consultation with many stakeholder groups. In anticipation of a third federal relief package and to develop a recovery plan with meaningful consultation, the PRDE facilitated a School Leader focus group meeting on August 5, 2021 to determine needs of students, families , and educators due to the impact of COVID -19. Representatives of school leaders were asked to identify the greatest needs for students, families and educators. They were also provided a list of possible focal areas , from which the PRDE could prioritize support, including use of federal relief funds. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 42 As a result of the focus group meeting, PRDE was able to identify the following top priorities: Improve working conditions, as to salary increase, providing school materials, human resources recruitment, and improving school infrastructure. Continue providing effective strategies during distance learning as to distribution of laptops, internet devices, providing summer learning to students that are at a greater risk of failing, and continue providing technical assistance to educators. Provide after school and/or tutoring services to students that are at risk of failing . Regarding the social emotional support, focus group participants mentioned the need to facilitate data and analysis to better assist school personnel and students. As a summary of the input received from stakeholders , PRDE identified that it was overwhelmingly aligned to the stated prioritization and needs around learning acceleration and mental health. Ongoing Consultation. PRDE is conducting and will continue to conduct ongoing meaningful engagement with stakeholders. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 43 PRDE requested its School Educational Regions (ORE's) to provide a list of what they understand would be the most relevant initiatives to address the academic acceleration and social emotional needs. Below some of the initiatives that were presented by the OREs : - Create a mobile app for students to exchange, publish and store information in different formats and topics, with the purpose of sharing useful and reliable information and that in turn serves to support the student allowing it to complete self -learning and learn from its peers. The use of this app will be in collaborati on and interrelationship among community members, content is supervised, mediated and monitored by expert teachers in the different subjects. 15 - Develop six ( 6) m ultidisciplinary technological c enters (CTM , per its acronym in Spanish) in alliance with the municipalities within our region. The CTM project aims to use technology combining a hybrid education to address the student's academic gaps and provide them with a continuous and safe educational environment . Through this initiative, our ORDE could offer equitable and accessible access to computers and internet service to students and members of the school community. The CTM center would as a study and technology center. 16 - Provide school director s a specialized support through specia lists in the field of education and administration. It is necessary to extend the integration of the services offered, educational strategies and resources for five to six consecutive school years in order for them to effective . The ORE has identified the need to purchase equipment and materials, t eacher salaries to carry out the school extended day, teacher's assistant , security guards, office clerk s and part -time administrative assistant. 17 - Create centers, known as Centers for Academic and Social -Emotional Strengthening for Students, Families, and the Community. Centers would offer learning support and address socio -emotional needs during afterschool hours. The ORE could design the structure s for the targeted interventions through differentiation of instruction and offer the services t o guarantee and address the particular needs of our students. 18 15 ORE Caguas - best strategies to address academic acceleration 16 ORE Mayaguez - best strategies to address academic acceleration 17 ORE Ponce - best strategies to address academic acceleration 18 ORE Arecibo - best strategies to addre ss academic acceleration Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 44 - Improve both the emotional and educational well -being of students. Integrate and collaborate wi th teachers and parents who are the ones who interact directly with students. Create an infrastructure department to support OMEP in dealing with minor or emergency improvements in schools at the ORE. Provide support on Saturdays, through the arts and spor ts. Offer practical tools and methods to help teachers and parents with the educational and emotional development of students with autism problems, which has been strongly affected by social distancing due to the Covid- 19 pandemic. Creat e alliances with companies to offer workshops and \"coaching\" to teachers by professionals on educational issues, and that these workshops include materials, diagnostic tests and development plan. Offer a s trategic plan that will impact the 1 st, 7th, and 9th grades. Speak over self-esteem and personal development to high school students.19 - Create educational laborator ies, strategically located in close proximity to communities. Students seeking to improve their English language skills can visit these laboratories after school. Each municipality would have at least 1 laboratory, with another laboratory added for every 12 schools. The laboratories would offer self -learning modules on the basic, intermediate , and advanced levels. 20 - Provide students distance tutoring in the subject of Spanish (K -3rd grade) and Math (6th through 8th grades) through the in- person and virtual modalities. Tutoring would be offered as an afterschool service. In order to address the student's social emotional needs, the ORE could perform activities (workshops, literature, movies) allusive to managing emotions (anxiety, fear, sadness , and f rustration ). 21 The Department will continue to develop a comprehensive set of strategies for the ARP ESSER funds in the coming months using feedback from ongoing engagement and consultation with the US Department of Education. PRDE will utilize established networks to expand and deepen engagement with the advisory groups, partners, and the public to assess PRDE 's progress toward d eveloping a plan that reflects the needs of our communities. Staff will capture public input and consider recommendations as the plan is finalized . 19 ORE San Juan - best strategies to address academic acceleration 20 ORE Bayam\u00f3n - best strategies to address academic acceleration 21 ORE Humacao - best strategies to address academic acceleration Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 45 Online Public Comment Period. PRDE has also posted a draft of its ARP ESSER plan on the PRDE website for any member of the public to provide feedback from September 10th - 20th, 2021. A s of the date this state plan was submitted to USDE, PRDE has received 70 comments. PRDE analyzed comments receiv ed, and has identified that 34% of the comments stated the urgency to improve school's infrastructure and classroom conditions, including the purchase of 21 st Century technology for the classrooms. Another 23% of the comments stated that PRDE needs to rei nforce the academic, psychological and health support within schools due to the pandemic of COVID - 19, as to providing the alternative of mode of instruction, screening testing, and reducing school hours. A 11% of comments stated the urgency to increase salary and provide additional incentives to the school personnel due to the work performed during the pandemic. This was followed by a 9% of the comments which stated that PRDE needs to provide teachers better instructional materials. Stakeholder input taken into account. The input received will inform how PRDE will prioritize the use of ARP ESSER funds as it plans for the return of students to its school campuses and the implementation of educational opportunities to reengage students and accelerate learning to increase student achievement. I t is important to highlight that through this state plan, PRDE's intention is to promote a safe and healthy learning environment for students and staff and to assess learning loss mitigation strategies . PRDE's plan was shaped by all of these stakeholder's interactions; those main themes are reflected throughout this document. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 47 psychological and health personnel, including the purchase of health and safety items for schools, and regional offices. As of August 30, 2021, PRDE has expended $39.5 million and encumbered $59.4 million of the $ 349.1 million ESSER I award. Nurses. PRDE completed the recruitment of nurses to perform physical evaluation in the school community, both for students and for the faculty. These personnel will be in charge of mak ing referrals, preparing a prevention and action plan against possible COVID-19 infections. *404 Nurses from August 2020 to June 30, 2021.

In addition, please provide any available information on the total dollar amounts of ESSER I and ESSER II funds t hat have been obligated but not expended by the SEA and its LEAs, including whether the SEA is able to track LEA obligations. As a unitary SEA -LEA system , PRDE has made all ESSER I and ESSER II funds received available for the LEA allowable uses. As of August 30, 2021, PRDE has expended $39.5 million and encumbered $59.4 million of the $ 349.1 million ESSER I award. As of August 16, 2021, PRDE has expended $1 million and encumbered $75 million of the $ 1.320 million ESSER I I award. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 59 iii. In supporting LEAs as they plan for the safe return to and continuity of in- person instruction and for meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic , the extent to which the SEA is also using other Federal funding sources including but not limited to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( \"ESEA \"), IDEA, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (\"WIOA \"), funding for child nutrition services, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act , and the funds to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness provided by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act.22 PRDE plans to maximize the use of all federal funds awarded to address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students wh ile fulfilling the requirements of all grant programs as a unitary system. ESSER funds will be used to supplement the use of ESEA, IDEA, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act funds to provide additional supports to students disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. These supports include, but are not limited to, afterschool programs, deepen tutoring, and wraparound services to address students' social, emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs. ESSER funds will also be used to supplement child nutrition funds to continue to provide all students with school meals. After a rigorous analysis of the situation and the available alternatives, the School Food Authority (AEA), using the waivers granted by the USDA, modified the way of offering the food services from a congregated to a non- congregated manner. In other words, to maintain the recommended social distancing, the food services that the AEA has offered during this emergency were in the \"Grab and Go\" or \"Pack and Go\" modality. In this modality, food was offered to participants in disposable utensils, in front of the school gate, or in a place identified by the school director. WIOA funds will continue to be used to provide non- traditional students with career readiness programs. 22 Please note that the needs of students experiencing homelessness must be addressed (along with the other groups disproportionately impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic) through the use of the ARP ESSER SEA reservations and the required LEA reservation for the academic impact of lost instructional time; the funding provided to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act is in addition to the supports and services provided with ARP ESSER funds. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 60 D. Maximizing State- Level Funds to Support Students The Department recognizes that States have an extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the ARP Act's required State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs, and provide comprehensive afterschool programs. In this section, SEAs will describe their evidence- based strategies for these resources. 1. Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time: Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP A ct (totaling not less than 5 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds). The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those interventions on an ongoing basis to understand if they are working; PRDE's students and educators have been greatly impacted by the pandemic and related events , which have exacerbated existing inequalities. This has been demonstrated by data and the needs identified in previous sections of this plan. As PRDE turns to address these issues, with the support of the American Rescue Plan, there is both a need of urgent action while also considering a multi-year plan and a well -thought-out approach. PRDE will reserve at least the respective amount of funding for each intervention in the section, including at least 5% of the state's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds for evidence -based interventions to address the academic impact of lost instructional time. The services provided will target vulnerable students most impacted by the pandemic. However, it is important to highlight that through the ongoing consultation that PRDE plans to follow, this state plan is considered a live document. All strategies, here included (section D) , are subject to modifications, if our school community such requires it. In addition, PRDE may identify and develop other strategies to help support the students. Any other strategy, not included in this state plan, will be presented to USDE for approval and proceed with an amend ment process of the Puerto Rico's ARP ESSER State Plan. Multi -year plan . To effectively implement the evidence -based interventions, PRDE will develop, through collaborative network, a coherent plan , adequately supported and designed for long- term impact. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 61 When an academic, social emotional or health component is planned with the goal of creating a cycle of continuous improvement, opportunities are created to assess ongoing needs, experiment with new evidence -based strategies allowing PRDE to make necessary adjustments. As a result of this sustainable and continuous growth cycle, PRDE fully intends to support students in achieving accelerating learning rates so that students are meeting grade and/or content level standards. Over the course of this multi -year plan, and based on PRDE's review of data, stakeholder input and implementation of evidence -based practices, PRDE will support schools with accelerating student learning to address learning loss needs and close performance gaps. These will be addressed through an acceleration cycle, and will include: High -Impact tutoring . PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to expand and extend the tutoring services that are being currently provided by the University of Puerto Rico. The Professional Development and University Relationship Institute in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) is offering tutoring services for students from the 3 rd and 12th grade. The purpose of this program is to provide innovative and relevant educational experiences to the student, resulting in better academic achievement, within the following subjects: English, mathematics, Spanish, social studies and science. Tutoring service is currently being provided in the distance modality, from Monday to Thursday, through the Moodle platform of Microsoft Teams. Students can request the service through www.tutoriasde.upr.edu . PRDE plans on expanding these services to all student population, and extend it through 2024. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 62 During the first phase, tutoring services will be provided by the UPR students and teachers from the Puerto Rico Department of Education. The tutorial model consists on providing services to a small group, so that students receive a personalized service and the skills in need of each student can be effectively addressed. Each group will be made up of 5 to 10 students accompanied by a designated tutor. The activities and teaching strategies have been designed by an interdisciplinary group of experts in content, technology and family issues and psychosocial support, in the hands of a group of coordinators who are teachers of the humanities, education, social sciences and general studies faculties of the UPR - R\u00edo Piedras Campus. High quality instructional materials . A full suite of optional, high-quality, innovative instructional materials including long term scopes and sequences, unit plans, unit assessments, daily lesson plans, student activities, and additional supports for the most affected students. Accelerated learning, requires that students consistently receive grade -level materials, tasks, and assignments, campus experiences, along with appropriate scaffolds that make the work accessible in order to close the most critical gaps. HyFlex Classrooms . Providing high- quality instructional materials includes equipping classrooms with 21st century technology. PRDE understands the educational importance of technology. The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted the overdue need to integrate technology into regular educatio nal process. Integration of well -designed technology allows teachers to enrich the overall learning experience for all students. For this reason, PRDE will invest ARP funds to equip classrooms still lacking a dashboard with projector and touch screens. The basic configuration of a HyFlex classroom supports the ability for both in- person students and remote students alike to interact and actively participate in class. Healthy environments at Classrooms. Research 23 shows there is a direct link between children's health and performance and their physical environment, including students' exposure to toxic environmental factors. Unfortunately, many classrooms across the island fail to meet the minimum standards of providing appropriate air ventilation, dry, mold or rust -free furniture. PRDE will therefore, invest ARP funds to create classrooms that meet standards for accessibility and safety, both considered fundamental for 23 The organization of Center for Green Schools, recently issued an overview titled, Green school buildings are better for teachers and students | Center for Green Schools of existing research related to health and the learning environment at schools. The document states that school buildings create an environment where students and teachers are more comfortable, less prone to illness and more focused on teaching and learning. The quality of school facilities is often overlooked as a major factor in students' scholastic performance. However, school buildings are not only the setting for learning, they can also help or hinder the learning process. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 63 teaching and learning. PRDE will dispose contaminated furniture, presenting mold, fungus, or rust build up during the lockdown. PRDE will provide students and teachers appropriate desks, that are free of mold or any rust residues. In addition, researchers 24 observed a 5% decrease in \"power of attention\" in poorly ventilated classrooms. Natural ventilation through operable windows can be an effective and energy -efficient way to supplement air - conditioning (HVAC) systems by providing outside air ventilation, cooling and thermal comf ort when conditions permit (e.g., temperature, humidity, outdoor air pollution levels, precipitation). Windows that open and close properly can enhance occupants' sense of well -being and feeling of control over their environment. In order to improve air ve ntilation for the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, PRDE will replace and update windows that are not properly functioning. However, for most part of the year Puerto Rico's climatic conditions require that outdoor air be cooled to provide acceptable thermal comfort for students, faculty, and staff, requiring the addition or replacement of air - conditioning (HVAC) systems. PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to purchase or replace outdated HVAC systems that meet standards identified by the EPA. According to the Department's regulation at 34 CFR \u00a7 75.616(c), PRDE will also comply by using the services of a certified electrical engineer, licensed by the R efrigeration and Air Conditioning Technicians College of Puerto Rico. PRDE will use the ARP ESSER funds to perform the assessment at schools and determining improvements necessary in our HVAC systems and schools' energy substations. The acquisition process will consider the costs necessary to install the HVAC system, and repairs necessary to improve the school's energy consumption (i.e. power substations). In order to ensure compliance with social distancing inside our classrooms, PRDE has applied many s trategies to accommodate students and teachers in one place. However, PRDE has identified that some classrooms simply cannot accommodate a reasonable minimum of students. Therefore, PRDE is identifying schools with classroom spaces that need to be extended or modified. PRDE considers this a remodeling activity that is necessary to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID -19. Once a rigorous assessment is properly performed, PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to 24 With similarly poor CO2 levels and ventilation rates in school buildings, students have been observed to experience greater fatigue, impaired attention span, and loss of concentration (Chatzidiakou et al., 2012); poorer performance on tests of concentrati on (Dorizas et al., 2015a); and lower levels of focus among university students during lectures (Uzelac et al., 2015). Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 64 perform school facility improvements allowing PR DE to create a learning environment that could better sustain social distancing. Professional learning . Professional development and technical assistance for educators, leadership, and school health professionals to address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students. In order to empower educators, school support staff, and school leaders to develop skills and implement creative and evidence -based strategies to improve instructional practices, PRDE will offer incentives to those educators, school support staff, and school leaders, when they attend to professional development trainings, focusing on topics directly related to addressing the academic impact of lost instructional time, summer learning, and enrichment programs, after school programs or any other related to community violence. PRDE will offer an additional incentive to e ducators, school support staff, and school leaders that were able to reach the school's goal. Each school will be provided a baseline data and the improvements that should be establish ed as a goal in order to receive the incentive. Extended school day . PRDE will extend its Extended Academic Enhancement initiative, (RAE, per its acronym in Spanish) as an academic recovery strategy. The purpose is to offer an extended- hour program that focuses on math, science, Spanish, English, social studies, fine arts or physical education, school health, and occupational programs (as needed). The supervised study program will emphasize reading comprehension skills in Spanish and English using the STEAM educational approach that encourages integrated learning of the disciplines. Schools that do not PROVIDE extended hours services through other federal programs for the same purposes (i.e. 21st Century) will participate in this project. Summer learning programs . A strategic planning process to design and align summer learning program to extend instructional time with high - quality, innovative instructional materials, curriculum -aligned, and enrichment options for students. Student Growth Incentive . PRDE recognizes that our students have struggled academically during this pandemic, and have also been impacted socially and emotionally. Due to the deep understanding PRDE has of this situation, it has developed and put forth strategies, initiatives, and practices that will support all students impacted by COVID -19 in closing those academic gaps, working diligently as a team to also provide the support needed to work with the social -emotional and health component. As part of the initiatives', PRDE will recognize the e ffort of students in improving their academic achievement, taking ownership, responsibility and interest in their own academic progress. This monetary recognition will be given at Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 65 the end of the school year to the participating students who demonstrate growth. PRDE plans on using ARP ESSER funds to implement this merit program for students, which also serves as additional motivation during these troubled times, for our most impacted and at need students. Students interested in participating from this inc entive, would need to enroll in the Student Growth Incentive Program . They must meet certain criteria to successfully complete the program, such as raising their performance one grade level in any of the core subjects (Spanish, English, math or science). G enerally, a student must be performing at least one grade level below their current status to qualify. PRDE will pair their prior year baseline data in order to measure improvement achieved at the end of each year in the multi-year plan. These students will receive continuous social, emotional, academics, and scaffolded supports through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support, further explained in this state plan. The PRDE's Planning, Transformation and Performance Auxiliary Secretariat (SAPTRE, per its acronym in Spanish) will provide oversight over the implementation of this program. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 66 Social, emotional, and mental health supports . Hire or contract school mental health staff or the implementation of programs targeted at mitigating social, emotional, and mental health impacts of COVID -19. School mental health staff (including counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other mental health professionals) have the necessary skills to build capacity within the school environment to meet the social, emotional, and mental health needs of students to support academic growth and prepare students to be career -ready adults. PRDE has identified that schools do not provide the space or office for our social, emotional and health professionals to provide their services and meeting with standard privacy requirements. Therefore, PRDE will use ARP ESSER funds to renovate or remodel schools' facilities, considered necessary for PRDE to respond to the traumas caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. Through these renovations or remodeling, PRDE will create the adequate space for our students to receive the social emotional and health support needed. The SMARTS (Students, M easurable, A ccelerated, Relevant, Teachers, and S ocioemotional and health) Integrated System of Support is embedded within the multi -year plan. This will include operational and system conditions, social and emotional wellness, academics, and scaffolded supports. Through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support, PRDE will address the academic, social emotional and health needs of all students. Key components within the associated SMARTS Integrated System of Support will include operational and system conditions, social and emotional wellness, academics, and scaffolded supports. The multi- year plan ning cycle is necessary for PRDE to provide effective support . The steps and process of planning, intervention, evaluation , assessment , and readjustment create the foundations for fidelity of implementation and sustainable improvement. The SMARTS system of support continues through 2024 when the goals of ARP ESSER III funds are met . Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 67 The goal of the planning phase is to diagnose student's unfinished learning of the prerequisite content knowledge and skills, as well as the social, emotional, and mental health needs . PRDE will collaborate with schools to identify the areas or subjects that student need the most support. This will lead to a relevant planning of intervention, necessary to properly address the most impacted students. During the intervention phase, teachers, psychologist, social workers, nurses, counselors, educational therapist, educational therapist, and other school personnel will provide the necessary support to the students in need. Intervention will be targeted to the individual student and provided by the appropriate personnel or professional. In order to ensure targeted interventions, PRDE will provide all schools with appropriate accelerated learning resources, high quality curricula, and all additional necessary tools, including data collection protocols. PRDE will evaluate the impact of each of these interventions, with qualita tive data, including stakeholder feedback, in order to assist schools in determining next steps. Other quantitative metrics will include those that indicate changes to the learning environment such as results of school climate surveys, hours of mental h ealth services provided, and percent of students receiving social emotional support. Evaluation of these interventions will occur annually during the multi- year cycle. If the intervention worked, PRDE will proceed with the cycle and address additional needs, as these where identified; if not, PRDE will Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 68 readjust the intervention in order to effectively provide its students the support needed. During the assessment phase, a wide variety of rich data collected during the previous phases will be collected and analyzed. This allows PRDE to identify areas of strength and areas in need of improvement within and across programs and divisions. The Island of Puerto Rico is composed of seven unique and extremely diverse educational regions. Therefore, the readjustment phase of the cycle will empower each region to modify practices according to the unique needs of the students, staff, and community, to meet on going and changing needs. Over the course of the next three years, the SMARTS Integrated System of Support will be systematically implemented, to address student and educator needs in a strategic and targeted manner, as well as create a culture of growth and continuous improvement. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 69 ii. How the evidence- based interventions will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to determine the impact of lost instructional time ; and Student groups who were disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 will be prioritized for learning loss interventions based on their needs identified by student data and throug h the analysis performed in the multi- year cycle. Student data will include, but not be limited to, diagnostic data, statewide assessment data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and school climate data. PRDE will provides additional support for students with disabilities, Spanish language learners, economically disadvantaged students, students experiencing homelessness, and students struggling in the traditional classroom setting through multiple federal and state programs and will supplement these supports with ARP ESSER -funded interventions , through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support. These interventions include a comprehensive summer program targeting these subgroups of students and mobile and community outreach to provide academic supports and wraparound services within the communities of need. Funds will be prioritized to provide evidence -based interventions for underperforming students of identified subgroups based on complex area data to addre ss academic, social, emotional and mental health needs. PRDE will continue to provide students with devices to ensure equitable access to all learning opportunities and to ensure students have the resources necessary to be successful in school. This will require PRDE to invest resources in systems to ensure student safety, monitor device utilization, and maintain software and hardware. Distance Learning will be leveraged to increase the opportunity to facilitate learning of challenging content and courses, especially for students in rural areas where accessibility may be limited . iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in- person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures. In addition to the aforementioned strategies in reengaging students to in- person learning, PRDE will reach out to families and students who were Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 70 disengaged, c hronically absent or at risk of failing during the 2020 -2021 school year . These students are at greater risk of learning loss due to their lack of participation in online learning and may need intensive student supports to accelerate learning . During distance learning last year and according to the available data, 52% of the students were disengaged during the months of February thru May. During that period 39% of the students enrolled at the end of the year neve r connected to MS Teams sessions, while 13% connected less than 25% of the enrolled time. PRDE will provide essential counseling services to help students with social, emotional, and behavioral support as they readjust to in-person learning on school premises . Engaging family members of students who were chronically absent will allow for a joint ef fort in identifying the supports both the students and their families need to facilitate student success. Comprehensive supports are especially vital for students in middle school w ho are not only struggling with engagement, but are also transitioning from one school to another and adjusting to the cognitive and physical changes of adolescence. 2. Evidence- Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(2) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs, including those that begin in Summer 2021, and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs that address the academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs of students (e.g., providing intensive or high- dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs; PRDE will utilize no less than one (1) percent of the state's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds for summer learning and enrichment programs for Summer 2022. Summer 2021 w as primarily funded with CRRSA ESSER funds . However, PRDE intends to continue with the summer learning programs over the course of the multi- year cycle. The purpose of the Education S ummer initiative is to reinforc e students' academic skills, giving priority to th ose students who may fail the grade in order to reduce failures by 80% due to the challenges face during the COVID-19 pandemi c. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 71 PRDE will hire and contract all the Educational and non -teaching staff necessary to offer dynamic, interactive and flexible learning environments and motivate students to obtain the necessary skills and competencies to increase academic achievement. The Educational Summer initiative includes face- to-face and online modality of classes. PRDE will monitor student data to evaluate the effectiveness of the summer learning and enrichment programs implemented. Student data includes , but is not limited to, diagnostic data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and student feedback. Evaluation of these interventions will occur annually during the multi -year plan. If data determines the success of the intervention, PRDE will proceed with the cycle and address additional needs, as these where identified. If data determines the intervention is an area in need of improvement , PRDE will readjust as needed, in order to effectively provide students with necessary supports. ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3. i.-- viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs; and Student groups who were disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 will have prioritized enrollment for summer learning and enrichment programs based on their needs as identified by student data and the multi -tiered system of support. Student data includes , but is not limited to, diagnostic data, statewide assessment data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and school climate data. PRDE will prioritize summer programs for students who are academically behind, students in transition grades (incoming kindergarten, elementary to middle, middle to hig h, and high school to college or career), and students who are identified with engagement challenges due to the pandemic. Specialized student support programs will be offered to students as appropriate. These summer programs target students with disabilit ies, Spanish language learners, students experiencing homelessness, and students struggling in the traditional classroom setting. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 72 iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019- 2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures. PRDE has communicated with families and students who were disengaged, chronically absent or at risk of failing during the 2020- 2021 school year . These students are at greater risk of learning loss due to their lack of participation in online learning and may need intensive student supports to accelerate learning durin g the summer. PRDE will provide essential counseling services during the summer to help students with social, emotional, and behavioral suppor t as they transition to in-person learning in schools. However, PRDE recognizes that extended summer learning is not sufficient for students who have lost significant instructional time due to absenteeism; thus, learning loss mitigation for students who are disengaged and behind grade level academically will require a multi -year approach to address their academic, social, emotional, and behavioral needs to ensure student success . 3. Evidence- Based Comprehensive Afterschool Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(3) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based comprehensive afterschool programs (including, for example, before -school programming), and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs (e.g., including partnerships with community -based organizations) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs; PRDE will utilize no less than one (1) percent of the state's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds for comprehensive afterschool programs. PRDE will extend its Extended Academic Enhancement initiative, (RAE , per its acronym in Spanish) as an academic recovery s trategy . The purpose is to offer an extended -hour program that includes the following subjects: math, science, Spanish, English, social studies, fine arts or physical education, school health, and occupational programs (as needed). The supervised study program will emphasize reading comprehension skills in Spanish and English using the STEAM educational approach that encourages integrated learning of the disciplines. Schools that do not Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 73 qualify for extended hours services through other federal programs for the same purposes ( ie. 21st Century) will participate in this project. ARP ESSER funds will also be used to continue, expand, or enhance these offerings for complex student cases . Through a mult idisciplinary team, schools will provide additional support to students experiencing chronic absenteeism, health issues, discipline problems, or low academic achievement. To provide the individualized support, a fterschool programs will be held within community learning centers, outside school structures, or even at home if necessary. Schools will identify students that need the most support, either academic, social emotional, or health. The d ata that has been gathered will be then be provided to the Regional Multidisciplinary Team through a formal referral, and together with the host school , will proceed with collaborative development of the student's intervention plan. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 74 PRDE will monitor student data to evaluate the effectiveness of the comprehensive afterschool programs. Student data includes , but is not limited to, diagnostic data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and student feedback. Evaluation of these interventions will occur annually during the multi -year cycle. If data determines success of the intervention, PRDE will proceed with the cycle and address additional needs, as these where identified. If data determines the intervention is an area in need of improvement , PRDE will readjust the intervention in order to effectively provide its students with the necessary support. ii. How the evidence- based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of comprehensive afterschool programming; and Student groups who were disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 will be prioritized for comprehensive afterschool programs based on their needs as identified by student data and the multi -tiered system of support. Additional support will be provided to students experiencing chronic absenteeism, health issues, discipline problems, or low acad emic achievement. Student data includes , but is not limited to, diagnostic data, statewide assessment data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and school climate data. Currently, students with disabilities, Spanish language learners, economically disadvanta ged students, and enrolled students identified for comprehensive support and improvement prioritized eligibility for afterschool programs funded by federal funds. The use of ARP ESSER funds will allow PRDE to prioritize all students who need additional support iii. the extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in-person instruction during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures. PRDE will communicate with families and students who were disengaged, chronically absent or at risk of failing during the 2020- 2021 school year . These students are at greater risk of le arning loss due to their lack of participation in online learning and may need intensive student supports to Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 75 accelerate learning through comprehensive afterschool programs , either at school or through the multidisciplinary intervention team at the communit y centers. 4. Emergency Needs : If the SEA plans to reserve funds for emergency needs under section 2001(f)(4) of the AR P Act to address issues responding to the COVID -19 pandemic, describe the anticipated use of those funds, including the extent to which these funds will build SEA and LEA capacity to ensure students' and staff's health and safety ; to meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs ; and to use ARP ESSER funds to implement evidence-based interventions. PRDE plans to reserve funds to address any emergency needs that may result from the COVID -19 pandemic . ESSER funds are currently being used to build capacity to ensure the health and safety of students and employees is tended to appropriately; meet students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs; and implement evidence -based interventions to mitigate learning loss. Funds will also be used to ensure the continuity of educational services should the impact of the pandemic worsen. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 76 E. Supporting LEAs in Planning for and Meeting Students' Needs The Department recognizes that the safe return to in -person instruction must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students ' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, and by addressing the opportunity gaps that existed before - and were exacerbated by - the pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in developing high-quality plans for LEAs' use of ARP ESSER funds to achieve these objectives. 1. LEA Plans for the Use of ARP ESSER Funds : Describe what the SEA will require its LEAs to include in LEA plans consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements for the use of ARP ESSER funds , how the SEA will require such plans to be made available to the public, and the deadline by which the LEA must submit its ARP ESSER plan (which must be a reasonable timeline and should be within no later than 90 days after receiving its ARP ESSER allocation). The LEA plans must include, at a minimum: i. The extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies that are, to the greatest extent practicable, in line with the most recent CDC guidance, in order to continuously and safely operate schools for in-person learning; ii. How the LEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 20 percent of the LEA's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds) to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence- based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; iii. How the LEA will spend its remaining ARP ESSER funds consistent with section 2001(e) (2) of the ARP Act ; and iv. How the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements , including but not limited to the interventions under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , will respond to the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students, and particularly those students disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including students from low -income families, students of color, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students. As a unitary system, PRDE will fulfill the ARP ESSER requirements of both the SEA and LEA. The PRDE will implement the mitigation strategies described in section B.1.i and the interventions to mitigate learning loss described in section D as the SEA and LEA. Faced with the public health emergency due to the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID -19), the PRDE has established a prevention guidance to provide schools the necessary strategies for the safe operation of schools during the pandemic. The guidance is based on the guidelines of the Centers for the Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) and the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), among others. The Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 77 prevention strategies presented in the guide aims to achieve a safe operation of schools under strict health prevention and mitigation measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission SARS -CoV- 2 on school sites while serving the educational needs of students, children and youth, including those receiving services from the Special Education Program. PRDE proactively collaborates with the Puerto Rico Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on guidance for our schools, and central level. In preparation for the return of more students to in- person learning, the PRDE will continue to diligently monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pande mic. Regardless of the level of transmission of COVID-19 in the community, the CDC has highlighted the consistent and combined implementation of different strategies to prevent its transmission in schools and continue offering face -to-face classes safely. The nine (9) essential prevention strategies are: Get v accinated as soon as you are eligible Universal, correct and mandatory use of masks Maintain physical distancing Use of tests for early identification of cases, clusters and outbreaks Improve classroom ventilation Hand washing and respiratory hygiene Stay home when you are sick and get tested for COVID-19 Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine measures Cleaning and disinfection of school buildings Despite careful planning and consistent implementation of prevention, there are situatio ns in which the temporary closure of a school or parts of a school (such as a class, a cohort, or a grade) for classes face- to-face proceeds . These decisions will be made jointly by the officials of the Health Department and the PRDE, after careful consideration of various factors and with an emphasis on ensuring the health and well -being of students, their families, teachers and school staff. In such cases, schools should do their best to continue classes through synchronous remote learning or home activities. To improve ventilation, schools must increase fresh air circulation from the outside. Fresh air intake reduces contaminants in closed spaces. PRDE's guidance also states to use window fans, with child restraint systems, to increase the effectiveness of open windows. The fan should be fixed in a window to remove potentially contaminated air and allow fresh air to enter. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 78 In those cases wh ere windows don't function properly, PRDE will proceed on replacing those in order to improve classroom's air ventilation. As mentioned on section A.1 of this state plan, PRDE has worked with the Puerto Rico Department of Health to host massive vaccination campaign for staff, students, and school communities across the island. With the authorization to administer the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine to children who are at least 12 years of age, the PRDE has approximately 46,000 students (eligible for vaccination) that have completed their vaccination doses. The goal is to increase the number of fully vaccinated people on school campuses and in school communities. PRDE has made publicly available all information regarding the procedures and policies adopted to ensure the safe return to in -person instruction on its webpage: https://de.pr.gov/ prior to the 2020- 2021 school year and continuously has updated the guidance as necessary, as recently as in July 2021. In relation to how the unitary system will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, e xtended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; PRDE will do so by extending those initiatives described in section D.1.i and ii. However, it is important to highlight that through the ongoing consultation that PRDE plans to follow, this state plan is considered a live document. All strategies, here included (section E), are subject to modifications, if our school community such requires it. In addition, PRDE may identify and develop other strategies to help support the students. Any other strategy, not included in this state plan, will be presented to USDE for approval and proceed with an amendment process of the Puerto Rico's ARP ES SER State Plan. Through a collaborative network and coherent plan, PRDE will effectively implement the abovementioned evidence-based interventions. Schools will be part of the planning of the multi -year cycle. Having a continuous improvement mindset, opportunities will be constantly created to assess ongoing needs, trying new strategies, and making necessary adjustments. PRDE fully intends to support students in achieving accelerated learning rates so that students are meeting grade and/or content - level standards. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 79 The coherent plan will begin with the review and analysis of data, community input and research on evidence -based practices to address lost instructional time and close performance gaps. Regional Educational Offices and Schools will be supported through the following initiatives: (Please note, details of these initiatives are included in section D.1.i) High -Impact tutoring High quality instructional materials HyFlex Classroom Healthy environments at Classrooms Professional learning Extended school day Summer learning programs Student Growth Incentive Social, emotional, and mental health supports The SMARTS (Students, M easurable, Accelerated, Relevant, Teachers, and S ocioemotional and health) Integrated System of Support is embedded in the multi -year plan. Through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support, PRDE will be able to address the abovementioned student's academic, social emotional or health needs. As mentioned in section D.1.i, the multi -year planning cycle is necessary for PRDE to provide effective support, by starting with the planning, that will lead to the intervention, followed by an evaluation or monitoring of the support provided, complete an assessment of the outcome, and readjust the planning, accordingly. The SMARTS System of Support will continue through 2024 when the goals of ARP ESSER III funds are met . Please refer to section D.1.i, for specific details of the six phases included in the multi- year cycle. For the next three years, the SMARTS Integrated System of Support will be used as a structure for continuous planning and responding to address student and teacher's needs. The cycle will also support the most impacted groups of students with an individual academic improvement plan, if necessary. PRDE will evaluate the impact of each of these interventions, with qualitative data, including stakeholder feedback, in order to assist schools in determining next steps. Other quantitative metrics will include those that indicate changes to the learning environment such as results of school climate surveys, hours of Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 80 mental health services provided, and percent of students receiving social emotional support. Evaluation of these interventions will occur each year during the multi -year cycle. If the intervention worked, PRDE will proceed with the cycle and address additional needs, as these where identified; if not, PRDE will readjust the intervention in order to effectively provide its students the support needed. Student groups who were disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 will be prioritized for learning loss interventions based on their needs identified by student data and through the analysis performed in the multi- year cycle. Student data will include, but not be limited to, diagnostic data, statewide assessment data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and school climate data. PRDE will provides additional support for students with disabilit ies, Spanish language learners, economically disadvantaged students, students experiencing homelessness, and students struggling in the traditional classroom setting through multiple federal and state programs and will supplement these supports with ARP ESSER -funded interventions, through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support. These interventions include comprehensive summer programming targeting these subgroups of students and mobile and community outreach to provide academic supports and wraparound services within the communities of need. Funds will be prioritized to provide evidence -based interventions for underperforming students of identified subgroups based on complex area data to address academic, social, emotional and mental health needs. PRDE will continue to provide students with devices to ensure equitable access to all learning opportunities and to ensure students have the resources necessary to be successful in school. This will require PRDE to invest resources in systems to ensure student safety, device -use moni toring, and maintenance of software and hardware. Distance Learning will be leveraged to facilitate the learning of challenging content and courses, especially for students in remote rural areas where offerings may be limited at the home school. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 81 2. LEA Consultation: Describe how the SEA will, in planning for the use of ARP ESSER funds, ensure that , consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements ], its LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to: i. students; ii. families; iii. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and iv. teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions. The LEA must also engage in meaningful consultation with each of the following to the extent present in or served by the LEA: i. Tribes; ii. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and iii. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. The description must also include how the SEA will ensure that LEAs provide the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the LEA's plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds and take such input into account. Consultation efforts described in section C.1 applies to PRDE as a unit ary system. Please refer to the abovementioned section for details over consultation efforts. Survey results have been included in appendix E. PRDE distributed online surveys related to the ARP ESSER plan to all stakeholders. 5,944 questionnaires from parents, teachers, students from the 8 th grade and 12th grade, representatives of civil organizations, stakeholders representing children with disabilities, Spanish learners, children experiencing homelessness, children in foster care, and incarcerated ch ildren. Another 11,442 surveys were answered by students from 1 st grade and 7th grade, 2 surveys were answered by non- for-profit organizations, and 559 surveys were answered by school leaders, superintendents, and charter school leaders. While PRDE attempted to receive input from all stakeholder groups, none was received related specifically to unions. From the beginning of the pandemic, PRDE has maintained focus on collaboration and consultation with many stakeholder groups. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 82 As a summary of the input received from stakeholders, PRDE identified that it was overwhelmingly aligned to the stated prioritization and needs around learning acceleration and mental health. As a SEA, PRDE requested its School Educational Regions (ORE's) to provide a list of what they understand would be the most relevant initiatives to address the academic acceleration and social emotional needs. Results of this SEA consultatio n were included in section C.1 of this document for it responded to our SEA consultation. PRDE will conduct ongoing meaningful engagement with stakeholders. The Department will continue to develop a comprehensive set of strategies for the ARP ESSER funds in the coming months using feedback from ongoing engagement and consultation with the US Department of Education. PRDE has also posted a draft of its ARP ESSER plan on the PRDE website for any member of the public to provide feedback from September 10 th - 20th, 2021. A s of the date this state plan was submitted to USDE, PRDE has received 70 comments. All comments received were analyzed. PRDE identified that 34% of the comments stated the urgency to improve school's infrastructure and classroom conditions, including the purchase of 21 st Century technology for the classrooms. Another 23% of the comments stated that PRDE needs to reinforce the academic, psychological and health support within schools due to the pandemic of COVID -19, as to providing the alternative of mode of instruction, screening testing, and reducing school hours. A 11% of comments stated the urgency to increase salary and provide additional incentives to the school personnel due to the work performed during the pandemic. This was followed by a 9% of the comments which stated that PRDE needs to provide teachers with better instructional materials. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 83 The input received will inform how PRDE will prioritize the use of ARP ESSER funds as it plans for the return of students to its school campuses and the implementation of educational opportunities to reengage students and accelerate learning to increase student achievement. It is important to highlight that through the ongoing consultation that PRDE plans to follow, this state plan is considered a live document. All strategies, here included (section D and E), are subject to modifications, if our school community such requires it. In addition, PRDE may identify and develop other strategies to help support the students. A ny other strategy, not included in this state plan, will be presented to USDE for approval and proceed with an amendment process of the Puerto Rico's ARP ESSER State Plan. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 84 3. Describe how the SEA will support and monitor its LEA s in using ARP ESSER funds . The description must include: i. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs' implementation of evidence -based interventions that respond to students' academic, social, emotion al, and mental health needs , such as through summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs - including the extent to which the SEA will collect evidence of the effectiveness of interventions employed; ii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in specifically addressing the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.- viii; and iii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in using ARP ESSER funds to identify, reengage, and support students most likely to have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, such as: 1. Students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years; 2. Students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures; and 3. Students most at-risk of dropping out of school. In order to support and monitor schools in implementation of evidence-based interventions that address disproportionate impact of the pandemic on groups of students, the department will continue to collect disaggregated data to include, but not limited to, data from interim and annual statewide assessments, attendance, discipline, social worker reports, and a variety of surveys related to school climate and social emotional aspects. PRDE will analyze the abovementioned data from the student's groups who most likely have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning , including each of the student groups listed in question A.3.i.- viii. PRDE is investing in supporting the use of and access to high-quality interim assessments to support schools' efforts to continue close monitoring of student progress and targeted interventions. PRDE will continue integrating training on how ESSER funds may be used to implement interventions that respond to students' needs. External Monitoring: PRDE is currently working with a procurement competitive process to select an adequate external vendor to perform monitoring and program review professional services. For ESSER I, II, and III funds, as an additional internal control, PRDE will contract a firm with experience in auditing, monitoring and/or program review of federal grants, to have an external point of view and experts on Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 85 the filed evaluating the procedures performed related to these emergency grants. Both parties (P RDE and the external evaluator) will agree to perform a risk analysis in order to prioritize the evaluation of implementation of these federal programs at schools and PRDE offices (LEA and SEA levels). Once a representative sample of schools and initiatives are selected, desk monitoring and visits to locations will take place. After visits and desk monitoring are completed, PRDE will request the noncompliance reports and identification of findings, to follow -up and ensure the Corrective Action Plans (CAP) required are implemented or followed, accordingly. The vendor and PRDE SEA level program will follow up to the CAP . 4. Describe the extent to which the SEA will support its LEAs in implementing additional strategies for taking educational equity into account in expending ARP ESSER funds, including but not limited to: i. Allocating funding both to schools and for districtwide activities based on student need, and ii. Implementing an equitable and inclusive return to in- person instruction. An inclusive return to in-person instruction includes, but is not limited to, establishing policies and practices that avoid the over -use of exclusionary discipline measures (including in - and out -of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students. Educational equity means that every student has access to the educational resources and rigor they need at the right moment in their education across race, gender, ethnicity, language, disability, sexual orientation, family background, and/or family income, including socioeconomic status. Different communities, families and students experience the effects of the pandemic in different ways, requiring schools to in tur n differentiate responses based on need. It is for this reason that schools and their academic, social emotional and health personnel are required to provide detailed student information, in order for PRDE to register it by student subgroup and better ide ntify their specific needs. To the extent possible, the detailed description should include the academic impact of lost instructional time, chronic absenteeism, student engagement, and social- emotional well-being. Through the specific and detailed student data, including student discipline and suspension data, is that PRDE will be able to monitor, evaluate and refine the strategies and interventions implemented. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 86 Extensive supports and services will be provided throughout the academic year in order to reengage students in learning and to help them develop appropriate behaviors and social- emotional competencies. PRDE is committed to providing support to guide Regional Educational Offices and schools toward the strategic and effective use of funds to ens ure students get the most learning advantage as schools fully recover from the COVID- 19 pandemic. Targeted and equitable use of resources is a significant component of closing gaps in students' success among highest needs students' groups. Return to in -person learning . PRDE understands that in- person instruction is very much needed. For this reason, for the new academic year, all 860 schools were given the option to provide in- person, hybrid or full virtual instruction for the 261,485 students that are enrolled as of today. 770 schools are opting for the onsite instruction (100% face- to-face instruction), while other 31 schools are offering a virtual option, in which students attend full -time off -site (either synchronous or asynchronous) and utilize technology resources for instruction. And a remaining 59 schools are providing the hybrid learning option, by providing students a combined virtual and on-site instruction and utilize a combination of resources. Policies and practices that avoid the over -use of exclusionary discipline measures. PRDE included provisions in the Special E ducation Contingency Plan (2020) for Special Education students with maladaptive problem behavior. A student with maladaptive behavior is considered to be those experiencing tantrums, spitting, scratching, pulling hair, getting outside of the classroom, aggression, self-harm, among others. For these students, the Auxiliary Secretariat of Special Education (SAEE, per its acronym in Spanish) established that the Programming and Locating Committee (COMPU, per its acronym in Spanish) identifies the triggers for these behaviors. The Committee will establish a crisis management protocol within the classroom and an instructional plan that can ensure student health and safety. This provision is aligned to what the IDEA Act establishes : the education of students with disabilities will take place, to the greatest extent possible, in regular classrooms and that a more restrictive placement alternative will only be considered when the impact of the disability is such that, even with modifications, adaptations , supplementary and related services the student is unable to progress academically. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 87 F. Supporting the Educator Workforce The Department recognizes the toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has taken on the Nation's educators as well as students. In this section, SEAs will describe strategies for supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce and for making staffing decisions that will support students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. 1. Supporting and Stabilizing the Educator Workforce : i. Describe the extent to which the State is facing shortages of educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools, and the extent to which they vary by region/type of school district and/or groups of educators (e.g., special educators and related services personnel and paraprofessionals; bilingual or English as a second language educators; science, technology, engineering, and math (\"STEM\") educators; career and technical education (\"CTE\") educators; early childhood educators). Cite specific data on shortages and needs where available. PRDE has identified multiple areas of shortages in the educator workforce (teaching and student support) which are identified in Table F1. For this analysis, shortage of full -time equivalent (FTE) is defined as the number of educators whose credentials are not aligned with their current placement. To determine shortage areas, teaching areas are ranked by the percentage of courses with teachers lacking aligned credentials to the relevant subject area, grade level or student population. Student support areas are ranked by the percent of the statewide full -time equivalent positions currently filled without the appropriate credential. Complete the table below, changing or adding additional rows as needed, or provide a narrative description. Table F1. Area Data on shortages and needs FTE (full-time equiv. %) Special educators and related service personnel and paraprofessionals 1,296 4.61 Bilingual educators 252 .85 English as a second language educators 899 3.26 STEM educators 411 1.36 CTE educators* 16 Not available Early childhood educators 53 .10 School counselors** 42 .11 Social workers** 64 .17 Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 88 * Health and behavioral health professionals (Schools Counselors and Social workers). PRDE will need to recruit additional personnel in order to effectively implement the SMARTS Integrated System of Support that is embedded within the multi -year plan. PRDE will perform an assessment in order to identify the specific number of counselors an d social workers that are deemed necessary. The assessment will not only cover the above FTE shortage, but also the additional number required to effectively implement the SMARTS Integrated System of Support. ** Career Technical Education. The Career and Technical Program experienced an increase in retirements of its occupational teachers due to the lack of skillful knowledge in technological equipment. PRDE will perform an assessment to update the above number of FTE shortage reported to USDE. The above table provides data on identified shortages area at the PRDE. On February 18, 2021, PRDE submitted to USDE the fiscal year 2019-2020 data over its Teacher Shortage Area. However, additional information regarding non -teaching personnel that would provide social, emotional and health support to students; and administrative personnel that need to assigned to work at schools and Educational Regional Offices is described below to provide more context on workforce needs and ongoing efforts to address those concerns. School Nurses. PRDE hired, and plans to continue recruiting school nurses throughout its schools to maintain and monitor health services for students aimed at prevention, preparedness and response to the challenges we continue to face as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. For the previous and current academic year, PRDE used ESSER I fund to recruit nurses to perform physical evaluation in the school community, both for students and for the faculty. However, PRDE expects that the service that is being provided to our students, will continue to be in the foreseeable academic years. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to recruit 429 school nurses for the effective implementation of the SMARTS Integrated Support System for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years. School Psychologists. PRDE hired, and plans to continue recruiting psychologists to provide early intervention services, supports, and related services to students during the pandemic situation. The purpose of hiring psychologists is to address the students' socio- emotional ne eds caused during distance education schools' offerings and continues to have during the in -person instruction modality. Even though, PRDE has already recruited psychologists for the previous and current academic year, PRDE expects that the service that is being provided to our students, will continue to be needed in the foreseeable academic years. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to recruit 116 additional school psychologists to effectively implement the SMARTS Integrated Support System for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years. Educational Therapist. During the planning phase of the SMARTS Integrated System of Support, schools will be able to identify students who Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 89 are experiencing learning disorders, or attention problems that make learning unusually difficult. Once a child's learning challenges are identified, an educational therapist will provide academic support to help the student develop the skills he or she is missing, and on devising learning strategies that build on her strengths and compensa te for her weaknesses. PRDE will use ARP ESSER III funds to recruit educational therapist needed to effectively implement the SMARTS Integrated System of Support. School leaders: School Directors, Assistant Director, Teacher leaders, and other school staf f. As evidenced in the data collected from the surveys and focus groups, there is consensus concerning the supports that Directors need at schools. As of today, PRDE has identified dozens of schools lacking a School Director. Within the surveys, School Di rectors stated the urgent need to recruit Assistant Directors, Teacher leaders, and other school staff to assist them in performing academic and administrative tasks. The PRDE Alternate Education Program also stated a need of Auxiliary Administrative perso nnel for its Juvenile Institutions. PRDE will perform an assessment to identify the specific need in each school in order to recruit necessary personnel. Administrative and Academic personnel at the Regional Educational Offices (OREs, per its acronym in Spanish). As evidenced in the data collected from the surveys and focus groups, there is consensus concerning the supports that OREs need. Within the surveys, Superintendents stated the urgent need to recruit additional Superintendents, Auxiliar y Superintendents, Academic and Special Education facilitators, IT personnel, administrative personnel, Procurement personnel, and other office personnel in order to assist them in performing the administrative tasks. PRDE will perform an assessment to ide ntify the specific need in each ORE in order to recruit necessary personnel. ii. Describe how the SEA will assist its LEAs in identifying the most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages, with particular plans for individual LEAs facing the most sig nificant needs (e.g., by avoiding layoffs, providing high-quality professional learning opportunities, and addressing the impact of stress or trauma on educators). Include a description of how other Federal COVID- 19 funding (e.g., ESSER and GEER funds unde r the CARES Act and CRRSA Act) have already been used to avoid layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic. PRDE will held an assessment in schools and at the Regional Educational Offices to identify the most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages. Certification and Recertification. As a way to address areas of shortage or potential shortages, the PRDE officially signed a partnership with the Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 90 University of Puerto Rico to offer opportunities to current teachers in grades PreK -12 to earn graduate school credit hours - at no cost to them, and achieve a certification or recertification in the area or subject it teaches. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to extend this strategy to offer courses in other universities and colleges. PRDE's certification and recertification process is also a way on how PRDE has used funding to avoid layoffs. Professional Development Organizational System . On September 27, 2021 PRDE plans to launch the Professional Development Organizational System , a platform envisioned to be used as a system for data driven decision making, collection of targeted professional development information, identifying personnel readiness and, target state provided supports and technical assistance. In addition, the platform will provide a variety of professional learning sessions and support to all school staff and PRDE personnel on how to access and accelerate student learning. The Professional Development platform will also allow self -service, interactive training sessions with on- demand resources available to all educators and administrative staff. The Professional Development platform will allow PRDE to identify the most urgent areas of shortages. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 91 iii. Describe the actions the SEA will take to fill anticipated gaps in certified teachers for the start of the 2021- 2022 school year and to what extent the SEA will further support its LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity while addressing the immediate needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (e.g., recruiting teaching candidates to provide high- dosage tutoring or implementing residencies for teacher candidates). Certification and Recertification. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to extend this strategy (explained in detail above) to offer courses in other universities and colleges. Professional Development Organizational System . The Professional Development Organizational System (explained in detail above) will provide relevant data that will allow PRDE to identify anticipated gaps in certified teachers before the academic year. Retention strategy. PRDE plans to use ARP ESSER funds to provide a one-time paid -leave license to quali fied personnel that will help PRDE address its most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages. Those who complete the certification or recertification process, through the one -time paid-leave license, will be required to sign a 5 -year commitment to teach that particular subject matter in PRDE. This strategy also contributes to a more professional workforce, which is so needed in the educational field. Bonus and Salary increase for permanent, probatory and transitory employees . PRDE also plans on using ARP ESSER funds to further compensate staff who continues to shows a high sense of responsibility during the pandemic and support s the continuity of the services and the educational process . However, thru the various consultation processes that were performed , PRDE repeatedly identif ied the urgen cy to also address salary increase. Therefore, this will be further analyzed and considered as an indirect retention strategy. PRDE understands that further shortage s may arrive if it doesn't address this need. Both of these strategies will help PRDE on minimizing the effect we are experiencing; more teachers and school personnel leaving the public system. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 92 2. Staffing to Support Student Needs : Describe the extent to which the SEA has developed or will develop strategies and will support its LEAs in increasing student access to key support staff within school buildings, including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social workers, and psychologists (e.g. hiring additional personnel or freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students). Is through a collaborative network and coherent plan, that PRDE will effectively increas e student access to key support staff within school buildings, including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social workers, and psychologists. Schools will be part of the planning of a multi -year cycle that will allow PRDE to achieve a continuous improvement mindset, create constant opportunities to assess ongoing needs, trying new strategies, and making necessary adjustments. The coherent plan will begin with the review and analysis of data, community input and research on evidence -based practices to address lost instructional ti me and close performance gaps. Regional Educational Offices and Schools will be supported through the following initiatives: (Please note, details of these initiatives are included in section D.1.i) High -Impact tutoring High quality instructional materials HyFlex Classroom Healthy environments at Classrooms Professional learning Extended school day Summer learning programs Student Growth Incentive Social, emotional, and mental health supports The SMARTS (Students, M easurable, Accelerated, Relevant, Teachers, and Socioemotional and health) Integrated System of Support is embedded in the multi- year plan. Through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support, PRDE will be able to address the abovementioned student's academic, social emotional, or health needs. As mentioned in section D.1.i, t he multi- year planning cycle is necessary for PRDE to provide effective support, by starting with the planning, that will lead to the intervention, followed by an evaluation or monitoring of the support provided, complete an assessment of the outcome, and readjust the planning, accordingly. The SMARTS System of Support will continue through 2024 when the goals of Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 93 ARP ESSER III funds are met. Please refer to section D.1.i, for specific det ails of the six phases included in the multi- year cycle. For the next three years, the SMARTS Integrated System of Support will be used as a structure for continuous planning and responding to address student and teacher's needs. The cycle will also supp ort the most impacted groups of students with an individual academic improvement plan, if necessary. PRDE will evaluate the impact of each of these interventions, with qualitative data, including stakeholder feedback, in order to assist schools in determining next steps. Other quantitative metrics will include those that indicate changes to the learning environment such as results of school climate surveys, hours of mental health services provided, and percent of students receiving social emotional support. Evaluation of these interventions will occur each year during the multi -year cycle. If the intervention worked, PRDE will proceed with the cycle and address additional needs, as these where identified; if not, PRDE will readjust the intervention in order to effectively provide its students the support needed. Student groups who were disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 will be prioritized for learning loss interventions based on their needs identified by student data and through the analysis performed in the multi -year cycle. Student data will include, but not be limited to, diagnostic data, statewide assessment data, student attendance data, quantitative and qualitative student performance data, and school climate data. PRDE will provides additional support for students with disabilities, Spanish language learners, economically disadvantaged students, students experiencing homelessness, and students struggling in the traditional classroom setting through multiple federal and state programs and will supplement these supports with ARP ESSER -funded interventions, through the SMARTS Integrated System of Support. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 94 G. Monitoring and Measuring Progress The Department recognizes that transparency on how ARP ESSER funds are used and their impact on the Nation's education system is a fundamental responsibility of Federal, State, and local government. In this section, SEAs will describe how they are building capacity at the SEA and LEA levels to ensure high-quality data collection and reporting and to safeguard funds for their intended purposes. 1. Capacity for Data Collection and Reporting: It is important for an SEA to continuously monitor progress and make adjustments to its strategies, as well as to support its LEAs in making adjustments to LEA strategies, based on impact. Describe how the SEA will ensure its capacity and the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on reporting requirements, including but not limited to the examples of reporting requirem ents described in the SEA's Grant Award Notification (listed in Appendix B). Describe the SEA's capacity and strategy to collect data from its LEAs (disaggregated by student group, where applicable), to the greatest extent practicable, including any steps the SEA will take to build its capacity in the future (which may include the use of ARP ESSER and other Federal COVID-19 pandemic funds at the SEA and LEA levels), on issues that may include the following: i. Student learning, including the academic impact of lost instructional time during the COVID-19 pandemic; ii. Opportunity to learn measures (e.g., chronic absenteeism; student engagement; use of exclusionary discipline; access to and participation in advanced coursework; access to technology, including educator access to professional development on the effective use of technology; access to high-quality educators; access to school counselors, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists; and results from student, parent, and/or educator surveys); iii. Fiscal data that is comparable across the State (e.g., per -pupil expenditures at the LEA and school levels); iv. Jobs created and retained (by position type); v. Participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources (e.g., summer and afterschool programs); and vi. Other reporting requirements reasonably required by the Secretary (please refer to Appendix B of this template; final requirements will be issued separately). PRDE will acquire a platform that provides the mechanism to register students' attendance both in present and remote learning. Also, to identify students using a code identification card to register attendance electronically and promote location monitoring while using school transportation services; and provide efficient and modern communication betw een student parents and school staff. The new Student Information System will ensure PRDE's capacity and the capacity of our schools to collect data on reporting requirements. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 95 In order to support and monitor schools in implementation of the abovementione d evidence -based interventions, that will address disproportionate impact of the pandemic on groups of students, PRDE will continue to collect disaggregated data to include, but not limited to, data from interim and annual statewide assessments, attendance, discipline, social worker reports, and a variety of surveys related to school climate and social emotional aspects. It is for this reason that schools and their academic, social emotional and health personnel are required to provide detailed student information, in order for PRDE to register it by student subgroup and better identify their specific needs. To the extent possible, the detailed description should include the academic impact of lost instructional time, chronic absenteeism, student engagement, and social- emotional well-being. Through the specific and detailed student data, including student discipline and suspension data, is that PRDE will be able to monitor, evaluate and refine the strategies and interventions implemented. Extensive supports and services will be provided throughout the academic year in order to reengage students in learning and to help them develop appropriate behaviors and social- emotional competencies. PRDE will analyze the data from the student's groups who most likely have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, including each of the student groups listed in question A.3.i.- viii. PRDE is investing in supporting the use of and access to high-quality interim assessments to support schools' efforts to continue close monitoring of student progress and targeted interventions. 2. Monitoring and Internal Controls : Describe how the SEA will implement appropriate fiscal monitoring of and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds (e.g., by updating the SEA's plan for monitoring funds and internal controls under the CARES and CRRSA Acts; addressing potential sources of waste, fraud, and abuse; conducting random audits; or other tools). In this response, please describe the SEA's current capacity to monitor ARP ESSER; steps, if needed, to increase capacity; and any foreseeable gaps in capacity, including how the SEA will provide its LEAs with tec hnical assistance in the anticipated areas of greatest need. PRDE is currently working with a procurement competitive process to select an adequate external vendor to perform monitoring and program review professional services. Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 96 For ESSER I, II, and III f unds, as an additional internal control, PRDE will contract a firm with experience in auditing, monitoring and/or program review of federal grants, to have an external point of view and experts on the filed evaluating the procedures performed related to these emergency grants. Both parties (PRDE and the external evaluator) will agree to perform a risk analysis in order to prioritize the evaluation of implementation of these federal programs at schools and PRDE offices (LEA and SEA levels). Once a representative sample of schools and initiatives are selected, desk monitoring and visits to locations will take place. After visits and desk monitoring are completed, PRDE will request the noncompliance reports and identification of findings. PRDE will proceed on ensuring the Corrective Action Plans required are implemented or followed, accordingly. The vendor and PRDE SEA level program will follow up to the Corrective Action Plans.

The SEA will conduct all its operations so that no person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under the ARP ESSER program or activity based on race, color, national origin, which includes a person's limited English proficiency or English learner status and a person's actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics; sex; age; or disability. These non-discrimination obligations arise under Federal civil rights laws, including but not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. In addition, the SEA must comply with all regulations, guidelines, and standards issued by the Department under any of these statutes; 2. The SEA will comply with all ARP Act and other ARP ESSER requirements and all requirements of its Grant Award Notification, including but not limited to: a. Complying with the maintenance of effort provision in section 2004(a)(1) of the ARP Act, absent a waiver by the Secretary pursuant to section 2004(a )(2) of the ARP Act ; and b. Complying with the maintenance of equity provisions in section 2004(b) of the ARP Act , and ensuring its LEAs comply with the maintenance of equity provision in section 2004(c) of the ARP Act (please note that the Department will provide additional guidance on maintenance of equity shortly); 3. The SEA will allocate ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the SEA recei ves ARP ESSER funds (i.e., 60 days from the date the SEA receives each portion of its ARP ESSER funds). An SEA that is not able to allocate such funds within 60 days because it is not practicable (e.g., because of pre-existing State board approval requirements) will provide an explanation to the Department within 30 days of receiving each portion of its ARP ESSER funds (submitted via email to your Program Officer at [State].OESE@ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov)), including a description of specific actions the SEA is taking to provide ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and the SEA's expected timeline for doing so; 4.

SEAs should consider ensuring a standardized URL format in all cases (e.g., xxx.gov/COVIDplan). Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 102 Appendix D : GEPA OMB Control No. 1894-0005 (Exp. 06/30/2023) NOTICE TO ALL APPLICANTS The purpose of this enclosure is to inform you about a new provision in the Department of Educations General Education Provisions Act ( \"GEPA\" ) that applies to applicants for new gr ant awards under Department programs. This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103-382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new gran t awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State -formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State - level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally-assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access to, or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve high standards. Consistent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following examples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, Puerto Rico ARP ESSER State Plan 103 among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. (4) An applicant that proposes a project to increase school safety might describe the special efforts it will take to address concern s of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students, and efforts to reach out to and involve the fami lies of LGBT students. We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in responding to the requirements of this provision.
