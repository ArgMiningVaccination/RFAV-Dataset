Stevenson, MD; John W. McMahon, Sr, MD; Jan Harris, MSHA, CHE; J. Richard Hillman, MD; Steven D. Helgerson, MD, MPH OBJECTIVE: To evaluate collaborative efforts and inter- vention strategies by peer-review organizations (PROs) and long-term-care facilities (LTCFs) for improving pneumococcal vaccina-tion rates among residents of LTCFs. DESIGN: Prospective, before-after quality improvement project. SETTING: 133 LTCFs in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. PATIENTS: All residents of participating LTCFs. METHODS: Baseline pneumococcal vaccination rates were determined by medical-record review, self-reporting bypatient or family members, and review of Medicare claims infor-mation. Remeasurement of vaccination rates was accomplishedfrom documentation of vaccination of eligible residents by eachLTCF . RESULTS: 133 LTCFs with 7,623 residents from Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming participated in this quality-improvement project. This accounted for 41% (133/321) of the potential nursing homes and resident population in the participatingstates. Baseline overall vaccination rates were 40% (3,050/7,589).The overall vaccination rate improved to 75% (5,720/7,623, P<.001). The number of facilities meeting the Healthy People 2000 vaccina-tion goal of 80% improved from 18% (24/133) to 62% (83/133,P<.001). Initial use of chart stickers and implementation of stand- ing orders led to similar increases in vaccination rates, but thestanding-order strategy required commitment of fewer PROresources at a statewide level. Remeasurement of vaccination ratesin a subset of participating Idaho LTCFs 1 year after initial vacci-nation efforts demonstrated a sustained vaccination rate of 70% infacilities enforcing a standing-order policy. CONCLUSIONS: Simple and straightforward vaccination strategies implemented in LTCFs over a short period of time canhave a significant impact on vaccination rates. Collaborative effortsbetween state PROs and LTCFs enhance implementation of thesestrategies and can result in the achievement of national vaccinationobjectives. Standing orders appear to be one intervention effectivein sustaining successful vaccination efforts. Regardless of the spe-cific interventions employed, PROs played a significant role infacilitating vaccination program development and meningitis), complicated local infec-tions (empyema, endocarditis), and death. 1At highest risk are infants, the elderly, and persons with certainunderlying medical conditions. It is the most common cause of pneumonia in long-term-care facilities (LTCFs). 2 Several outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia amongunvaccinated residents in LTCFs have been reported inrecent years, including outbreaks due to multidrug- resistant organisms. 3-5Although evidence on the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in preventing pneumonia isinconclusive, 6-8the currently available vaccine has docu- mented efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal dis-ease in older persons. 9-12 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends pneumococcal immunization for allpersons aged /H1109165 years, and others at increased risk for From PRO-West (Dr. Stevenson), Boise, Idaho; Mountain-Pacific Quality Health Foundation (Drs.

Increasing pneumococcal vaccination rates among res idents of long-term-care facilities: provider-based improvement strategies implemented by peer-review organizations in four western state s. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2000;21:705-710.ABSTRACT706 INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY November 2000 pneumococcal disease.1The Healthy People 2000 goal is a pneumococcal vaccination rate of 60% for those 65 or olderand 80% for those residing in LTCFs. 13Despite this, only 45.5% of all persons aged /H1109165 years and less than one half of nursing home residents have been immunized against pneu-mococcal disease. 14,15 Despite the high risk of long-term-care residents and recent emphasis on improving their vaccination status,there are relatively few studies describing vaccination poli-cies, practices, and strategies affecting these individuals. 16-18 A recent study concluded that \"many long-term-care facili-ties have inadequate policies and practices for ensuringtheir residents and employees immunity to important vac-cine preventable diseases.\" 16In hospitals, systems approaches that incorporate administrative and organiza-tional strategies to promote convenient access to vaccina-tion, rather than education of providers alone, appear toproduce durable success. 19It is reasonable to assume sim- ilar success could be achieved in LTCFs. Furthermore, theACIP recently has strongly recommended the use of stand-ing orders in LTCFs as an effective intervention to improvevaccination rates. 20 Title XI of the Social Security Act, Part B, as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982, established theUtilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization, orPRO program. The PRO program is charged with improvingthe quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries by assuring thattheir care meets professionally recognized standards. Eachstate has a physician-led quality-improvement organization(PRO) with Medicare contracts responsible for a multitude ofquality-improvement efforts involving hospitals and otherhealthcare facilities. These efforts have led to the develop-ment of cooperative networks designed to improve the deliv-ery of healthcare quality. We describe successful collaborative efforts by PROs and LTCFs in four western states (Alaska, Idaho, Montana,and Wyoming) to increase pneumococcal vaccination ratessignificantly among LTCF residents. Furthermore, we dis- cuss the vaccination strategies employed by each PRO thatappear useful in enhancing vaccination rates among thishigh-risk population. METHODS Each state PRO independently developed interven- tions for improving pneumococcal vaccination in LTCFs.There were, however, many common and shared features,which are summarized in Table 1. Recruitment A packet containing information describing the pro- ject, publications about pneumococcal vaccine and disease,data collection tools, and an invitation to participate weregenerally provided by mail from the PROs to facilities in allstates. A copy of a recently published article describing anoutbreak of multidrug-resistant pneumococcal pneumoniaand bacteremia in unvaccinated nursing home residents 4 was typically included to emphasize the importance of theproposed vaccination program. Information was mailed tofacilities by the PROs in Alaska, Idaho, and Montanabetween June and September 1998. Additionally, the sameinformation regarding the project was provided by the PROdirectly during on-site visits to facilities in Wyoming duringSeptember and October 1998. Participation in the projectwas voluntary in all cases but was accompanied by a signedmemorandum of agreement between the PRO and LTCF toshare confidential patient information. Baseline Measurements Facilities were generally responsible for measuring their own vaccination rates by obtaining self-reported infor-mation from patients or their families and from review ofpatient medical records. Medical-record review for baselinemeasurement was performed by PRO staff in Wyoming andby LTCF staff in other states. Some facilities requested PROTABLE 1 FEATURES OF LONG-TERM-CAREFACILITY VACCINATION PROGRAMS CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITHSTATE PEER-REVIEW ORGANIZATIONS Feature Alaska Idaho Montana Wyoming Mailing introductory information by PROs X X X X On-site introductory information by PROs X Physician direct mailings XX Self-reporting of rates X X X XMedical-chart reviews for rates X XMedicare claims for rate calculations X XStanding orders mailed prior to vaccination project X XStanding orders mailed after vaccination project XChecklist for data collection X Chart stickers with pre-printed physician orders XFacilities administer vaccine X X X XCommunication and support during project X X X XRemeasurement X X X X Abbreviation: PRO, peer-review organization.Vol. 21 No. 11 PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATIONS IN LONG-TERM-CARE 707 assistance with chart review in Alaska. No charts from physi- cian offices were reviewed. The vaccination status of all resi-dents participating in Idaho and several patients in Alaskawas also checked by review of claims information by the PROfor Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare claims information onselected patients in Alaska was reviewed by the PRO only atthe request of some LTCFs. Baseline measurements wereobtained between June and September 1998 for all states. Interventions Each facility was responsible for obtaining and administering vaccine. All facilities followed ACIP guide-lines to determine eligibility for vaccination 1and were encouraged to vaccinate all eligible residents. Subsequentcontacts by the PRO with the LTCFs were made by letteror telephone to encourage continued participation andcompliance. Vaccinations were administered duringOctober and November 1998, with the majority of vaccina-tions administered during October 1998. A schedule for August through October 1998 was developed in all facilities in Alaska, with the assistance ofthe PRO, for conducting initial review of vaccination status,completing a vaccination program, and remeasuring vacci-nation status. The Alaska PRO tailored support to eachfacility based on its situation and needs. Support includededucation, introduction to a menu of potential interven-tions, medical-record reviews, and review of Medicareclaims. Some LTCFs elected to send letters to attendingphysicians to encourage vaccination of their patients. Nospecific interventions, such as standing orders or chartstickers, were uniformly promoted by the PRO to all par-ticipating facilities. Each participating facility in Idaho provided a com- plete list of residents to the PRO during August andSeptember 1998. Their vaccination status was determinedby abstraction of medical records, self-reporting, andreview of claims information as outlined above. A chartsticker indicating the pneumococcal vaccination status wascompleted by the PRO and then placed on the physician'sorder sheet in each patient's medical record of every par-ticipating LTCF . The sticker included a pre-printed physi-cian's order to facilitate easy administration of the vaccineto eligible residents. Reasons for not immunizing particularpatients were documented on the sticker in the medicalrecord and reported back to the PRO automatically on thedata copy of the sticker. Each LTCF in Montana and Wyoming was requested to designate October 1998 as \"Influenza and PneumococcalVaccination Month.\" A letter regarding the usefulness ofstanding orders for pneumococcal vaccination, a standing-orders protocol requiring physician's signature, and aguideline to assist LTCF personnel in gathering data weresent by the PRO to 652 Montana physicians whose nameswere provided by LTCFs as their attending physicians.Similar letters were sent directly to Wyoming attendingphysicians by respective LTCFs. These standing-ordersprotocols in Montana and Wyoming were signed by eachattending physician and returned to the facility. Standingorders for vaccination were typically intended to be used at the time of resident admission and did not require a priorphysician examination. Vaccine could be administered by anurse or pharmacist based on the standing-order protocol. Remeasurement Facilities were responsible for measuring their own subsequent vaccination rates by recording patients whoreceived vaccine as a consequence of this quality-improvement program. These data were forwarded to the respective state PROs, and a summary report outliningimprovements in vaccination rates was returned to all par-ticipating facilities at the conclusion of the project. Montanaand Wyoming facilities were queried at the time of remea-surement about the implementation of the standing orderspreviously provided to all physicians and facilities.Remeasurements were conducted during November andDecember 1998 for all four states. Facilities in Idaho were provided in November 1998 with written sample standing-orders policies after comple-tion of this initial phase of vaccinations. All participatingfacilities were encouraged to implement standing orders inorder to sustain vaccination efforts. Unlike standing ordersin Montana and Wyoming that focused on each physicianreturning a signed standing-order protocol, LTCFs inIdaho were encouraged to develop the facilitywide policy aspart of general admission procedure. Remeasurement wasperformed again in November 1999 for all participatingIdaho facilities, which were queried about the presence orabsence of a standing-orders policy, about whether the pol-icy was enforced, and about the vaccination status of all cur-rent residents. Data Analysis The data were entered into an Access database (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) for analysis. Chi-squaredanalyses comparing baseline and remeasurement propor-tionate vaccination rates were performed using Epi Info(version 6.02; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[CDC], Atlanta, GA). RESULTS Of 321 LTCFs in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, 133 (41%) participated in this quality-improvementproject. State-specific demographic and vaccination infor-mation is summarized in Table 2. The proportion of facili-ties in each state participating in the vaccination effortranged from 16% to 77% (median, 27%). The total baselinevaccination was (3,050/7,589), with a range of 26%to 53% (median, 41.5%) when stratified by state (Table 2). The proportion of residents in all states reported to have a documented pneumococcal vaccination increased to75% (5,720/7,623; range, 69%-84%; median, 74%) after the vac-cination campaign. Overall, 2,670 unvaccinated residentsreceived vaccine during an intervention period lasting only 2to 3 months. There was a statistically significant increase invaccination rates ( P<.001) for all states. The impact of the vaccination program may best be reflected in the change in708 INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY November 2000 median vaccination rates for the facilities. The median facili- ty vaccination rates equaled 85% or higher for three of thestates after the intervention period (Table 2). This is in starkcontrast to baseline measurements, which were generallybelow 50%. The number of facilities exceeding the HealthyPeople 2000 goal of an 80% vaccination rate increased P<.001). Information on failures to vaccinate was available only in Idaho. A sticker was placed on the chart of every eli-gible resident with a pre-printed physician order to facili-tate easy administration of the vaccine to eligible residents.Reasons for not providing the vaccination were document-ed on the sticker and reported back to the PRO. Two hun-dred two eligible LTCF residents (16%) were not vaccinat-ed. Patient or family refusal accounted for 60% of thesefailed vaccination attempts, followed by 26% physicianrefusal. Allergies or unknown reasons accounted for theremainder. Standing orders were distributed in Montana and Wyoming as part of the recruitment process. At the time ofremeasurement, 56 (72%) of 78 of the participatingMontana LTCFs had implemented standing orders. Thereported pneumococcal vaccination rate in the 56 facilitieswith standing orders was 2,625 (83%) of 3,175, whereas therate in the 22 facilities without standing orders was 711(53%) of 1,334. This difference was statistically significant(P<.0001). Two (33%) of six Wyoming facilities reported the presence of standing orders at baseline but stated thatthese were not consistently used. All 6 (100%) Wyomingfacilities had implemented standing orders at the conclu-sion of the project. Very few Idaho LTCFs had written policies or stand- ing orders for pneumococcal vaccination at the beginningof this project. Twenty-nine of 89 facilities completed aquestionnaire regarding pneumococcal vaccination poli-cies prior to initiation of the vaccination campaign. Only 2(7%) of 29 had a written policy concerning pneumococcalvaccination. It is unclear whether these included standingorders. An additional 2 (7%) of 29 stated they had no writ-ten policy but did have a standing order as part of their admission orders. At the conclusion of the vaccinationcampaign, a sample written policy with standing orderswas sent to all LTCFs in Idaho with a recommendationthat these orders be implemented immediately to sustainvaccination efforts as new residents were admitted. In November 1999, 1 year after this initial vaccina- tion project, the participating LTCFs in Idaho werequeried about the presence of a written standing-orderspolicy, whether the policy was enforced, and the vaccina-tion status of the current residents. Nineteen (86%) of theoriginal participating facilities responded to repeat sur-vey. Sixty-three percent (12/19) had written standing-orders policies that were being enforced. Eleven percent(2/19) had written policies, but they had not been execut-ed. The remaining 26% (5/19) had no written standingorders. Remeasurement of vaccination rates demonstrat-ed a sustained vaccination rate of 70% (606/871) in facili-ties enforcing a standing-orders policy compared with 54%(87/161) in those facilities with standing orders but noenforcement and 59% (112 of 191) in those without stand-ing orders ( P<.001 and P=.003). There was no difference between those facilities with written policies withoutenforcement and those without a standing-orders policy(P=.386). Some additional information about documentation of baseline vaccination rates was obtained in Idaho. Of all ofthe documented baseline vaccination information, 47%(274/579) were obtained from review of the facility chartalone. Medicare claims data alone accounted for 27%(155/579) of the documented vaccinations with 7%(42/579) obtained from Medicare claims data and chartreview combined. An additional 19% (108/579) wereobtained from patients or their families reporting receipt ofthe vaccine. Medicare claims review was anticipated to doc-ument close to 100% of vaccinations given but captured only34% of the residents with a documented baseline vaccina-tion. This indicates a significant number of vaccinationsgiven in LTCFs to Medicare beneficiaries are apparentlynot billed to Medicare.

Strategies to enhanceuse of the polysaccharide vaccine have been recommend-ed by the CDC, including age-based, organizational-based, community-based, and provider-based strategies. 1 Residents of LTCFs should be readily available targets for vaccination if the individual facilities implement these basicstrategies. We describe a successful collaborative effort byPROs and LTCFs in four western states to increase pneu-mococcal vaccination rates significantly among LTCF resi-dents by applying these strategies. Baseline vaccination rates in the participating LTCFs were similar to those reported nationally. 15Review of LTCF practices during baseline measurement indicated thateffective vaccination strategies such as standing orders, ifavailable, were being applied inconsistently. Collaborationwith the PRO helped facilities to structure and organizetheir programs to implement effective strategies widely. The strategies used were simple and straightforward and led to significant improvement within a short period oftime. The interventions were performed during Octoberand November 1998. This focused effort resulted in thevaccination of 2,670 LTCF residents from 133 facilities. Themean immunization rate for residents in these facilitiesincreased from 40% at baseline to 75%, and 62% of partici-pating facilities exceeded the Healthy People 2000 goal. 13 The median facility vaccination rates were generally lessthan 50% at baseline but improved to 75% or more after theinterventions. The major intervention in all facilities con-sisted of delivering information about the disease and thevaccine to LTCF staff, physicians, residents, and residentfamilies. In addition, simple tools such as standing-orderforms, data collection checklists, and chart stickers wereprovided to facilitate the vaccination process. Follow-upcommunications by the PROs during the interventionencouraged ongoing vaccinations, and the required finalremeasurement completed the effort in most facilities.PROs played a significant role in facilitating vaccine pro-gram development and intervention implementationregardless of the specific interventions employed. Two intervention tools appeared particularly suc- cessful in promoting this increase in pneumococcal vacci-nation in participating Idaho facilities. Stickers placed onthe front of each patient's chart indicating the need for vac-cination and including a pre-printed physician order formresulted in 99.8% of those residents without contraindica-tions or refusals being immunized. This intervention, how-ever, required significant effort by the PRO to completeand disseminate stickers. The final overall vaccination rateachieved by this intervention was 84%. Standing orders were provided at the beginning of the intervention to all Montana and Wyoming facilities. Thevaccination rate among participating Montana facilities thatreported use of standing orders was 2,625 (83%) of 3,175, or 1.57 times higher than the rate (711/1,334; 53%) amongfacilities that did not report use of standing orders. Lettersdescribing standing orders were sent directly to 652 physi-cians in Montana by the PRO, with similar letters sent toWyoming physicians by LTCFs. This communication prob- ably did not increase the amount of time spent by individualphysicians in the LTCF but probably improved the physi-cian recognition of, and concurrence with, the standing-orders policy. In addition, the efforts to implement standing orders were primarily those of the individual LTCFs andnot the PRO. The final overall vaccination rate achievedwas 83% among facilities that implemented standing orders.Standing orders, an intervention requiring minimal effortby the PRO, achieved an overall vaccination rate compara-ble to that of chart stickers, an intervention requiring amuch greater effort by the PRO. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recently reviewed 118 studies describing interventionsdesigned to improve vaccination coverage in children, ado-lescents, and adults. 21Key findings of this review were that use of standing orders \"improves vaccination coveragewhether used alone or as a part of a multicomponent inter-vention and is effective in settings such as hospitals, clinics,and nursing homes.\" Standing orders are strongly recom-mended for adults by the Task Force. Setia et al showedthat education of physicians alone improved influenza vac-cination rates in LTCFs by only 4%, whereas inclusion ofstanding admitting orders increased the vaccination ratefrom 33% to 95%. 22Citing the Task Force review21and a ilar review conducted for the Health Care the Southern CaliforniaEvidence-Based Practice Center-RAND, 23the ly recommended standing orders for vaccination programsin LTCFs and other healthcare settings. 20Other strongly recommended provider-based interventions are informingvaccine providers that individual clients are due (providerreminder) or overdue (provider recall) for specific vaccina-tions and retrospective evaluation and feedback to vaccina-tion providers. 21 One limitation of our study was the difficulty of reli- ably ascertaining the vaccination status of LTCF residents.Much of the information was self-reported, and the self-reports require an accurate recollection of vaccine admin-istration by patients or their family members, often as farback as 5 years. Pneumococcal vaccine may be confusedwith the influenza vaccine by some patients. Chart reviewscaptured only about 50% of the vaccinated patients in Idahoand were very time consuming. The validity of vaccinationrates and the outcomes of quality-improvement interven-tions could be greatly improved if HCFA or state regulato-ry agencies would require documentation of vaccinationstatus in the Minimum Data Set upon admission of the res-ident. Vaccination registries for this population would like-wise improve the reliability of vaccination histories. Review of Medicare claims data for residents of Idaho LTCFs greatly underestimated the vaccination rateby identifying only 34% of the immunized patients. This710 INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY November 2000 suggests that many LTCFs were not billing Medicare. HCFA recently improved the ease of billing by encouragingroster billing 24and no longer requiring a physician order for payment.25These changes were implemented after completion of the PRO interventions described in thisreport. Future programs designed to increase vaccinationrates should focus on reimbursement issues in addition tothe other intervention strategies. These changes providean additional incentive for LTCFs to promote vaccinationefforts among their residents. Analysis of the effectiveness of interventions was limited by several factors. Data were combined from indi-vidual states after the completion of their programs. Thevaccination programs were developed independently byeach state PRO with lack of interstate standardization ofeither data acquisition at baseline or approach to interven-tions. Conducted as quality-improvement projects, no statePRO attempted to randomize facilities or adjust for casemix of patients. Each facility served as its own historicalcontrol without attempts to monitor secular trends. Therecruitment methods used could have resulted in selectionbias. In spite of these limitations, the overall effectivenessof the vaccination programs implemented as a result ofPRO collaboration appears quite significant. There were 1,590,763 individuals /H1109165 years of age who were residents of LTCFs in the United States in 1990. 26 This number is estimated to grow to 2.9 million by 2020.26 In 1995 less than one half of LTCF residents were estimat-ed to be vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccine. 15If all LTCFs nationally implemented the types of interventionsdescribed here, with the same success rate, a very large num-ber of additional residents could be successfully vaccinated. This substantial increase in vaccination rates among such a large population of susceptible individuals is likely,given recognized vaccine efficacy, 1to prevent a significant number of cases of pneumococcal bacteremia and death.Additionally, a recent study evaluating the cost-effectivenessof vaccination against pneumococcal bacteremia amongindividuals aged /H1109165 years demonstrated that vaccination both reduced medical costs and improved health. 27It can be presumed that the vaccination of a large number of addi-tional LTCF residents could result in significant cost savings with additional quality-adjusted years of life. Theclinical and economic impact of successful pneumococcalvaccination programs on the LTCF population, such asthose described in this article, will only increase as the sizeof this vulnerable population continues to grow.
