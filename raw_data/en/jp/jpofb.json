And when parents can't get their children into any of these clinical trials, particularly for autism, they often opt for what's called the Expanded Access Program (EAP), in which they pay between $10,000 and $15,000 to get their kids a single infusion. All of the trials use products derived from human umbilical cord blood, which is a source of stem cells as well as other types of cells. The autism trials are using a type of immune cells called monocytes, according to Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, a well-respected Duke professor who's conducting clinical trials into whether cord blood can help with autism, and who has been researching stem cells since the early '90s. (On ClinicalTrials.gov, however, these trials are listed Now, a for-profit company called Cryo-Cell International with ties to Duke researchers has A large randomized clinical trial, the [as using mesenchymal stromal cells](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04089579?term=kurtzberg+duke&cond=Autism&draw=2&rank=2), which are a completely different type of cord blood cell.) Now, a for-profit company called Cryo-Cell International with ties to Duke researchers has [indicated that it plans to open clinics promoting these treatments](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj87xm/a-controversial-autism-treatment-is-about-to-become-a-very-big-business), under a licensing agreement with the renowned North Carolina university. In their investor presentation, Cryo-Cell said they plan to become \"an autonomous, vertically integrated cellular therapy company that will treat patients.\" Duke and Cryo-Cell's rush to monetize a procedure before it's shown to have solid benefits has created concern, though, across the community of scientists, clinicians, and medical ethicists who study autism treatments. The hope is that these cord blood infusions can improve some autism symptoms, like socialization and language, or decrease the inflammation that some parents and clinicians think might exacerbate autism symptoms. Early study results, however, haven't been very promising. A large randomized clinical trial, the "}
