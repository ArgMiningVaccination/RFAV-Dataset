It's a substitution of artificial therapy over natural , of poisons over food, in which we are feeding people poison trying to correct the reactions of starvation. You all know how ridiculous that is, but you all know how widely it's being done.\" - Dr. Royal Lee, January 12, 1951 9 Excerpt from Lectures of Dr. Royal Lee, Vol. II. Used with Permission of Selene River Press, Inc. Dr Lee on Food Concentrates \"I believe you will understand why it is we can't ana lyze our products. Were they synthetic factors or were we only interested in the KNOWN vitamins, we could give you an analysis, but such an analysis would be totally useless for indicating the merits inherent in the UNKNOWN factor upon which we have built our success .\" - Dr Royal Lee, 1948 9 10Ending the Autoimmune Epidemic Michael cliniciansmastermind.com 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 6Pharmacological Nutrition \"Researchers approaching nutrition with a pharmaceuti cal mentality as, 'What is the active ingredient?' When a particular compound is isolated, it is not alw ays clear that it is the most physiologically important nutrient. It is not known how a combination of isolated chemicals will react in the body. The combination of several purified substances may yield re sults that are quite different from those observed for foods. 'What are the effect of long-ter m consumption of large amounts of purified nutrients? What is the optimal level of consumption fo r an isolated food ingredient or manufactured imitation?' These are pharmacological questions. In deed, these purified fractions do perform more as pharmacological agents than as foods.\" Judith DeCava, PhD, Whole Food Nutrition Journal 11 ADA on Synthetic Vitamins \"I am very familiar with the difficulties involved w ith the fortification of foods with synthetic vitami ns or concentrates of individual vitamins... In this case c hicks were placed on the modified Goldberger diet alone and supplemented with various synthetic vitamins and concentrates of some of the new members of the B complex. In most cases some improvement in grow th was noted due to the feeding of each additional vitamin, but normal growth was not obtaine d until a fair amount of a natural food such as live r, kidney or yeast was added. Likewise, synthetic vitamins should be used with caution in o rder to prevent the development of deficiencies more seriou s than the deficiency we set out to control.\" Elvehjem, C.J., Am.

Used with Permission of Selene River Press, Inc. Los Angeles College of Chiropractic Homecoming Weekend 1955 Don't forget now, there's two kinds of antibodies. There's natural tissue antibodies [autoantibodies] and there's the antibodies to foreign proteins. Most of our textbooks on immune reactions discuss nothing but the antibodies that are developed against foreign proteins. In the next period of scientific development of this physiological reaction, you're going to hear more about natural tissue antibodies. They've been discussed and described, but you won't find them in the textbooks yet. You'll only find them in the periodicals. It takes a few years between the time a discovery is reported and gets into the journals before it gets into the textbooks. 21 22Ending the Autoimmune Epidemic Michael cliniciansmastermind.com rights reserved. 303 442 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 12 Understand & address the cause, to implement the correction & prevention of the autoimmune process NecrosisImmune Dysregulation Gastrointestinal DysfunctionTHE TRIAD OF AUTOIMMUNE ETIOLOGY The Autoimmunity 24Autoimmune Disease (AiD) - Etiology #1 Necrosis: Damage to / degeneration of that tissue / cell type causes them to leak cell fragments (esp. nucleoproteins) into the blood, causing increased autoantibody formation to that cell type (esp. the nucleoproteins) 23 24Ending the Autoimmune Epidemic cliniciansmastermind.com 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 1325Immune Dysregulation: A. Weak innate immunity allows \"stealth\" or latent pathogens to linger unchallenged, leading to over-activity in the acquir ed immune system B.

By preventing pathogens from overcoming the innate immune system, we can prevent and reverse disease, if we keep innate immunity strong throughout life. - Adapted from Trevor Marshall, PhD 25 26Ending the Autoimmune Epidemic Michael cliniciansmastermind.com 303 442 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 14Innate Immunity, and Chronic & Autoimmune Disease The innate immune defenses are the key to preventin g and reversing chronic disease, esp. autoimmune disease These innate immune responses depend on correct nutrition (e.g. Calcium Lactate, Cataplex C, Cataple x F Tablets, Immuplex, etc.) and herbal therapy (e.g. Echinacea Premium) Autoantibodies & Clinical Disease Autoantibodies appear long before clinical symptoms an d diagnosis (up to 26 years) Autoantibodies can be eliminated without improvement in clinical symptoms The body produces thousands of antibodies, and it is e asy for some of those to be recognized as autoantibodies Human antibodies (not synthetic ones) are polyspecifi c, and can act on a variety of targets Blood naturally produces antibodies to bacterial DNA fragments that are ubiquitous in blood and tissues. These easily cross-react with body tissues . 27 28Ending the Autoimmune cliniciansmastermind.com 303 442 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 15More on Autoimmune Disease The most likely trigger for persistent antibody producti on is dysbiosis and a weakened innate immune system Antibodies and autoantibodies are not causal in AiD, bu t a manifestation or effect of an immune response to chronic infection and/or dysbiosis. Autoantibodies seem to be collateral damage, as the bod y tries to fight off chronic infection from weakened innate immunity and dysbiosis 30Gastrointestinal Dysfunction: A.

PMGs\u00aeare produced by the nucleus of each cell to regulate its g rowth and function. PMGs\u00aeare nucleoproteins common to all mammals. Taking PMGs\u00aesupplementally removes interference to cell repair by distracting autoantibodies away from that tissue (that is the \"decoy theory\"). 39 40Ending the Autoimmune cliniciansmastermind.com 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 2141Protomorphogens:TMTwo Types & Functions Endogenous PMGs: 1.

Every cell has a number of these protomorphogens because it has just as many as it has ki nds of proteins. We also describe a protomorphogen as one of the fractional blueprints of the cell. Protomorphogens a re in the nature of nucleo-proteins and are really blueprints of things that are going to be built long before they are built.\" 44Dr Royal Lee on PMGs - 2 \"A protomorphogen (PMG) is that component of the cell chromosome that is responsible for morphogenic determination of cell characteristics . It is the smallest unit of the cell blueprint assembly. It is the smallest unit of the gene system that gui des the cell into its hereditary form as it grows, develops or repair s itself. Without sufficient protomorphogen in its chromatin, the cell degenerat es, de-differentiates, becomes senile and dies. The protomorphogen level in the cell is regulated b y the fact that, while normally more is constantly being created by the cell nucleus, it is antigenic and promotes the formation of antibodies (in the mammalian organi sm), which in turn control the levels of extracellular protomorphogen in blood and lymph.\" 43 44Ending the cliniciansmastermind.com 303 442 2525support@michaelgaeta.com 2345 So if you provide this patient who is sensitized to his o wn heart protein with some extract of beef heart\u2014cytotrophic extract\u2014(cytotrophic means stimulative), that's the blueprints of the heart's cell in that extract. It's the chromosome, the thing that makes the heart different fr om any other organ. When that's provided it will combine it with antibodi es. The inhibition is controlled and the old heart starts to repair itself normally wit h it's own blueprints, with it's own cytotrophic factor. Because we can use a beef cytotrophic factor to get rid of the antibody but we can't use a beef cytotro phic factor to heal the heart. You have to depend on what's in the heart to do that. But we can use the beef factor to get rid of the inhibitive an tibody.
