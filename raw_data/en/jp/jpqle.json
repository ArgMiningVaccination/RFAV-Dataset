The story began as early as 800 years in the past from nilayadi bheedu Dharmasthala known as kuduma at mallarmadi a village at that hour in South Canara theirs lived the Jain chieftain Birmana Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballathie in a house called nelayadi beedu a simple pious couple of courteous and most affectionate among the pergade and in the surrounding communities., a cut above the rest may be quoted. 2. We could ascertain the true ruler is always a beggar his balance sheet is no expenditure deficit as income to be because it is always altered by the ruler by his rule to nil. No aggrieved resist from his dependents due to his impartial justice and unprejudiced predominant procedural activities and scrupulous means of action within his purview of jurisdiction. Because he has enormous love and affection shown on his dependants due to all rely on him. At this juncture, the story of Agastya Muni and his wife lopamudra about a narration of details found to be important Lopamudra daughter of great king vidarbha., a princess brought up in a wealthy circumstance she got in wedlock with the great saint Agasthya, in fact, the saint bar from all wealthy amenities it's all not his passion, therefore, lopamudra compelled to avoid all such external urge of needs which are to be averted due to her saint's life to be led along with her husband Agastya Muni. Gradually the days passed by the modesty shrank due to intimacy with her husband and she felt the wealthy past reminded her father's house well-being thoughts. And subsequently, she provoked similar thoughts in her husband's needs of the same. Agastya muni could bring all the need and wants in no time to his wife Lopamudra by his power of austerities he acquired the same by tapas and severe penance he went through in the past but it is against the rule of a sanyasi. Hence he assured to his wife that he intended to visit the wealthy kings and demand without hurting his dependents and his duty bound rule etc.. The, Lopamudra's appeal was also the same to her husband Agasthya and the great saint started to visit a king's citadel sets out as an ordinary Brahmin or in a disguised form. King also greeted the saint offered a seat, honored him and after some time he asked his purpose of visit. The great Agastya Muni explained his intention and the king also reacted by submitting his royal statement of accounts the same accepted and gone through the statement, but in vain the Agastya Muni found the statement is a Nill deficit of expenditure of income. There is nothing to claim as per his sought need. Now the saint found no option other than leaving the king's citadel on a bare hand., then the king requested with an obligation he is desirous of accompanying him to obtain the sought need by the saint in assisting. The sage in illusionary replication as a Brahmana accepted the king's desire and they went to beg well to do for their needy visited many citadels. But in vain, they found everywhere it's been found a similar answer as in the past. Thus the Vyasa illustrates that the king should always stick to Dharma and he is not supposed to tax his people above the norm always he should stick with corrective measures to not to burden the dependants without any exorbitant manner that may lead to hampering his kingdom or reign over his jurisdiction get hurt all the instance he is bound to stick with Dharma only Dharma could be the ultimate solace for him for his generations in ahead forthwith. Finally started visiting many the answer being the same and in those days there were two cruel assuras in possession of enormous wealth by name illava and vadapi used to take revenge on Brahmanas. Tactfully the illava invite for a feast the innocent Brahmana too accept the invitation and the vadapi deceitfully transform by magic power the vadapi into a goat kill the goat., cook & prepare delicious food and the same fed to innocent Brahmanas after some time the illava order to vadapi to come out and the vadapi tear the innocent Brahmana stomach and kill. In those days, even Brahmana consumed meat for food. Similar tactics applied in case of the great saint Agasthiya after sumptuous dinner the ilava called, but this known trick by saint ordered vadapi be digested in the stomach. And vadapi got digested in the stomach of great Agastya muni. Thus the vadapi never returned And the Illva thus surrendered the wealth desirous of by the saint, meant to say make light of. There the story delineates the ruler all the time should be duty-bound beggar only he strives hard to satiate his dependents, by all means, defends with his might. The Dharma devas assuming human forms visited the chieftain Birmana pergade house and the noble couple hosted the devas and gone through all wherewithal the devas were pleased of the hospitality dictum of their visiting disclosed in their dreams the devas appeared than the chieftain and his aspirants to propagate the quintessence of Dharma. There how the propagation of Dharma continues from generation after generation.

Instead, she gave in-comprehensible objections. The Nandini the holy cow could accomplish all the needs as her Mother Kamadenu to fulfill the requisite things of a Yajna in need and committed by the great soul Jabalimuni. The jabalimuni is never uttered hard-bitten words to any of his disciples ever and the nandinis spell-bound denial made him to curse over nandini the holy cow it is natural that his hardships incurred to save the earth at this juncture of intense destruction and torrent flood or deluge scorched the earth made him to utter the curse over the holy cow nandini being in-evitable.The curse being one that the holy nandini is to flow as a river like ganga and fertile the land and energize vitalities vegetation all around till the earthly beings become happy and lead a satiated life and environment is sustained and the holy nandini pleaded to the sage jabali how she is to gain redemption from the curse and return to her abode with an anxiety.

Eastern ghat is an array of broken or discontinuous range of mountainous it traverses through northern Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna, Tungabhadra and Kaveri cut through this mountainous range and intercepts the Inland and vast land or Deccan plateau centrally oriented is converted into fertile greenery and cultivation made possible. And the agriculture being flourished yield being altered due to these large, distinctively lengthy & extensively wide range of rivers sustained vegetation being altered adequate supply of river water.,and finally, the rest of the bay of Bengal., This eastern ghat is said to be older than the western ghat section and it geographically contains numerous composition of many types of rocks materials viz., charnockites, The rock granite gneiss, khondalites, [metamorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic) [gneisses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gneiss), [quartzite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartzite), these are classified into igniting rocks, lime rocks, and granite rocks and in possession of valuable wealth of the nation and it is heard formation of these rock materials during the earth had to revolt due to tectonic movement, we could say tectonic plates constant shift underneath the earth's crust disintegration Sprang occurred the Gondwana viz., a single landmass separated into seven continents due to nature's impact. It all took place before the civilization cropped up, No mortal beings were present. A lonely horizon could be the right word well to presume. It could be counted under the spring of an ancient civilization. Neoproterozoic Age of Gondwana around 550 million years back in the past until the 180 million ago the Jurassic presence is notified in geophysical studies, it seems, and it only concerned about the earth natural sciences, The western ghat fauna has special animals, bird species mammals carnivorous and herbivorous viz., Jerdon courser a bird endemic, very rare species and a restricted one, Gray slender loris tropical like monkey-like species, Golden Gecko, Golden rock gecko a reptile type one, snakes of types venomous and non venomous shielded snake, Nagarjuna Sagar racer etc., The above medicinal plants and its nature to cure are to be arbitrarily is to be maintained and the excerpts only what I have mentioned here in this article it will be continued and it should comply with eco-compatibility of usage and Pharmaceutical standards it should adhere to and it should comply with government and international regulatory restraints. New Amarambalam reserved wildlife sanctuary is the one., And situated at the western ghat at Malappuram, Kerala specifically a very important wildlife sanctuary it has an attitude gradation of 40 meters to 2554 Mtrs i.e., 131 Ft To 8379 Ft and has an area of comprised 265.72 Sq. Kms and 212 species of birds at nilambur and amarapalam forest area And this amarambalam forest area is considered to be one important bird sanctuary[IBS] western ghats endemic region and around 16 rare species of birds are identified i.e., {RRS] or Restricted Rare species there are birds like lesser adjutant is a large wading bird, White-rumped flycatcher, crimson backed sunbird, etc., as per fauna all mammals of 25 varieties are available as in the western ghat., lion-tailed macaque and Nilgiri tahr are available............................. Environment Demerits This has been notified in the south Goa for an example of the Caurem village at Quepem Taluka it has been statistically identified 2000 families whose farmland has been destroyed by illegal mines operating in this area. And silt exhumed from mining works entered the fields which now resemble a large quagmire spoilt the fertile qualities of the land & Polluted., agriculture has been totally destroyed people are left with no means of earning their living out of it is the known fact from agriculturists prevailing opinion in this area. As per the Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel certain viable facts has been denoted dictums are as follows: Mining has caused irreversible damage to forests, agriculture, fisheries, and water aquifers, Goa have 90 operational mines spread along the Western Ghats in an area of 150 to 200 sq km.

Earlier this protection of endemic plants and species has been mentioned by the reports and details of Kasturirangan submission of documents to the union government. What the Kasturirangan report proposed is a more realistic model \u2014 one that would not, by any means, protect all of the Western Ghats or even all that is left unspoiled there, but that could mitigate some of the damage that unchecked development stands to cause. The Kasturirangan report stresses only 37% of the western ghat section is to be brought found necessary under ESA i.e., Ecologically sensitive Area -zone down from 64% of Gadgil report suggestion it seems. It may protect endemic species It is a formula that could work if the environment ministry stands firm behind it. Government works under narrow vested interest it has to divulge the required measures towards such improvements, eco-friendly precepts to switch rapidly and put forth efforts on in a streamlined course it seems. The Kasturirangan report seeks to bring just 37% of the Western Ghats under the Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) zones \u2014 down from the 64% suggested by the Gadgil report. If enforced, this would protect thousands of endemic species. Deteriorating peninsular and eco-system retrieval to the normal occurrence is found to be an expectation being on the cards. It is found to be utmost necessary for understanding the intractable valorous fierce Bheeshmacharya or Pithamaha the grandeur of Mahabharata and a well-wisher of Kauravas and Pandavas the story of this brave unconquered warrior starts and delineates the unparalleled sacrifice of this renowned archer and the eighth son of Goddess Ganga Matha and Hasthinapuram King Shantanu this undefeated bowman by name Devaratha. Recalling the reminiscences of his birth adorn celebrated prince and his latter sacrifice of the throne of sovereignty on behalf of his father, King Shantanu & his endeavor is a heartfelt indescribable factor and really painful feature of this great warrior. There are many epics and epithet are on search available in our sacred Vedic books or existing Four Sruthi and Histories details the selflessness & dedicated characters. But none could be equal to our grandeur Pithamaha. Bhishma is known aware of undertook a terrible oath \"He forfeits all sensual pleasures and he promised that he never marry and lead a life of worldly as in normal, but instead he will lead a life of nobility and protector of Hastinapura and it's inmates & entire society \" since then he has called Pithamaha Bheeshmacharya of yet so young in an age sprint of puberty in the Mahabharata without underwent severe penance or following any austerities availed grant of the boon or bliss of his life at his will and he could survive as long as he wishes to be alive or Iccha-Mrityu. The Devas from heaven showered flowers & praises over his head when he proclaimed pronouncing such an unbreakable vow unimaginable by any worldly-minded. And the boon granted by Devas without any requisition placed on to Dewas by following severe penance or austere performing. There are many such human beings as well as animals of the exemplary deed can be notified by plowing The wicked and devious Saguni being the maternal uncle to kauravas and he is the cause for the great war kurushethra and said to be the principal character of kurushethra war & being youngest prince of Ghandhar kingdom and he is the elder brother to queen Ghandhari and brother in law for Dhiritharastra the king of kuru kingdom Dhiritharastra is blind by birth and gandhari as a queen she forcibly blind folded her eyes with cloth as a sacrifice because of her husband is blind by birth. The kuru kingdom has hasthinapura being the capital city. And hastinapura is now at meerat i.e. Uthara Pradesh and at the right bank of ganges.Saguni had long ill-fated vengeance over bheeshmachari and never could be Quenched by all means due to his sister Gandhari married the blind king by birth and bheeshmachari is the cause for his father and his brother's death as per epic. There is a story behind all these incidents one after another cropped up due to vengeance and hat-redness or we could say intense hostility between kauravas and pandavas hurling brickbat and creating tension made each other quarrelsome on prestigious issues the devious saguni how he provoked the same etc., and aggravate the hostility between the two sections of brothers. And the devious saguni stood or steadfast enriching the vengeance between the kauravas and pandavas on every phase it seems throughout the kurushethra war.,.Ghandhari in her birth sign she is an in-auspious considered to be due to mangalik i.e., Mars being war-some planet and it is resting in one of the houses of her birth sign or in her horoscope this is considered to be not good for her family and for her entire livelihood it seems hence her father as per astrologers suggestion first she is married to a goat than the goat is sacrificed.Dhiritharastra the king of hasthinapore marry Ghandhari without knowing the facts the consequence cropped up one after other this is due to bheeshma the pithamaha.whom responsible for the same the pithamaha also come to an awareness of the facts at the latter stage of ghandhari's first marriage he becomes furious of the known facts and punishes the king subhala the naresh of ghandhar kingdom imprisoned all his hundred children's inclusive of devious saguni the most intelligent and wicked. The crafty and wicked saguni had dice rolled at his will and show the numbers as an advantage as he wish it seems and these dice made out of his father's thigh bone it seems. the history of events, and on an earthly presence performed similar sacrifices yet without any expectations of this world. Many could not have been recognized for their good endeavor the destiny has a different account it seems to fit to prove the selflessness and sacrifices of precise in nature. The devour of tour performed by destiny is cent percent right and accurate; it could be seen in the pile after piling of the events which alone establish the unbiased truth. To err is human, to eradicate is divine., But the penalties imposed by destiny could not be evaded by the earthly beings that are the befitting answer. The Nilgiri biosphere region is mountainous and elevates to an altitude of 2400 meters in height. Annually 14 cms of rain this region attained in between the month of June to August during monsoon and inhabitants or tribes is Toda Kotta Badaga Irula and Kurumba they work in the fields of tea plantations, cattle & herds rearing milk product producing is the occupation is done. And the Queen of the hill station is Udhagamandalam [Ooty] it has an altitude of 7200 ft in height. Nilgiri biosphere declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO IN THE YEAR 2012 it includes Aralam, Mudumalai, Mukuruthi, Nagarahole, Bandipur, and silent valley National Wayanad, Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuaries. This seventh heaven Nilgiri biosphere and its hill ranges and it has surrounding environments covering a tract of 5000 Sq.Kilometers and it constituted as UNESCO under Nilgiri biosphere control in the year September 1986. And it is known Heritage rich rapturous vital fauna and flora environment possession on in Indian heritage resourceful place. And tribal culture belonged one as such toda, the tribal groups native to this Nilgiri reserve. And these tribes have special features and acquainted with their own system of rules & regulations their clothing style living habits & their abode, food and other basic need procuring and culture of the traditional background are very interesting and their passion may be an alluring one could be presumed. Development projects such as hydroelectric power projects, agriculture, horticulture, etc., which have brought about substantial changes in the ecology of the area. Many environmental problems are noticed in different parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The enormous tribal population growth in the Nilgiri biosphere is one of intimidating issues and change in ecology-related Nilgiri is an issue and an immediate attentive one. The present world has changed to an environment enthusiast perceptive arena, we are coming across overwhelming uproar from common people all around the globe in a presumptive way to enrich the eco-peninsular eco-system by all means. This is a sign of an optimistic gainful concept of humanity it seems. Recently the heat of public uproar at Maharashtra the Aarey movement is very much observed critically upheaving the voice of eminent peoples, celebrity, and best-known environmentalists against the Maharashtra government by forming a human chain at Aarey forest western ghat. The demand being against the cutting of 2700 trees in this area, devastating the dwelling tribal culture of 3000 in number for the metro shed construction etc., has obscured demand taken up shook off Mr. Devendra Fadnavis CM of Maharashtra Government is a known fact it needs immediate attention of the situation by the center. The toda tribes have in possession of intrinsic cultural habits as such polyandry marital status, thus is five men marry one lady similar to Mahabharata Pandava they believe they are the descendants of Pandava origin and the traditional style of polyandry has changed in recent times due to modern days and habits habituating process it seems. And also copulation and Inter-mixing of tribal origin into other Kurumbas, Badagas tribe groups, etc., their occupation is herd & cattle raring and they are pure vegetarians milk and milk-related foods they consume apart from vegetable dishes only. They have a population strength is around 1100 on average and they live in Nilgiri hill ranges. And dating back to the 19Th Century one of the oldest civilizations histories as per the census. And their dress code is shawl one single piece of cloth and they are well skilled in silver artifices manufacturing and embroidery works using the needle with black and red thread for their ornamental traditional cloth wearing embroidery works for wear. In recent days they have learned working on fields, coffee & tea plants etc., The badagas tribes have a very rich culture and they live in the Nilgiris hill have a population around 3,00,000 approximately and 1/4th of the total population of these hill areas & they have dress code during functions and celebrations will be white turban, shirt and panche or dhoti in white color this is for men and ladies wear two pieces above the waist one piece and below as wrapped over as a saree one piece and in the recent past their educational standard has developed possibly from the inception it seems they are in fact origin of Karnataka and their language is badagu there is no lipi only spoken language one only it seems. Due to an invasion of the Muslim dynasty at Vijayanagara and nanjangud in Karnataka the badagas drove and shifted over to Nilgiri hills and they rested permanently at these hilly areas, it occurred around 400 years back, in fact, these badagas are very much disciplined cultured community. They are very fond of dancing and singing and they have in possession of fair complexion and good healthy and handsome boys & men and beautiful girls and women. The tribal culture is spread all over India and it has a link with world tribal culture too; that we can presume. Starting from Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat along the western ghat till Kanyakumari Kerala and I would like to spell out or delineate the special nature of the different types of cultural ethic values in the coming pages and now I begin to detail the wealthier states Kanyakumari and Trivandrum. The Kanyakumari peninsular tip and western ghat has a long tradition of trade and this place is the southernmost tip of India the Cap Comorin named by the Britishers it confluence of three ocean together the rapturous bay of Bengal the magnificent Indian Ocean and Sensuous Arabian sea a place famous for tourism and considered as a mainly richest state per capita of income of the Democratic Republic of Indian constitution thickly populated second in Tamilnad and Tip of cardamom hill an Extention of western ghat and in the past Chera Chozha and Pandya Nayak dynasties ruled Kanyakumari and Trivandrum And Kanyakumari is famous for sunset and sunrise a place total silence except for the uproar of three confluence of the ocean. The Kanyakumari temple is there and goddess Parasakthi is waiting to get wedlock with intractable and valorous Lord shiva. There is a story behind Kanyakumari alias parashakthi stayed a virgin as per the rule of conscience only the demon king Banasura could be killed by virgin parashakthi. The great Narada Muni tapasya stringent disciple of Lord Vishnu played a great role in fulfilling the killing of Banasura the cruel Asura king. Swami Vivekananda the Most deserving disciple of Ramana Maharishi Ramakrishna Paramahamsa he got through the attainment of spiritual enlightenment spent adequate time for meditations here at Kanyakumari at the brim of the shore confluence of great three Ocean at the rocky placid Inspired by the place suitability for performing penance and perspired the immense sustained silence of roaring shore on air. And on requisite remembrance and reminiscences, an Idol of Swamiji monument erected in the year 1970 just off the shoreline on a little mount rocky docile. As well as a statue for Thiruvalluvar in the recent past by the Indian government in the year 2000 installed. According to Christian legends, Christianity arrived in South India around AD 52 through St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Christ. However, European missionaries, who arrived in the 16th century, propagated Christianity in the area. St. Francis Xavier (7 April 1506-2 December 1552) was the pioneer in preaching Christianity in what is now the Kanyakumari district. And Jains also invaded through this Kanyakumari for the purpose of trade links etc., Islam is believed to have entered the southern part of India through Kanyakumari during the early part of the eighth century AD through traders and missionaries who came through sea-routes. Islam, Christianity, and Jainism have also contributed to the architectural wealth and literary heritage of the region. Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) of neighbouring state Kerala, is the nearest international airport, with direct flights from the Middle East, Singapore, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. And is served by Air-India, among others. From there it takes about three hours by train or bus or taxi. The taxi charges are pretty cheap, about Rs 9-10 per km, and should be around Rs 1000 (US$22 Approx), for a trip to Kanyakumari from the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The Mahabharata is not merely an epic, but it is the regress after regressed events and scrupulously in a thorough search of truth between good and bad a story of vengeance lust over the attire of wellbeing an emotional outburst between valorous independent or athirathas or it denotes brave enough to combat and defeat outnumber adversary in the Warfield. One such character is the brave Athiratha Karna the soulful king of Angha a small kingdom & present Bengal Duryodhana granted to greet the priceless warrior Karna a friend indeed in need when all the enmity mocked over the brave Karna the anga sovereignty a solace forever granted to karna by his friend Duryodhana at the cost of friendship. An unfortunate character of the great Mahabharata and all the time he is forced to taste brunt of ridicule & snide of the remarks of the Kurukshetra war. A guiltless soul lost his life for endeavor everlasting friendship with Duryodhana. Foster son of a charioteer adhiratha and son of Kunti Devi and sun god took birth before marriage without rites and rituals performed, carried all blame without knowing from birth and born with kundalini and kavacha unbreakable one and it is the gift by his father sun god. Kunti Devi a helpless damsel and left her beloved elder son in a river by placing in a basket with the help of her maidservant in an abandoned way without finding any optimistic or alternate option insight predicts for her. And skilled Kshatriya brought up by charioteer denounced all the time by society without fault. Sutha Putra voluntarily declined to lower caste as per Vedic reclaim Destiny prevails as such could be comprehended. Destiny destined before birth it seems in the case of Maharathi and Athiratha Karna and there were in our ancient Veda there is pronounced athiratha Viz., Lord Krishna, Drona, Bheeshma, Karna, and Arjuna considered owning intractable valour There were war vindication & violations throughout Mahabharata and its sequence of incidents and war measures taken up by the Kauravas and Pandavas has been justified on different occasions on the situations biased and unbiased justification balancing of denote Vedic rules. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu death and Dhana Dharma Sura Karna killed by Arjun by severing of his head driving an arrow by Arjun as instructions delivered by Lord Krishna the principled chariot driver and Karna after he was in wounded position and Lord Krishna is obtaining all the fruits of Dharma from Karna as Dhana placing requisition in a disguised form as a Brahman pity of begging before the brave Karna died. Everything the events created on the combat ground seems assembled one. And Dharma as if resumed & retrench at the same time, many situation provokes several doubts over occurrences unpredictable as the right correction is required. And all the blame is taken by Lord Krishna voluntarily of this greatest war and the renunciations & imbalances of events presume that the Mahabharata Dharma, at last, retrieved unbiased justification intact. On the battleground, the Kunti Devi proclaims by crying Karna as her elder son on the combat zone when Karna at the death rite in presence of all her sons Pandavas and in the presence of the Kauravas king Duryodhana the Kaurava king exhilarated by hearing his true friend Karna mitigating all the good qualities of the valorous intractable essence of the great king Karna Anga sovereignty. Mahabharata is being a nerve-racking quiz for all those who relish the taste of truth and Dharma. It is all recourse of this great story Mahabharata a suspicious presumption and recourses or retrogress events. What we could presume about the western ghat other words the benevolent mountain range timely restoration of rain and inciting the ecosystem balance for the benefit of humankind is all it happens on its own. And Indian peninsular traverses the Kerala, Karnataka Tamilnadu Goa Maharastra and Gujarat and a vast proportion of fauna and flora estimates the nature eco-balance intact.

Forth coming every budget session an amicable provision berth is to be allocated or to be balanced is a must due to the same the eco-system which exists in Western Ghats being our asylum an existence fact being our prime survival question. The western ghat is the dense forest range and eastern ghat is moderately dense forest range.

Therefore, a king should appoint advisers (as councilors and ministers) and listen to their advice The root of wealth is economic activity and lack of it brings material distress. Economy along with balanced productivity could only bring prosperity and the kingdom is strengthened. It is the people who constitute a kingdom; like a barren cow, a kingdom without people yields nothing.
