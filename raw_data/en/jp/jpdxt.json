First Posted : December 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : July 27, 2023 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT04210726) [No Results Posted](/ct2/show/results/NCT04210726) study, whereas a number of patients with clinically-diagnosed Cancer (any type, any location and any stage), and who were poorly responsive to at least one cycle of conventional and standard therapy (Chemotherapy or Radiation therapy), are equally divided into 2 groups, Active and Control groups. The Active group patients will separately have an immersion bath in 25% Sea Salt in Water solution at a temperature comfortable to every patient, whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers. The Control group's patients will separately have a bath in 0.9% Sea Salt in Water at a comfortable temperature whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers.| |Masking:||Single (Participant)| |Masking Description:||Participants will not know which Group (Active/Control) they are assigned to, only the Investigator will know. The amount of Salt added to each bath (and hence the concentration of each bath) will not be known by Participants. Assignment will be random using a simple computer program.| |Primary Purpose:||Treatment| |Official Title:||Effect of on Cancer Nodules' Size, Number and Its in Vivo.| |Estimated 25% Saline Bath | The Active group's patients will separately have an immersion bath in 25% Sea Salt in Water solution (made by adding pure Sodium Chloride in the form of Sea Salt to Tap Water Bath) at a temperature comfortable to every participant (please note that Solubility of Sodium Chloride in Water does not change significantly with change in temperature, therefore the concentration will remain the same regardless of water temperature), whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers. | Drug: 25% Hypertonic Saline Bath | 25% Sea Salt (mainly Sodium Chloride - NaCl) in Tap Water Immersion Bath (made by adding Sodium Chloride in the form of Sea Salt to Tap Water to a concentration of 25%). | Placebo Comparator: Control Group - 0.9% Saline Bath | The Control group's patients will separately have a bath in 0.9% Sea Salt in Water (Isotonic solution, made by adding Sodium Chloride in form of Sea Salt to Tap Water) at a comfortable temperature whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers | Other: 0.9% Isotonic Saline Bath | 0.9% Sea Salt (mainly Sodium Chloride - NaCl) in Tap Water Immersion Bath (made by adding Sodium Chloride in the form of Sea Salt to Tap Water to a concentration of 0.9%). - Reduction in Tumors size [ Time Frame: 6 month ]Tumor responses are evaluated in terms of change in tumor size represented by the linear measurements of all targeted lesions. The Hypertonic Sea Salt Bath intervention will be considered effective if there is a statistically-significant reduction in Means of the measured Cancer Cells sizes/dimensions for the same nodules between the two groups using a One-Way ANOVA test. - Reduction in Tumors lesions numbers [ Time Frame: 6 month ]Tumor responses are evaluated in terms of change in tumor lesions number. The Hypertonic Sea Salt Bath intervention will be considered effective if there is a statistically-significant reduction in Means of the Cancer lesions number for the same nodules between the two groups using a One-Way ANOVA test. - Reduction in Tumors lesions SUVmax (FDG-Maximum Standardized Uptake Values) [ Time Frame: 6 month ]Tumor responses are evaluated in terms of change in tumor SUV max (FDG-Maximum Standardized Uptake Values). The Hypertonic Sea Salt Bath intervention will be considered effective if there is a statistically-significant reduction in Means of the measured Cancer lesions SUVmax values for the same nodules between the two groups using a One-Way ANOVA test.
