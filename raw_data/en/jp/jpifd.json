The technique is used by some nutrition consultants, health-food store operators, practitioners of holistic and orthomolecular medicine, chiropractors and even some dentists. It is also done by mail-order companies that solicit customers through advertisements in health and health-food newsletters, newspapers and magazines. Customers are urged to send a tablespoon or two of hair, usually from the back of the head, and anywhere from $15 to $37 to companies that promise a computer analysis of the body's nutrient deficiencies and excesses and toxic metal accumulations, based on the contents of the dead strands that emerge from one's scalp. The unreliability of such analyses and the fact that they cannot reveal anything about vitamin needs has been demonstrated repeatedly. Some ads even suggest - without any scientific documentation - that the findings of hair analysis may explain why people suffer from such problems as depression, fatigue, headaches, arthritis, diabetes and heart disease. When providing customers with the results, most analyzers also issue a list of recommendations, usually suggesting several vitamin and mineral supplements and sometimes ''chelation therapy'' to rid the body of toxic heavy metals. In many cases, the provider of the analysis is also the purveyor of the recommended remedies. Aside from being a waste of money, the recommended megadoses of supplements and chelation therapy can sometimes be dangerous. In their illuminating book, ''Vitamins & 'Health' Foods: The Great American Hustle'' (George F. Stickley, 1981, $11.95), Drs. Victor Herbert and Stephen Barrett describe a man in ''apparently good physical health'' who was told by a mail-order hair analysis laboratory to take 34 doses of 17 different supplement products daily. Included were ''vitamin B-15'' (there is no such vitamin) and 40,000 units of vitamin A (a potentially toxic dose). The Food and Drug Administration describes a healthy woman who was told by a hair analysis company that her body was deficient in phosphorus, manganese, iron and zinc and had ''toxic levels'' of selenium, aluminum and nickel. She was advised to take 28 doses of 15 different nutrient products daily, including vitamins, minerals and other food supplements. Although the firm's advice was supposedly tailored to individuals based on the analyses of their particular nutrient problems, recommendations of the same supplements were made to other customers. One Los Angeles case of fraudulent hair analysis was brought to criminal court after a woman complained that owners of a health-food store said her hair analysis indicated she had a bad heart valve, abscesses in her pancreas, arsenic in her body and growths in her liver, intestines and stomach. Two herbal remedies were prescribed, which supposedly cured these conditions, but the woman was then told that she had lead in her stomach. The Los Angeles City Attorney General's Office sued the store owners for practicing medicine without a license. The owners pleaded no contest and were fined $2,000, given a 60-day suspended jail sentence and placed on probation for two years. Unfortunately, however, it is only the rare case of this sort that is aired for public scrutiny, although a few others have come to the attention of medical experts. In one case, a man was told that he had poisonous amounts of lead in his body and was started on chelation therapy with the drug EDTA to cleanse his system. But the excess lead turned out to be only in his hair, where it is harmless, and not in his body. Its source was a hair dye. Had he continued much longer with the chelation treatments, he might have ''cleansed'' his body of a number of essential nutrients, including calcium and magnesium, and possibly destroyed his kidneys with the drug. In a similar case, a woman was told she had toxic amounts of selenium in her hair. Fortunately she consulted a physician before undergoing chelation therapy. Like the man above, the excess was only in her hair, not her body. Its source: the antidandruff shampoo she was using. Hair is dead protein tissue which, depending on how long it has been on your head, could have been formed days, weeks, months, or even years ago. In the growth process, minerals in the body can become incorporated into the hair. There are, however, no vitamins in hair except possibly those that cling to hair from ''vitamin-enriched'' shampoos. Hair analysts say hair can serve as a permanent record of nutrient consumption and toxic exposure, since substances that get into hair presumably stay there until the hair falls out. They claim that hair provides a more reliable record than blood or urine of the nutrients and toxic substances that are or have been in a person's body. Neither of these claims have been substantiated by proper scientific research. In fact, if anything, studies have indicated that hair analysis is grossly unreliable for determining nutrient deficiencies and the presence of toxic substances. Many factors besides what you eat and drink can influence the contents of your hair. In addition to hair dyes and shampoos, these include other colorings and conditioners, hair sprays and dressings, hair straighteners and permanent-wave lotions, pollutants in the air and chemicals in the water you swim in. In seeking to determine the effects on people of arsenic pollution from a gold mining operation, researchers from the University of Zimbabwe showed that untainted hair removed from a person's head and placed in the general environment of the mining complex absorbed arsenic directly from the air. Thus, what is found in your hair may - or may not - reflect what's in your body. Another study revealed that the hair of rats on a diet that caused a chronic severe zinc deficiency did not display zinc deficits. ''If hair-zinc is an unreliable indication of the zinc status of a laboratory animal kept under strictly controlled conditions, it is very unlikely to be a reliable indicator of adequacy of zinc nutrition in man,'' University of the West Indies researchers wrote in The Lancet, the British medical journal. They also pointed out that hair-zinc concentrations in malnourished children were much higher than in normal children. And a University of Colorado researcher, Dr. K. Michael Hambidge, found that when malnourished children are treated, their hair-zinc levels actually decline. These findings are believed to reflect changes in the rate of hair growth, which is slowed by malnutrition, and possibly other factors not yet understood. In Dr. Hambidge's view, hair analysis may be useful in studying large groups of people, from which enough samples can be collected to produce statistically significant results. But, he says, in the study of individuals its use is ''extremely limited.'' Individual findings can be affected by the color of the hair, the part of the body or head it came from, the season of the year, and the person's age, sex and race. Few, if any, of these factors are taken into account in commercial hair analysis. Furthermore, the analyses themselves are extremely unreliable and ''normal'' levels of nutrients in hair have yet to be established, so it is not possible to say what is abnormal. Dr. Bertram A. Spilker, a pharmacologist and Government consultant, sent duplicate hair samples from three healthy men to three different laboratories for analysis. The reported findings varied not only from one laboratory to another, but also from sample to sample from the same individual as analyzed by each laboratory. There are no standardized methods for hair preparation and analysis and many factors can influence the results of such an analysis, including which part of the hair shaft is used, the washing and preparation of the sample by the laboratory and the actual analytic methods used. Unfortunately, the abuse of hair analysis has discouraged legitimate study to improve and standardize the "}
