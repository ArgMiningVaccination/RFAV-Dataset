Mind-body modalities have been used to improve the mental health, well-being, quality of life, and physical health of clinical and general populations, and may also be used to improve the mental health of HCWs during COVID-19. The objective of this review is to analyze the effectiveness of mind-body modalities for the mental health of HCWs in the COVID-19 era. Six electronic bibliographic databases were comprehensively searched to find intervention studies using mind-body modalities, including meditation, mindfulness-based intervention, autogenic training, yoga, tai chi, qigong, breathing exercise, music therapy, guided imagery, biofeedback, prayer, and faith-based techniques for HCWs. All intervention studies conducted from December 2019 to August 2021 will be included. Quality assessment will be performed according to study type, and Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool will be used for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). If sufficient homogeneous data from RCTs exist, a meta-analysis will be performed. Dichotomous data and continuous data are presented as risk ratios and mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through the publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal or by presentation at a conference.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-03", "cleaned_text": "A Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Mind-Body Modalities to Manage the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Era [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101320](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101320) [Occupational Health and Safety particular, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been exposed to the threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since the early days of the pandemic [ [2](#B2-healthcare-09-01320), [3](#B3-healthcare-09-01320)]. In the early stage of the pandemic, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), undiscovered etiology, strict isolation, high-intensity work, insufficient rest, fear of infection, and lack of a vaccine were major stressors for them [ [2](#B2-healthcare-09-01320), [3](#B3-healthcare-09-01320)]. Since then, some vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed and PPEs have been distributed, but HCWs' mental health is still threatened by a prolonged COVID-19 outbreak. According to a recent meta-analysis, HCWs exposed to stress from COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%) and depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%) compared to experts in other fields [ [4](#B4-healthcare-09-01320)]. Accordingly, the importance of improving the mental health of HCWs has emerged [ [5](#B5-healthcare-09-01320)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-09-01320)]. Previous studies have reported that mind-body modalities such as yoga [ [7](#B7-healthcare-09-01320)], mindfulness-based interventions [ [8](#B8-healthcare-09-01320), [9](#B9-healthcare-09-01320)], and tai chi [ [10](#B10-healthcare-09-01320)] can benefit the health of HCWs. Today, mind-body medicine has re-emerged for its mental health benefits in the context of COVID-19 [ [11](#B11-healthcare-09-01320), [12](#B12-healthcare-09-01320)], and some health systems use mind-body modalities to build strategies to improve the mental health of the public, patients with COVID-19, and HCWs [ [13](#B13-healthcare-09-01320), [14](#B14-healthcare-09-01320)]. [15](#B15-healthcare-09-01320), [16](#B16-healthcare-09-01320)]. Moreover, mind-body modalities are generally considered safe and can also be delivered non-face-to-face in combination with information and communications technology (ICT), making them a promising mental health improvement strategy in the COVID-19 era [ [17](#B17-healthcare-09-01320)]. 2. Materials and Methods [https://osf.io/tudbw](https://osf.io/tudbw); registered on 13 August 2021). Any amendments to this systematic review will be tracked using this registry. This protocol was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement [ [18](#B18-healthcare-09-01320)] ( [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-healthcare-09-01320)). We will report our systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 statement [ [19](#B19-healthcare-09-01320)]. 2.1. Data Sources and Search Strategy [20](#B20-healthcare-09-01320)]) to September 2021: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE via Elsevier, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature via EBSCO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database via EBSCO, and PsycARTICLES via ProQuest. In addition, we will review the reference lists of the relevant literature and manually search Google Scholar to find potentially missing literature, including gray literature. Since our study will include gray literature and literature published in peer-reviewed journals, we will not evaluate the journal reliability of additional literature identified through manual searches in Google Scholar. However, we will indicate the source of the search for all included articles. The search strategy for Medline via PubMed is presented in [Table 1](#healthcare-09-01320-t001). 2.2. Eligibility Criteria [21](#B21-healthcare-09-01320)], but a newly developed assessment tool reflecting the COVID-19 era will also be accepted. Secondary outcomes will include any mental health-related outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and burnout. Safety data of the intervention used are also considered to be a secondary outcome of this review ( [Table 2](#healthcare-09-01320-t002)). 2.3. Study Selection [Figure 1](#healthcare-09-01320-f001)). 2.4. Data Extraction 2.5. Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment [22](#B22-healthcare-09-01320)]. Additionally, to assess RoB, the Cochrane Collaboration RoB tool will be used in RCTs [ [23](#B23-healthcare-09-01320)]. Using this tool, it is possible to evaluate RoB by classifying it into seven domains for the included RCTs. Accordingly, the methodological quality of included RCTs will be assessed in random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other domains with an assessment of \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"unclear.\" In the case of other domains, if the demographic and clinical homogeneity between the treatment and control groups is presented at baseline, it will be evaluated as \"low risk.\" The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions will guide the use of this tool [ [24](#B24-healthcare-09-01320)]. The Quality Assessment of Controlled Intervention Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will be used for CCT [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-01320)]. The Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies with no control group by NHLBI will be used for before-after studies [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-01320)]. Two independent researchers (C.-Y.K. and B.L.) will perform the methodological quality and RoB assessments of the included studies, and any disagreements between the researchers will be resolved through discussion. To prevent potential reporting bias by researchers, we will first perform a risk of bias assessment on three studies by two researchers as a preliminary step and evaluate whether they agree. In addition, the suitability of quality assessment will be evaluated by systematic review experts unrelated to the subjects of this study. 2.6. Data Analysis and Synthesis 2.7. Reporting Bias 2.8. Patient and Public Involvement Statement 3. Discussion [5](#B5-healthcare-09-01320)]. In particular, nurses, female workers, front-line HCWs, younger medical staff, and workers in areas with higher infection rates have been reported to have mental health vulnerabilities in the COVID-19 era [ [26](#B26-healthcare-09-01320)]. Maintaining the mental health and increasing the well-being of HCWs could be considered as a promising strategy to improve humanity's capacity to cope with potential short- and long-term effects during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [ [5](#B5-healthcare-09-01320)]. [7](#B7-healthcare-09-01320), [8](#B8-healthcare-09-01320), [9](#B9-healthcare-09-01320), [10](#B10-healthcare-09-01320)]. In addition, mind-body modalities have recently been delivered in a non-face-to-face manner in a combined form with ICT, so mind-body modalities can be considered as a useful mental health strategy in the context of COVID-19, where social distancing is being emphasized [ [17](#B17-healthcare-09-01320)]. [27](#B27-healthcare-09-01320)]. Importantly, as the team pointed out, guidelines for improving mental health and well-being in HCWs should provide evidence-based recommendations [ [27](#B27-healthcare-09-01320)]. Portella et al., who analyzed relevant systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies, found that traditional, complementary, and integrative medicines, including mind-body modalities, could be useful, especially in the field of mental health, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic [ [28](#B28-healthcare-09-01320)]. In other words, despite the literature reporting the possibility of mind-body modalities being used in mental health problems related to COVID-19, the quantity and quality of the evidence in HCWs have not yet been comprehensively and critically evaluated. This, in turn, may hinder the consideration of mind-body modalities in developing mental health promotion guides for HCWs.
