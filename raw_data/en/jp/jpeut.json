Practitioner, who specialises in natural and chemical detoxification protocols, metabolic rehabilitation by means of orthomolecular interventions and I use dietary, an super-nutritional plans based on the personal bio-chemistry of each patient. I am registered with several international organizations, the International Board for Clinical Metal Toxicology (www.IBCMT.com), Bradford Research Institute (www.americanbiologics.com); International Association of Oral Metal Toxicology (www.IAOMT.org), Auditory Integration Training International Practitioners' Forum (www.AIT-IPF.org) and Autism Research Institute (www.autismwebsite.com/ARI/). The focus of my practice is mainly that of offering assistance with paediatric recovery programmes for autistic children, which incorporates the work of the Defeat Autism Now! Consensus Group for natural recovery of children with autism, although my practice also caters for a vast number of adults with a variety of health problems, in particular cancer (I have a personal history of natural recovery from cancer) and Lyme Disease. My primary focus in detoxification is the use of anti-oxidants, enzyme catalysts and other nutrients to rehabilitate/correct broken detox chemistries in the bodies of my patients, and only, as a last resort, to work with chemical chelators, depending on the severity and the degree of threat to the patient's health and general well-being. Africa (Kenya) Name: Lawrence Degrees/Certifications: have been involved in nutrition therapy for over several years and I love the results that I always get. Africa (South) Name: Theo Verwey Academic Practice. I congratulate Theo Verwey and his colleagues for this remarkable advance in using this concept and in using a simple test, the ratio of pyruvate to lactate as a diagnostic measure, to indicate the dose, duration of treatment etc. I realize that he has made a very complete review of the literature. For instance, not many know about our 1960 studies with oral NAD. (Dr Abram Hoffer, Foreword to the Ebook - NAD Therapy! Too Good to be True). Theo Verwey and his group of clinicians are now the future of this movement to reform medical therapeutics. It is the concept of NAD as a medicine, which must not be ignored the needed research must be allowed, encouraged, the results evaluated, acknowledge and passed on to the young physicians of today.

Rocco incorporates strategies such as optimum nutrition, strategic nutritional supplementation, allergy elimination and the use of certain functional pathology tests in the elucidation and treatment of a number of complex, chronic conditions. Rocco has a particular interest in individually tailored, patient-centred nutrition intervention programs and the justifiable, evidence-based, strategic use of pharmaceutical grade natural nutritional supplements (as a treatment adjunct) in treating the cause of disease and alleviation of patient symptomatology. Rocco has a special interest in how food and nutrition (including nutritional supplementation) is crucial in the treatment of gastrointestinal and liver dysfunction and disorders; neurological/neuropsychiatric conditions such anxiety/depression, ADHD/Autism including learning and behavioural Autoimmune diseases (such as Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis) and people with syndrome x (including people with diabetes, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, obesity) and more. Mr. Rocco Di Vincenzo is a Consultant Dietitian (Accredited Practising Dietitian - APD) and works privately in a variety of clinics around metropolitan Melbourne. Rocco has worked as a Community Senior Dietitian for over a decade and until recently as the Swinburne University Hospital Chief Dietitian. Rocco has completed a Bachelor of Science (Monash University), a Masters in Human Nutrition and Dietetics (Deakin University), Postgraduate qualifications from the Australian College of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine and a Postgraduate Diploma in Nutritional and Environmental Medicine at Swinburne University's Graduate School of Integrative Medicine (GSIM). Rocco is a certified practitioner of NAET (Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique). Rocco has had a keen interest in the area of Integrative Functional Nutritional and Environmental Medicine (IFNEM) for many years and is now formally trained in the area. Rocco is in the process of becoming a qualified DAN (Defeat Autism Now) practitioner. Of particular interest to Rocco is the phenomenon of hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria (little or no stomach acid production) and its potential implication in the development and progression of a variety of chronic diseases as well as a range of undesirable symptoms, including digestive ones. Such is his interest that he is one of the first practitioners in Australia seeking to make available technology (together with Dr. Joseph V. Nastasi) that allows for the objective measurement of gastric acid levels, this via the Heidelberg pH Capsule Gastric Analysis. It is hoped that this technology will be available to patients in the second half of 2009. The nutrition service offered at the variety of venues around metropolitan Melbourne focuses on holistic, integrative and expressive health care, with the ultimate aim of focusing on the treatment of disease rather than simply the allopathic alleviation of symptoms. Nutritional supplements are only recommended when their likely benefit can be clearly demonstrated and clearly as part of a systematic, strategic and goal oriented health plan. Rocco also provides consultations in Italian. Rocco has lectured at Swinburne Graduate School of Integrative Medicine and at the Australian College of Natural Medicine (ACNM). As a result of his past employment as a community Dietitian, Rocco is a strong advocate of community development and health promotion principles, recognising that failure to invest in social infrastructure to help build healthy communities significantly encourages disease development and progression. As a result of his interests, Rocco regularly appears on radio, regularly convenes and facilitates seminars and conferences, lectures to health professionals and the public on a wide variety of topics involving nutrition, and frequently writes articles for both scientific journals and health-oriented magazines. Rocco has recently contributed a chapter in the recently published book: Complementary Therapies and The Management of Diabetes and Vascular Disease: a Matter of Balance - edited by Professor Patricia Dunning, published in 2007. Rocco has established the first Dietitians Working in Integrative Medicine (DWIM) Special Interest Group for Accredited Practising Dietitians in Australia. This group seeks to support, guide and up skill interested Dietitians in this emerging area of medicine and provide them with a supportive base from which they can develop the confidence, skills and expertise to effectively integrate functional medicine principles and practices (including reputable evidence-based nutrition research (incorporating functional foods, pharmaceutical grade nutritional supplements and functional testing techniques) with potential clinical applications in an integrative manner in patient nutrition assessment and intervention.

If you've been to see a doctor lately, chances are, you should have also seen a nutritionist.

Causae Institute of [http://www.cardioretinometry.com](http://www.cardioretinometry.com) Summary : From contact lens practice and the search for a better means of diagnosing primary open angle glaucoma by studying the central artery and vein of the retina for 'nasal shift' (believed to predate the permanent visual field defects that characterise this ultimately blinding disease) came what has been described by medical colleagues as a historic discovery. A an actual change in the structure of the vessels under observation for microscopic displacements within the optic nerve head (disc or papilla) was observed to be apparently associated with the consumption of vitamin C and possibly other antioxidants and nutrients. This has to be fully researched. The new field of optometric diagnosis was discovered in 1999 after the first of the electronic fundus (retinal) camera/microscopes was introduced into the practice in 1998. The procedure was named CardioRetinometry and the intervention protocol was named Nutritional Preventive CardioRetinometry. Informal study has resulted in the discovery that actual reversal of cardiovascular ageing has been recorded for up to ten years with no sign that the limit has been reached. Assuming (as an example) that the regression of atherosclerosis has reached its limit at this time (2008) it might be fairly hypothesised that the period during which the regression of arterial and in many cases venular plaque occurred, would be matched by a similar period during which reversal would take place. Conservatively, since rapid regression has been seen in some cases after abandonment of the lifestyle/dietary measures, it is considered reasonable to halve this period of time and assume that an additional five year period can fairly be predicted before complete reversal to the original vascular state might be observed. This would benefit subjects to the extent of an apparent 15 years extension to their (cardiovascular) life expectancy. Informally the research is proving very rewarding but clearly now that the reversal of retinal vascular pathology has been proved photographically by thousands of images of hundreds of contact lens wearing patients returning with great regularity for 6 monthly examinations, it is clearly a predictable, measurable, and semi-permanent feature of human life. This being so, the origins of disease are being observed. Hypertension is seen to ease with reduction of swelling of veins and recovery of normal curvilinear form of blood vessels which were becoming distorted before reduction of the internal plaque blocking blood flow. Tortuosity of the retinal arteries has been observed to result from lengthening of the vessels between fixed points under excess pressure leading to retinoschisis (splitting) and actual detachment. The Institute of CardioRetinometry was founded to organise research into this new field of optometric/medical investigation and to develop links with other centres interested in this area promising actual life extension.

Biochemical Factors - Many of these factors are biochemical in nature. Some of the biochemical factors that can prevent a person from experiencing ongoing wellness include neurotransmitter imbalances, toxic overload, blood sugar levels, thyroid problems, chemical addictions, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, Candida, poor diet choices, hormonal sensitivities and food allergies. Neurotransmitter imbalances are common. If an individual complains of chronic depression, they are likely suffering from low serotonin levels. If they suffer from a lack of ego drive, their dopamine level may be insufficient or their thyroid gland may be malfunctioning. They may be suffering from high anxiety, which can be caused by heavy metal toxicity, their blood sugar level, or low inhibitory neurotransmitter levels. If they suffer from chronic physical or emotional pain, the cause may very well be low endorphin levels. Our collaborating physicians can easily test for any or all of these conditions. They can also easily test for food allergies, which, along with heavy metal toxicities, are persistent factors in a broad spectrum of psychiatric and biological symptoms. At Alternative to Meds Center, we use this information to develop a specifically targeted repair strategy for the client. This repair strategy includes whole foods, pharmaceutical-grade supplementary nutrients to enhance proper neurotransmitter production and balance, and the elimination of allergically reactive foods from the client's diet. In addition, a client's targeted strategy may include reducing Candida, promoting healthy gut pH and flora and a sauna detoxification and purification regimen. For both drinking and cooking, we even use mineralized, ionized and filtered water. Lab testing- We are currently doing DMPS heavy metal challenge, Immunolabs 121 food allergy panel, Genova Nutreval, and Comprehensible Metabolic and CBC with differential as well as Thyroid and other hormones We help our clients re-establish the balanced biochemical factors for experiencing a natural sense of wellness and well-being. Medications - Dr Les Adler manages our clients' medical needs. He is expert at significantly reducing or completely eliminating medications. Alternative to Meds Center is a leader in the field of medication tapering protocols. Our tapering protocols are the best and most gentle protocol designs available, and are used by Dr Adler to help our clients free themselves from dependencies. Under their direction, our clients can reduce or eliminate the use of opiates, including Methadone and Oxycontin, anti-anxiety and all SSRI and SNRI medications. Finally, for prospective clients who qualify for our services, we also work with clients to reduce their dependencies on anti-psychotics. Therapeutic Factors - It is clear that in order for us, as human organisms, to live enriched, fulfilling lives, we need to immerse ourselves in a social ambience of healthy emotional exchange. We have an innate sensitivity to identifying, isolating and removing barriers to our emotional well-being. At Alternative to Meds Center, we collaborate with local community therapists who intimately understand the plights of our clients, and their specific desires to holistically address their wellness issues. As the emotional balancing we help clients establish through nutritional interventions and medication management take hold, the experience of our clients is they are much more able to engage in productive therapy. This makes therapy rewarding for both therapists and clients. Our clients are more aware, attentive, fundamentally present and resonant. Our therapists are able to be more effective in achieving change that persists from session to session. Adjunct Therapies - Many people who do not experience an ongoing sense of wellness and well-being are, to some degree, removed or dissociated from their bodies. In order to calm and quiet their minds, and re-establish a conscious connection with their bodies, our clients engage and participate in the traditions of yoga. They can also participate in other adjunct therapies that include meditation, cranio-electric stimulation, massage, exercise and acupuncture.

Name: Aaron Blackledge Academic Degrees/Certifications: MD, Alternative to Meds Center Address: Guerero to Meds Center, we investigate the factors that prevent our clients from experiencing wellness. Biochemical Factors - Many of these factors are biochemical in nature. Some of the biochemical factors that can prevent a person from experiencing ongoing wellness include neurotransmitter imbalances, toxic overload, blood sugar levels, thyroid problems, chemical addictions, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, Candida, poor diet choices, hormonal sensitivities and food allergies. Neurotransmitter imbalances are common. If an individual complains of chronic depression, they are likely suffering from low serotonin levels. If they suffer from a lack of ego drive, their dopamine level may be insufficient or their thyroid gland may be malfunctioning. They may be suffering from high anxiety, which can be caused by heavy metal toxicity, their blood sugar level, or low inhibitory neurotransmitter levels. If they suffer from chronic physical or emotional pain, the cause may very well be low endorphin levels. Our collaborating physicians can easily test for any or all of these conditions. They can also easily test for food allergies, which, along with heavy metal toxicities, are persistent factors in a broad spectrum of psychiatric and biological symptoms. At Alternative to Meds Center, we use this information to develop a specifically targeted repair strategy for the client. This repair strategy includes whole foods, pharmaceutical-grade supplementary nutrients to enhance proper neurotransmitter production and balance, and the elimination of allergically reactive foods from the client's diet. In addition, a client's targeted strategy may include reducing Candida, promoting healthy gut pH and flora and a sauna detoxification and purification regimen. For both drinking and cooking, we even use mineralized, ionized and filtered water. We help our clients re-establish the balanced biochemical factors for experiencing a natural sense of wellness and well-being. Medications - Dr. Joel Lopez and Dr. Aaron Blackledge manage our clients' medical needs. Dr. Lopez is a a holistic MD and the director of the San Francisco Preventative Health Hospital. Dr. Blackledge is an addiction medicine specialist. Both are experts at significantly reducing or completely eliminating medications. Alternative to Meds Center is a leader in the field of medication tapering protocols. Our tapering protocols are the best and most gentle protocol designs available, and are used by Dr's. Lopez and Blackledge to help our clients free themselves from dependencies. Under their direction, our clients can reduce or eliminate the use of opiates, including Methadone and Oxycontin, anti-anxiety and all SSRI and SNRI medications. Finally, for prospective clients who qualify for our services, we also work with clients to reduce their dependencies on anti-psychotics. Therapeutic Factors - It is clear that in order for us, as human organisms, to live enriched, fulfilling lives, we need to immerse ourselves in a social ambience of healthy emotional exchange. We have an innate sensitivity to identifying, isolating and removing barriers to our emotional well-being. At Alternative to Meds Center, we collaborate with local community therapists who intimately understand the plights of our clients, and their specific desires to holistically address their wellness issues. As the emotional balancing we help clients establish through nutritional interventions and medication management take hold, the experience of our clients is they are much more able to engage in productive therapy. This makes therapy rewarding for both therapists and clients. Our clients are more aware, attentive, fundamentally present and resonant. Our therapists are able to be more effective in achieving change that persists from session to session. Adjunct Therapies - Many people who do not experience an ongoing sense of wellness and well-being are, to some degree, removed or dissociated from their bodies. In order to calm and quiet their minds, and re-establish a conscious connection with their bodies, our clients engage and participate in the traditions of yoga. They can also participate in other adjunct therapies that include meditation, cranio-electric stimulation, massage, exercise and acupuncture. All of these adjunct therapies help the body re-establish itself as a pleasurable, habitable place. A place our clients reclaim fundamentally. A place they want and love to be.

I also research and write articles, and am soon launching an online magazine, The True Health Journal, when I complete my BS degree in Nutrition Science in 36 days, at a GPA of 3.98 from Kaplan online university. My holistic educational adventure with Clayton College, where I earned my BS and MS in Holistic Nutrition, taught me more about healing the human body and achieving vibrant health than the traditional education I am about to complete. My research papers and articles have emphasized the benefits of orthomolecular, traditional naturopathic and &\"alternative\"; medicines, and I have, on occasion, refuted the false, misled statements about nutrients put out by others, including the m edia, and physicians. I have had many discussions with physicians about the restorative benefits of nutritional therapy, politely but assertively challenging their notion that their is a lack of scientific evidence. I have been sad for clients when I hand them hardcopies of scientific data from reputable university studies for their physicians to review, but which they refuse to look at, and am worried about my clients when their physicians reply to my correspondence with tragic close-mindedness, even with credible, irrefutable evidence at their fingertips. I am invited to speak to various groups interested in getting well, and will accelerate my efforts to increase the word of true health through my website, blog and eBooks after completing my degree. My factual seminars have had profound impacts on my audiences lives on the subject of the superior nutritional quality of organic foods, a holistic approach to exercise, enlightening them about the politics and business of conventional agriculture, genetically modified foods, toxic environmental chemicals that affect food, air and water quality, toxic personal care and household products effect on their health and the environment, and solutions for green living individuals can easily implement.

Kaslow, MD, FACP Academic Degrees/Certifications: MD Clinic: Jeremy E. Inc 720 strive to provide more than just rapid relief of your immediate symptoms. I focus on your overall health examining nutritional, metabolic, immune, hormonal, structural, and toxicologic factors. We want you to eat well, move well, think well, be resilient to whatever challenges you on your journey and have functional reserves. Most conditions whether it involves heart disease, fatigue, arthritis, cancer, headaches, chronic infections, allergies, elevated cholesterol, depression, anxiety, PMS, menopause, autism, diabetes, osteoporosis, etc. are manageable if the underlying causes are more fully understood. That doesn't mean I use the latest fad or herb to cover up your symptoms. Rather I apply scientific principles in a practical and logical way for you to solve your medical needs. There are five management principles that need to be addressed to make certain that your health program will enable you to harness the remarkable healing capabilities of the human body-- Disease can be considered your body's attempt to compensate physiologically for not providing these five essential demands. Your success depends on our close Doctor / Patient relationship. That means asking the right questions, careful listening, complete examinations of your physical and biochemical state and understanding how you function within your own environment. If necessary, select labs that identify your nutritional needs, allergies, hormonal status, metabolic efficiency, etc. can be performed. When it is all put together, a practical and personalized plan will be agreed upon that is designed to not only get rid of symptoms you don't have to live with but also create a healthier, happier, more vital you. Moreover, I know that you shouldn't wait until something bad happens. Disease and discomfort does not occur by chance. True preventive care depends on more than just early disease detection. Understanding what creates dysfunction and disease helps prevent problems before they ever develop. This means that we need to look for indicators of health or dysfunction even when there are no obvious outward signs or laboratory tests.

One of the main goals of our office, and indeed this website, is to educate patients on the differences between our approach to a patient's health and what he or she may be used to. Since this is a chiropractic office, many patients take me to be a \"back doctor\". While chiropractic helps with back pain, what chiropractors truly specialize in is the central nervous system. The central nervous system just happens to be encased in the spine and skull. Further, the practice of Applied Kinesiology allows the doctor to go beyond examination of the structural components of health and into the chemical and emotional, as well. This allows us to treat a greater variety of patients! We can help you get past your pain, but we can also help your body recover from problems that many people (often mistakenly) think they need drugs or surgery for. This office has had great success with digestive, endocrine, liver, and many other INTERNAL problems as well as all manner of musculo-skeletal problems. We believe it makes sense to try the simplest, least invasive approach first to try to fix a problem.
