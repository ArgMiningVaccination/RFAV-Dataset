Despite, or perhaps because of, the success of the immunisation programme in the United Kingdom a vocal minority of parents have cast doubt on the wisdom of having their children immunised, particularly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.2 Not only does this place their own children at risk, but if a significant number of children remain unimmunised it poses a risk to the general population.3 In this article we suggest how health professionals, particularly those within the primary healthcare team, can respond to parents' concerns. #### Summary points Immunisation has saved millions of lives The routine vaccines are safe The eradication of diseases preventable by vaccines throws undue prominence on unconfirmed adverse reactions Vaccine scares are common Parental concerns should be taken seriously Health professionals have a duty to provide accurate information to enable parents to make a truly informed decision about their child's vaccinations Our approach is based on a number of surveys showing the reasons for non-immunisation,4 5 books,2 6 articles written by those antagonistic to vaccination,7 8 and personal experience of talking to thousands of parents. Information used to respond to parental concerns (box 1) is based on extensive knowledge of both \"mainstream\" and \"fringe\" literature. ### Box 1 :Parental objections to immunisation and response to these objections #### The disease is not serious Measles can kill healthy children. #### The disease is uncommon Diseases such as measles, diphtheria, and polio are common in unimmunised populations and are easily spread worldwide. ...

It is acknowledged (1) that parental concerns should be taken seriously and also that no vaccine is 100% effective or safe. But how often do parents 'routinely' receive this information from the immunisation providers? When parents take their children for immunisations, consent is implied. However, does it not fall short of 'informed' consent? Such a practice provides ammunition to the anti-immunisation rhetoric. Subra Vemulpad Lecturer Macquarie University Sydney NSW Elliman D. Concerns about immunisation. BMJ 2000;320:240-243 Competing interests: No competing interests Editor-Bedford and Elliman expound well on addressing parental concerns regarding immunisation. They conclude that health professionals should treat parental concerns seriously, and that accurate information should be provided.1 In Bath, we offer an immunisation hotline telephone service, which professionals, parents, and adolescents can access.2 Administration staff who have access to computerised records answer calls, and clinical queries are passed on to a paediatrician. This resource provides information and is also a point where concerns can be expressed and addressed. This is especially important with the introduction of a new vaccine, or a change in the immunisation schedule. The meningococcal C vaccine campaign began in October 1999 and since then to mid-February 2000, paediatricians have taken a total of 194 calls. 37% of queries were directly related to the meningococcal C vaccine. Of all calls relating to meningococcal C vaccine, 44% were from parents, 0.03% from adolescents, and 55.97% from professionals (general practitioners, health visitors and their assistants, practice nurses and managers, and school nurses). 87% of these calls regarding meningococcal C vaccine were answered in 5 minutes or less. Examples of parental questions ranged from general concerns such as management of children with needle phobia, to specific questions about vaccine safety, and eligibility of a child to be vaccinated. Parents also asked about detailed information not available in leaflets, and specific questions that they felt had not been fully addressed by primary health care professionals. We feel that a telephone immunisation service is an effective and time- efficient means of answering queries from both parents and professionals. It addresses concerns and leads to an increased uptake in immunisations.

Ambulatory child health 1999;5 :295-302 Competing interests: No competing interests Bedford and Elliman' s paper(1) is a welcome start to the debate on immunisation concerns of the parents. They acknowledge that underreporting of adverse reactions is a major problem. It follows that the reassurance they suggest in Box 1 about monitoring is a little premature. The Committee on Safety of Medicines as well as those responsible for administering the vaccines should construct better systems of monitoring. Currently immunisation attracts a fee per item of service. Perhaps we should consider an additional fee for collection of adverse effects. Goldberg (2) suggests the creation of nation-wide data base of children with autism and their familial, social, health and immunisation variables. This should be easy - surely every child health department already holds the relevant data on computer. All that is needed is to make the anonymised data available to any statistician. (Restricting the data to any particular set of workers may well lead to the charge of bias.) Given that poliomyelitis due to the wild virus is now extinct in the UK, perhaps it is time we switched to the inactivated vaccine. This would extinguish the risk, howsoever small, of vaccine-virus induced paralysis. J K ANAND Retired public health physician Refs. 1. Bedford H, Elliman D.

BMJ 2000;320:389 Competing interests: No competing interests Sir, I thought I had been very careful in my letter NOT to actually state that these organisations are opposed outright to vaccination, or that they support it unquestioningly; what I said is they do not support it. I would contend that there could be a large difference between not supporting something and opposing it. Is it safe to conclude that because I do not support Bradford City, that I am opposed to them? The problem is more or less as I stated in my letter, that homeopaths are uncomfortable about vaccination in general. Some are more uncomfortable than others are. Some oppose it strongly, while others accept it. Most are sceptical of its benefits while being cognisant of its possible dangers. I think that is a fair account of the matter. At no point did I use the word 'formal'. We are in danger of splitting hairs here. If Mr Dean's aim is to point out a factual inaccuracy, then it is probably a flawed attempt, as it assumes that I have stated that this issue is straightforward. It isn't; it is very blurred. It also assumes that these professional bodies have tight governing control over, or reflect the general opinions of, homeopaths in the field. They don't always; their members are at liberty to form their own views on such matters. Homeopaths are only loosely answerable to these professional bodies on doctrinal matters. And on such emotive and divisive issues as vaccination, they are accountable to no-one but their own consciences. What therefore is the point Mr Dean is trying to make? However, I willingly apologise if I was guilty of including any factual error in my letter. I must also thank this writer for raising an interesting new point, which I had not seen before, about the relationship between a controlling body and the views and beliefs of those it claims to represent. I also thank Mr Dean for inspiring me to convey, in more detail than before, the extent of anti-vaccinationism within homeopathy today. Whether a specific organisation supports, does not support, or opposes the vaccination technique, what I said in my letter still applies: homeopaths are generally uncomfortable with and ambivalent towards vaccination. They regard it as an unwanted and integral element of allopathic medicine, which they never seek to promote. Many believe it is toxic, suppressive and can cause damage. If Mr Dean had read the other letters eBMJ has published, especially several by John Heptonstall, he would have apprehended a plethora of evidence, from within holistic medicine generally, of people who are opposed to vaccination or who do not support it. Moreover, for a whole range of different reasons. The Society of Homeopaths certainly used to issue a leaflet on this subject. While not outrightly opposing vaccination, it did suggest that parents should seek the widest possible advice about it. Why did they do that, if they wholeheartedly support vaccination? They clearly did it because they recognise a possible danger about the subject, and it reflects the fact that throughout their own history homeopaths have more or less consistently opposed it as a damaging, suppressive technique, that generates ill-health. Thus, it is no more correct to say that all homeopaths are opposed to vaccination than it is to say they all support it. The vast majority is ambivalent or sceptical. As for the HMA, which Mr Dean has specifically referred to, I am advised by Simon King, a homeopath practising in Norwich, and a Council member of that body, that no such policy on vaccination has so far been devised, but, and I quote his private email to me [of 2 Feb 2000]: 'They just don't advocate allopathy per se, as they are promoting a system, which is opposite to it. Vaccination is allopathy, so they won't promote it. That's not the same as damning it. I think what they say is people have a choice, a choice based on having more than allopathy to choose from, that allopathy doesn't have the monopoly on effective health care.' As for the ICM Register, that used to be controlled by Sheilagh Creasy, a very firm Kentian homeopath, who now mainly teaches in the USA. She is widely regarded as one of the foremost classical homeopaths in the world, and she is renowned for her firm views on the dangers of allopathic suppression, of using single dose of high potency remedy, chosen along Kentian lines, and for her strong views against all forms of drugging and vaccination, which she believes frequently constitute root causes of much modern pathology. Suppression of disease, by strong drugs and inappropriate techniques like vaccination, into the deeper, interior layers of the organism, is, of course, a fundamental axiom of the Kentian approach. Such views are fairly widespread within homeopathy today [see quotes below by Vithoulkas]. Moreover, it is not really the controlling bodies that formulate, reinforce or control the beliefs of homeopaths, as this writer seems to suggest in his letter, but the major figures and the major writers within the movement, who much more deeply impress their beliefs upon the movement as a whole. Thus, the idea that these professional bodies have an official view about vaccination, which is enforced upon the mass of homeopaths, is misleading. Whatever 'formal views' they may espouse in documents, homeopaths can take or leave them with impunity. Their views and beliefs are determined much more by the main figures, who dominate the movement, than by the controlling bodies. This apparently removes the central supporting pillar of this writer 's main complaint. Of even greater significance to our discussion, are the actual stated views of some leading modern homeopaths. To illustrate this point, let us consult the writings of the foremost homeopath in the modern world, and the leading light of the entire movement, George Vithoulkas. He has this to say about vaccination: 'Vaccination is cited by many as being an example of the allopathic use of the Law of Similars. Superficially, this would appear to be true...however, vaccinations are administered to entire populations without any consideration of individuality. Each individual will have a unique degree of susceptibility to any vaccine, yet it is administered without regard to the uniqueness of the individual. Therefore, the concept of vaccination is almost the precise opposite of the principles of homeopathy; it is indiscriminate administration of a foreign substance to everyone, regardless of state of health or individual sensitivity.' [Vithoulkas, George, 1980, The Science of Homeopathy, Grove Press, New York, p.113] '...in homeopathy any chronic condition which can be traced to a vaccination is called a 'vaccinosis'. Dr. J Compton Burnett presents his very detailed cases which demonstrate clearly that vaccinations can have profoundly disturbing and lasting influences on the health of susceptible individuals...the fact that vaccinosis is indeed due to vaccination and not merely coincidence is seen by the fact that many cases are dramatically benefited by administration of a potentized preparation of the particular vaccine used.' [Vithoulkas, pp.115-6] 'Such cases can be quoted in great numbers by any homeopath who takes the time to elucidate the complete history of the patient. Thus even something as popular and widespread as vaccination - one of the so-called major 'successes' of modern medicine - can be a large-scale factor in the degenerating health of our populations.' [Ibid. p.116] 'How does a person acquire a predisposition to illness...? As we know, powerful acute ailments, allopathic drugs, and vaccinations are major factors...' [Ibid. pp.120-1] 'It is natural to inquire into the evolution of the present pathological state of the patient...what eliciting causes can be considered as factors in producing the symptoms? In particular, the evolution of the pathological state of the patient should focus on the following major influences: 1. Any mental or emotional shocks.... 2. Any major illness... 3. Any treatments given throughout the life of the patient... 4. Vaccinations, which have been administered and the patient's reactions to them.' [Ibid. pp.175-6] I think these quotes demonstrate, that leading, modern homeopaths - whose written works are regarded as influential texts upon the attitudes of the movement - are just as resolutely opposed to vaccination, on therapeutic grounds, as many of their forebears. In addition, this stands in stark contrast to the UK Faculty of Homeopathy's stated position on this subject, and that claimed by Mr Dean on behalf of the main professional bodies in the UK. I therefore stand by my original remarks. On balance, therefore, vaccination appears to be something of a Russian roulette game, in which it cannot be predicted with much certainty whether your own precious child will be damaged by any kind of injection or not. It is an emotional matter, of course, for any parent, but these are the kind of factors, which people try - desperately and probably unsuccessfully - to evaluate, whenever they have to consider this very difficult problem. Moreover, in that sense, I think homeopaths, and others, are perfectly entitled to be uncertain and sceptical over this issue. Regards Peter Morrell Competing interests: No competing interests Re: Vaccines - cause celebre or bete noir? Peter Morrell Re: Concerns about immunisation. Helen Bedford and David Elliman Peter Morrell claims that the 3 registers of professional NMQ homeopaths in the UK formally oppose immunization: 'It is significant that not one of these three bodies supports the use of vaccination, and, indeed, they warn patients that it can be a dangerous practice.' I am aware of no such policy on the part of the Homeopathic Medical Association (formerly UKHMA), of which I am a member, and think it is unlikely that the other registers would endorse such a policy. Regards Michael Emmans Dean Department of Health Sciences & Clinical Evaluation, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom Competing interests: No competing interests I was interested to read the joint response to the paper by Bedford and Elliman by workers at the Department of Public Health & Community Medicine, University of Sydney. They comment: \"Our own research on anti-vaccination press reportage has shown that manifest claims about vaccines being dangerous and ineffective tend to be located under a canopy of more general discourses about cover-up and conspiracy, manipulation by venal private enterprise interests, governments with totalitarian agendas and the back-to-nature idyll. [3] We argue that what generates the appeal of anti-vaccination claims is underlying reference to these wider issues.\" This statement intrigues me as it seems to portray a picture of objections to vaccination coming from those who are fearful but not actually experienced by having a child who has been damaged by vaccination. As workers in the Department of Public Health & Community Medicine, University of Sydney, I can understand their primary concern is to seek a situation of herd immunity in local populations. If they want most parents to accept that proposition then governments must take the step of accepting current research that indicates some children can be harmed by some vaccinations in some circumstances, and create a fund from which adequate compensation can be offered. Without that support it will not be surprising if many parents continue to be fearful of a potential outcome which, if realised, will leave them and their child in a compromised position for the rest of their lives. Competing interests: No competing interests Bedford and Elliman [1] provide a useful summary of the main evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. The authors suggest that their evidence-based refutations of erroneous beliefs commonly expressed by immunisation defaulters may be useful in dispelling their concerns. This assumes that those who express these beliefs are simply mistaken and when exposed to counter-arguments they will realize this. While we believe it will always be important for scientists and health professionals to refute misleading information, there is little empirical support for the hope that decision making about vaccination is based on 'facts' alone. In their research on cognitive processes in vaccination decision making, Meszaros et al demonstrated that when parents opposed to the DPT vaccine were presented with factual information about risks and benefits they became more committed to their antipathetic position. This response was moderated by underlying values about death and chronic disability. [2] Our own research on anti-vaccination press reportage has shown that manifest claims about vaccines being dangerous and ineffective tend to be located under a canopy of more general discourses about cover-up and conspiracy, manipulation by venal private enterprise interests, governments with totalitarian agendas and the back-to-nature idyll. [3] We argue that what generates the appeal of anti-vaccination claims is underlying reference to these wider issues. We are now undertaking qualitative research with parents and immunisation providers in an attempt to explore the nature of the appeal of both immunisation rhetoric and reassurances by providers. While this work is incomplete, we have been impressed by how frequently parents in focus group discussions are adamant that they want to be given the \"facts\", but demonstrate minimal retention of \"facts\" when exposed to TV items containing pro- and anti-immunisation claims. What is retained, discussed and prompts strong responses from participants are images of children who are allegedly vaccine-damaged. In other words, the facts have little potency when competing with the very emotive news stories found in the mass media. Any attempt at refuting or deflating the persuasive power of vaccination arguments must address the potential 'gut' level appeal at which anti-immunisation rhetoric tends to operate. What we have learned about immunisation science will be of no public value ultimately if we ignore key lessons from health communication science. References 1. Bedford H, Elliman D.

Competing interests: No competing interests Sir, I think this article is highly misleading to your readers in two very important respects. Firstly, for trying to portray support for vaccination from homeopathy. Secondly, in trying to over-interpret scant figures. It is not true that all homeopaths, at all times, have supported vaccination. Far from it. In fact, the majority of them have had profound difficulty in accepting this technique. I shall offer some reference material below in support of this statement. Nor is it true that the Faculty of Homeopathy represents anything more than a minority of medically qualified doctors, who until the 1970s never amounted to more than 300 practitioners in the UK, and for most of this century hovered around the 200 mark. The vast majority of practitioners today are medically unqualified and are represented by three different professional bodies and registers: the Society of Homeopaths, the Institute of Complementary Medicine (ICM) and the UKHMA. Together, they total fast approaching 2000 practitioners, and represent at least three quarters of the entire profession in the UK. It is significant that not one of these three bodies supports the use of vaccination, and, indeed, they warn patients that it can be a dangerous practice. It is only recently, within the last twenty years or so, that the Faculty has adopted a pro-vaccination stance. I suspect it is an attempt to draw them closer to mainstream medicine, by reducing areas of conflict and friction. Moreover, the Faculty of Homeopathy had previously adopted a very different attitude on this issue. It was strongly influenced by the views and techniques of the American homeopath, Dr James Tyler Kent, from about 1903 until well into the 1970s [see Morrell, 2000; and Winston, pp.203-4]. Moreover, his metaphysical, anti-bacterial and anti-vaccination views of homeopathy can be very clearly judged from his writings: \"Man cannot be made sick or be cured except by some substance as ethereal in quality as the Vital Force.[Kent] \"The tendency for the human mind to run after the visible, that can be felt with the fingers, leads one to adopt foolish theories like the Bacteria doctrine and the molecular theory. [Kent] \"Most doctors have gone crazy over the vicious Microbe as being the cause of disease, and think the little fellows are exceedingly dangerous. As a matter of fact they are scavengers. Shortly after death, a prick with a scalpel is a serious matter, but when the cadaver has become green and is filled with bacteria, it is comparatively harmless. [Kent] \"The microbe is not the cause of disease. We should not be carried away by these idle allopathic dreams and vain imaginations, but should correct the Vital Force. [Kent] \"The Bacterium is an innocent feller, and if he carries disease he carries the Simple Substance which causes disease, just as an elephant would.\" [Kent] \"It is not from external things that man becomes sick, not from bacteria nor environment, but from causes within himself.\" [Kent] \"Whenever a man settles all things by his eyes, and fingers, pseudo- science and theories, he reasons from lasts to firsts; in other words, from himself, and is insane.\" [Kent] \"If we have material ideas of disease we will have material ideas of the means of cure.\" [Kent]. \"The doctrine of the Vital Force is not admitted by the teachers of physiology, yet without the vital force, without simple substance, without the internal as well as the external, there can be no cause and no relation between cause and effect.\" [all the above quotes from Kent's Aphorisms] Thus, it is quite simply untrue that homeopaths accept and endorse vaccination. At its best, it is regarded as a crude example of the 'law of similars', and it is probably that viewpoint which Hahnemann had in mind when he made approving comments about Jenner and cowpox in the 1790s. Thus, these authors have chosen deliberately to give a highly simplistic and misleading impression of the view of most homeopaths towards vaccination. \"Homeopathy is opposed to the use...of drugs in physiological doses...to methods of and to 'group treatment' depends for all its results upon the dynamical action of single, pure, 1924, 'the dynamis' and 'the life force'. This is Hahnemann's greatest discovery, and the absolute bedrock of his system.' [Close, p.32] 'The homeopathic opposition to the use of vaccines has its roots in the work of Dr James Compton Burnett, who was the first to conceptualize that a vaccine...could cause a deep-seated illness, vaccinosis...treatable by the use of homeopathic remedies...so the homeopath, since before the turn of the century, has viewed vaccines as inherently dangerous to the human economy.' [Winston, 1999, pp.247-8] The 'law of similars' was not originally conceived by Hahnemann; it was mentioned by the early Greeks and Galen and used extensively by Paracelsus and the English physician, Thomas Sydenham [1624-1689]. It is also made use of in folk medicine, such as recommending heat for burns and cold for frostbite. In a crude form, it also manifested in the vaccination experiments of Edward Jenner [1749-1823]. It is a remarkable fact of history that Jenner's first experiments with Cowpox in Dorset in the summer of 1796, coincided with Hahnemann's publication of his Essay On a New Principle, both concerning the 'law of similars'. Hahnemann refers positively and at length to Jenner's experiments with cow-pox in paragraph 46 of his Organon [mentioned by Wolff, p.240, and by Rothstein, p.157], which can be viewed online at: http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/organon.html However, we should treat these comments with some caution, firstly, because Jenner was an early medical experimentalist, like Hahnemann, an approach he greatly admired, and which must have predisposed him towards Jenner's work; secondly, though vaccination is a crude example of the law of similars, it also contravenes the individualisation of disease symptoms, which is so central an impulse within homeopathic philosophy: '...cure is always individual, in the concrete case or patient, never in the generalised disease; and that such a thing as a specific cure for a disease does not, and, in the nature of things, cannot exist, since no two cases of the same disease, are ever the same.' [Close, 1924, p.94] I thus fail to see how Hahnemann today could approve of the widespread and routine immunisation of all children. 'In Germany, contemporary homeopaths, as well as adherents of sectarian medicine in general, are known to be critical towards immunization.' [Wolff, p.218] '...research on the historiography of vaccination recognised the phenomenon that anti-vaccinationism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had a deep response among adherents of non-regular medicine.' [Wolff, knows what disastrous side-effects vaccinations are able to trigger.' .' [in Wolff, p.219] By the end of the 19th century, it was becoming clear to physicians that in the causation of disease, it was not the apparent presence or absence of 'germs' [as had first been thought], which was the main concern, but the precise level of susceptibility to them possessed by the individual. According to regular physicians, that level of susceptibility was entirely due to 'antibodies', which could be generated or induced artificially, on demand, through the inoculation procedure. Moreover, plainly, according to most homeopaths, that susceptibility was down to the activity of an immaterial vital force, or life principle, inherent in the organism, and not to any physical and chemical process per se. On theoretical grounds, therefore, that clearly divides the two groups of practitioners. However, having said all that, the matter is slightly more complex. It is also true that some homeopaths chose, of their own volition, to accept vaccination as a valid procedure and they did not take the view that it was harmful at all. This latter interpretation was down to individuals over which the movement as a whole clearly had little control. 'While homeopaths before the Civil War had vacillated over the question of smallpox vaccination...the use of antisepsis could be clearly linked to Hahnemann's call for physicians to prevent disease, and many saw serums and vaccines as an expression of homeopathic law.' [Warner, p.44] 'Van Eden pointed to the interest in homeopathy on the part of religiously orthodox circles such as a the example of Abraham Kuyper. He was opposed to vaccination, like Hahnemann, or rather in Kuyper's case compulsory vaccination...' [Hofstra, p.102] A lot of very useful background historical information about vaccination and how it first developed is given in Blake's article in Leavitt and Numbers. Regarding the data presented in this article, the vaccination data supplied in the table looks highly suspect. It looks like a classic case of massaging figures to get whatever 'spin' out of them you like. I would make the following questions about it: 1. More data is required concerning the number of cases and deaths BEFORE the years given, in order to draw the type of conclusions from the data that the authors seem so eager to make. 2. By how much were these diseases in decline BEFORE immunisation was introduced? 3. By how much did their decline accelerate or slow down AFTER the introduction of vaccination for these diseases? 4. To what extent can the vaccination programmes truly be causally connected to the decline of the diseases? 5. Most homeopaths are against vaccination regardless of what the Faculty say. What is the homeopathic principle that dictates that the serum of a virus should be inoculated into all people, when homeopathy contends that all disease is expressed and must be treated upon the sole basis of utterly individualised symptoms? 6. Is it proven beyond reasonable doubt that homeopathic vaccines do not work. Can we please see some evidence for this claim? The article seems to convey to the reader the strong and unambiguous impression that the figures presented demonstrate conclusively that vaccination has caused the decline of these diseases. This is certainly questionable, as many of them were in massive decline before a single vaccine was introduced. This certainly applies to Diphtheria, Tuberculosis, Whooping Cough and Measles. Such a graph, for the USA and TB, is shown in Leavitt and Numbers, p.6, and for Diphtheria on p.8. These graphs clearly show that TB was all but extinct before vaccination against it was introduced. The same pattern holds true for Diphtheria. Similar data can be invoked for the UK and all these infections. The article also seeks, unashamedly in my view, to give the strong and unambiguous impression that all homeopaths accept and endorse vaccination as a safe technique. They do not. And historically, they have opposed it from its first introduction, regardless of what Hahnemann said: 'In 1879 William Tebb, the leading British anti-vaccinationist came to New York, and the Anti-vaccination Society of America was founded.'

Many of these medics are desperate to serve their patients well, yet they do not ask the right questions, seek the right answers, and therefore fail those patients who are damaged by vaccine policy. For those who wish to know the facts; the enduring MYTHS are that:- A. Vaccines are generally safe. B. Vaccines almost always work/are efficacious C. Vaccine science is generally accurate The facts that prove the mythical basis for the above:- A. Vaccines are generally safe - MYTH supported by BMJ papers written by Bedford and Elliman (1)\"the routine vaccines are safe\"; J. Claire Bramley (2) \"vaccination programmes of proven worth\"; Prof Edzard Ernst \"some complementary medicine practitioners put their patients at risk thro' their attitude to immunisation\" (3); Begg & Nicholl (whole article) (4). - they all imply that vaccines and vaccinations are inherently safe despite 1. From 1979 onwards pertussis vaccine was excluded in Sweden due to fears for its safety and efficacy(5) 2. From July 1990 thro' April 1994, 5799 ADRs following MMR vaccination were reported to US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS); including 3063 cases requiring emergency medical treatment, 616 hospitalisations, 309 who did not recover, 54 children left disabled and 30 deaths. Due to massive underreporting these are considered only 10-15% of the total number of ADRs (6) 3. In 1973 one study described 80 cases of neurologic disorder starting within 30 days of live measles vaccination (JAMA 1973;233(13):1459-62) 4. Convulsions after measles vaccine occurred in 1 in every 526 cases (Prod Roy Soc Med, 1974;67:24) 5. Millions of children who received the Salk vaccine in the 1950s were infected with Simian Virus 40 (SV40); SV-40 and similar agents have since been recovered from human brain tumours and also precancerous conditions in the brain; SV-40 was shown to cause cancer in hamsters after the equivalent of 20 human years.(WDDTY vaccination handbook, p17) 6. The Rubini vaccine, used in Europe for many years, was shown to be virtually useless by the mid-'90s and probably responsible for many outbreaks of mumps during the '80s and '90s with resultant morbidity. (7) 7. Finland 'eradicated' mumps measles and rubella by mass vaccination from 1982 with two doses of live virus vaccines. \"the 99% decrease in these diseases was accompanied by an increasing rate of 'false positive clinical diagnoses'\" - \"In 655 vaccinated patients with clinically diagnosed disease, serologic studies confirmed presence of measles in only 0.8%, mumps in 2.0%, rubella in 1.2%.\" (8) The question I would now ask is, Finland replaced measles, mumps and rubella with \"approximately 655 cases\" of WHAT? 8. DTP vaccination resulted in convulsions within 3 days in 1 in 4200 children; measles of MMR resulted in convulsions within 6-11 days in 1 in 1000 children; Urabe mumps vaccine caused convulsions in 1 in 866 children in 15-35 days (and an outbreak of bacterial meningitis in 1992 resulting in it being withdrawn from use); MMR caused idiopathic thromocytopaenic purpura (ITP) within 1 in 8000 children. (9) 9. \"Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome after a further attenuated measles vaccination\" (10) 10. Finland eradicated M,M and R by mass vaccinations starting from 1982; from 1987 Finland's rate of Insulin Dependent Diabetes (IDDM) in under 15 year olds increased by 40%, its rate of IDDM is THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. (8) 11. \"In the past two decades ('70s and '80s) Finland's IDDM incidence rose by 57%\" (11); the highest rise between 1987 and 1996 was in 1-4 year old children (1987-93 rate of 36/100,000 p.a. rose by 1996 to 45/100,000 p.a.)

Hepatitis B vaccine starting at 2 months of life associated with increased occurrence of IDDM in New Zealand; Finland study showed Hib vaccine associated with increased occurrence of IDDM; several studies link BCG vaccine after 1 month of life with development of diabetes.(15) 15. Risk of Hib-induced diabetes outweighs vaccine benefits (16) 16. MMR-triggered autoimmune response to myelin sheath may play pathogenic role in Autism (Jan. '99 Journal of Clin.

Vaccines almost always work/are efficacious - MYTH 1. Only 5 of 25 children (5-19) had measles enzyme IgG and IgM antibodies present (21) 2. 58% of 212 children (2-4yrs) who had been vacccinated or had measles disease were without detectable antibody (22) 3. Despite mass vaccination campaign in 1985 epidemics hit Turkey in 1989 and 1993 in groups 5-9 and >15 yrs; most in previously immunised primary and secondary school children (23) 4. 1992 measles epidemic in Cape Town in 91% vaccinated community - possible reasons \"include both primary and secondary vaccine failure\" (24) 5. For whole cell pertussis vaccine there was \"low antipertussis toxin response; hypotonic hyporesponsiveness occurred significantly more frequently than acellular vaccines; more frequent seizures and high fevers were seen than after any acellular vaccine\" (25) 6. \"Because of fears of safety and efficacy no pertussis vaccine has been included in vaccination program in Sweden since 1979 (5) 7. Immunology of whole cell vaccine studied was POOR after 1 month (and third dose) and no antibodies were detected in nearly all 1572 children 15 months after whole cell vaccination. 1998 (26) 8. Post MMR vaccination results in 5-6 year olds \"data indicated that a large proportion of children vaccinated under routine conditions do not have detectable measles or mumps antibody\" (27) 1995 9. Lederle/Takeda acellular pertussis component DTP vaccine but not Lederle whole cell component DTP vaccine was efficacious against Bordetella parapertussis infection. (28)1999. 10. The Rubini strain of mumps vaccine is still widely used in Europe despite studies showing it not to be efficacious.(7) 1999 C. Vaccine Science is generally accurate - MYTH 1. 1995; \"Salivary measles antibody assay was not sufficiently sensitive for population screening\"; 54% shown positive by serum HI antibody showed negative by salivary test (22) yet.... 2. Implication of national salivary testing program for England and wales \"salivary testing is an acceptable method\" (29) 1997 3. 1997; Pasteur Merieux paper:- \"whole cell pertussis vaccines provide best protection against pertussis\" (30) yet... 4. 1998; \"immunogenicity of whole cell pertussis study vaccine was poor 1 month after 3rd dose, no antibody was detected in nearly all children 15 months after whole cell vaccine\" (26) and... 5. \"The whole cell pertussis vaccine was associated with significantly higher rates of protracted crying, cyanosis, fever, and local reactions than the other three (acellular) vaccines\"....conclusions..\"the five-component acellular pertussis vaccine we evaluated can be recommended for general use, since it has a favourable safety profile and confers sustained protection against pertussis; the two component acellular vaccine and the WHOLE CELL vaccine were less efficacious\" (5) 1996 Sweden \"but acellular vaccines are not available outside of Japan\" (1991) 6. \"A new method for active surveillance of ADRs from DTP & MMR 1995...\"The estimated absolute risk of 1 in 24,000 doses of MMR and Idiopathic thrombocotopaenic purpura resulting in admission was five times that calculated from cases passively reported by clinicians\". (9) 7. The safety and efficacy of vaccines is very dependent on ADR reporting by clinicians yet one study showed underreporting by GPs could be as much as 24,000 times! (Moride et al Br J Clin Pharm 1997 Feb;43(2):177-81) Are homeopaths correct in recognising serious flaws, that have given rise to the current MYTH that medical vaccinations prevent disease, in vaccine science? Some say a vaccine alters our immune response by SUPPRESSING IT therefore we do not show a reaction to the disease but still suffer it albeit with altered immune reaction, ( e.g.. atypical measles?) Do diseases have natural cycles - the fourth horseman rides in and out with impunity - from a few years to decades or more? TB had declined dramatically before a vaccine was introduced such that the vaccine said to have prevented TB worldwide was revealed as a 'fraud' when the worlds biggest trial to assess the value of BCG vaccine, carried out in Southern India, made the startling revelation that the vaccine \"does not give any protection against the bacillary forms of TB\" (New Scientist Nov. 1979). The Lancet (14th March 1992) carried study of 83,000 individuals of Malawi vaccinated with BCG \"there was no statistically significant protection offered by BCG against TB\". Does the vaccine merely 'remove the alarm' (well-recognised symptomatology) from our immune 'security' system by inserting germs, avoiding natural routes, and invading our bodies directly via blood stream? It then appears as an 'atypical' disorder such as atypical measles instead of measles, aseptic meningitis instead of polio, 'post-polio syndrome/ME instead of polio etc.). What was the disease that was incorrectly diagnosed disorder 97% wrongly as measles in then Prime Minister John Mayjor's Huntingdon constituency not long after the 1994 'MR campaign' which questioned the merits of the 'mythical' impending epidemic of measles? What disorder did the study in Finland uncover that was so like measles as to be mistaken for it by clinicians in 655 vaccinated people (8) - was it 'atypical measles', the more dangerous (than wild measles) disorder usually found in vaccinated communities which, along with increases in IBS, autism, diabetes and asthma probably due to vaccination assaults, are the new diseases of the late 20th and early 21st Century? Doris Jones MSc showed, in her study of 222 students with M.E., how vaccination within the month prior to the onset of M.E. was common (12% of cases), especially anti-tetanus vaccine; Dr. Charles Shepherd, medical advisor to The M.E. Association showed how Hepatitis B vaccine is suspected of being a cause of M.E. Neither managed to have their work published in major medical journals. Government and Industrialist health politicians are not without fault - and perhaps this is where good physicians should look for the origins of their vaccine MYTHOLOGY; after all isn't this where most of the edicts arise, arriving often with little specific evidence? The comforting stance \"everything's fine, safe, efficacious, just get on with it, there's money to >be made out of high percentage vaccination coverage\" works every time; How about the new Meningitis C conjugates, how many physicians have referred to research papers supporting these vaccines, are they sufficiently accurate and valid? Do they prove safety and efficacy for vaccines which are already being injected into our youth before the publication of supporting evidence! Has sufficient research data been published such that professionals and parents/ guardians can make informed assessments? I do not think so. In a year long investigation of the US VAERS operated by the FDA, the National vaccine Information Center (NVIC operated by Dissatisfied Parents Together DTP) analysed computer discs used by the FDA to store death and injury data of ADRs to DTP vaccinations. A total of 54,072 reports of ADRs following vaccination were listed in a 39 month period from July 1990 to November 1993 with 12,504 reports being associated with DTP vaccine, including 471 deaths. A wide variation by batch was noted, some with many more deaths and injuries than others. At least one batch met the FDA criteria for triggering an investigation (report of one death or two serious ADRs within a 7 day period) eleven times within a 12 month period! There were 129 ADRs and 9 deaths reported for this batch between Septembers 1992 & 1993. The FDA did not act in every case - it failed in its statutory duty! (Campaign Against Fraudulent Medical Research Newsletter 1994). Where does the impaired vison end and mythology begin? What is the true reality of vaccine science? Smallpox vaccination was banned on threat of imprisonment due to the large outbreaks of smallpox the vaccine appeared to be causing - why was it reinstated despite continued serious outbreaks associated with vaccination; and the findings that sanitation and avoidance of vaccination could save the day? (Leicester, relying on hygiene and sanitation without vaccination, in 1892-3 outbreak had only 19.3 cases per 100,000 compared to 99.2% vaccine-uptake Warrington with 123.3 cases per 100,000 and death rate 8 times Leicester's); diptheria vaccine in UK was similarly blamed for sparking outbreaks. After 15 years of intensive vacciation by the US command of the Phillipines from 1903 where smallpox had been virtually unknown, epidemics struck in 1905 thro' to 1923; in 1918 47,000 cases occured with 16,000 deaths(Phillipines Health Service, 1918). The 1918 'Spanish Flu' started in American military Camp Funston, Fort Riley, USA amongst troops making ready for W.W.I - taking on board vaccinations, recruit training and all. It eventually killed about 40,000,000 people worldwide. That flu strain only appeared briefly once again, according to the US Atlanta CDC. This was in 1976 and again it struck at the US army camp Fort Dix, USA, amongst recently vaccinated troops (and no one else EVER); Fort Dix is known to have been a vaccine trial centre. Was the world's greatest 'influenza' scourge another well-hidden vaccine disaster? Regards all John H. 1. Bedford & Elliman BMJ 2000;320:240-243 2.
