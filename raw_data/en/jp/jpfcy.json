Kennedy, July 11,1967. v __ -.Jl PREFACE From the earliest days of organization, the Chairman, Commissioners, and Executive Director of the National Commission on lhe Causes and Prevention of Violence recognized the importance of research in accomplishing the task of analyzing the many facets of violence in America. As a result of this recognition, the Commission has enjoyed the receptivity, encouragement, and, cooperation of a large part of the scientific community in this country. Because of the assistance given in varying degrees by scores of scholars here and abroad, these Task Force reports represent som~ of the Hlost elaborate work ever done on the major topics they cover. The Commission was formed on June 10, 1968. By the end of the month, the Executive Director had gathered together a small cadre of capable young lawyers from various Federal agencies and aw firms around the country fhat group was later augmented by partners borrowed from some of the Nation's major law firms who served without compensation. Such a professional group can be assembled more quickly than university faculty because the latter are not accustomed to quick institutional shifts after making firm commitments of teaching or research at a particular locus. Moreover, the legal profession has long had a major and traditional role in. Federal agencies and commissions. In early July a group of 50 persons from the academic disciplines of sociology, psychology, psychiatry, political science, history, 1aw, and. biology were called together on short notice to discuss for 2 days how best the Commission ~nd its staff might proceed to analyze violen.ce. The enthusiastic respons;} of these scientists came at a moment when our Nation was still suffering from the tragedy of Senator Kennedy's assassination. It was clear from that meeting that the scholars were prepared to join research analysis and action, interpretation, and policy. They were eager to present to the American people the best available data, to bring reason to bear where myth had prevailed. They cautioned against simplistic solutions, but urged application of what is known in the service of sane pOlicies for the benefit of the entire society. Shortly thereafter the position of Director of Research was created. We assumed the role as a joint undertaking, with common responsibilities. Our function was to enlist social and other scientists to join the staff, to write papers, act as advisers or consultants, and engage in new research. The decentralized ,structure of the staff, which at its peak numbered 100, required research coordination to reduce duplication and to fIn in gaps among the vi original seven separate Task Forces. In general, the plan was for each Task Force to have a pair of directors: one a social scientist, one a lawyer. In a number of instances, this formal structure bent before the necessities of available personnel but in almost every case the Task Force work program relied on both social scientists and lawyers for its successful completion. In addition to Our work with the seven original Task Forces, we provided con\u00ad sultation for the work of the eighth \"Investigative\" Task Force, formed originally to investigate the disorders at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and the civil strife in Cleveland during the summer of 1968 and eventually expanded to study campus disorders at several colleges and universities. Throughout S~ptember and October and in December \u00b7of 1968 the Com\u00ad mission haid about 30 days of public hearings related expressly to each of the Task Force areas. About 100 witnesses testifie;d, including many sch,olars, Government officialf l, corporate executives as well as militants and activists of various persuasions. In addition to the hearings, the Commission and the staff met privately witb ,scores of persons, including college presidents, religious and youth leaders, and experts in such arcas 3S the media, victim compensa\u00ad tion, and firearms. The staff participated actively in structuring and conduct\u00ad ing those hearings and conferences and in the questioning of witnesses. As Research Directors, we participated in structuring the strategy of design for each Task Force, but we listened more than directed. We have known the delicate details of some of the statistical problems and computer runs. We have argued over philosophy and syntax; we, have offered bibliographical and other resource materials, we have written portions of reports and copy edited others . In short, we know the enormous energy and devotion, the long hours and accelerated study that members of each Task Force have invested in their labors. In retrospect we are amazed at the high caliber and quantity of the material produced, much of which truly represents, the best in research and scholarship. About 150 separate papers and projects were involved in the work culminating in the Task Force reports. We feel less that we llave orches\u00ad trated than that we have been members of the orchestra, and that together with the entire staff we have helped compose a repertoire of current knowl\u00ad edge about the enomlVlI,>lycomplex subject of this Commission. That scholarly research is predominant in the work here presented is evident in the product. But we shouhi like to emphasize that thl~ roles which we occupied were not limited to scholaily inquiry. The Directors of Research were afforded an opportunity to participate in all Commission meetings. We engaged in discussions'at the highest levels of decisionmaking, and had great freedom in the selection of scholars, in the control of research budgets, and in the direction and design of research. If this was not unique, it is at least an uncommon degree of prominence accorded research by a national commission. There wer\u00ab;l three major levels to our research pursuit: (1) summarizing the state of our present knowIedge and clarifying the lacunae where morc or new research should be encouraged; (2) accelerating known ongoing research so as tomakeitavailable to the Task Forces; (3) undertaking new research projects vii within the limits of time and funds available. Coming from a university setting where the pace of research is more conducive to reflection and quiet hours analyzing data, we at first thought that completing much meaningful new research within a matter of months was most unlikely. But the need was matched by the talent and enthusiasm of the staff, and the Task Forces very early had begun enough new projects to launch a small university with a score of doctoral theses. It is well to remember also that in each volume here presented, the research reported is on full public display and thereby makes the staff morl' than usually accountable for their products. One of the very rewarding aspects of these research undertakings has been the experience of minds trained in the law mingling and meshing, sometimes fiercely arguing, with other minds trained.in behavioral science. The or~aniza\u00ad tional structure and the substantive issues of each Task Force required mem\u00ad bers from both groups. Intuitive judgment and the logic of argument and organization blended, not always smoothly, with the methodology of science and statistical reasoning. Critical and analytical faculties were sharpened as theories confronted facts. The arrogance neither of ignoran.ce nor of certainty could long endure the doubts and questions of interdisciplinary debate. Any sign of approaching the priestly pontification of scientism was quickly dis\u00ad pelled in the matrix of mutual criticism. Years required for the normal accumulation of experience were compressed into months of sharing ideas with others who had equally valid but differing perspectives. Because of this process, these volumes are much richer than they otherwise might have b,~en. Partly because of the freedom which the Commission gave to the Directors of Research and the Directors of each Task Force, and partly to retain the full integrity of the research work in publication, these reports of the Task Forces are in the posture of being submitted to and received by the Commis\u00ad sion. These are volumes published under the aut~'ority of the Commission, but they do not necessarily represent the views or the conclusions of the Commission. The Commission is presently at work producing its own report, based in part on the materials presented to it by the Task Forces. Commission members have, of course, commented on earlier drafts of each Task Force, and have caused altera!icns by reason of the \\,;ogency of their .remarks and insights. But the final responsibility for what is contained in these volumes rests fully and properly on the research staffs who iaborieo~ on them. In this connection, we should like to acknowledge thp,:'specialleadership of the Chairman, Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, in formulaHng and supporting the principle of research fre~dom and autonomy under which this work has been conducted. We note, finally, that these volumes are in many respects incomplete and tentative. The urgency With which papers were prepared and then integrated into Task Force Reports rendered impossible the successive siftings of data and argument to which the typical academic article or volume is subjected. The reports have benefited greatly from the counsel of our colleagues on the AdVisory Panel, and from much debate and revision from within the staff. It is our hope, that the total work effort of the Commission staff will be the viii. j, source and subject of continued research by scholars in the several diw;;iplines, as well as a useful resource for policymakers. We feel certain that public: policy and the disciplines will benefit greatly from such further work. . * * To the Commission, and especially to its Chairman, for the opportunity they provided for complete research freedom, and to the staff for its prodi\u00ad gious and prolific work, we, who were intermediaries and servants to both, are most grateful.

The Number of Firearms in Civilian Hands Of the estimated 90 million firearms in civilian hands in the United States, 24 million are handguns, 35 million are rifles and 31 million are shotguns. ' 2. Patterns of Firearms Ownership About half of all American homes have a firearm, and many have wore than one. Firearms ownership is highest in the South and lowest in the East. Ownership of rifles and shotguns is higher in rural areas and towns than in large cities, but handgun ownership is highest in towns and large cities. 3. How Firearms are Acquired Almost half of all long guns, and more than half of all handguns , . ' , are acqulfed secondhand. New firearms and a large number of used firearms are purchased from sporting goods stores, hardware stores, or other firearms dealers. But, a bou t half of secondhand firearms are acquired from'friends ?r other private parties. . 4~ Recent Trends in Firearms Sales Sales of long guns doubled from 1962 to 1968; in ihesame period sales of handguns quadrupled. In the last ,decade, about 10 million handguns were soldin this country, more than one third of all hand\u00ad guns produced or imported for the civilian market since the turn of the century .. Growing interest in shooting sports may explain much of the increase in long gun sales, but it does not account for the dramatic increase in handgun sales, Fear of crime, violence, and civil disorder, and pe~~~ps the anticipation of stricter firearms laws, appear to have'stimulated sales of handguns in recent years. xi -1'1\" 5. Firearms and Accidents Americans are currently dying from firearms accidents at a rate of about 2,900 per year; another 20,000 persons suffer accidental , injuries each year from firearms. Firearms accident rates follow the pattern of firearms ownership; they are highest in the, South and lowest in the East. Over half of all fatal firearms accidents occur in or around the home: and about 40 percent of accident victims are children and teenagers. 6. Firearms and Suicide For persons who seek to end their lives, firearms are a speedy , and effective method. There is some evidence that, if persons who now use firearms were forced to resort to other means where there is a higher chance of intervention and rescue, some wou~d n?~ die. But there is little reason to expect that reducing the avaIlability of firearms would cause a significant reduction in suicides. A person who really wants to die will find a way of doing so. 7. Firearms ana Crime Homicide is seldom the result of a single-minded intent to kill. Fatal injuries most often occur from an attack growing o~t of,an altercation and committed in a rage. Firearms were used III 65 percent of homicides h~,this country in 1968. When a gun is u~ed, the chances of death are about five times as great as when a kmfe is used. In the last 5 years the number of firearms homicides has increased by almost 50 percent. Aggravated assault differs from homicide only in its outcome\u00ad the victim survives~ Although the knife is still the No. 1 weapon used in aggravated assault, the share of gun attacks is increas~g, and in 1968 nearly one in four aggravated assaults involved fue\u00ad arms. One third of all robberies are committed with guns. The chances of the victim's being killed increase substantially if the robber uses a gun. 8. The Firearms Used in Crime The criminal's primary firearm is the handgun. Although only about one quarter of all firearms in this country are ~andguns, they xii 'I i l , . ~ .. -..... are used in three quarters of the homicides involving firearms. Of the handguns used in crime in the District of Columbia, nearly half are imported. Samples of firearms manufactured in this country and used in crime reveal that a surprising number are more than 50 years old and one in six is a military weapon. Many of the handguns used in crime were owned by legitimate users at one time but appear to have been sold privately or to have been stolen without the theft having been reported. 9. Firearms and CollectiJle Violence The availability of firearms at relatively low cost makes it easy for extremist groups and individuals to obtain such weapons; the possession of firearms by some groups encourages opposition groups and individuals likewise to arm themselves; and possession of fire\u00ad arms by any group invites quicker and deadlier response on the part of rival armed groups and law enforcement agencies. 10., Firearms and Self-Defense Owning a gun for self-defense and protection of homes and busi\u00ad nesses is deeply rooted in American tradition. Guns may be of some utility in defending businesses, but householders may seriously ovt::r., rate the effectiveness of ~ns in protection of their homes, In our urbanized society the gun is rarely an effective means, of protecting the' home against either the burglar or the .robber; the former avoids confrontation, the latter confronts too swiftly. Possession of a gun undoubtedly provides a measure of comfort to a great many Ameri\u00ad cans, but, for the homeowner, this comfort is largely i,ln illusion bought at the high price ofincreased accidents, homicides, and more widespread illegal use of guns. 11. il10re Firearms-More Firearms Violence Data from three.sources document ,that the proportion of gun use in violence rises and falls with gun: ownership. Statistics from Detroit show that firearms violence increased after an increaseln handgun acquisitions. Regional comp,lrisons show that the per\u00ad centage of gun use in violent attacks parallels rates of gun owner\u00ad ship. A study of guns used in homicides,robberies, and assaults in eight major cities shows that cities with il high proportion of gun llsejn-bne c~ime:tend to have high proportions of gun use in the other crimes; xiii 12. Strategies of Firearms Control ., Different strategies of firearms control-regulation of the place and manner in which firearms can be used1regulation of who may possess firearms, permissive and restrictive licensing 1 registration and transfer notice-can be combined in a variety of ways to pro\u00ad duce a comprehensive system of control. Since handguns and long guns do not contribute equally to firearms misuse 1 it may be appro\u00ad priate to use different strategies for different types of firearms. 13. State and Local Firearms Laws State and local firearms regulation in the United States is a patch\u00ad work quilt of more than 20,000 laws, many of them obsolete, unenforced1 or unenforceable. Serious efforts at state and local regulation have consistently been frustrated by the flow of firearms. from one state to another. Attempts to establish i~niform state and local firearms laws have failed. 14. Federal Firearms Laws Public opinion 1.1 this country has favored regulation of firearms since the 1930's. Yet; from the enactment of the first federal fire\u00ad arms possession law in 1934, federal gun laws have been passed in this country only after sensational episodes of gun violence. The Gun Control Act of 1968, which followed the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, commits the federal government to support state and city gun control laws by reducil1g the interstate flow of firearms which has long flUstrated IQcai control effort~ Proposals for a federal system of screening firearms owners have not been enacted. 15. Firearms Control and the Constitution The second amen:dment raises no legal barrier to federal or state firearms legislation. The fifth amendment, however, could be invoked against enforcement of such laws. Fifth amendmenLprob\u00ad lems might be minimized by exempting from licensing, registration, or transfer notice requirements aU persons in those categories pro\u00ad hibited by law from possessing firearms. This. exemption of illegal possessors would not decrease the effectiveness of firearms control because other parts of the contml;system could allow prosecution of such persons without requiring them to incriminate themselves. xi., 16. Foreign Firearms Laws Most countries have passed national firearms control laws. The great majority of these laws appear to be more stringent than the laws of most states in the United States, although many of the foreign laws may not be effectively enforced. Many countries regu\u00ad late handguns more stringently than long guns, and rough estimates of handgun ownership in 10 countries are all far below the rate of handgun ownership in the United States. 17. Can We Reduce Firearms Violence? The gun control controversy has often involved comparisons of crime statistics from states with firearms control laws with statistics from states with no such laws and comparisons of the United States to foreign countries. These comparisons are never wholly satisfac\u00ad tory, but when care is exercised to focus not upon the number of crimes committed but solely upon the proportion of crimes involving guns, an inference can be drawn that control systems that substan\u00ad tially reduce the number of guns are effective in reducing the level of gun violence. Since handguns. are the major problem, a nation\u00ad wide restrictive licensing system for handguns promises a more cer\u00ad tain and more substantial reduction of gun violence in this country than a permissive system. . 18. The Costs of Firearms Control The costs of any firearms control system include both the funds needed to administer the system and the effect on opportunities for legitimate firearms use. The monetary cost of an efficiently administered permissive or restrictive licensing system would not be excessive. Restrictive licensing, however, would significantly redupe the. legitimate use of the controlled firearms. 19. Technology and Firearms Control Technological advancements in tracing of firearms to owners, in detecting firearms in public places, and in development of nonlethal weapons or ammunition would help reduce fIrearms misuse by making firearms control systems more effective.

For many years the armed citizen\u00ad soldier was the country's first line of defense; the \"Kentucky\" long rifle opened the frontier; the Winchester repeater \"won the West~'; and the Colt revolver\u00b7'made men equal.\" Firearms no longer-playa significant role in keep\u00ad ing food on American tables, yet Americans own and use fll'earms to a degree that puzzles many ob\u00ad servers. If our frontier has disappeared, our frontier tradition remains. In addition to this tradition, however, our national enthusiasm for firearms de\u00ad rives from the genuine pleasures of hunting, sport shooting, and gun collecting and, to some (legree, from fear for personal and family safety-a fear of' guns in. the hands of others. Part I considers general patterns of firearms ownership in order to gain perspective on the mis\u00ad u~ of firearms in this country. The analysis ad\u00ad dresses four questions: (1) How many firearms are privately owned in the United States? (2) What types of firearms are owned, who owns them, and where? (3) How are.firearms acquired? (4) What are the current trends in l11'ea.rms . sales? 1 I, '~' Chapter 1 THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS IN CIVILIAN HANDS Any meaningful study of the relationship between firearms and violence in the Unite\"d States should begin with tID effort to deter\u00ad mine the number of serviceable firearms-handgu,ns, rifles, and shotguns1-currently in the hands of civilians. Estimates have ranged from 50 to 200 million.2 The Task Force has attempted to reduce this margin of error. The ideal estimate would be based on domestic firearms production, plus imported firearms, less the number of guns that have disappeared through wear, loss, break\u00ad age~or confiscation and destruction by the police. Table\u00b7 I-I shows domestic production and report9d imports of handguns, rifles, and shotguns for 9ivilian use. The domestic pro\u00ad duction figures cover the years since 1899, and the import figures IHandguns, rifles, lUld shotguns are the tili~e common types of civilian small arms.

The estimate of imports is not yet complete, however, since it does not reflect firearms brought into the country but not re\u00ad ported as imports. There are two ways in which firearms have been brought into tIns country without being reflected in import or production statistics. First, considerable numbers of military firearms have been brought into the country by returning service\u00ad men. The Department of Defense cannot advise us of the number offrrearms sold within the United States as military surplus, but . it is known tliat firearms purchased by the military since 1940, less those in current use, total approximately 14 million. Approxi\u00ad mately 2 million of the,se have been supplied to foreign countries since 1950 under military assistance. programs. Many of there\u00ad maining 12 million were lost in combat or scrapped, but a signifi\u00ad cant number, together with foreign-made firearms taken as souve\u00ad nirs, have found their way back to the United States in packages or duffel bags of returning servicem.en.6 These guns, plus the do\u00ad mestic military small arms sold as surplus in this country after eveiy wartime mobilization, constitute a sizable portion of the firearms in civilian hands in this country. FBI records reveal that, of nearly 185,000 firearms reported stolen as of November 1968-,23 percent originally were military 3 A description of the meth~ds used in compiling thi$ data is contained in App. C. 40f 328 confiscated liandguns traced by the Task \"Vorce, for instance, seven were manu\u00b7 factured in 1898 or before.

These fm:anns are now classifieda~ . antiques by the Gun Control Act of 1968. (See'ch.14, infra.). . '. . 6Some indication of the extent of unc.ounted imports of military fueanns is revealed from the high ownership of handguns by veterans. (See Fig. 2-3 in ch. 2, infra.) The Number of Fireamts in Civilian Hands s firearms. Similarly, records of several police departments indicate many firearms confiscated by the police are former military fire- . arms. Another source of uncounted imports are foreign visitors and returning tourists ~ho have been allowed to bring as many as three handguns and a thousand rounds of ammunition into this country without a formal declaration'? Millions of tourists enter or re-enter the United States every year,8 but the Bureau of Customs has no records with which to estimate the number who have brought in firearms. On the other side of the ledger, many of the firearms included in th,e totals in Table 1-1 have been lost, destroyed, or are no long~r serviceable. Firearms manufacturers have advised the Task Force that a firearm can be expected to last indefinitely if given proper care.9However, a substantial number of firearms pro\u00ad duced since the tum of the century have been taken out of circu\u00ad lation through loss or neglect. A considerable number of firearms are confiscated each year by law enforcement agencies. Only a few states, however, require the police to destroy confiscated firearms; in other states these fire\u00ad arms are auctioned off to the highest bidder and returned to circu\u00ad lation;10 This leaves our computation with an unknown number of mili\u00ad tary firearms sold as surplus or brought into the country as souve~ nirs by servicemen, an unknown number of frrearms brought through customs from abroad, and an unknown number of fire\u00ad arms that have been worn out, lost, or confiscated and destroyed. One method of completing our estimate of the number of firearms is to assume that these unknown entries and disappearances cancel each other and that the total number of firearms in civilian hands is about 100 million. 722 C.F.R. 123.52. 8Thehnmigration and Naturalization Service has advised the ,!~kF?~ce that nearly 5 million Americans visited abroad last year and another 86 million VlSlted Canada and Mexko. About 6 million foreign visitors came to this country. 9The small number of firearms that are worn out through use is confumed by the fact that manufacturers advise that the useful life of a gun, in terms of rounds fued, rang()s from 10,000 to 100,000 roupds, depending on the quality and type of gun .. Informa\u00ad tion from the mimufacturers'of ammunition indicates that 4.4 billi!)n rounds of ammu\u00ad nition were made in. 1967. If all this ammunition were expended, this would amount to !in average of only 43 roundsperyear, assul1}ing 100 million fireanns. Although all fueanns are not used equally, it is unlikely that any significant number of fueanns are .worn out through use.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 . .' lOlI\\' New York, for instance, fireanns confiscated in crime must be destroyed (New York State Penal Coae, Sec. 400.05). But North Carolina, on the other hand, al.lctions such weapons off to the,highest bidder and thus returns them to circulation (N .C. Stats. Sec. 14-269-1). In other states the police apparently have discretion to destroy or sell ,..\u00a3ortfis<;!i~4 fueanns. . , . ' . 6 Firearms and Vio!ence in American Life National public opinion polls;also provide insight on the num\u00ad ber of firearms in civilian hands. A 1968 Harri~ poll conducted for this Commission, and discussed in detail in the>next chapter, showed that 49 percent ofthe 60.4 million American hous~holds reported firearms ownership~!ld that the average number ,offire\u00ad arms owned was 2.24. Thesepata allow a projection of 66/million firearms (49 percent of60Al11iIlion householdstimes2.24); A , 1966 Gallup poll showed that 59 percent of American households possess firearms. Using the 1968 Harris figure of 2.24 firearms for each firearms-owning household allows a projection of 80 million serviceable firearms (59 percent of 60.4 million h6useholds times 2.24). TWo factors a.t least partially account for, the discrepancies be\u00ad tween the calcl,tlated a..\"1d projected totals. ,There is evidence that many persons','are increasingly reluctant to disclose ownership of firearms in a door-te-door survey.II Also, wives or children who are interviewed may not always know about all the weapons owned by other members of the household . Survey results thus indicate ownership of approximately 80 million fIrearms, while production. and import totals indicate ap\u00ad proximately 100 million. We can do no better than average these two figures and conservatively estimate the number of fIrearms now in civilian hands in this country to ,\\;l,e 90 million. A more precise estimate must await the availability of more precise data. The 90 million estimate is divided in Figure 1-1 into the three main types of firearms according to the percentage reflected in the production and import totals. Figure l~l-Estimated number of 11rearms in civilian hands. . n T~e the Hams lUlU polls can be inteIpreted as evidence of tlusreluctance. FIfty-rune percent or tile sample households conceded lliearmsowner\u00ad ship in 1966, but only 49 percent did so in 1968 despite a dramatic increase in fire- arms sales since. 1966. (See ch. 4.) 'c The Number of Fizeamls in Civilian Hands 7 Whether one ac~,epts the figure of 80 million firearms indicated by the public opinion polls, the figure of i 00 million indicated by production and import figures, or an intermediate figure makes litHe difference to any public policy question about firearms. By whatever measure/ ji11e United States has an abundance of firearms. Summary There are an estimated 90 million firearms in civilian hands in the United States today: 35 million rifles, 31 million shotguns, and 24 million handguns-in 60 million households. j: Chapter 2 PATTERNS OF FIREARMS OWNERSHIP Public opinion surveys conducted for firearms manufacturers and a Harris survey conducted for this Commission! provide data on the ownership of frrearms in this country. Because people are reluctant to answer questions about firearms ownership, the polls give us an incomplete picture of firearms ownership. However, the public opinion polls are the best source of information available about patterns of ownership in the United States. Table 2-1 shows the distribution of firearms among the 60 mil\u00ad lion households in the United States as revealed from the Harris poll data: Table 2\u00b7J-Number offirearms per household.

Chapter 3 HOW FIREARMS ARE ACQUIRED Firearms, as noted in Chapter 1, are generally quite durable and can be expected to last ind~finitely when given proper care. It is therefore 110t surprising that the secondhand market in firearms is almost as important as the new market, as indicated in Figure 3-1. M'ANDGUNS ~s Figure 3\u00b7J-How fuearms were acquired. (United States, 1968) Source: 1968 Harris poll Almost half of all rifles and shotguns and slightly more than half of all handguns were acquired used by their present owners. New firearms are normally sold by manufacturers and importers to wholesalers, who sell to dealers, who in tum sell to consumers. In 1967, the Treasury Department issued 102,041 licenses to fire\u00ad arms dealers and wholesalers, many of them large businesses. In 1967, 10 wholesalers each. purchased more, than a million dollars' worth of firearms from major manufacturers; 30 other wholesalers each purchased over $500,000 worth of firearms. Wholesalers vary widely in the products they handle and the ter\u00ad ritories they cover. Some operate in many states, but most sell primarily in a handful of states surrounding their location and have only a few customers in other states. 13 14 Fireanns and Violence in American Life The largest share of the approximately 100,000 federal firearms licenses are issued to an estimated 70,000 retail dealers1 ranging from gunshops and sporting goods stores to hardware stores, de\u00ad partment stores, and pawnshops.2 Most of the remaining 32,000 federal firearms licenses are held by private individuals who paid the $1 fee to allow them to buy firearms at wholesale prices and transport firearms through the mails.3 The market for secondhand firearms is somewhat different, as noted in Figure 3-2, PRIVATE PARTIES' STORES NOT SURE Figure 3\u00b72-Sources of used flleanns. (United States, 1968) Percents add to more than 100: Some respondents acquired firearms from more than one source. Source: 1968 Harris poll Just over 40 percent of the buyers surveyed bought a used firearm from a retail firearms dealer. Over half of all secondhand guns are obtained from a \"friend\" or another \"private party.\" Figure 3-3 breaks down these firearms acquisitions by income group. IJoseph W. Barr, Under Secretary of the Treasury, Hearings before the Senate Subcom\u00ad mittee To Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 90th Cong., 1st sess.,p. 40 (1967). 2A 1966 survey of nearly 14,000 retail outlets handli~ . ,ifles and shotguns showed 44 percent are sporting goods stores, 21 percent hardw ,tores, and 11 percent depart: ment and general merchandise stores (1966 Manufacturer's Market Survey, App. D). On the other hand, information submitted to the Task Force by flleanns wholesalers indicates that a large percentage of retail outlets handling flleanns, particularly hand\u00ad guns, arc pawnshops. The 300 accounts of one major wholesaler, engaged almost exclu\u00ad sively iIi selling domestically manufactured handguns, included 70 pawnshops or loan companies, representing 16 percent of its business. Many fllearms are sold\u00b7by chain store merchandisers. One such chain store increased its flleanns sales approximately 50 percent from 1963 to 1967. Another liad mail-order and over-the-counter sales of more than $10 million from 1963 to 1967. A major chain store discontinued sales of handguns in 1963 and mail-order sales of rifles and shotguns in 1968, as well as the listing of firearms in its catalog. , 3See footnote 1, supra. The Gun Control Act of 1968, discussed in ch. 14, infra, raised the dealer's Ikense fee to $10 and also provided for a license for gun \"collectors\" for the same fee .. al'e 82 Stat. 1221.

II Chapter 4 RECENT TRENDS IN FIREARMS SALES , In Chapter 1 an estimate was made of the total number of fire\u00ad ?irms presently owned by civilians in the United States. In this 'chapter, production and imports of civilian firearms over time are examined, with particular attention being given to what has oc\u00ad curred in the last 10 years.

For the decade ending in 1968, the increase was 9.6 million. Shotguns increased sharply in the 1950's (3.2 to 9.4 million per decade) but leveled off in the 1960's (9.4 million). The number of handguns added to' the domestic market shows the most substantial increase. The average increase of 2.7 million per decade in the first 50 years rose to 4.2 millionper decade in the 1950's and to ] 0.2 million for the decade ending in 1968.

Growing interest jn shooting sports may explain much of the increase in long gun sales, but it does not acJi count for the dramatic increase iii handgun sales. Fear of crime, \" violence, and civil disorder, and perhaps the ~nticipation of stric1rr firearms laws, appear also to have stimulated sales of handguns in . recent years. ~.s-::-::~.~~ <if,<~~:4.''''~-':'~~~4b4''1~*! p ..... ~.. l\"'. t .J < 1':';< PART II FIREARMS AND VIOLENCE\u00ad CAUSE, CONTRIBUTION, OR COINCIDENCE? In 1967, firearms were involved in approximately 73,000 robberies, 53,000 aggravated assaults, 9,000 suicides, 7,000 homicides, and 2,900 accidental deaths in this country. Although firearms used in these deaths and crimes r~present only a small frac~ tion of the total guns in the United States, some relationship clearly exists between firearms and vio\u00ad lent death and crime. Three propositions might explain this relation\u00ad ship. First, f'trearms may be a cause of violence. Second, if firearms do not <;ause violence, their availability may be a contributing factor to the rate :or seriousness of violence. T}tird, firearms and vio\u00ad lence may be related only by coincidence, since irre- anns are only one of many weapons that can ~e;, used in violence. The following chapters discuss the use of firearms in accidents, suicides, and crime; the age,.origin, and prior history of fireanns used in crime;' the use of firearms in civil disorders; the arms policies of ex\u00ad tremist organizations; the utility of guns as defen\u00ad sive weapons; and the apparent consequences of increases in the number of fuearms in civilian hands. 23 ~'., , .

Nine percent are children under 10, and by far the largest group of . firearms accident victims are children between 10 and 19 years of age. Fatality statistics, however, are only part of the picture. Firearm! accidents also inflict nonfatal injuries. One informed source esti\u00ad mates the annual number of such injuries at over 100,000.1 A pro' jection from hunting accident deaths indicates.that about and Paul V. Joliet, \"Accidents and Homicide\" (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968), p. 93. accidental firearms injuries can be expected alIDually,2 suggesting that for all firearms accidents the 100,000 figure may be too high. In addition to age, sex, and race, some information is available on the background of persons involved in firearms accidents. A recent study showed that persons causing firearms accidents in Vermont were also prone to disproportionate involvement in traffic accidents and offenses, criminal violence, and heavier than average drinking. 3 Figure 5-6 shows the rate of accidental deaths from firearms for the last available year (1966) by region of the country. Figure 5\u00b76-Accidental civilian firearms deaths by region. (United States, 1966) [annual rate per 100,000] WEST , U.S. AVERAGE 1.5 Source: Vital Statistics of the United States, 1966. Unpublished data. Although the level of death from firearms accidents is relatively low, the fluctuation of rates from region to. region parallels the pattern of firearms ownership.4 The simple truth is that more gun accidents happen where more guns are. 2The. 1966 Uniform Hunter Casualty Report of the National Rifle Association shows, for lI~stance, 289 fatal fuearms casualties compared to' 1,967 nonfatal casualties, ap\u00b7 proxunately a 7 to 1 ratio. Applying this ratio to the 2,900 accidental firearms il,jUrieS ~Ot 19~7 would indicate about 20,000 Iuearms injuries for that year. The San1e method IS .applicable to homicides. In 1967, the Uniform Crime Reports show nonfatal attacks With firearm.s totaled 53,000, compared to 7,700 fatal Iuearms attacks-approxin1ately the s~e ratio of 7 woundings for each fatality. Since many such nonfatal attacks and woundings probably go unreported, the true ratio of nonfatal-to-fatal injuries is proba- bly substantially higher. . 3W~er, \"A~ci?ents and Violent Behavior: Are They Related,\" a report prepared for 4 thiS Commission. See ch. 2, Fig. 2-1. '1 .1 30 Firearms and Violence in American Life Another point of interest is how and where firearms accidents occur. Some insight into these questions is provided in Figure 5-7.

More than half of all the accidents in the home are not the result of normal shooting activity. Fjgure 5-9 sets forth information on the types of firearms in\u00ad volved in the activities leading to fatal accidents. Although many fIrearms accidents occur during shooting activities or while cllean:- ing weapons after such activities, others arise from activities that . have little to do with proper firearms use.

Firearms accident rates follow the pattern of frrearms ownership; they are highest in the South and lowest in the East. Over half of all fatal frrearms accidents occur in or around the home, and about 40 percent of accident victims are children and teenagers. ,:;'.-' \", ;J~~ 1, Chapter 6 FIREARMS AND SUICIDE Every year over 20,000 Americans commit suicide. Since almost half of these suicides (47 percent) are commited with frrearms,l it behooves the Task Force to investigate whether firearms contribute to the number of suicides. The question is simply whether those 1\\ who seek to end their lives would find other equally effective methods of suicide if all or some of them did not have firearms. Our inquiry begins with an examination of the available data on suicides and attempted suicides.

I For males, firearms are the second most frequent means of at- ~\" tempting suicide (19 percent) and account for almost half (42 per-l < cent) of all completed suicides. The picture for women is quite !: different. Only in 3 percent of all attempts do women use firearms.i But when they do, firearms produce a high death rate-though not' quite as high as for men (69 percent versus 84 percent).3 Although firearms are a highly successful means of committing suicide, a few other methods-hanging, carbon monoxi4e, and drowning by jumping-are almost equally effective. The ques-. tion, therefore, is whether persons attempting suicide, if they had no firearms, would turn to equally effective methods that are now used py only a small proportion of those attempting suicide--or whether some. would tum to the more frequently used, but less effective, alternatives such as barbiturates. ')Th' . -erelS.nO reason to dif- ferent. 3Note that the overall sUCe<:SS rate f'o[women attempting suicide (13 percent) is only one third .01' that for men (38 percen t). This is partly because of women using, on. the whole, less deadly metliods (e.g., b~biturates)thanmen, but also because of the lower suCcess. rate for females for every method (except drowning and throat cutting). Stated differently, the question is whether the 19 percent of all men who attempt suicide by shooting are so determined to kill them\u00ad selves that they would find another effective way if firearms were 'not available. A tentative answer comes from Table 6-3 which shows the sui- cide rates in 1966 for 16 countries and the percentage of those sui\u00ad cides committed with firearms. Table 6-3-SuiCide rates and suicide wit1l firearms in 16 countries.

The United St&tes, with 10 suicides' per 1 OO,OOO~ holds a middle position among .these 16 countries 'in reported. rates of suicide.. . . .' The different rank orders of the ovenul suicide rates and the .suicide rates by firearms show that no significant relationship exists b~tween the frequency of suicide and the frequency of suicide by shooting. The German SUicide rate, for instance, is. almost the high\u00ad est (20 per 100,000 and second among the 16 countries),. but with respect to suicides by shooting, it ranks 13th (4 per 100,000), or almost last.

Thus, sUIcIde rates would not seeml J to be readily affected by making firearms less available. I'if While frreanns may not be a major factor in suicides, there is It some evidence that they might be a minor one, In Los Angeles, IJ l :, physicians who treated persons who failed in their attempts at sui-L,t cide wer. e asked to .rate the seriousness of the survivors' intention, I . \u00b7 ... ! to end their lives ..

There is some evidence that, if persons who now use frrearms were forced to resort to other means where there is a higher chance of intervention and rescue,.some wou~d n~~ die. But there is little reason to expect that reducmg the availabIlity of firearms would cause a significant reduction in suicides. A per\u00ad son who really wants to die will find a way of doing so. . ' Chapter 7 FIREARMS AND CRIME Firearms are commonly involved in three of the four major categories of crime causing injury or deathl-homicide, aggravated assault, and armed robbery.2 Figure 7-1-Role of f\"irearms in crimes against the person. (United States, 1967) HOMICIOE ROBBERY AGGRAVATED ASSAULT 63% Two out of every three homicides, over a third of all robberies, and one out of five aggravated assaults are committed with a gun, usually a handgun.3 ~ T?c use of llIearm.s in rape in all probability is not substantial. FlIearms are, of course, also used in other crimes. In 1968, for instance, ilrearms W~Ie used i~ at least 16 airplane hijackings, a crime difficult to commit without firearms or 3 explOSives. (Information from Federal A viation Administration.) See ch. 8, infra. 39 40 Homicide Firearms and Violence in American Although firearms are the principal weapon used in homicides . in the United States. knives are used in one out of four homicides, as shown in Table 7-1. Table 7\u00b7]--Weapons used in homicide\", (United States, 1967) Weapon Percent Firearms ....... 63 Knives.......... 25 Other........ .. . 12 1------Total....... 100 Source: 1967 Uniform Crime Report. Since 1963, the number of homicides involving firearms has in\u00ad creased 48 percent in the United States. At the same time, the number of homicides committed with other weapons has risen only 10 percent. We shall point out in this chapter that the in\u00ad creased use of fireanns in violent assaults is one of the reasons for the increase in homicides. Although other weapons are involved in homicide~ firearms are :. not only the most deadly instrument of attack but also the most I. versatile. Firearms make some attacks possible that simply would I not occur without firearms. They permit attacks at greater range i and frompo~;itions of better concealment than other weapons. l They also permit attacks by persons physically or psychologically unable to ove.rpower their victim through violent physical contact. It is not surpdsing, therefore~ that firearms are virtually the only weapon used in killing police officers. The policeman, himself anned, is capable of d\\~fending against many forms o(violent attack. He is trained and t~quipped to ward off attacks with blunt objects, knives, or fists, and his firearm is ally sufficient to overcome his attacker, even if surprised at close range. It is, the,refore, the capacity of firearms to kill instantly and from a distance that threatens the lives of police officers in the United States. 4Knives are also the most frequently used substitute for fuearms in anned .robbery. In aggravated assault, the situation is reversed-lcnifeattacks are more frtlquent than gu:l ,!lUacks.

Planned murders involving a single-minded intent, such as gangland killings, seem to be the spectacular but infrequent exception. ' The nature of homicide was succinctly described by the chief of the Homicide Section of the Chicago Police Depa.rtment when in-. terviewed on television after Chicago's 600th homicide of 1968 had occurred: \"There was a domestic fight. A gun was there. And then somebody was dead. Jfyou have descrlbedone, you have de\u00ad scribed them a1L\"9 Not only do the circumstances of homicide and the relationship of victim and attacker show that most homicides do not involve a single-minded determination to kill, but also the choice of a gun does not seem to indicate such intent.

If they were knife attacks, roughiy 12 fatalities would result (3.7 percent of 322)-a reduction from 20 deaths per hundred attacks to 4 per hundred. The foregoing material on homicide permits the simple conclu\u00ad sion that when an attacker uses a gun, the victim is more likely to die than whEm an attacker uses a knife. It is therefore not a coinci\u00ad dence that as the number of firearms homicides has increased in re\u00ad cent years, the number of all homicides has also increased Indeed, the increase in the number of homicides results at least in part from the increased use of firearms, as shown in Figure 7-2.

(Dallas and Philadelphia, 1968) Indoor 47 Outdoor Robberies sample by Task Force from the 1968 offense reports provided by Dallas and Philadelphia Police Departments. Interviews with robbers by a psychiatric investigator confirm that the gun often is an essential ingredient in robbery; Robbery appears to be a crime made infinitely more possible by having a gun. To rob without one requires a degree of strength, size and confidence which was lacking in many of the men with whom I spoke, .. , For the most part the men involved in robbery were not very large and not very strong. Some were not very aggressive. Some of these men could not possibly carry out a robbery without a gun. In short, there was a clear reality element in the need for a gun once a man made the decision to rob .. \" [Ajlthough the men needed a gUll to rob, the converse was also true: they nCt.'ded to rob in order to use a gun, .. it was the gun which provided th<! power and the opportunity for mastery .13 Because the attack on the person is usually incidental to the main goal of the robber, the overall fatality rate resulting from rob\u00ad berie!> is relatively small. Nevertheless, the fatality rate is consider\u00ad ahly higher for firearms robbenes than for robbcries with other weapons, as shown in Table 7-8. Table 7\u00b78-Fatality rate in robheries.

Donakl E. altilchcd as App. L 48 Firearms and Violence in American Life Summary Homicide is seldom the result of a single-minded intent to kill. \\1ost often it is an attack growing out of an altercation and com\u00ad mitted in a rage that leads to fatal injuries. Firearms were used in 65 percent of homicides in this country in 1968. When a gun is used. the chances of death are about five times as great as when a knife is. used. In the last 5 years the number of firearms homicides ha.<.; increased by almost 50 nercent. Aggravated assault differs from homicide only in its outcome\u00ad the victim survives. Although the knife is still the No.1 weapon used in aggrdvated assault, the share of gun attacks is increasing, and in 196~ nt'arly one in four aggravated assauits involved fire\u00ad arms. One third of all robberies are committed with guns. The chances of the victim's being killed increase substantially if the robber uses a gun. Chapter 8 THE FIREARMS USED IN CRIME With some 90 million firearms distributed among half of th0 households of the United States, the firearms used in aime arc but a small fraction of the total. For the criminal, however, firearms are an important matter. As n0ted in the preceding chapter, 1 firearms in 1967 were used in the United States in 63 percent of the homicides, 37 percent of the robberies, and 21 percent of the agf:,rravated assaults. And the u~e of firearms in homicide and aggravated assaults is increasing. For the first 9 months of 1968, firearms were used in 65 percent of all homicides and 23 percent of all aggravated assaults.2 Although only about 27 percent of the firearms in this country are handguns,3 thev arc the predominant firearm used in crime. Figure H-l shows the predominance of t.he handgun in each of the three major ty\"v;' of crimes involving firearms. Hgllre 8-1-Handguns and long guns in crimes involving firearms.

When firearms are involved in aggravated assault and robbery . in large cities, the handgun is almost invariably the weapon used. A study of firearms confiscated in the District of Columbia, 95 percent of which were handguns, revealed that nearly half of the confiscated handguns had been imported.

In ~n aftempt to determine how guns used in crime were ar.:quired, samples of handguns confiscated in crime in Detroit and Los Angeles were studied, Both cities require an applicatiop to purchase a hand\u00ad gun, but in both cities relatively few of these applications are denied and thus possession of firearms is not significantly restricted. In Detroit, a sample of 113 handguns confiscated by police dur- . ing shootings in the city of Detroit during 1968 showed that only 2S percent of the confiscated weapons ,had been recorded previ\u00ad ously in connection with a gun permit application. In Los Angeles, a sample of 50 handguns involved in homicides, 100 handguns involved in aggravated assaults, and 100 handguns involved in rob\u00ad belies was analyzed at the request of the Task Force. 'Figure 8-2 shows the proportion of firearms for which there was a record of an application. Three fourths of the handguns used in homicide and about one half of the handguns used in the other two crimes had been recorded. /1 4The FBI has advised the Task FOfce that 22.5 percent of the stolen 11Iearms on its rec\u00ad ords (totaling 184,711 in November 1968) were military type weap(ms.

Most of the recorded guns used in crime (60 percent for homkioe, 50 percent for aggravated assault, and 65 percent for robbery) were apparently used by persons other than the last recorded owners. Since only 6 percent of these weapons had been reported as stolen,S sales.of ~e..:ondhand firearms seem to be a major source of firearms \\lscd in crime. Summary The criminal's primary firearm is ,1le handgun. Although only about one quarter of all firearms in thi~ ':ollntry are handguns, they are used in three quarters of the homicide: involving firearms. Of the handguns used in crime in the District of Columbia, nearly half are imported. Samples of crime firearms maUl: lIt lids country reveal that one in five is more than 50 years old and one in six is a military weapon. Most of the firearms used in crime are acquired by criminals in unrecorded purchases or burglaries. 5(;uo\u00b7, .lre probably stolcn at a higher than figure Many ha\\ ,.wnership know the weapon's mak.e or serial number. ----I i Chapter 9 FIREARMS AND COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE Another task force of this Commission is investigating mass dem~ onstratiol1s, riots, and civil disorders. The fbCUS of this Task Force is solely on one aspect of the problem-the role firearms have played in recent collective violence and the role they may play in collective violence of the future. . Firearms and Recent Collective Violence The Nation&1 Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders studied disorders in 23 citiesl throughout the country. Although it found that sniping occurred in at least 15 of these disorders2 and that theft of firearms and ammunition was a substantial problem, the Commission did not specifically study the role played by firearms. It did, however, engage the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to conduct such an inquiry. The SRI report, published in July 1968,3 reported: In the Watts riot of 1965, mote than 700 guns were stolen, 115 persons (78 of whom had pr~vious criminal records) were arrested with firearms, and 118 persons were_injured by gunfire. During the riots of April 1968, following the assassinatio}:l of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 25 of 39 persons killed died of -t-_ lA~anta, Ga.; Cambridge, Md.; Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio; Detroit Mich.; Houston, Tex.; Jackson, Miss.; Wis.; Haven.

In Washington, D.C., alone, 32 persons were treated for gunsh~t wounds, and 8~ were arrested for carr~ing 11 dangerous'weapon. The July 1967 riot in Newark, N.J., was examined in detail. 0[23 persons killed as a direqt result of this riot, all died from . , gunshot woul,:ds. Ten of the 23 were killed by law officers, 1 by a sniper, and 2 by unknown persons.' Either law officers or snipers ' ' could have been responsible for 9 of the remaining 10. Sixty-five Of 587 civilian injuries reported were gun~ho(wounds; and 9 of 129 injuries 'to police and other officials were gunshot wounds. Of 250 sniping incidents reported to police,' 79 were'~subsequently verified, although no snipers wex:e apprehended. Of 66 perso~s arrested for firearms violations, 40 had previous criminal records and 7 had previous records for illegal possession of weapons; 28 . rifles and shotguns, 36 pistols and revolvers> 1 zip gun,and 1 sub- machine gun were seized. . . The July 1967 riot in Detroit was also examined in detail. Thirty~eight of the 43 persqns kiUed died from gunfire, Including three pubJic f::afety officials. Twenty-eight civilians' were killed by pvace gunfire, .and 7 by gunfire from civilians or unknown persons. Ten of these civilians were innocent bystanders. Twenty\u00b7 four of 290 injuries to public safety officials were gunshot wounds, including 5 by accidental discharge, while 36 of 109 irijuries to other persons were from gunfire. , Two hundred thirty\u00ad eight arrests were made for carrying concealed weaports, at least 118 of which were firearms, while 178 rifles and shotguns and 195 pistols and revolvers were seized. Althottgh more than 100 sniping incidents were reported, this number appears to have been exagger~ted. The riots itl Chicago in April 1968 were investigated by aicom\u00ad mission appointed by Mayor Daley. This commission found tPJ!t r sniper tIre occurred in one area of the city, wounding two police l' officers and seriously hampering firemen. Seven of nine deaths r ' and 48 wounds were caused by gunfire. 4 ! Another task'force of this Commission investigated the disorders' in the Glenville area of Cleveland from July 23 to 28, 1968.

The disiOrders apparently began when the Black Nation,alists opened fire on two unifor~ed City'employees, presumably mistaken for police' officers, attempting to tow away an' illegally parked car. About the same time, other Black Nationalists began fIring at police ca,rs stationed in the area to watch over the group's headquarters. ,When additional police arrived, rifle fire from surrounding apartment buildings increased and was returned by the police, first with handguns and later witl\\1 rifles and *otguns.

Some Cleveland police officers stateq this was the first time they had faced semi~automatic weapons and were critical that they were not authorized to carry similar, arms. in patrol cars. Others insisted the snipers had machineguns and submachlneguns.Although no such weapons were foun.d~ one of the suspects was charged with illegal possession of a machinegun. Considering the magnitude of the recent civil disorders and the extensive property damage caused, firearms so far have not played a major role in urban riots. In many cases reports of snipiI}g activity have subsequently proved to be false or exaggerated and most of the gu'nfire casualties were shot by police or troops. Yet the civil disorders have stimulated gun buying and the growth of black and white e:~.:remist gx:oups, leaving this country with a daIlgerOl.lS legacy: the highly explosive combination of fear <lind firearms., Firearms and Future Collective Violence Organized extremist groups of widely differing per!masions cur\u00ad rently advocate stockpiling of fiiearms as a matter of organization policy, in anticipation of either some form of dOn'1eslric guerrilla warfare or increasingly restrictive firearms control, or both. 5 Different groups envision different types of conflict.

Today most rightwing groups no longer consider a Communist military invasion imminent or even very li1cely; but they see evidence of internal Communist subversion in civil disorders and the rise of extreme leftist and Black Nationalist groups) who they believe 'are promoting violence and sociall.lnrest. In this context, rightwing extremists view themselves le58 as future \"freedom fighters\" than as vigilantes or, counter-revolutionaries who may Cne day have to use their weapons against trai.tors and insurgents to preserve law, order, and national security. With the change in the em~my's color from red to black, right\u00ad wing extremism is apparent not only in paramilitary groups, such as the Minutemen, but also in the proliferation of neighborhood protective associations. Now arms are stockpiled \"in the home\" as well as \"in the hills. \" ' Black extremist groups likewise urge members to stockpile fire\u00ad arms, usually for ne,ighborhood and home defense, ,but sometime~ for guerrilla and terrorist activities. Ironically, both black and extremist groups are remarkably similar in their firearms policir~ and their opposition to strict firearms control. This opposition has proved einbarrassing to those who oppose certain gun laws on the ground that they are not effective or not enforceable. To date, no extremist organization; white or black, has caused large scale violence. Rightists have staged abortive attacks on \"Communisttt encampments; racists (presumably Klansmen) have murdered civil rights workers; and Black Nationalists have attacked police and engaged in sniping dUring clvil disorders. Such acts of violence and inflammatory statements of extremist leaders have further stimulated the arms buildup and increased the capacity of such groups to engage in more extensive and costly collective vio\u00ad lence in the future. Although the violence of extremist groups may be more UV~\"\"lU\\\" than actual, the violence invoivillgjuvenile gangs (including som~,i motol\"cyc::le gangs) has occuned in several large cities, over a period\", ',' of many years. Such gangs range from loosely knit neighborhood!1 \" ' ' ethnic, Or social groups to weU-organized groups with strong ;leadeir\u00ad ship and an Obedient membership, though the latter appear to be rare. Fireanns substantially increase the potential seriousness of vio,\u00b7 lence by juvenile gangs. The possession of fIrearms by one I gang p,ro\u00ad vides incentive for rival gangs to arm themselves, and any violence that may result will be more likely to involve death or serious inju!]',. I I, ,.i' }J .1_-----\u00b7-- --_. -- 11iteWns and Collective Violence S9 Juvenile gangs generally are not \u00b7,'paramilitaryn in organization , or operation, but stockpiling of weapons is not un,common. Fight\u00ad ing gangs, in particular, often gather weapons in anticipatian of actual or potential threats from rival gangs: ExtenSive caches of gang weap'ons are sometimes discovered, and many gangs often' discuss real or imagined arsenals of firearms. However,largcnum\u00ad bers of guns have' not, in the past, been involved in specific ~pisodes involving gangs. Typically, incidents in which guns are present, involve ~ single weapon which often is passed among various mem\u00ad bers <?f a group before it is used. Studies suggest that the use of - guns by members of juvenile gangs is often related to interaction within the gang or with other gangs. 6 Althoughjuvenile gangs in the past have been essentially apolitical , in character, it is possible that some will be attracted to extremist causes and adopt extremis~ firearms policies. These is evidence that some juvenile gangs have already become involved in the politi- cal arena. -' , , Unorganized group violence, or. mob violence, tends to relate to particular events and specific targets such as storming a jail, looting a store, or attacking another group. Like juvenile gang violence, it probably wi!! occur whether or not the participants are armed. Pos\u00ad session of firearms by civil authorities or another organized group may even mitigate or deter mob violence on a,particular occasion. However, once a conflict has occurred, fear of future disorders freqUently leads to an arms buildup and to a higher degree of organization among all groups in the affected area. ' Sources of firearms vary among different groups. Extremist orga\u00ad nizations tend to be equipment conscious, favoring high powered military weapons and firearms specifically designed for combat purposes. Most such firearms are acquired through legitimate chan\u00ad nels, though buyers often use false names or otherwise attempt to conceal the fact of ownership. Juvenile gajiigs appear to arm them\u00ad selves through the most convenient and least costly channels: pawn\u00ad shops, \"street\" sellers, theft~ sawed-off Unorganized groups-rioters and street mobs\u00ad generally use firearms alrt:ady possessed by some of their members and.supplement:these with whatever other firearms can be looted. 6See, for example, cases described and interpreted in James F. Short, Jr., and Fred L. PStrodtbeck, Group Process and Gang Delinquency (Chicago: University of Chicago ress,-1965),pp; 191, 200-207, 251 f1'. 60 Summary \". Chapter 10 FIREARMS AND' SELF-DE,PENSB.

Defense of the Home The three principal crimes involving an invasion of the home are burglary,robbery, and sexual attack. ' Burglary is the most common type of intrusion of the' home and causes the greatest property loss, but it rarely thr.eatens the hon:e- owner's life. The burglar typically seeks to commit his crime'wIth- out being discovered, if possible by entering a home that is not .. occupied. Consequently, he is more likely to steal the . firearm than bedriven off by it. For example, oyer 18,000 h.orne burglaries in the Detroit Metropolitan Area in 1967resulted lrl. the killing of only one burglary victim in the City of ~etroit. 3 4 In, New.' York City, over 150,000 burglaries were reported m 1967\" yet on,l~ . 20 victims of burglary w.ere killed in. the decade from 1958to.1967., . 3The burglary data are .those submitted to the FBl by all reporting a~encies~l the Detroit Standard Metropolitan Area.

Firearms \\lIId S~lf-Oefense 163 The risk to the burglar1 though som'ewhat gr~ater than to the; . homeowner, is.still extremely small. In Detroit, from Jam.!ary 1964 through September 1.968, seven residential burglars were shot and. killed 'by their interlded victims-an average of just under two a year. If the ratio of fatal to nonfatal d.eadly assaults with firearms is used as the measure of the nonfatal injuries ~nflicted on year in Detroit. When measured ag~mst the burglary , rate, 110 more than two in a thousand burglaries in Detrqit are foiled by shooting the burglar. . . IIi addition, of 'course, householders with firearms may foil bur\u00ad glaries by interrupting or frightening the burglar. There are no available statistics on theJr~quency of such events. Home robbery differs from home burglary in that the robber confronts his viptim and. uses force. Home robberies occur far less frequently than home burglaries. While killings by home robbers are a small portion of all homicides (between 2 and 3' percent in Los Angeles and Detroit), _home robbery, when it occurs, is far more dangerous than home burglary. For example, from January 1964 tlu'ough September 1968 in Detroit, 17 victims died as a xesult of home robberies, compared to three deaths of home burglary victims. Firearms are of limited utility in defending against home robbers because the robber is 'usually able to surprise and overwhelm his victim. ,DetroitTeporte,d three cases of the victim killing a home robber in 5 years. IIi Los Angeles, where about a ,thousand home. robberie~ were reported in 1967, 8 home robbers were shot and killed fic.~n January 1967 to October 1968. No information is avalhlble on the number of robbers wounded, but if the ratio of fatal to'nonfatal sliootings is used, another 20 to 30 robbers were prob~ply wounded by homeowners' firearms.7 Compared to the overaH rate of home robbery, perhaps 2 percent of home robberies appeal' to result in the firearms death or injury of the robber. EXa;minatiQn oJ the circumstances surrounding the kilJing of vic\u00ad tims by home robbers confirms that the element of surprise sub\u00ad stantially limits the effectiveness of a firearm kept for purposes of deftlllse.'against a home robber. In 11 of the 13 DetrQit cases where data were available, the 'Victim opened the\" ooor or the robber en\u00ad tered t~~ough an unlocked door. In two cases there was evidence .

On the contrary, during 1967 . more lives were lost itt home firearms accidents in Detroit (25) than .. , were lost in home robbery and burglary in 4Yz years (23). Home intrusions that result in sexual attacks are rare but serious events. Yet firearms would,appear 'to be an eVen less effective ~etho(j of self-defense than in robbery, since women generally are less capable of self-defense and'lesskhowledgeable about firearms. Further indication of the limited effectiveness of the use of fire\u00ad arms to defend against home intruders comes from the \"Armed Citizen\" columns published in The American Rifleman. Assuming' the accounts are basically accurate, an analysis of 203 incidents printed between January 1966 and October 1968 disclosed that 69 percent of the incidel1ts involved the use of firearms to protect businesses, while only 17 percent it\"lvolved defense of the home,S even though many times more self-defense weapons are kept in the home.!>' The available data provide no reason to doubt that the loaded gun is a relatively ineffective defense against a violent intruder in, the home. . If keeping a. gun does not materially prote.ct the life and property of the homeowner by enabling him to shoot criminals, it neverthe\u00ad less can be argued that firearms in the home deter criminals and save lives and property. The small number of burglars and robbers actually shot suggests shooting is practically no threat to the , but might be somewhat of a threat to the robber. It is an open 80r the 34 inddents or se1\u00a3-protection in the home, 12 appeared to be home robberies where the offender sought to confront the victim, and 22 seemed to \u00b7be burglaries wheN the victim confronted the offender. A confirmatory check of 29 clippings SUbmitted to the magazine for' a recent issue and made available to the Task Force showed 'one of 29 incident, appeared to be home robbery. . 9The JesuIts of the National Opinion Research Center poll in 1966, footnote 1, supra, can be projected to 11 to~l.of 22.5 million households in the United States with se1\u00a3\u00ad protection firearms, The Small Business Administration study, footnote 2, supra, indi' cates abOUt 535,000 retail businesses in the United have se1\u00a3-protection firearmS, : Fileanns and Self-Defense 6S tion, however, whether home self-defense firearms provide an extra measure of deterrence. 'The trend in crimes against the hom~during recent years has been s~_arply upward in spite\u00b7 of the fact that the number of home self\u00ad defense firearms has'also been rapidly increasing. Yet increases in th~ crime rate occur for reasons unrelated to home firearms posses\u00ad sion, and it is certainly possible that the crirne rate would be still ~gher were it not for firearms. The increase in the 'crime tate may illdeed be a cause oft~e increase.in firearms 0~nership. As a result co~parisons over time of the incidence of crime and ~f frrearms cannot p~ovi~e ill the home deter cnme. 0 It is possible, however, that in a given community a ~ising robbery or burglary rate might be reversed, at _ least temporarily, by a sudden and locally puhlicized increase in , householders' gun buying or gun training. The long-term- conse':: ' quences of such arms buildups or programs may; however, outweigh the short-term benefits. (See ch. 11, in/ra.)

These computations are discussed in App. D. ~ .. 66 Firearms and Violence in American Life A Small Business Admirustration report confirms that for the Nati~n as a whole, burglaries are the more frequept crime against busine~s.u Because burglary usually occurs when the 'premises of a business are unoccupied, firearms are not an effective method of defending against burglary unless armed nightwatchmen are em\u00ad ployed. But firearms may help the businessman to defend against robbery, a crime where the criminal and the businessman meet face to face:' Although financial loss from robbery may be relatively small compared to losses from other crimes such as shoplifting and bur\u00ad glary, business robbery is a substantial national problem. Business. robbery a)?pears to be concentrated in certain .areas,i2 such as and among certain businessmen, such as taxi drivers, operators'of . t'. liquor stores, markets, and gas stations. . Of all crimes against business, robbery is also the primary threat to life. In Detroit in the last 5 years, 50 persons were killed during' robberies of bll;sinesses, compared to six who died from business burglaries, three of which were attributed to looting during civil disorders. Keeping a firearm is one of the many business countermeasures against robbery. Twenty-six percent of a sample of retail business\u00b7 men .reported keeping firearms.13 Businesses also have alarm . armed guards, dogs, and cameras. The limitations of firearms as a countermeasure against business robberies are highlighted in the recent Small Business Adm,inistration study: Because of the sudden, almost violent action of robbery, the victims are often taken by surprise and off their guard. The typical robbery occurs in a very short period of time, less than a minute. Firearms and Self\u00b7Defense 67 ,.,.. \u00b7 ti~ns on the effectiveness of firearms in the prevention of .robbery. The Small Business Administration study, for instance, found that 3 percent of retail. businesses with firearms reported being the vic\u00ad tim of a robbery d~ri.Q.g the previous year. The same percent of .. retail businesses without firearms reported being victimized by . robbery in the same period.1s. However, stores that make a practice of having fIrearms for pro- tection may be unusually vulnerable to robbery, because the stores .. with firearms are more apt to be in high crime areas and experience more burglary than non-firearms stores.16 Thus, firearms could be r~ducing. robbery rat~s in high crime areas. Also, the known posses\u00ad SIon of frrearms may well deter robbers. For instance, if many busi- nesses of a particular kind-such as bars-are known to have firearms d t t f'&\" 17 .' some e erren elect may result. And certamly the conspICUOUS posting of armed guards can be expected to deter ~any potential robbers. Thus, while there are obvious limitations'on the businessman's use of firearms as protection against robbery, it is not known whether, when, or how much guns protect ~usinessmen. It does appear, however, the possession of firearms by businessmen entails . less risk of accidents, homicides, and suicides than firearms in the home. Defense Against Street Crimes States or cities generally prohibit the carrying of concealed' . v:eapons except by certain authorized persons or under certain '. crrcum.stances. However, in some parts of the country many per\u00ad sons still carry guns in pockets or in cars-either within loosely framed laws or in violation of the law. Such gun carrying usually is rationalized on the ground of self-Almost invariably, police departments counsel against the victim of the robbery taking any action which might antago\u00ad nize the robber. Instead he is cautioned to cooperate fully with the robber's wishes .... The typical businessman is neither adequately trained nor prepart:d mentally to face up . defense; While no data exist which would establish the value of . . as a defense against attack on the street, there is evidence that the ready accessibility of guns contributes significantly to the number of unpremeditated homicides and to' the seriousness of assaults.

Carrying guns entails the fUrther risk of \"overreaction\" in am\u00ad biguous situations. An armed person may resort to deadly force mistakenly or unnecessarily or out of momentary rage. Summary Owning a gun for self-defense and protection of homes ~nd nesses is deeply rooted in American tradition. Guns may be of utility in defending businesses but, householders may seriously rate the effectiveness of guns in protection of their homes. In our urbanized society, the gun is rarely an effective means of \" protecting the home against either the burglar or the robber; the former avoids confrontation, the latter confronts too s1'1\u00a7.ftly. POSe session Of a gun undoubtedly provides a measure of comfort to a great many Americans. But the data sqggest that this comfort is' largely an illusion bought at the high price of increased. accidents, homicides, and more widespread illegal use of guns. \" i> Chapter 11 MORE FIREARMS -MORE, FIREAR.MS , VIOLENCE Previous chapters have indicated that in recent years this country has experienced a substantial increase in crime and in sales of fire\u00ad arms, particularly harid'guns. This chapter explores the ~onsequences of this arms buildup in three different ways. The first is a case his\u00ad tory of Detroit,l a city that has,experienced a fIrearms buildup in re~e~~ years., The s~cond is a comparison o~g\\m ownership and gun use ill crime in different regions of the country., The third is a study of armed crime in eight major American cities from which the Task Force,with the help of local police,dep~tments, has as\u00ad sembled data. All approaches ptovide evidence that the arms buildup, if it is partly a response to increased violence, also has contributed to it. \" Detroit - Chapter 1 discussed the growth of gun sales in Detroit after civil ~isorders. In this chapter, the focus shifts from documenting the arms buildup to a study of its consequences. Because Michigan law requires anyone who wants to buy a hand\u00ad gun to apply fora, permit from the local pollee, the general trend of lawful handgun acquisitions can be determined from the number of p~r~ts issued.

Statistics from Detroit show that firearll1S violence increased after an increase in handgun acquisitions. Regional comparisons show that the age of gun use in violent attacks parallels rates of gun ownership. A study of guns used in homicides, robberies, and assaults in eight major cities shows that cities with a high proportion of gun use in one crime tend to have high proportions of gun use in the other crimes. pART III SYSTEMS OF FIREARMS CONTROL Part I dealt with patterns of firearms ownership and use in the United States. Part II focused on the relationship between firearms misuse and various forms of violence. This part shifts the fo~us from the problem to possible solutions. Chapter 12 describes different strategies of fire\u00ad arms control; Chapters 13 and 14 discuss state, local, and federal firearms laws; Chapter 15 relates to fire\u00ad arms control and certain provisions of the federal Constitution; Chapter 16 disc!usses the farearms con\u00ad trQI policies of other nations; Chapter 17 discusses the controversy over the extent to which systems of firearms control can reduce firearms violence; Chapter 18 estimates the cost ofvarious systems of ilrearms control;.and Chapter 19 discusses ways in which advances m technology migh t assist firearms control. 79 L: . Chapter 12 STRATEGIES OF FIREARMS CONTROL The goal of all firearms control is separation of the legitimate from the illegitimate use of guns. The ideal solution would be to leave legitimate gun uses undisturbed and prevent all illegitimate uses. This solution is obviously unattainable, but it provides a ref- t . erence point for appraising the various strategies of firearms con ... , \"~ trol in search of a control system that will prevent as much illegi\u00ad f; tim ate gun use as possible while interfering minimally wit111egiti- mate uses. \\' One way to try to separate illegitimate from legitimate gun use is to regulate the place and manner in which firearms may be used : throughsuc\\11aws as those prohibiting the carrying of firearms ; within city limits, the carrying of firearms in a motor vehicle, the carrying of concealed weapons on one's person, and the discharge \" of a firearm in populated areas. Such laws attempt to reduce fire\u00ad arms violence by police intervention before violence or crime actu\u00ad ally occur. There are obvious limits to the ability of the police to discover persons who violate place and manner laws and to prevent , firearms violence. These laws thus have limited capacity to deter = . violence. l . .p' Laws that provide extra punishmen( for crimes when guns are used are a special form of place and ma~ner laws. These laws are intended to affect the behavior of persoh,~\"\"hdare not deterred by ordinary criminal sanctions, on the theOl}/that tMy might be per\u00ad suaded not to use guns in o;der to avoid extra punishment. There lMost ruearms violence OCCUIS outside the reach of normal police activity-in private dwellings! where 'police are not aware of if, and on the street, where concealed weap- ~ ons are dIfficult to identify. Police officers must have a search warrant to search a home an4 Ie~sonable grounds to search a suspect before they can intervene and prevent the Pdi?t~n~y dangerous use of firearms. The deterrent effect of place and manner laws is mllUshed not only because of the difficulties of enforcement but also because such ullaw~ attempt t? dete~f~om illegal use of fuearms the least reliable segment of our pop\u00ad ation.

Because the registered guns can be traced back to him\"it is hoped that the legitimate gun user will tend to be more responsible in the handling and storage of his firearms and more hesihmt to transfer them to individuals not eligible to possess them.

Strategies of Firearms Control ever, a transfer notice system might provide essentially the same results as registration for less expense and inconvenience.6 85 Registration and transfer notice are similar in that both depend on compliance by law-abiding citizens.7 They are also similar in that enforcement of either system might be substantially strength\u00ad ened by imposing, in addition to criminal penalties, civil liability for .the consequences of any subsequent firearms misuse on all per\u00ad sons who lose or transfer guns without giving the required notice.8 But the two systems are also different. In a registration system, the owner who has previously registered his guns is encouraged to report any subsequent transfer or loss because he is on record as the owner of the guns. This encouragement for giving notice of any later transfer or loss does not exist under a transfer notice sys\u00b7\u00b7 tern. However, the simplicity of the transfer notice system might lead to its being followed even if there is no incentive to do so as a result of existing records on gun owners. Another difference is that, even when certain legal safeguards are adopted, registration may lead to more enforcement difficulties ' under the fifth amendment than transfer notice.

This local emphasis ha~::~ver the years led to a situ- ation where it is safe to assert that the United States has I}1orefire\u00ad arms legislation than any other counjfY in the world'! , These laws present an astonishingdi.versity of rules and regula\u00ad tions, ranging from almost total lack of control to attempts at re\u00ad strictive licensing. Between these extI'etnes lies a great variety of approaches and degrees of strictness. Almost all states have some firearms controllegislation.2 The t:.: ~: .: earliest and most numerous state and 10,callaws relate to the carry\u00ad ing or use of firearms. In the 1600's, M'fu;sachusetts prohibited the carrying of defensive firearms in public places} Kentucky in 1813; Indiana in 1819, Arkansas and Georgia in183 7 passed laws prohib\u00ad iting the carrying of concealed weapons.4,Many states and most cities today have laws attempting to regulate what has been called the place and manner in which firearms m~y be carried or used. Even when there is a will to carefully dra(tand painstakingly en~ force these laws, however, their effect is q~estionable. An Arkan\u00ad sas statute, enacted in 1881, f.or instance,makes it a crime to lCongressman John D.

For years it has been unlawful for any\u00b7 one \"to carry on or about his person) saddle, or in his saddle bags) or in his portfolio or purse al1ypistol ... \"7 This does not apply, however, to \"travellers,\" and the Texas courts have attempted for decades to determine who is exempt as a \"traveller.\"8 As noted in Appendix A,9 Jack Ruby was probably not violating Texas law by routinely caiTying in the trunk of his car the pistol used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald so long as he was en route between his resi\u00ad dence and his business. When he varied from this route, however, and took the pistol from the trunk of his car to carry it on his per\u00b7 son, Ruby probably violated Texas law. In addition to laws relating to the place and manner in which firearms can be used, all but five stateslO prohibit certain cate\u00ad gories of individuals from possessing handguns. The persons ex\u00ad cluded from possession include minors, felons, aliens, fugitives, persons of unsound mind, narcotics violators, and drunkards.u Seldom does one state prohibit all or nearly all of these categories from having handguns.12 5earrying a pistol to kill hogs is not carrying it \"as a weapon.\" See a~~tation !o Ar~ Stats.

Only 20 states13 and the District of Columq\u00b7ta'attempt to screen ineligible individuals by requiring, before 1hllndgun (or a fireann) can be purchased, that the purchaser either flll out an application to be submitted to the dealer, obtain a permit or license from a local law enforcement agency, or obtain a firearms owner's identi\u00ad fication card from a state agency. Even in these 21 jurisdictions which attempt to screen glJP. purch~sers,'the systems vary. Only a few systems require the dealer to hl:>~,d up the sale until the local law enforcement agency approves\"tlteapplication submitted to the dealer.14 Other states allow the handgun to be delivered within a prescribed time even if no response from the local law enforcement agency has been rec~ived.15 Of the 31 states with no procedure whatsoever to screen persons,from buying guns, a few require fire\u00ad anns dealers to notify local police after a gun has been sold.16 All but tWQ,of the state screening system!: are permissive in that they exclude ll1r:1!yid.u..ru.s{rdm owning guns only if the state can give a reason, such \"as a criminal-record or mental incompetency why permission should be denied.

The license has the owner's photograph and shows the serial number of the licensed firearm. Most state screening systems create a waiting period between the time a prospective owner wants to acquire a firearm and the earliest date on which he can take possession. This period ranges from 48 hours in Alabama, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota to a period of 5 days in California, 7 days in Maryland and Connecticut, 15 days in Tennessee, and a matter of months in some cases in New YorkP Registration has never been a popular approach to state firearms control. Only Mississippi has enacted what appears to be registra~ . tion independent of ~y licensing or permit system. 18 Some states with handgun licensing systems require either the dealer or the owner to register guns after they have been acquired. Although a few states maintain a central state file of such information,19 such records are generally maintained only at the local or county level and there is no statewide collection of the information.20 Thus, of the estimated 24 million handguns in the United States, the records maintained by the states with statewide data cover only about 3 to 5 million. 21 One reason for this is that only the District of Columbia appears to have supplemented its licensing law bYTe\u00b7 quiring, when the law became effective, that all firearms already in circulation be registered. In addition to state laws, some cities have passed firearms con\u00b7 trollaws stricter than those that would be applicable to their citi\u00b7 zens under state laws. Philadelphia in 1965, for example, passed a restrictive handgun licensing system much stricter than the perm is' 17 Alan S.

State and Local Fireanns Laws 91 sive Pennsylvania handgun licensing law. In 1968, New York City and Chicago both passed registration laws.22 Table 13-1 is an attempt to summarize the varying degrees of control reflected in existing state fIrearmS laws. The two columns on the left show that all but five states prohibit at least one cate\u00ad gory of persons from owning handguns, but that only a few states extend these restrictions to rifles and shotguns. The two middle columns show that less than half of the states supplement prohibi\u00ad tions against possession by screening the persons who purchase or possess handguns. 23 Only a handful of these states also screen the purchase or possession of rifles and shotguns. The two columns on the right show that only two states have restrictive licensing of handguns and that no state has such a system for rifles and shot\u00ad guns. The emphasis on local control and the great range in the type and strictness of controls presently on the books have created a number of substantial problems. Until the end of 1968, it was perfectly legal to sell or ship weapons from a state which had little or no firearms control to a state with a stricter system. The diver\u00ad sity of state firearms control systems led to a situation where one state's loose laws posed a threat to efforts by other states to im\u00ad pose tighter controls because of the difficulty of keeping firearms from flowing from jurisdictions where they are readily available into jurisdictions with tighter controls. State and local firearms control systems have for years been frustrated by the interstate movement of firearms. In Massachusetts, a 10-year study showed that 87 percent of the guns used in crime came from other states.24 In New York City, 65 percent of a sample of domestic handguns confiscated by police came from outside the state and another 18 percent were of foreign or military origin.25 Similarly, in Detroit 75 percent of firearms used in a sample of shootings in 1968 ana\u00ad lyzed by the Detroit Police Department were never registered in ,', Michigan and were therefore probably not sold by any Michigan 221n ~hicago (with a popUlation in 1960 of 3.5 million), 194,687 handguns llave been regIster~dfr~m the time registratign became effective in 1968 until April 1969.

Many were probably brought in from Toledo, Ohio, where a 1968 survey showed that, of 13,000 handguns sold by one dealer alone, 5,448 went to Michigan residents. 26 The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, discussed in the next chapter, attempts to curtail the interstate flow of firearms and re\u00ad store effectiveness to state and local firearms controls. It is too early to determine the impact of this Act. The handicap placed on even the most stringent state and local firearms laws by the uncontrolled interstate movement offireanns has led to continuing efforts to coordinate firearms policies in the United States through uniform or model state laws. In 1923, the United States Revolver Association promulgated a model fireanns law, applicable only to handguns, that was adopted in a few states. Later rewritten a'3 the Uniform Firearms Act, it had been enacted in 10 states and the District of Columbia27 by 1?36, but often with modifications. A more restrictive act requiring a permit to purchase handguns was drafted in 1940 as the Uniform Pistol Act, but was passed by only two states.28 In 1968, three new uniform laws were proposed-one by the National Association of Attorneys General,29 one by the National Council of State Governments,30 and one, the \"Model Firearms Owners Identification Bill,\" was sponsored by the firearms manufacturers. 31 . If \"tne past is prologue, coordinated uniformity of state fireanns control laws i~ not on the horizon. Proponents of a national fire\u00ad arms policy have accordingly turned their attention to proposals for a federal system of firearms control. Summary State and local firearms regulation in the United States is a patchwork quilt of more than 20,000 laws, many of them obso- 26Testimony of Sheldon S. Cohert.

Chapter 14 FEDERAL FIREARMS LAWS During its first 150 years as a federal union, the United States had no nationai firearms legislation.l The first federal fIrearms possession law ~as passed in 1934 as a tax to discourage ,the use of machineguns and, sawed\";off shotguns andritles. Although anum\u00ad ber of additional laws were proposed in the 1930's and one was passed in 1938, no additional federal flrearms'laws were seriously c()nsidered until the 1960's when a series of proposals ~ere made, including laws for the licensing of firearms owners and registration of firearms. These efforts culminated in the Gun Control Act of 1968 that attempted to curtail mail-order sales and regulate the interstate movement of fIrearms. This chapter reviews the lustory of proposals for federal fIrearms control and'discusses the major provisions of existing firearms laws. During prohibition the rise of organized, interstate crime led ,<'UI\"\"\"'''<1Jli) for the first time to view crime as a national rather than local problem. But even then federal laws to control crinle were' not proposed as a solution. A national commission which conducted fust federally sponsored study of crime in the Uluted States,2 iristance, concluded in 1931 that crime was nationwide in scope . organized in nature but proposed only the mildest federal co\u00ad operation-a national fIngerprint me and a crime statistics agency . ~Fe~erallaws relating iricilie~tly toilrearms were passed at the beginning ofthis centlllywhen the Secretary of the Army was directed to support p~vate Shooting clubs and to sell ilrearms and ammunition at cost to membeliS of the NationalRitle ~ssociation.

The administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, however, viewed ~!fp crime and violence as a national problem requiring a federal solu::\\, tion.4 President Roosevelt proposed a series of virtually unprece\u00ad dented federal anticrime bills,s including a bill which would have regulated the sale and ownership of machineguns and concealable: weapons. These bills encountered substantial opposition fram hunting and shooting interests and from those who felt the federal. govern..l11ent should not assume jurisdiction of traditionally state and focal matters, However, a series of sensational kidnapings an4' machinegun battles between federal agents and public enemies in 1933 and 1934 increased the demands for federal action.6 The fire\u00b7 arms bill remained stalled in Congress, however, until April 1934, when John pillinger broke jail, ro.bbed several banks, and engaged federal agents in machinegun battles. Dillinger's exploits caused a national furor_ and the firearms bill and several other anticrime . 0. J' .'. . measures wei\"e quickly passed. Before'the proposed firearms bill was passed, however, all provi\u00b7 sions applying to handguns were removed. The National Firearms Act of 1934 accordingly.applied only to machineguns, short bar~ reled rifles and shotguns, silencers, and unconventional concealable firearms, suchas'\u00b7caneguns.

The other bills died. The Federal Firearms Ad of 1938 covered all firearms and most handgun ammunition. Before shipping in interstate commerce,the law required firearms manufacturers, importers, and dealers to ob\u00b7 tain a federal license, at an annual fee of $25 f()r manufacturers and importers and $'1 for\u00b7dealers. Dealers and manufacturers were pro\u00b7 hibited from shipping a firearm in interstate commerce to a felon, fugitive from justice, person under indictment, or anyone\u00b7 not a license to purchase, if such a license was required by local law. The prohibited class (felons, etc.) was also forbidden to ship or receive firearms which were or had been in interstate commerce. The act also prohibited knowingly shipping or receiving in inter\u00ad state commerce stolen firearms or firearms with altered serial num\u00b7 b.ers. Finally, dealers were required to maintain permanent records of firearms received and sold.17 Just as the courts had upheld the National Firearms Act of I the Federal Firearms. Act of 1938 was declared a constitutional . exercise of the commerce power.iS Yet, the Federal Firearms Act did not succeed in curtailing the flow of firearms into undesirable hands. Few states coordinated their laws with the federal law by riequiring individuals to have a license before they could buy fire-\" arms!9 Even if states had done sO,any person who paid $1 for a federal dealer's license could be shipped.a firearm without regard. to such a state law.2o Moreover, the act was ambiguous in prescribing standards for. becoming a firearms dealer.

In March 1966, the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee sent a slightly amended firearms bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it remained for a number of months. Then, on August I, Charles J. Whitman killed or wounded s{~me 44 persons b}rifle fire from the tower of the University of Texas. The next day the Presi\u00ad dentr:enewed his call for gun legislation, and the Judiciary Com\u00ad mittee agreed to discuss the latest Dodd bill at its next meeting. However, there was no quorum at that meeting and no action was taken until late September, when the committee rejected the admin\u00ad istration 'bill in favor of a bill that did little more than limit interstate Shipment of handguns.44 This bill was not reported out of commit\u00ad tee until 3 days before the 89th Congress adjourned-too late for any action to be taken. 45 In 1967, President Johnson again urged gun control measures, and Senator Dodd again introduced the administration proposal, substantially identical to the original administration 'proposal in t?e previous Congress.46 About this time, the 'President'sCommis\u00ad SlOn on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice issued its report recommending far stricter firearms legislation than the 42S J enato.r .Thomas J.

Congress had not acted on April 4, 1968, when Dr. Martm Luther King, Jr., was fatally shot in Memphis, Tenn. ~n the wake of sub\u00b7 sequent riots, the Congress did ~o~ o~tlaw mail-order sales of fIre\u00b7 arms but it did include in the CIvil Rights Act of 1968 an amend\u00b7 ment subjecting to federal penalties anyone who ~anufact~esor d transports a firearm in interstate commerce inten~g that It be uSw . a civil disorder or who instructs.another person m the use oUtre\u00b7 :ms with the kn~wledge, reason to know, or intent that the person use the firearm in a civil disorder.49 OnApril29, 1968, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably on a bill providing for federal grants to state law enforce\u00b7 ment agencies which the House ha~ ~assed in .1967. The new Se?atl bill added among other things prOVlSlons relatrng to the control of handguns. During the Senate debate in May, Senator E?~ard~. r Keilnedy offered an amendment incorporating the admmistration. ' proposals restricting mail-order sale of all firearms, but the .amend. ment was defeated by a 53~29 vote. so The bill was passed m the Senate, but the House did not consent to the Senate cha~ge~. , On June 5, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, after wmrungt~e . California presidential primary, 'was mortally wounded by ~n as~il\u00b7 ant armed wi~h a. 22 caliber revolver. 5 1 After the Senator s death, President Johnson urged Congress and the 50 states to adopt cpm\u00b7 prehe~sive gun controls.

Fed:ral Fireanns l.aws 107 He called on the Congress to ban mail-order sales of long guns as well as handguns and to ban sales to youngsters and nonresidents. He also asked the Governors of the 50 states to review and amend their firearms laws. The House, however, passed the pending Senate bill and. sent it to the President for his signature. 52 In spite of his disapproval of certain of its provisions, the President on June 19, 1968, signed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.53 Two of the 10 titles in this act relate to firearms. Title IV is the administration's firearms control bill. In this title, Congress de\u00ad clared: \"[T]he ease with which any person can acquire firearms other than a rifle or shotgun ... is a significant factor in the preva\u00ad lence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States.\" 54 Title IV repealed the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, effective December 19, 1968, and replaced it with other restrictions, particularly on handguns. 55 In Title VII of this act, Congress declared: that the receipt, possession or transportation of a firearm by felo.us, veterans who are other than honorably discharged, mental incompetents, aliens who are illegally in the country, and former citizens who have renounced their citizenship, constitutes- (1) a burden on commerce or threat affecting the free flow of commerce, (2) a threat to the safety ot the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States, .

The Second Amendment The amendment is sometimes quoted in ~ way that would cast doubt on the constitutionality of all ftrearms coritrollaws-\"- \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" But. this is only the second half of the sentence Whiell reads ih full: .' . -'. I!. \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a: free State, the right of the' people to keep and bear Arms shall bot be infringed.\" ' The U$. Supreme Court and lower courtshave consistently in\u00ad terpret~d the second amendment as a prohibition against federal inte:iference with the state militia and not as a guarantee of an in~ diyidual's right to bear ~lfms. The courts thus re,ad the amendment as relating solely tocollectiv.e military preparedness and conclude that the federal gov.ernment may regul'lte' fIrearins as it wishes, so long as it does not thereby interfere with state military personnel in the performance of their official duties with the state militia.

F,irearms Control and the Constitution system.6 Such proof might be difficult, and state authorities are not pleased at the prospect.7 A second,possible approach is to incorporate a \"restrictive use\" provision into the registration statute. Recent amendments to the National Fireams Act, for example, require every person owning a fIiearm covered by the act to register, whether his possession is ' kgal or not. But none of the registration information may \"be , used directly or indirectly, as evidence against that person in a criminal proceeding with respect to .a. violation of law occurring pri(.\\r to or concurrently with registration.\"8 . Under this approach, a person who illegally pqssesses a firearm can be prosecuted if he fails to register. Of course, he could have been prosecuted for illegal possession anyway, so ~his merely cre\u00ad ates two offenses where only one fomedy existed. Perhaps such a system would encourage illegal possessors to register out of fear of a possible additional criminal charge. But this seems unlikely. A . i 6This waS1ecognized by the Supreme Court in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 (1968); which overturned a federal wagering tax statute .. The government had argued, and Chief JusticeWarren in dissent took the view, that the wagilring tax statute should ~ upheld but that further criminal use of any information obtained under thestat~te should be prohibited, The Court refused to adopt this approach: . . [Tlhe imposition o{ such restrictions would necessarily oblige state prose\u00ad (;I!ting au~orities to establish in each case that their evidence was untainted by any connection with .information obtained ~ a consequence of the wager\u00ad ing taxes; the federal requirements would thus be protected only at the cost of hampering, perhaps seriously, enforcement of state prohibitions against gambling. 390 U.S. at 59\u00b760. . 7 .... ,1 would oppose the enactment .. the regis\u00ad ~ation of weapons ..

Under this approach also, in any prosecution for illega~ ppsses- sion the authorities would have to establish that their eVidence was ~ntainted by the defendant's registration. Further, :hete are problems in drafting such a restrictive use provision, for It must be \"coextensive\" with the protection offered by the fifth amend\u00ad ment.9 The Supreme Court has ruled that the fifth amendment . covers future or \"prospective,\" as well as past, criminal acts, al-. though it has observed that ~'prospective acts ~ill.doubtl~ss ~r~' narity involve only of Incnrnma- . tion.\"10 .' . A third possible approach is that adopted by the gun regIstration FiJeums Control and the Constitution 117 plicable only to all legitimate gun owners is not paradoxical but is a consistent part of a larger system of firearms control. There is still apother way of minimizing fifth amendmentobjec\u00ad tions. Requiring an owner to register the gun he possesses in viola\u00ad tionof some law may raise a .fIfth amendment objection. Requir\u00ad ing fuearms dealers. to supply information about pei~bns who obtain fIrearms from the dealers would seem to present fewer diffi~ culties under the fifth amendment ,because the person supplying the information is no longer incriminating himself. In addition, the dealers could be granted immunity from any prosecution for the illegal sale of fueanns and then be obliged to supply informa~ tion which might incriminate illegal gun buyers. Similarly, when~ ever a gun is sold or given away by a private individual. the former owner can be given immunity and required to submit information on the gun and its new owner. As discussed in Chapter 12 a notice similar to the warranty card now in use with many products might readily be adapted to this purpose and probably would not create fifth amendment difficulties. Fifth amendment problems may sti1l1inger on the fringe of fire- ordinance of the City of Chicago. This ordinance provides that any person who possesses a fuearmin violation of any Chicago, state, or federal laW is not required to register and that any at-. tempted purported J:'egistration is null and void.ll. T~e hYP?thetl\u00b7 . cal felon thus need not register in Chicago. He will still be liable \\ for illegal possession, however, and the llut~orities wh? vr?secute. him for this offense will not have to establish that theu eVidence IS , untainted by information from the registration files. If the felon does register, his doing so clearly was not \"compelled\" and he ~ no claim under the fIfth amendment. . .. .\" By requiring legitimate users to register their fuearms anll eX\u00ad empting illegitimate users, the Chicago approach creates an ap~\u00a5~ ent paradox. Registration, however1 is Only one aspect of a. tot~~ system of fIteariils control. Provisions making it illegal for meligf ble persons to possess a fuearni are all that is need~d to .se~d the .. \u00b7 iilegalpossessor to jail when he is-discovered. RegIstratio~con\u00ad tributes to fuearnls control not by pointing the fmgef at illegal. pos~ssors but by reducing the flow of ~uns fro~ legi.ti,?a!e ~?ille-: A gitimate users. Given this limited function, making t:eglstrat~on ap-~ anus control. For instance, fifth amendment objections might be raised about fuearms licensing laws. A fueanns statute which sim\u00ad ply prohibits possession of fuearms by defmed classes of persons\u00ad s~ch as felons-cannot raise a fnth amendment problem. Yet license systems requiring persons to me an application by which authorities pass upon their qualifications and involving the main~ ~enance of records on who owns what fuearms might lead to self\u00ad mcrimination wheninfonnation obtained during the application process leads authorities to uncover a crime in which the applicant has been involved; a substantial' risk 1hattegistta\u00b7 will. serve to incriminatebim'l PIobably not. but only a future cou~ case ~ sesob't,'- the issue..\u00b7 . llChlcago Municipal Code,.ch.1l.1 (1968). An application that requires one to list all fuearms presently ~wned might also create a fifth amendment question when a license is denied by the authorities who suspect from the filing of ~he ~pplication that the applic~nt may still possess a fireann. Even ~~t~~pro~es~is found!o be incrimination, it might be \"pro spec- lve .. andlhs diffIcult to anticipate whether the Supre~e Court ~ould the .fnth amendment has been violated resolved, all Iuearms licensing and reg\u00ad .. trat~on statutes must be carefully drafted to minimize possible conflict with the fifth amendment, . no legal barrier to federal or state arms legIslt\\.;J,on.

Chapter 16 FOREIGN FIREARMS LAWS Firearms control systems that appear to work W'f';1l in other coun~ tries with cultures and traditions different from the United States would not necessarily help io lessen the Americ..an problem -aftire\u00ad arms misuse. Yet it would be unwise to ignore what other nations have accomplished in controlling firearms violence. Our sources in this chapter are collections of foreign fireanns statutes and rough estimates of handgun ownership rates supplied by representatives of foreign governments. The text of a lrrearrns law is, of course, an insufficient basis for evaluating the quality of any country's llIeanns control system since the laws on lhebooks may notbe enforced. Yet such laws do illustrate the variety of ways in which other countries attempt to control the misuse of firearms. During 1968, two surveys of foreign .fireanns'laws were made.; The 8.tate Departmen tasked 102 of its diplomatic posts for infor~ mation on local fIrearms laws, and the Library of Congress analyzed firearms laws of 30 countries, predominantly in Europe.1 The 29 European countriesreviewed2 require either a license to carry a fIrearm or registration of the ownerShip or sale of each pri~ vate1y owned firearm. or both. At least five Eur()pean countries totally prohjbit the privatepos., session afhandguns. 3 In regard to other types offir~s,. the SOviet Union allows anyone with a hunting license to possesS smooth-bore hunting arms.

In North and South America, 15 of the 19 canvassed countries 4 require a license to possess or to carry a fire ann 01 registration of all firearms, or all of these. Paraguay has no controls whatsoever. Mexico has only local controls; El Salvador imposes no restrictions except in urban areas; and Nicaragua has no restrictions on owner\u00ad ship but does limit carrying of firearms. In Asia and AUstralia, 2i countries 5 were canvassed and all re-\u00ad quire either a license to possess or carry or registration of firearms, or both. The only exceptions are Australia and New Zealand, which impose no restrictions on shotguns, although they have severe rew strictions on handguns, and Afghanistan, which imposes no restric\u00ad tions on sporting weapons, althou~ it, like Japan, completely out\u00ad laws possession of handguns. In Africa, 25 of the 33 nations6 canvassed require registration of the ownership or sale of fireanns. The remaining eight have ~ licensing systems relating to ownership or carrying. Three7 entireiy prohibit the possession of handguns, four prohibit possession of military weaponsJ8 and one (Algeria) allows sporting firearms to be C possessed only by sporting clubs. While these surveys may conceal substantial gaps between law and practice, they disclose that foreign countries, with few excep\u00ad tions, have comprehensive national systems of flreanns control. At though national firearms control may not be as appropriate fQrthe federal system in this country? it must be noted that such large and diverse countries as Canada and Brazil have both adopted national \"\" programs of firearms contro!., These surveys also show that while many foreign countries reg\\!-\"\"~ late all flrearms without distinguishing between different types, \" other countries treat handguns and long guns differently, prohib-' .... ; Hillg or regulating handguns while imposing fewer restrictions on '. i rifles or shotguns.

One of the most controversial issues in the recent debates over firearms legislation is whether any system of screening owners could be effective in reducing gun violence. Both sides often take extreme positions. Proponents of firearms control sometimes seem to urge that even the mildest form of firearms legislation will eliminate gun misuse. Opponents of controls may argue that no gun laws can prevent criminals from having guns and that all efforts at control are accordingly futile. The statistical materials assem\u00ad bled to support these extreme pOSitions often reveal more about the frailty of partisan research than about the potential effective\u00ad ness of different types oflegislation.1 This chapter is a discussion of some of the evidence that has been produced in the gun control controversy. Data on the effec\u00ad tiveness of firearms control measures in the United States usually come from one of two comparisons. neither of which is completely satisf~ctory. The most frequent approach is to compare crime rates lithe United States with those in foreign countries. This COl1lpari:~on generally shows that most industrially developed Western llations experience far lower rates of gun crime than the United States. This does not necessarily mean; however. that adopting the foreign firearms con tro~ systems in this ~oun try would. r(!duce our firearms violence to the lower foreign levels.

Even when the greatel' incidence of homicide and robbery in the United States is eliminated from the comparison, Tal?ie l7~2 shows that, when ~obbery occurs in. the U,nited States, gu,nsare used six times as often as in England and Wales. When homicide occurs, guns are used about three times as often .in: the United States. These statistics also show that, even under England's restrictive handgun licenSing, some robberies and homicides are still committed witq. .guns. The lower .rate of fIrearms usage in violent crime .committed in England and Wales suggests that a fIrearms control system that malces it substantiallymored,iffIcult to obtain guns may have some\u00ad thing ;to do with reducing the uSe of firearms in criminal behavior. Comparison of English crime statistics with our own also reveals that in England, where handguns are difficult to obtain legally, . \"long. guns are not used in crime much more often than in the United States. Forinsiance, in England before stricter shotgun controls were put into effect in 1967, shotguns. were used in 10 percent of all homicides cdmpared to 9 percent in the United States. 3 A secon4 approach that is often used in an effort to measure the eff~ctiveness of fuearms controls is to COmpare crime statistics in ah a!!'ea of the United States which has gun control laws with an area. which has no effective controls. These comparisons can be misleading because the areas compared may be quite'differentin lPliteri, ~radition, social mobility, raCial c~mposition, and\u00b7 other factors that bear on the incidpnce of crime. Such comparisons may also be t:nisleading because stat~j<md local 'fir~~rms contrOl, systems have for years been frustrated by the interstate~ovement of fue\u00ad arms. and it is accordingly \u00b7diffIcult to confmn that any difference in crime rates ~ attribut~ble to the pres~nce or absence of gun con\u00ad trols.

Although factors other than firearms COIl) trollaws can affect gun use in different cities, it is plausible to con\u00ad cHide that fuearms control systems that substantially reduce total ~n ownership also reduce the use of guns in viol~nce. 'This is. a smlple t;lprollary of the proposition discussed in Chapter 11: fewer guns-less gun violence. Since handguns constitute only one fourth of the guns in this couJ).~ry but are used in more than three fourths of gun crilnes} a system of nationwid<s restrictiv~ licensing for handguns which sub\u00b7 stantially reduces handgun owner-ship below present levels can be expected to also curtail firearms violence. Even though such a sys-. tern would not reduce long gun ownersJ)ip, it would not appear to risk a massive strift to the use of long guns in crime. Restrictive handgun licensing is the only reasonable system that wUlsubstantially reduce handgun ownership. ltis thus a far more certain'rnethod of reducing firearms violence than permissive licens\u00b7 ing. Available data on states with pennissive licensing systems in ,the United States suggest that the wide .distnbution of legally held firearms and the free intl~rstate flow of firearmi1 cause severe diffi\u00b7 . cUItiesin any attempts to keep ftrearms from illegitimate users. On the basis of present evidence, it cannot be assumed that permissive licensing laws have prc)ved effective in the past.7 Anationa! system of permissive licensing that successfully keeps guns from the prohibited groups (felons, fugitives, addicts, drunk\u00ad arQsl etc.) could be expected to reduce gurrviolence. The critical question is whether .such a system, provided it is not frustrated by . the int.erstate flow of firearms, can in fact keep guns from such ~oupswhi1e the total number of guns in circulat~pil is not reduced. The danger of transfer' of firearms from legitimate to. illegitimate users might he somewh~t abated by a registration or transfer notice system. But panic buying, thefts, and hand-to-hand transfers of fIrearms 10 illegitimate users would continue to cause misuse of . , gUnsieven ifa permissive screening system were vigotql1$ly enforced.

After an The 'Costs of Fireanns Control $72.8 Yet even. this unusually high unit cost amounts to only abOut 19 cents percitizen.9 131 Maintaining an existing restrictive licensing system is, of course, le~s costly than the initial introduction of such a system. When a restrictive licenSing system begins, many persons must give up previously lawful firearms. A schedule of compensation for fire\u00ad arms surrendered by OWners Who can no longer possess them law\u00ad fully must accordingly be established at the outset of restrictive licensing. If an average of $20 were paid for 22 million of the 24 ntillion handguns in this country, such payments throughout the nation would cost $440 million. This expense would not recur, however, and in evaluating the costs of a restrictive system it should be spread over a period of years. ' If a system offull registration or transfer notice is added to a permissive licensing system, the supplemental administrative costs of recording ownership would be minimal, particularly if the process were similar to systems now used by private industry. One esti\u00ad mate, for instance, puts the annual cost of a national firearms regis\u00ad tration system 2t $22.5 million, or 25 cents per frrearm.Io Requir\u00ad nag gun owners to report losses or transfers personally to local clfficials would cost more than reporting by mail,but the cost per firearm would still be low. , In order to assure that a recording or transfftr notice system is ~!eing observed, Owners should be audited from time to time to ~rsure that the registered owners still possess their frrearms. Audit;. I11g can be done by mail, in person, or preferably by a combination ~ifboth. The cost of an auditing system would depend primarily 9n the size of the sample of firearms owners audited each year.

Such economic discrimination is inconsistent with the 't theory of either restrictive or permissive licensing.

The unit cost of a permissive licensing system is, relatively low, and even if most of the costs were passed on to firearms owners, the economic burden on applicants would not be great.

This chapter discusses three developments that might help reduce firearms violence: (a) devices'to trace firearms, (b) devices to det(;;ct the presence Qf ftrearms, and (c) nonlethal weapons. Tracing Firearms Proponents of firearms control measures often suggest that all guns should be \"fingerprinted\" by conducting a ballistics test in .;t the hope that the ftrearm and its owner can be identified if the , ~ gun is subsequently misused. Unfortunately, the storage of nearly ( .. ( 100 million bullets and the development of a system of classifying test bUllets so that bullets used in crime can be traced to a particu\u00ad lat' firearm are problems of great magnitude. Moreover, no m~thod of adequately preserving the rifling marks on a test bullet has yet been devised. As a result, the marks on a test bullet would change over the years. ~'A.t the same time, as ftrearms are used, rifling and other distinctive marks imparted to bullets change to the extent that bullets fired from the same firearm at different times have ;1 quite different markings; Also, the \"fingerprints\" left by a gun will change if barrels or other firearms Parts are replaced. j The foregoing problems might be avoided by a system of giving each gun a number and the development of some device to imprint , this number on each bullet fired from the gun. .Al'1\u00b7)t.ner suggested ... : method of tracing firearms is to implant an identi~l~ng capsii1e With a distinctive number in each bullet and require firearms dealers who sell the ammunition Jo maintain records of the per~ Sons who buy all such numbere&iammunition, Since over 4.4-rl 135 D \"-136 Fireatms and Violence in American Life Dillion bullets were manufactured in this country in 1967,1 many practical and technical problems must be overcome before any such idea can be translated jnto a working system. ~ A practical system of tracing bullets from 90 million fireanns . cannot be reasonably anticipated in the near future. Detection Devices More sophisticated methods of detecting people who carry fire\u00ad arms would help our police enforce firearms laws. Devices which sound an alarm when a metal object passes near the sensing instru\u00ad ment, for instance, might be used to detect flfearms in airports, railroad stationst or other locations where a single checkpoint could be established. A simple induction coil placed in a doorway allows detection of any firearm which passes close enough to disturb the magnetic field. Magnetic devices of this kind) however, are subject to false alarms from keys, coins) or other metal objects, X~ray devices would eHminate false alarms but cause health hazards. A combination of magnetic and X-ray devi~esmight be feasible if persons passing, the checkpoint were requested to .remove coins and keys before entering the magnetic field. If the magnetic de\u00ad tector indicated the presence of a metal object, X-ray equipment might be used to identify the object. Detection of fl,tearms jn growds is considerably more complex, but might be accomplished through .radar or ultrasonic deYice~. Firearms m,ight also be detected in crowc!s by chemically treating (or tagging) gun metal or ammunition so that it has a detectable scent wllich can. bCPlcked up by a sensitive HsniffingH device. If radiation hal1,ards can be overcome, newly manufacturei;! frreanns or ammunition might also be HtaggedH with a radioactive substance detectable by a geig~r counter. AlthOUgll adeqv.at~ d\u20ac)vices. to detect fueanns have not b~en developed~ such developments could be made in the near future. Furth.er research and development work should be pursued.

' \" PART IV RECOMMENDATIONS One out of every two hundred deaths in this country results from the criminal or accidental use of fll'eanns. About the same number of deaths are the t:esult of fll'earms suicides.1 Thousands more are wounded each year, and untold others are threatened. by someone holding a gun. An overw.~elming majority of the guns in this . country are'used responsibly. The handgun is the principal weapon of gun misuse, accounting for more than three fourtJIs of all criminal gun vio\u00ad lence. Although handguns constitute only about one fourth of all guns in civilian hands in the United States, the number of such guns is formida\u00ad ble-24 million. This amounts to' an average of 40 handguns for every 100 households. And the rate i~ increasing because handgun sales have risen dramatically in the last decade . . It can s~Jrprise no one that high rates of gun violence are, connected with high rates of handgun ownership. When the number of handguns in\u00ad creases, gun violence increases, and where there are fewer guns, there is less gun violence. . 'If there were fewer handguns in this country , the knife and other weapons might replace the gun as instruments of violem:e. Even so, deaths . and injuries would be reduced because a gun attack ~s five times as deadly as an attack with another weapon . lor the 1,852,000 people who died in 19()7 in the United States, approXimately 18,900 ruM of gunshot wounds: aboUt 9,000 sui\u00ad cides, .2,900 gun accidents, and 7 ,000 h9micides; 139 140 Firearms arcd ViOlence in American Life The stockpile of handguns in this country is a legacy of traditional American ,attitudes toward firearms and decades of lruc firearms control. Yet~ the handgun in the house gener.ally creates more danger than safety. The use of handgtl.ns for target shooting can be accommodat~d wIth~ut such a stockpile of guns, and the ,handgun IS unimportant as a hunting weap~n. At the same time ciVil disorder, racial tension, and fear of crim~ are turning our nation into an a~e~ camp d have increased the role of firearms in VIolence. ~he vicious circle of Americans arming themselves toprotectagainst other armed Americ~ns must be broken. Finding effective and appropnat~ methods . of reducing gun violence must be recogruzed as a national problem.

' An information program is necessary to secure broad public support for meaningful firearms legis\u00ad lation and to encourage the safe and responsible use of firearms.

The Commission on Law EnforcelMnt and (Administration of Justice ' Established. by President Johnson on July 23, 1965, this Commission re\u00ad ported in February 1967. In chapter 10 of its report, entitled \"Control of Firearms,\" this Commission found: 1 (1)DUring 1963, 4,760 persons were murdered by firearms. During 1965, 5~600 murders, 34,700 aggravated assaults, 'and the vast majority of the 68,400 armed robberies were committed by means of firearms. All Qui 10 of the 278 law ,enforcement officers murdered between 1960 and 1965 Were killed by firearms. (p.239) , (2) Although many of an estimated 50 mU~on privately owned fire\u00ad arms belong to hunters, collectors, and sportsmen, 37 percent of the persons interviewed in a poll conducted by the National Opinion Rc\u00b7 search Center said that they kept firearms in their homes to protect themselves.

(p.242) Status The Gun ControlAct of 1968, which pecame law on October 22, prohibits the transportation in interstate commerce of \"destructive device:;\" except by licensed manufacturers, dealers, importers, ~r collectors, who must pay an . annual license fee.2 \"Destructive devices\" include bomb~, gr~nades, rockets, missiles mines and other devices designed to expel a prOjectile more than . 1/2 inch in di~eter.

States; pos\u00ad 'session of destructive devices, as recommended by the Crime Cominission. '('he Crime Commission recommendation also asked the states to outlaw the transportation and possession of \"destructive devices.\" Several states have fqr many years had statut$,<; nutluwing the possession of bombs and ex\u00ad plosives.5 Although '~destructive devicj'ls\" might well be encompassed by these earlier state statutes, four\u00b7 states6 and the District of Columbia 7 have specifically enacted legislation to outlaw the p'ossession of \"destructive de\u00ad vices.\" Recommendation States should enact laws prohibiting certain categories oj'persons, such as habitual drnnkards, drng addicts, mental incompetents, persons with a history of mental disturbance, and persons con\u00b7 victed of certain offenses, from bUYing, owning, or possessing [il'earms.' (p.242) Status Although not strictly within the Commission':'s recommendation, tne fed\u00ad eral government in the Gun Control Act of 1968 makes it unlawful for felons, persons under indictment, fugitives, unlawful users of marihuana or narcotics, adjudicated mental defectives, or persons committed to. a mental institution to re~el.ve or transport.any firearm in interstate.commerce. 8 It is f\\!s6'tmlaw\u00ad fuI for licensed firearms manufacturers, dealers, importers, or coU~ctors to sell fuearms to anyone within the prescribed group.9 Inltdditlon, Title VII to (he Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets act'ot ~:968, as amended by the Gun Control Act of 1968, makes unlawful th~ receipt, possession, or trans\u00ad porting in interstate commerce of any firearm by felons~ dishonorably dis\u00ad charged 1968).-.7-~ 5See, Consol.

Recommendation Each State should require the registration of all handguns, rifles, _ and shotguns. If, after .5 years, some States still have ~ot e~acted , such laws, Congress should pass a Federal firearms reglstratlon act applicable to those States. (po 243) Status Several states have had for several years systems whereby a permit is r~\u00ad quired to purchase a handgun. 12 As a result, these states generally have fil~s showing the names and addresses of persons legally owning firearms and the model and serial number of the handguns owned. In essence, these states have all the information which could be. obtained t4rough a system of hand\u00ad gun registration. . . \\ We are unaware, however, of any state \\~hich h~S, sl~ce the regtstration ~ystem, alt~ough several cities, including New York City, Chicago, San FranCISco, and Mmneat> olis, have done so.

(p. 243) . Status \" 155 As noted in connection with the previous recommendation, several states ~ave permit systems'regulating the possession of handguns, although there . would appear to be wide divergence in cIlforcement of such laws. The New , York and Massachusetts systems appe~r to be strictly enforced, but this\"does 'not appear to be the case with other states, except perhaps New Jersey in re- \u00b7centyears. ' ' R.egarding the remainder of tbis recommendation, th,e Gun Control Act of 1968 .prohibjts the ma~ order or interstat~ shipment of handguns, rifles, and shotguns, except from a federally licensed manufacturer, dealer, importer, or collector to another such manufacturer, dealer, importer, or collector. Ship;\u00ad ments of rifles or shotguns (but not handguns) to contiguous states is allowed under the new federal law so long as the'sale does not violate the law of either the seller's or buyer's residence and so long as 'the buyer executes an affidavit setting forth his name and address and swearing he is eligible to own the fire\u00ad arm. A copy of this affidavit must be sent to the chief law enforcement offi\u00ad cer of the' buyer's residence and 7 days must elapse before delivery can be made. The Crime Commission also recommended a cont~!1uing effort to find non\u00ad lethal weapons to replace the handgun, so that victims of guns are merely in\u00ad capacitated and not killed!3 (p. 256). This subject is discussed further in Chapter 19, infra. The National' Advisor Commission on Civil Disorders (the KernerCo1l1l}1ission ' This Commission was formed by Presiden~Johns(jn on July 29,1967, to study the civil disorders which had occurred in various sections of the United States and to make recommendations to. minimize their r~,\\)ccurrence. 13The Task Force 011 Science and Technology elaborated in this way on the question of nonlethal weapons: , \"A patrol officer, in meeting the has.a potent1ally lethal handgun If an 'officer feels that his life is threatetled, .he may shoot, with the attendant risk that suspects or bystanders may be killdid .

Shotguns .,.. The shotgun is a smooth bore, long arm designed to fire paper Or plastic cartrIdges loaded with lead pellets. 1 It comes closest to being an all-purpose ' wcaport by virtue of the variations i11 barrel iength and shot loads made to ac~ . commodate hunters, sport shooters, farmers, and law enforcement agencies .. It also has a long histoiy as a frontier weapon o( household defense and has earned notoriety as a weapon of gangsters and some armed robbers. The shotgun's utility derives mainiy from its effectiveness against fleeting targets. Despite its short range and limited penetrating power, the gun's ex\u00ad panding shot pattern greatly increases the likelihood of hits on birds in flight and running game. In police work, where ricochet bullets might endanger' bystanders or other officers, the shotgun's short range and limited penetnlting power are definite assets. At the same time, it can be an extremely destructive weapon at close range. Traditionally, the shotgun is a simple and inexpensive firearm whose single or doubJ'e barrels require reloading by hand after each shot: Although the recent trend has been toward repeating and autbloading 2 shotguns, Single shot models still enjoy conliiderable popularity for certain types of hunting and sport shooting. The great majority of shotguns sold in this country are of domestic manufacture. Rimfite Rifles Almost all rimfire rifles are .22 caliber arms suited mainly for target shoot\u00ad ing, plinking, and hunting small game. Despit\u00a2.its limited utility as a hunting . weapQn; the .22 rimfire rifle has always been popular among all classes of shooters because of its low cost and inexpensive ammunition. Despite its Iel~ atively low power, .22 rimfire ammunition has sufficient range and accuracy ~e exceptions arc uncommon: shotgun pistols, metallic shot cartridges for use in . \"nnes and pistols, brass shot shells loaded with a lcad slug for largc gamc hunting. , ':~epeating rucarms carry a supply of cartridges in a magazine, but require. hand opera\u00ad tiO!! of the reloading mechanism between shots; semi-automatic or au toJoading lue\u00ad arm~ utilize gas pressure or recoil to perform this operation and will flre asf~st as the shooter Cl\\llpuUthdrigger: l63 \", \\;, \", i,\\ .m 164 Pi!'canns and Violence in American Life for serious target shooting. Its most common use is probably for informal target shooting-plinking at tin cans and bottles. Almost all rimfire rifles sold in this country are of domestic manufacture. Although rirnfire rifles are built with a variety of single shot and repeating actions, the curren! trend appears to be toward semi~automatics. Centerfue Rifles Although some centerfire rifles are .22 caliber, most are larger, and centet\u00b7 fire cartridges, regardless of bullet size, typically have several times the power and range of:rimfire ammunition. This greater range and power, together with the generally higher cost of the gun and ammunition, once tended to limit ownership of centerfire rifles to the more serious sportsmen. Since World Wac II, however. large numbers of surplus military rifles have been sold by the U.S. AmlY or imported from abroad at bargain prices. Consequently, high powered centerfue rifles have increased in popularity among all classes of shooters to the point where this type of rifle now rivals the .22 rirnfire in popularity. While experienced sportsmen generally prefer a conventional hunting rifle manufactured by an established American firm, mapy hunters have purchasr~ military surplus rifles to convert th.em to sporting weapons with new sights,\"~ stocks, and flnishes more appropriate to civilian purposes. Some surplus mil\u00ad itary ri11es have thus been converted into handsome, high quiility sportirig arms. Most surplus military arms are poorly suited to any hunting purpose, however, because of their size, weight, obsolete design, poo~;;condition, or use of military ammunition. Some verge on junk and are suitable only for ' decoration.' In addition to increasing the incidence of centerfue rifle o~nership by people who do not regularly hunt or participate in shooting sports, military\u00ad surplus rifles and ammunition have increased lalge bore target ~ooting, es-. pecially plinking, and have greatly stimulated gun collecting a~:a hobby among younger persons who have limited budgets and who view surplus arms as mil:'.: itary antiques, ~.... c;' Centerfire rifles are available in a wide variety of calibers, styles, and ac-.!~ tions. A few are single shot, but the gI~at IIlajority are bolt, pump, or lever \"\\ action repeaters. Surplus military rifles'of.,',:American manufacture include . the 1903 and 1917 bolt action, .30 caliber Army rilles of World War I vintage:,' a.nd the semi~automatic Ml rifles andcatbines of World, War II, many of whiell' have reached the civilhm market through the Army's Civilian Marksmanship Pr.ogram.3 Most foreign-made rifles are of and Centerfu~ Handguns Virtually aU rimfue haria&1ns, like rimfue rifles, are chambered for .22 caliber ammunition.

If properly designed for accuracy, ~Iw .22 caliber ~andgu1l1 IS partIcularly suited to target shooting by virtue of Its,moderate pn~e and the low cost of ammunition. In recent years, how\u00ad ever, the domestic firearms market has been flood.ed with imported .22 hand\u00ad guns too che.aply an~ ~oo~ly ~ade to serve even the most casual sporting pu;posc. C.nme statistlcs.mdlcate that these rim fire handguns are increasingly bemg us~d as pocket weapo~s in the old \"$2 pistol\" tradltion. Because these low-quahty ~a~dg~ns have virtually no appeal for the hunter, sport shooter, or colle?tor, It IS likely that the million or more sold in the last few years are largely m the hands of persons who own no other firearms . This flow of .cheap handguns from abroad should be substantially eliminated under the Gun~ontrol A~t of 1%8, Which allows importation only of hand\u00ad guns that are sUltab~e fO,r ~por~ing purposes.\" Manufacture of such weapons may,of course, begm wlthm this country, but because of higher manufactur- ing costs they will probably then sell for $15 to $25. . The,centerfire handgun ranges from .25 to .45 caliber imd is a more power\u00ad ful weapon than t?~ r~fir~ h.andgun. The greater range, and cost of centerfire ammumhon limits 1ts useJor plinking, although a few shooters, use centerfue handguns for target shooting and hunting. From all indications, however, most centerfue handgun owners buy this t}1Je of weapon at least p.artly, for purposes of personal and home protection., As' with centerfire r\u00a5les,ownership bf centerfire handguns appears to have increased substan\u00ad tially due to the importation of miHtarysurplus arms since Wor1d War II. ~ny.oft~ese guns are military service sidearms of su~ficient quality and histon~al mterest to appeal to serious sportsmen. an.d collectors. However the mail-order availability and relatively low cost of many of these fuear~s h~s doub~lessly led to their purchase ,by many persons who might not other~ Wise own a centerflIe handgun, Antique and Hobby Firearms .

Most German military sidearms of World War II and el}rlillr (such as Lugers and Mausers), certain early model Colt and Browning automatic pistols, and even some of the nickel-plated revolvers are gradualiy being tak~n out of circulation by collectors. The number of serious gun collectors in the United States has been con\u00b7, servatively estimllted at 10,000, most of whom belong to one or more ofthe approximately 75 local and regional collectors associations. 6 In addition, there are probably many thousands of Americans who qualify as gun \"buffs\" and who simply accumulate sizable collections of fuearms without any serious effort to specialize in anyone type. One small, but active, segment of the firearms industry manufactures mod\u00b7 ern muzzle loaders and replicas of antiques, and several firms manufacture specially designed rifles and pistols that are suited stlictly for target shooting. Paramilitary Fireanns A recent and potentially troublesd,',,1, J!;1 phenomenon is purposes. These include sen).i-automatlc pistols with actions and magazines of the Ml carbine rifle, high-powered semi\u00b7 automatic rifles styled after military \"assault\" rifles and light machineguns, \"riot\" shotguns of the type used by police agencies, and such combat acceS= sories as bipods, muzzle brakes, flash hider,s, folding stocks, and large-capacity magazines. , De.spite appearances, these weapons Can be legally sold in this country because they are not assembled from surplus machi.'1egun parts and are not readily modified for fully automatic Hre. They are virtually useless for hunting or other sporting purposes, and the advertisements for them in gun publications suggest that their main appeal is to paramilitary groups and i.o individuals arming themselves in expectation of civil disorders. While the traffic in these guns is difficult to determine, the records of one recently formed company show the sale of more than 4,000 .45 caliber \"submachine\"\u00b7 type carbines in the first 4 months of 1968,7 indicating a demand that is sizable and probably increasing. Destructive Devices Since World War II a substantial quantity of military ordnance other than small arms has reached the u.s, civilian market through returning servicemen and dealers of military' surplUS. This equipment includes mortars, rocket launchers (bazookas), cannon, antitank rifles, mines, bom~s, and hand gre- nades. Sale and possession of such weapons are now regulated by the.

Some cannon and antitank rifles are sefVice~ able. weapons insofar as ammunition has been BYailable through surplus arms dealers. Their misuse has never been a serious problem, however, and they appeax to be mostly in the hands of \"cannon buffs\" and collectors of miliUu\"y ordnance. Of greatest concern has been the acquisition of heavy weapons and ex\u00ad plosive devices by certain paramilitary groups such as th~ Minutemen. How\u00ad ever, the further import and sale of this type of ordnance woUld appear to have been largely curtailed by the Gun Control Act of 1968. Prohibited Firearms The National Fireanns Act of 1934 and the statutes of a number of states regulate the ownership of sawed-off shotguns and rifles, automatic weapons.9 handguns made from long arms, and silencers. Under federal\u00b7 and most state laws, a sawed-off firearin isa shotgun whose barrel length is less than 18 inches, a rifle whose barrel length is less than 16 inches, or any shotgun or rifle whose overall length is less than 26 inches. This includes any shoulder weapon which has been modified into a handgun and any ?andgu~ w~ch has an attachable shoulder stock. The; lIsual purpose of cuttmg down a nfle or shotgun is to increase its concealability, though in the case of shotguns the short barrel length incr~,~ses the weapon's shot pattern and,deadliness at close ranges. The ease with. which a conventional hunting . shotgun or rifle can:be cut down into a \"gangster\" weapon precludes effective Icontrol of sawed-off:weapons as such. However, the illegality of sawed-off weapons often provides law enfprcement agencies with tion),submachineguns (chambered for pistol ammunition, usually .45 caliber or 9 rom), and certain rifles, carbines, and pistols capa~le of automatic fire (usually by means of a fire-selector switch). '. .\" The most common source of illegal machineguns has been th()~!deactivated\" machineguns brought into the country under,aDeactivated War Trophy ._ (DEWAT) program instituted by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Treasury Department after World War U. Underthi~:pnigram,owners of prohibited weapons could, Without penalty or confiscation,'have thes~ fire\u00ad anus each each sho.t Iequires a separate pull of tpe trigger., All automatic fuearm is a machinegun whIch lues a stream of bullets with a ~gle pull of the trigger. These two types of ~ellWJs .;g~ ..s,ometimes c~mfuse4, Violtince in American Lile who were slipping such weapons into the country, either complete or piece by piece. However, severallarge surplus armament firms soon seized upon the program aS1!means of selling excess stocks of obsolete or captured weapons to(~omesticcollectors. Before the DEWAT program was discon\u00ad tinued in 1958, large nu~bers of military machineguns and submachineguns were imported, \"deactivated\" by steel welding, and Sold at prices as low as $10 each. . \" While the DEWAT program specified deactivation by steel welding in a manner that would make restoration extremely difficult, many collectors and amateur gunsmiths have prov~d themselves equal to the challenge. In some cases, the companies seUingsuch machineguns were doing less than a thorough job of welding. But even the most carefully deactivated gun can be restored to working order with enough machine shop equipment and de\u00ad termination. Replacement barrels and other parts for most sl.lbmachineguns have long been available through the mail-order houses. The registration of unserviceable machinp.guns by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division has presumably discouraged wholesale reactivation of machineguns, but there is no question that many such reactivated guns are in circulation today. Another source of illegal machine guns was the sale of obsolete military weapons to junk dealers in the early 1960's. The guns were \"demilitariud\" by means of torch cuts across the receivers and along the chambers, burned to remove the wood, and then sold as scrap metal. A few thousand of these \"demils\" found their way back into circulation, and some have turned up, re\u00ad activated, in the arsenals of paramilitary groups. The military services no longer sell demilitarized ordnance on the commercial scrap market. Most of the automatic weapons still comiilg into circulation are those being brought into the country by service personnel on foreign duty. Al\u00ad though the extent of this smuggling is difficult to evaluate, a recent lJPot check of parcels from Vjetnam disclosed that a significant percentage contained arms of one kind or another. A final source of automatic weapons is. the amateur gunsmith. Gunlore has it that semi-automatic weapons can be converted to full automatic by sim\u00ad ply \"fIling down the sear~\" While some semi-automatics can thus be altered to fire automatically, amateur attempts to do this usually result in a largely use\u00ad less weapon that fires, if at all, erratically and uncontrollably andrlt a rate that empties the magazine in One quick burst (unless the weapon' stops by jamming). Nevertheless, many amateur gunsmiths have thus '~huilt machine\u00ad gilns\" in violation of federal law , usually motivated merely by'a deSire to see if they could do it. At the same time, however, a skilled ms,thinist with proper equipment and a technical knowledge of firearms can not only convert many autoloading rifles and Distols into autOIllatic weapons but can construct work\u00ad able submachineguns fiom metal stock found in any machine shop)O Al\u00ad though very difficult to control, the numberoHUegally manufactured machine- type weaponsjs probably negligible. . . 10 According to the Alcohol and Tobacco TaX Dil1sion, the Minutemen organization bas supplied members with plans and instructions for the home manufacture of a simple submachinegun lesemblingthe Britis~ Sten. Although the gun appears to be sound in 4esign and inexpensive in materials, its actual manUfacture is probably beyond tbe capacity of the amateur machinist. Types of Firoanns in the United States 169 The great majority of illegally owned machineguns tHe probably in the ha~ds of othe~ise law:abiding gun fanciers who have succumbed to the temp--. tabon to reactIvate then own registered submachinegun or have acqutred one for secret target practic~ ~ith an exotic weapon. The appeal of machine guns t? collectors and paramilitary groups has taken them out of general circula- tion over the last 2 or 3 years and has priced them out of reach of the casual gun buff. Similarl~~}heir hi~.value .. on the collectors market-often upward of $200-and the [;'wt of then illegality seem to have discouraged their use by other than the most romantic of criminals. C' j-- (/ II , \" t;. APPENDIX C STATISTICAL COMPILATION OF DOMESTIC FIREARMS PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS To obtain information on domestic production of firearms for the civilian market, the Task Force in August 1968 served subpenas on 68 firms thought to be fu:eai\"lUS manufacturers.! The subpenas requested information on the number and value of nonmilitary firearms manufactured for sale in the United States each year since 1920. Subsequently, the same informatio,n was also re\u00ad quested for the years 1899 to 1919. When precise production infOrmation was not available, manufacturers proyiljed estimates bl!sed on a variety of rec\u00ad ords, including factory output, stiippjng, warranty, and similar records. Although such estimates may not provide accurate totals of domestic produc\u00ad tion fo\\ any particular year, they are the best available information. . , The rask Force-'recognizes that many companies which manufactured firer arms earlier this century have now gone out of busiI)ess, and any infor,matio,n' on their production is virtually unobtainable. For example, only eight maI)u~ facturers supplied estimates of their prQ(iuction before 1920, even though ,census data indicate there were about 30 firearms manufacturing concerns at that time. In order to compensate, at least :in part, for this omission, informa. tion on firearms production was also obtained\"from the Census Qf Manufac~ turers conducted by the Bureal,!. of the Census ,every other year from 1919 to 1939. Interpolations Were made to arrive at e~tjmated total domestic unit production for eacJ\\.of the ihtervenmg years from 1920 to 1938, No similar ,census was tpade p'#.~rto 19f9, sothe production totals for the years 1899 to '1918 are probably understated., '. \" , ' The other major\"mgredient in our aggregation of firearms in this 'countJY is , import~!

B. \"Manufacturer's Market Research, '1964\" This was an interview poll conducted by an established survey research organization in 1964. By agreement with the organizations which supplied these data, the commissioning and polling organizations cannot be named. The national sample was divided into \"shooters\" and \"nonshooters\" to evalu\u00b7 ate differences in attitudes between the two groups. C. \"Manufacturer's Market Research, 1966;' A three-stage mail poll involving 35 one-thousand-family panels, supposed to be representative of the nation in llocial variables. Phase 1 of this poll gave ownership percentages, but there were based on only slightly over 31,000 returns out of the 35 ,000 qUe~tionnaires mailed out. Phase 2 was sent to those in Phase 1 who admitted owning a firearm. Phase 3 was a selection of gun-owmng families used in Phase 2 who reported ownership of a particular kind of firearm. In Phase 3, III detailed questionnaire was sent to a sub sample of owners of particular types of firearms. Sevcnty-fivG to 84 percent of previously identified long gun owners replied to the detailed questionnaire, while 52 percent of previously identified handgun owners replied. D. 1966 NORC Poll The data in Chapter lOon ownership of a weapon in the home for self\u00ad defense come from a poll conducted by the National Opinion Research Center for the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. The survey was conducted in June 1966. The question on self\u00ad defense fuearms was a~ked of a random sample of nonvictims of crime .and all victims of crime identified in a 1O,OOO-ho!Jsehold survey-the total number of individuals asked the fireanns question was 3,787, a disproportionate nUm\u00ad ber of which were crime victims. aecause crime victimization was not signifi\u00ad cantly associated with fuea~'ms ownership, the relatively greater ~ount, of repre-seritation of crime \\iictilils would not appear to distort ownership per\u00ad centages within racial, social, and economic classes. But, because some groupS arel1).ore crime prone . than others, this relative wcightingmight have had a slight effect on the total ownership fj!?Ure.For whites, ownership is posi. . tively correlated with income. For Negroes, ownership is negatively correlated with income. Since tlle sample of victims is made up of a disproportionate Statiltical Materials 177 ~umber ~f bl~cks .and poor people of :1.11 races,l two possible biases, running In opposite dlfectlOns, can be noted.

Task Force attempted to collect detailed information on fire\u00ad anns and crime in 26 cities across the United States. Involv~d in this effort were 14 ofthe 16 largest cities in the country, excluding only Milwaukee WisconSin, and Chicago, Ill. Mihyaukee was excluded on the adVice of th~ Internatlonal Association of Chiefs of Police, Who cooperated with the Task Fo~ce in securing the collaboration of the local police departments, and Chicago was e~cluded from ,the ,field study, which began in late August 1968, because that City was expenencmg unusual demands on its administrative resources during that period. Ten smaller citie~ five of them located in states with generally pennissive firearms licensing an(l five in states which did not have fireanns control also were studied. The control and noncontrol cities ~ere matched with respect to region and approximate ethnic concentrations, m ~ ~ttempt t.o gage the effectiveness of .firearms control strategies with more precJsJo~ ~ha~ IS allowed by ~ational coz:rel~tion studies. Unfortunately, in ~eral Clites, It was not pOSSIble to obtam all the information requested. For this reason, the number of planned small-city comparisons was quickly re\u00ad du~e.d to three Situ~tions in which both cities in a matched pair were able to proVlde data suffiCIent for analysis, a number insufficient to generate meaning\u00ad ful conclusions. With respect to the larger cities, a vadety of statisti~al analyses were made. One of these, 'mentioned in Chapter 7, involved comparison of knife and fire\u00ad anns attacks and fatalities and the relative deadlines .of knives versus fireanns .if! 24 cities for which sufficient data were available. Correlations for the ~'ears 1965, 1966, and 1967, and for the 3 years taken together, are presented In table D.3. fable D.~.-C(me~tiQns between knife attacks (as p proportion of all attacks) and the proportton of knife as compared to firearms attacks which are fatal, byett/sf of City, 1965\u00b767. -1965 1966 1967 Sum of ASSist Corp., Annandale, VA.; statistics provided by the FBI. .An earlier analysis had shown that absolute fatality rate from knife attacks did not increase as the proportion of knife to gun attacks increased, but that ra~ comparison did ~ot control for inter~ity reporting differences. On the basts of tl;,~ data, which do control for reporting differences, it appears that as the number of knife attacks increases in relation to the number of firearms attacks (Which p'resumably happens where guns are less available to assailants), the prop()rUon of knife attacks that are flltal does not increase relative to that -l::S\"'Criminal Victimization in the United States,\" U.$., Governm.ent Printing Office, and Violence in American Life proportion among gun attacks. The small negative correlations in TabJe J).3 suggest; if anything, the OpposIte is the cas~. FBI and field survey data were utilized further in an attempt to gage the effect of self-defense firearms on crime rates.2 This was done in two stages. First, FBI statistics on the rates offelons killing civilians, and rates of civilians killing felons in 56 cities and robbeo-rates per 100,000 population irl the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of these 56 cities were intercorrelated. Robbeo- rates are utilized here ajl ,a measure of criminality in these cities. The correlations are presented in Tabl~ 'D-4. Table D-4-Correlations among rates of felons killing civilians. civilians killing felolls. and robberies, 56 cities, 1967. Rates of felons killing civilians (rate per 100,000) Rates of civilians killing. felons (rate per 100,000) Robbery l'titt:s, SMSA ... > > .48 .12 Rates from FBI. Not surprisingly, robbeo-rateg are moderately related to rates of civilians killed by felons. Rates of civilians killing felons are only slightly related to robbery rates, hoWever (r= .12). The two types of killing also are moderately related to one another, and this correlation is unaffected when robbery rates are held constant (the partial correlation is .35.) Thus, as the number of feJ\u00b7' ons killed by civilians increases, the number of civilians killed by felons also increases, independent of changes in robbeo-rate. ' . \"In an effort to study this question in more detail, FBI data from the 26 citi~s originally involved in the field survey were further studied. For this purpose four variables were added to those included in the previous correl~-. tion matrix: (1) frreann accident fatality r~tes of the states in which the cIties ' are located; (2) home robbeo-rates; (3) burglary rates fQr the SMS~'s of ~ese cities; and ( 4) the population Of the SMSA's. ,The correlatio~ matrIX obtamed in this analysis is presented in Table D-5.

By way of contrast, CiVIlIans ~hng felo~s ,bears a small negative relationship (-.36) to home robbery rates 10 these cIttes, general robbery rates incrl!llse but the rate of home robberies tends slightly to decrease (accounting for' about 13 percent of the variation in such rates). On the other hand felons killing civilians are unrelated in any systematic w'!ly to home robbery (r= .02) but they are related somewhat more closely to rates of all robberies (r= -.33). 3. Study of Gun Use in Crime 179 . Data on the use of firearms in two closely related crimes-homicide and aggra~ated assault-are forwarded to the FBI each year from reporting police agencIes. The Task Force surveyed 15 major cities on gun uSeinthese crimes and robbery. The robbery data were requested so that gun use in this differ\u00ad ent area of criminal behavior could be compared with gun use in homicide and assa~lt. The data on assaults, hOmicide, and robbery by type of gun used ~ere deslt~d to determine the relative importance of handguns and long guns m these crunes. Usable data on robbery were obtained from 11 of the 14 cities but the figures in three cities showed firearms robbery as a percentage of ~rmed:tather than total robbery, as the following comparison between FBI figures and the TaskForce questionnaire figures for 1967 illustrates.

Because handguns are so closely associated with violent crime, the 'signifi\u00ad cant state laws to b.: evaluated would seem to be those governing the pos..~s\u00ad sion of handguns. Of S\\lch laws, two very different forms exist: restrictive laws that attemptto reduce the number of handguns in circulation and per\u00ad miSSive laws that lIcttempt to keep such weapons from a small number of high 'lisk individuals .but allow most persons to purchase lrrearms. Only two Ami~ricanjurisdictions, New York and Massachusetts; have . attempted re~tiictive pistol licensing Dna statewide basis. Because the num- . her of restrictive licensing jurisdictions is so small,and because both of them are located in the Northeast, comparing the crime statistics of these states).? oilier states tluough use of multi-val'iate co~elation techniques is inappropri\u00ad ate. However, a number of states have passed permissive handgup.llcensing legislation, allowing most indi'liduals to obtain handguns after screep.ing by police or other IQcal authorities to establish that the applying individuals do not have criminal records or suffer from other manifest disqualification~. A nlllllber of inquiries have beenmade concerning the effectiveness of these state gun laws before the interstate fireanns ban in the 1968 Gun Con\u00ad trolAct, but the published materials are sparse. The Wi$consin.Legis1~ti\\Te Reference Bureau noted, in 1960, that states with \"gun license l~lws\"exhibited rates of violent crime both higher and lower than the national a;~erage.5 ilKrug,6 in 1968, showed that iffllJ states with gun license laws ~re lumped , Iftogetl1er and no other factors are considered, the gun law statesbavecrimes no lower thapnonlicense states.

No. 130, July 196(l ,'i. , y.Ji 11 182 purposes, these rough correlations are not of great value; Moreover, since urban, violence prone states are more likely to institute gull iawsthan other .states, a lack of relationship may conceal real differences in violence attdbutllble to differences in gun laws~the problem her(:~.is often called self\u00ad selCiction.Also, these two studies do not make comparisons controlling for regional differences that have a profound effect on rates of violent crime. Unpublished studies of gun law effects are more interesting. The Olin Mathieson Co. conducted a set of multi-variate correlation st\\ldies that llhowed gun license states do not experience Significantly less total hon'licide than non\u00ad license states. The correlation matrix obtained is shown in Tabl~ D-lO.

How,ever> , . the comparisons were between states-and thus left a rather large margm ?f:. comparative error-and the controls us~d iii this study were not fOm~l~te;. For ex.ample, the study controlled for the percentage of a states popUlatIon that was \"urban\" but did not distinguish between degrees of urban concen- tration, so that Waterloo, Iowa, and New York City are ceo.nted equally when. factoring in the effect of the percentage of a state's population that is urban. Yet large metropolitan areas have far higher rates of ~iolent ,prime than smaller urban areas, so the possibility of self-selection concealing ~Kllaw differences remaills. Also, while this study contIoUed for the proportion of Negroes in a state's popUlation, it did not consider the impact of other lIlinorlty group popUlations, such as Puerto Rican or Mexican descent groups. Chism (unpublished honors thesis, University of Chicago, '1968). compared metropolitan areas with and without gun licensiiig lawsandconclude.d that .. ' .' gun laws have a significant effcGUn reducingvioJence. The Chism exercise is superior to state-by-state comparisons because it narrows the units compared to metropolitan areas,but this study failed to stratify the areas studied by region. . ,\" ':.' ..,' '. None of the studies cited above sought to control for factors other than gun laws that might influence rates ofviolent crime by considering only the percentage ofViolent crimes that involved firearms ..

In the third case, the man stated he ;'~s carrying the gun for self-protection against someone who. was ou.t to ~et ~um, that it fell to the floor in a store and that he was forced mto a Sltua110n m 'which someone was .killed. All threehad purchased their guns \"on the street.\" B. Aggravated Assault Of the men interviewed, 15 were in. prison for assault. or had c?mmitted assaults in the pase Of these 15,6 <;ommitted as~ault WIthOut usmg a gun. Out of these six, four had consciously avoided uslOg guns, althou~ they.were constantly embroiled in street fighting and violence. All were qUlte specific as to why they avoided the use of guns. They were young men who never backed off and always \"went the Umit\" even in the face ~f !ather aver~~e1m\" ing odds. They were fearful that'the gun would lead to kilhng. In addition, they felt bigger for not needing a gun. Table B-1 Shows that ofthe 15 men interviewed, 9 used a gun. Only two of the nine obtained the gun within several days prior to the assault. I~ the . other seven cases, the men had guns available for relatively long penods piior to the assault. Most of the histories are similar-that is, once the men and guns got together; difficult situations became potentially lethal.

In the two exceptions the intenteither to protect or to hmt precede;d the obtaining of the gul(;, The third case where intent preceded acquisitfion, the cause and effect relationships are less well defined. This third caSfl involved an intense, cold and bitter young man who had ' had a variety of weapons readily availl?,ble for a number of years. ijis favorite weapon was a sbotgun which was always ready fot use~ In addition, he usu~ ally had several' handguns. The guns were not only readily available, but used with a fair degtcee of frequency. '. . The handgTJn was clearly the weapon of choice for th'&\u00b7assaulters. One: ex\u00ad ception was a young man who preferred the shotgun because of its greater firepower. His shotgun was usually sawed off and could be hidden in the ~runk of a cal' or on a motorcycle. However, in additiq~ to the shotgun, he always had available a number of handguns to be prepared for any eventual\u00ad ity. This same young man noted that members of his motorcycle gang gener\u00ad ally used shotguns and that some were seriously looking for machineguns. ' C. Robbery With robbers, the patterns of gun acquisition and use are less clear, with more room for indiVidual style and circumstance. Table B-2 Shows that of the 14 robbers, all but one used a gun. There was a marked contrast between the Itlen who used guns for assault and the .men who used guns for robbery. Those involved with assault had long periods of time between acquisition ,and use. In contrast, 7 G>f the 13 men who used guns for robbery obtained them within .1 to 2 weeks prior to the robbery. This gr,<l~p incl~ded two .men wh~ acquired guns the day of the robbery. Six ofth~~p:men'acquired their gurls~lQp.ths or years prior to the commission of the crime. .' \" . Again there is a contrast between robbers and assaulters in how guns were acquired. In the assault group, the overwhelming majority had bought weap\u00ad ons they thought were stolen. In the robbery group, however, only 5 out of .:. the 13 bought weapons in street sales. Four otilers obtained guns.in the course of prior burglaries, which generally preceded robbery as the crime of choice for these men. The licquisition of a gun during the course of a burglary, played a varying role with respectto when a young man changed from bur-\", /' g1~ry to armed robbery. In the four re.maining,pases, the weapons were ob-. tained under unusual circumstances. One young mariused toy guns which looked real and Were purchased if} tOY$tares. A, second obtained a gun in the strongarmed robbery of a hardware st6(c run by a verr o.ld man. Another young man borrowed guns from~friends without their knowledge-despite the , Jact that he had many of his own. ' In another caSe, a man used a gun his Wife. had ownedprior to their marriage.' , . ' bought \"on the street,\" half were new , probably stolen from stores. One man, uS('ld a toy weapon. It seemed to matter little 'v~,ther a gun wasnew or used., Only one ofthe men purcJ:lased a )!lew wellPon fr,l;>m a <~;s,~ore, and he got a defective weapon which misfli'ed during the course of a .1\"~bbery, The other men found street purchases far.easier, ~ 0 Q) 0 0 ~z ~.;:Q z :z; .,--, ~'~;:. :0 Z 1 \" I,' ! ~ J I , 1 f ! ~ ~ Ii \" ~ ~ I l \\ i ~ ~ .:\",Therobbery group also differs in another way from the men usirigweap\u00ad ons fot assault. Tlte majority of the assault group acquired their weapons with,no specific act in mind, whereas 9 of the 13 robbers acquired the weap- 'oris after they decided upon their crime. ' Handguns or facsimiles of hailaguns were used by most of the robbers. In addition. to the man who used a toy gun, several used unloaded gun's or target pellet guns. These men we~.e concerned that a loaded gun pUght lead to their seriously injudng or killing someone.

Interestingly, these men were also involved in aSsaulfand gang fig)1t!llg.They shared the characteristics of neVer wanting to be put down, always;msisting upon being the masters of a situation.: II. 1'.I~~.Role of the Gun ~::;:'{. The' gun seems to have played many roles, consci~us and unconscious; in 'the violent behavior of these men. Some of these roles could be ascertiiined from these initial conv~f'sations. However, thisis a~'p.reliminary study involving single inte'rrlews. Were we to lengther~the interv'i~/W'piocess !lIld add Psychological testing, we could undoubtedly greatly expand our understanding of the complex significance of this simple device called a gun, not only for the violent offender but for other gun users as well. ';~?;'1'~. A. Assault and Homicide Of thel 5 men charged with assault, 4 spoke of not needing a gun, of being able to r~ly primarily on their fi~ts and toughness. One of these men prided himself on tl~e use of his knife,which was clearly his choice of weapon. The man considered the knifea,n extension ofhls haml It was al\u00ad most as if it were apar~of hirrl. To hirrl, a gun was a foreign body-he could not make i~ .a,jiaft of him nor see it as an e~t~fl~~oil of ~i~self. To use a gun he would have to depend upon something that waS'not his own, Something he could not (or would n()t) do. He insisted that all encoilnters and all victories be his and his alone. He could not share 1.)~at momentofgJ~ry with anyone or anything. In his View, the,kItife\" was a Jlart of him::'.;~rhus he protested against the increaSing use of guns by many of the men involved in violence \"on the streets.\" ..

There is ~~~.' . :1 ,,' ., ' , . { :,,1 I, '\" ~i '\\\" ' , 188 Firearms and Violence in American Life he states this, but there is more a sense of sadness, for the gun and the organization cannot possiMy give him the sense of self-esteem and satis\u00ad faction that his fists have provided him in the past. Though he will con\u00ad tinue to fight now with a gun arid an organization and may win, it will not be his victory> his~steem, and himself. Thus it is with teluctance that he accepts this neW dependenc)' on a gun. This young man makes several points Which are echoed in the conversa\u00ad tions with the others charf,ed with assault. The process of escalation from fists, tire chains, and knivos to guns is more than a numerical progression of hurting power. The gun appears to introduce a number of new elements. As with atomic weapons and small nations, the gun on the street allows the weakest to join the superman club. Whereas there was once a sense of stabil\u00ad ity, with each man krtowing his place in the pecking order, the gun introduces uncertainty. This element of instability in part is corrected by enlarging the gangs\" which appears to be the present trend. Five men described this process of escalation. All had used a variety of weapons in the past; but now used guns. Each quite independently picked 19'57 as the turning point in the shift to guns, although several of them had used gun!! previously. Most of them cited deteriorating race relations and outbreaks of racial violence as a major reason for the shift to guns. John is a handsome young man who is neatly groomed and speaks with some authority. He is at ease and readily discusses hisJeelings and past history with pride at the insight he has been able to attain by care\u00ad fully thinking over his life and the events that led to his crimes and im\u00ad prisonment. The incident for which he is in prison involved his driving into a rivai gang's territory and firing over the heads of a number of men who were closing in on him .and two of his friends~ He spoke of having the weapon.in his caf, readily available for j\\lst such an occasion. He said that when gangs fought in Los Angeles, weapons were always used. He had been shot twice and charged with assault on a number of occasions. The old gang fights using fists, chains, and knives, he noted, were a thing of the past. Now the gun was the favored weapon, and its adoption had led to serious escalation in street fighting. Gi\\\\,ns do not appear to have suggested the crime of assault, but they clearly escalated the violence inyolved. The men who had guns available eventually used them when. the gun, the situation, and the man were all at the right spot at the right momejlt. Others were able to recognize that this might happell. and avoided carrying guns. However, most 01 the men felt that the situation had progressed to the point where guns were becoming essential, because everyone \\else had them. ~ A num\\)er of factors are inyolved in this process of escalation. Guns are reaclily avaiJable. They can be bought cheaply Md without delay. They allow a man to attack his victim from a safe distance. In. addition, there is an ad\u00ad vantage in striking the first bloW, and several of the encounters involved as\u00ad sault in ordei'ip prevent being assaulted-so-called preventive warfare. The move to guns results in an escalation of the conflicts as well as an escalation of the violend.\\. Wbereas fist fighting may have ended a dispute in the past, it F~arlnS and Violent Crime: Conve~tions wiUt Protagonists 189 is now likely to be settled with a shootout which is usually far out of propor\u00ad tion to the anger involved in the original dispute. With a gun, a moment's anger or loss of control can quickly result in a killing. The young man who entered the interview room seemed ill at ease d~rin~ the first part of the interview. He spoke of having a serious drm~8 problem whi~h had been going on for 4 years. In order to sup\u00ad port himself he comnutted a number of robberies, but had neYer harmed anyone. He had not been involved in any Significant violence in the past. Prior to his coming to prison, he began carrying his gun on his persoIl, even though he was not im'olved in robbery at that time. He statef~ chat he carried a gun because he was frightened of the police, knew he was wanted, and needed it for protection. He was involved in a 7 day ~rinki~g ~arty with a group of friends, playing poker and gener\u00ad ally havmg a.blg t~e. T~ere was an acquaintance at the party who ch~enged him wlth a kmfe. After successfully avoiding a fight with this man, he pulled the gun and shot him. He could not explain why, except that he had the gun and was still fearful of the man and his knife. . Th:re is an additi~nal dan~er in the increa!;tng use of guns. Bystanders are sometunes hurt or killed, which rarely occurs when a fight involves only fists and knives. Jim descri~ed a situation in whichhe awoke early o~e morning hear\u00ad mg a commoilon across the street. He learn~(J,t,!1at his sister had been -c;> mot 'lind his impression W3\u00a3 that she was dyfug. At the time Jim was li~ing with his wife. His family had purposefully tried not t6 involve him because tbeyknew he was easily angered. He became incensed upon hearing of the shooting and possible death of his sister and could ;:;-think of nothing but revenging her. He suddenly found himself driving a car with four other men, all of Whom had guns. They drank and talked of getting the guy, becaus~ thiS same man had been in a lot of other trouble. When they arrived at the place where they found him, the~ were confronted with three men in the house-aU armed with guns, Dunng the fight that followed, a girl was killed. Jim .had owned the gun about a year a~d half without using it. He kept it just in case he might someday need It. The need came, he js now in prison, and a girUs dead. The gun had never been used in a crime, nor had he carried it on the street until the evening of the murder. . Unlike jitn~ several other men had carri(!d their guns regularly. rOt at least one of th~s~ men, the actual need for a gun seemed less important than the p~ychological need merely to be armed .. Thema!l e~tering the interview room was short, neatly dressed, and :onfident lD.his pos~ure and ap~aranc~. He smiled readily, though for the first 10 or 15 mmutes of the mteMeW he was .hesitant and wary. Gradually, he felt more at ~ase and des~ribed h~w h~ carried a gun only w~en he went on the street.dressed and out for a good time,iJsually With women. This was in marked contrasUo when he.

Robbery Robbery appears to be a crime made infinitelY'more ~ossible ~y havir.g a gun. To rob without one requires a degree of strength, Size, a~~,;nnfidence which was lacking in many of the men with whom I spoke,,: ,!~~\"e were, how\u00b7 ever, four men who said they did not use a gun while robbing: -Only two of these. had the necessary requisites to carry off a strongarm robbery an~ ther were experts at it. This kind of robbery is performed only when the SituatIOn 1 is right-a gas station at night or a single person on the street. For the most part~ the men involved in robbery were nct very large and not very. strong. Some were not very aggressive. Some of these men could not posslbly c~rry out a robbery without a gun. In short, there was a clear realit~ element In the need for a gun once a man made the decision to rob. The clanty ends there, however, for although the men needed a gun to rob, the converse was also true: they needed to rob in order to use a gun. Some wanted the sense of power and control which robbing with a gun gave them. In each ?f these cases, it was the gun whiCh provided the power and the opportumty for malltery. One of the young men with whom 1 spoke stated he was always t~e \"gunman\" in a robbery because he has always been independent. Bemg' in the driver's scat was of prime importance to him. He was not sure he , coold trust hi~ crime partners, so he elected himself gunm~n. He,~otes that this is an easy thing to. do because most of the other dudes are afraid of guns and,would rather drive t)1e car or pic!' up, ~e money. ~e showed a, real faSCination for his gun llod spoke of 11 as If 1t had an a~ _ most magical quality-a key that could unlock any dOQI. As he put It, .''': ' \"it made me king:' Wjth a gun I:te could have anything he wanted-cars, \" radios, clothes-whenever he wanted. _ Another mari'told me that he was never as powerful as when he had a gl1.n and went into a store to mh. ',~\"\" ' firearms and Violent Crime: Conversations witt: Protagonists 191 This young man went on to say that with a gun in his hand he felt as if he were \"President or Governor.\" The feeling Was one of absolute power and control. To him it was the epitome of all success; there was nothing to equal it. He spoke of the gun as the instrumtmt that allowed him to have the sheer pleasure and enjoyment of having absolute power. We began to reflect about other weapons that might do this, and he pointed out that this was not possible,-only the gun could give him total mastery. As ffto complete the parlillel with legitimate power, he pointed out that presidents and governots at~ also dishonest-that they, too, steal and rob. and in this respect he Was similar. One of the young men who had this need to be all powerful appeared to have clost:u the gap between himself an4 his gun. He identified with his gun and took on all of its power. Although other men were willing to acknowl~ edge that the power they desperately wanted emanated from the gun, he now saw this power as emanating solely from himself. I was struck by the childlike appearance of the young man who en\u00ad tered the room with a cocky grin that appeared to reassure him con\u00ad lItantly how tough and fearless he was, Although nearly 20, he looked closer to 13. He outlined a life of crime beginning in his early teens, graduating from burglary, car theft, and a variety of minor offenses to armed robbery. At the time of his most recent crimes he was studying college criminology and psychology. He vjewed his career in crime much as One views a career in \"medicine or any of the other profes\u00ad sions.n He felt he committed, his crimes with int~lligenceand finesse, and he received a sense of satisfaction from doing it well and fooUng the police, especially those who sat in class With him. Although guns were inlJlortant in allowing him to .achieve success with armed robbery, he ga1)~ no credit to the gun. He began to speak of accomplishing the same thing with a slingshot or knife. despite his having the size and strength of a boy just reachin~ puberty. He spoke of himself as if he were a gun. He saw himself as an all-powerful, compelling, frightening gii!,nt of a man. Thro]Jghout, he remained a babyfaced boy who p&thetlqUly wanted to be something he could not be withou t a gun-a ni'an,\u00b7 rt gradually became clear from these interviews that the most important element in robbery often was not the acquisition of money but the one brief moment in which these men luild a gun and forced someone to do anything they commanded. They e~p~rienced it as jf they were omnipotent, and I often wondered during the COllrse of the interviews if their vjctims might not Teprcsent~ significant petson frolP, their past. It WC1S difficult to assess how many.baolbecome dependent upon or addicted to g,uns. A number of the men had grown up like man)' nonviolent, noncriminal men in our culture; i.e., they grew up with guns, were taught how to shoot by their fathers, and had a particular fondness fo~and fascination with guns. Some kept guns around for no particular reason. Robbery appeared to be almost an excuse to use the gun, giving thenl both excitement and esteem. , With three of the men jnterviewed, the gun seemed to play the role of sedUcer. Its presenf;e.~uggested and evel1tually commanded its use, usually to relieve a difficult andTrustrating situation~i' In these cases, the gun was present .\" r'~~F t~ . Violence in\" American Life prior to the' intent to commit the crime. In two of the cases, the gun was ac\u00ad quired in the CQUlse of burglary and its possession suggested escalation to armed robbery. I,'). a third case, it appeared to play an even more important role as seducer. \";::.;:, The man who entered the office appeared oHler than most of the others who were interviewed. He had achieved some success in life, was educated, and had an air of confidence. It was at first difficult to un\u00b7 derstand why he was here. What came out was a story of a compulsive need to gamble in an attempt \"to rilake it big.;' Throughout his life he had preferred taking chances'to playing it safe. He gave up sev;';rai suc\u00ad cesses, each time gambling on greater rewards. By continually pushing the odds, he went downhill financially, untiLhe found himself in need of a large SUll}, of money. This sum would enable him to gamble once again in a business venture and perhaps \"make it big.\" \" He had neverbeeIi a violent man, nor had he ever engaged in crbninal activity. At the time ofhi~ marriage several years previously, his Wife had had a gun, and after thei~marriage it had always b~~'en kept in a clothes drawer for their P!O!,,~;:jtion. He had done some'target- practice with it several years earlier, but had not thought about it or touched it since. Now it was becoming more prominent eacn time he opened the drawer and thought of his need for money. It appeared to act as a\\1 ever-present suggestion Vo;ith each new opening of the drawer. H~ would think about it lind reject the thought, only to open the. drawer and have the thought come back agairl. Eventually, he put the gun to use with great fear and trepidation in order to acquire the money he needed. This marked departure from his previous life pattern was clearly unac\u00ad ceptable to him, at least on an unconscious level, and he carefully man\u00b7, aged to. get lUmself caught and imprisoned. Anger play.ed an'important role in the armed robberies committed by sev\u00b7 eral of these young men. In one episode of anger which led to a series of robberies, the gun played an unusual role. One young man related a story of a long history o(p~rental depriva\u00b7 tion. His mother and father had been divorced for anumb'er of years and he had alternatively lived alon,e and with his father whom he de\u00b7 scribed as a \"playboy.\" His father .ha4 a numberbf guns/being an avid hunter and gun collector. The. boy had been away from his father for a pi610nged period of time and dec[~ied to return in celebration of his fathe;r's birthday. A fight ensued and his father left the house. Both .. were furious with each other. At this point the son impulsively took one of his father's guns and went out tn start a series of robbedes- . something he had not done for a rather _prolonged period of time. Al\u00b7 though he co.uld not eXJllain all of thi3 dynamics involved, it wa~ clear. to him the robberies resulted frolllthe anger with hisfathf.;r anf! that It was very important t~at the robberies be cpmmitted With ~s J\"ltlter's gun. It was as if he wanted to ,have.his fath~}.\" along a::; ~1~~(;q:\\tlplice, so that he could at once be reunited withrus fatheI:..andaj~~ht i;i:lrte time have him punish~d as an accompljcein the crime; The *1;l.E)'St,ihe could. come to this was to use his father's gun as hisaccompliceJ,/\" ~ 'r . _. \\ ' ,.1 l f J i t 1 t I i Ii .~ ,\" \\ ~ i I l' ~ J' t<-.- l t ., ,Fireanns and Protagonists 193 . The gun's shar.mgthe guilt as an accomplice is a theme found with a,I)um\u00ad ber ofthe.mcrr WIth whom I spoke. Several felt the need to rid themseives-nf the gun after a crime as ifthis rid them of the guilt as well. With one young man, this was a very importllnt theme, A~ we'talke:I, I was struck with the overwhelming availability of guns to Hus man. He had been brought up with guns and now, in his late !eens, always had one or two lying around his apartment, and period\u00ad lCally he went target shoothlg. Although he had plenty of guns of his own, when he needed money and thought of armed robbery, he was careful ntwer to use one of his own weapons. He employed elaborate ~tratagems to borrow or temporarily steal the gun from a friend, use it ill the robbe~. and then carefully replace it. He had no good, lqgical rea~on for this,behavior, b~t as the previous case, the gun appeared ,to be an accomplice to share ill both the crime and the guilt. Unlike as~ults, the crime of robbery rarely seemed to be inspired by the .mere POSSeSSIOn of a gun. There were two notable exceptions, One was the you~g m;l!l described above who became angry with his father and took one ?fhls father's guns to use\"in robberies. However, this young man had robbed tn. the past .. The other case involved a young man who, whenever confronted :W1th a,fostile re.spon~~ from. a merchant, would pull his gun and \"teach him a Jesso? by robbIng him. This same young mall; as in the first example, had ;also robbed on a number of other occasions which were usually planned in i!advance and Were not the result of possessing a gun at a particular moment. m. Ho,v Would a ScarcitY of Weapons Affect the Violent SubjccH,i? l : Of.~he men who used guns for assault or robbery, only two felt there was t~Y .dhficulty in obtaining a gun. The rest not only had no difficulty in ob\u00ad ~ talmng guns but many had guns readily available long before their use or in\u00ad Ivolvement in t~e crime. Several men mentioned that the delay involved in 1 legally p~rchasmg a gun discouraged them from trying to do so; instead they bought tnem on the street. In fact, of the men interviewed, only one had I p~rchased a gun through legitimate channels, and this in anomer state with .~ ;~ff;(lre~t l~ws. Several of the men who committed robbery withou t guns had I fOlind It difficult to acquire one. ' . ~ !,-One ~ay ask: If guns were not readily available, would the group of men ! .. ' ,~volved .m aggravated assault make an effort to acquire guns? With only one .~ l~rtw~ notable exceptions, the answer seems to be \"no\" so long as guns were ~ _ }~available .to eit~er side. E~en the two exceptions could get along fairly well f \"dYlthfists, bee chams, and kmves. Some ofthe most violent men would ' t i. \u00b7;1Iearly welcome a return to \"the good old days.\" Ii ij , . ~ \\i If one asks the same question concerning those men committing robbery f:\\e answer is ~ess clear. SOIne of the men would make little effort to getgu~s. ? _ .. ~ .. the .s~e tune, there are several men in this category to whom robbery ful-' ~\" ~ ~aslg~fi~ant psych?Iogi~alneed; how they would with\u00adi\\ U[ guns IS difficultto unagme. Thert} were several young men who might t,t~nd much titl1e and: effort in attempting. to find weapons; however, this ;, mber appe.!lrs small. Most of the men described a variety of ways they-had J .2~ . .l ,~ o \" 194 Firearms and Violence in American Lile lived and. satisfied .needs prior to committing robberies. There were episodes 1n their lives in which cats were dominant; i.e., they had felt powerful behind a wheel as they now did behind a gun. For a number <:>.f young men, engaging in robbery was a way of proving they were not \"chicken,\" and these men had a host of other ways pf proving this without resorting to guns and robbery. In short, as with ally individual, alternate patterns are sought when the road they are traveling is blocked. Even in a prison setting, they were able to play out their roles and estabHsh their hierarchy. In speculating with these men on what life in the streets would be like wHhout guns, not one ',:>f them could possibly conceive how this could be ac\u00ad complished and thus found it difficult to speculate on what it would be like. A number of the more violent men assured me tpjswould provide a greater degree of stability in individual and gang relationships. IV. Summary The gun: to these men is many things. It can in a single individual playa variety of roles and have a variety of meanings. To some it was a source:o( omnipotent power, while to others it was an equalizer whicnerased feelings of inadequacy and helplessness. For some, it was a seducer tempting themlQ an ea~\\ier and quicke~\\path to success and riches. It was at times a friend, a crime partner, or a fill guy to share the blame. The gun puts distance between the victim and the assailant. It exaggerates conflict and eS9alates violence. It is both a source of fear and fascination, and for some it takes on a magical quaHty. Whatever else a gun may be, it is clearly not simply another weapon, an inanimate ,objeqt playLng a passive role. To these young men It is very much alive.

Breakthrough Due to the civil disorders and terror that is being planned for the American people by the Communist Conspiracy ... the following inform ation is presented to you .. .for the purposes of defending your home, your family and your neighbor\u00b7 hood. In so doing we remind you that that sacred document which is our United States Constitution guafantees every American citizen the right to keep and bear arms. The most effective weapon for home defense is a 12-gauge Shotgun-pump or double barrel. If you are going to buy one .. may we suggest a 12-gauge with an 18\" or 20\" barrel also known as a riot gun .. ,.If you are buying one for defense, buy one without a choke. * * '\" The above two headings (Ammunition and Rifles) would take a tremendous amount of reading to be able to understand. Therefore, the General Douglas Mac.' Arthur Shooting Cilib has been founded so that interested citizens may join the Club. Instructions on f'uearms and practice shooting in addition to safety will be taught with the help of the National Rifle Association. The Club will be sanc\u00b7 tioned by tM National Rifle Association. Your obligation to provide security for yourself and your family is very gIeat anG will probably become. greater as time passes.

Q APPENDIXH THE ARMY CIVILIAN MARKSMANSHIP PROGRAM Statutes passed in the early 1900's directed the Secretary of the Army to support private shooting clubs; sell rifles, shotguns, handguns, and ammunition at cost to members of the National Rifle Association (NRA); and hold annual shooting matches open to both military personnel and civilians.1 This sup\u00ad port rose from the $2,500 appropriated for trophies in 19032 to almost $5 million in the middle 1960's.3 The \"Civilian Marksmanship Program,\" as its elements are nominated, has currently been cut to a mininlallevel, 4 as it was during World War II.S lThese statutes now provide in relevent part: Civilian Rifle Ranges (10 U.S.C. \u00a74308). \"The Secretary of the Army shall pro\u00ad vide for (1) the ... maintenance, and operation of indoor and outdoor rifle ranges; (2) the instruction of able-bodied citizens ofihe United States in marksmanship, .. ; (3) ... the maintenance .. of matches .. in the use of those arms, and the issue of arms, ammunition, targets and other sup.\\llies .

Legislative Background At the beginning of the century, the Army was of the view that all infan. trymen need not be trained to shoot accurately but only to deliver an even volume of fire over an entirtl area; trained riflemen were apparently expected to concentrate fire 911.obvfous targets, leaving the rest of an opposing force unharassed. 6 A col{ti:ary view seems to have been held by Congress, which began support of accurate shooting by authorizing the expenditure in 1903 of $2500 for trophies and medals for military rifle matches that year.7 'The support of marksmanship was extended further in 1905 when the Sec\u00ad retary of War was directed to sell to the states, at cost,Army weapons and ammunition for use by rifle clubs.8 In 1911, civilians were authorized to compete for the national match trophies. 9 in '1914, sale of Army weapons at cost was streamlined by allowing direct sale to members of rifle clubs.lO By 1916 the possibility that the United States might need a large Army en\u00ad couraged preparation for mobilization. In keeping with European practice, the National Defense Act of 191611 envisioned an Army composed basically of un {mined troops from civilian life stiffened by a cadre of Regular Army personnel. In addition, support of civilian rifle clubs under the Civilian Marks\u00ad manship Program was authorized.l 2 A Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) was appointed,13 rifle ranges were built, and personnel were assigned to instruct on the ranges.14 . The shortage of rifle instructors and untrained riflemen during the mobili\u00ad zation for World War I reinforced the postwar position of the members of Con\u00ad gress interested in appropriating funds for the national matches, the sales pro\u00ad gram, and support of the title clubs)5 The Army, which by then supported accurate marksmanship for all its personnel and had surplus ammunition, offered no opposition.1 6 In 1924, however, opponents of such expenditures manage.d to strike from the appropriation bill the language supporting the marksmanship program by successfully arguing that such language was in fact substantive legislation unsuited to an appropriation bill.!7 Congrerls thereupon enacted 6See 1st sess., pp. 3-4, 11-20 (1928). 732 Stat. 986-87 (1905). 936 Stat. 1058 (191U, 1038 Stat. 370 (1914). 1139 Stat. 166 (1916); see Hearings before the HOllse Committee on Military 14lbid. Hearings on War Department appropriations before a~iibcommittee of House Committee on Appropriations, 68th Cong., p. 881; 8599. -----------_._----- The Army Civilian Marksmanship Program 243 legislation restating in permanent form the recurring language from the appro\u00ad priation bills and added an unexplained change whereby the sale of Army weapons to members of rifle clubs was authorized only to NRA members.18 A final statutory change appeared in 1928, after the Army announced that the national matches would be held only in alternate years in order to free support units for field training during the summer.19 However, shooting in\u00ad terests persuaded Congress to require the Army to hold the matches annually and to submit annual reports to the Congress.20 II. Growth of the Program These annual reports ~nd the testimony during appropriation hearings pro\u00ad vide some information on the ~cope of the program for the past 40 years. In 1929 the National Board's appropriation was $744,750. 21 The major share, $500,000, was to pay the expenses of 4,455 military and civilian par\u00ad ticipants in the national matches at Camp Perry, Ohio. The pay and subsist\u00ad ence of 1,868 Army personnel who conducted the matches were provided through ordinary Army appropriations. 22 Support for the matches was sus\u00ad pended or greatly reduced from 1931 to 1935.23 Beginning in 1952, the matches grew to a peak in the mid-1960's, when they cost an estimated $3 million annually.24 However, Army support was suspended in 1967~ due to the Vietnam war and a shortage of funds.25 _ In the last 40 years, the sale of military firearms to NRA members ex\u00ad panded even more, although this, too, was suspended during World War II. In 1929, 14,797 rifles and 408 handguns and 4.8 million rounds of ammunition were sold to NRA members. Weapon sales escalated with the end of World War II, when surplus stocks were enlarged. A witness at tlfe fiscal 1960 ap\u00ad propriation hearings reported sales of approximately 95,000 rifles in the pre\u00ad vious. year.26 The peak year appears to have been 1963, however, when ap\u00ad proximately 126,000 rifles and 20,000 handguns were sold to NRA members at cost.27 Since the beginning of the program, approximately 1 million mili\u00ad tary firearms have been sold to NRA members. The exact figure .is unknown 1843 Stat. 510 (1924). 19See hearings, 786 . 21Annual Reports for Fiscal 1929 from t1tC National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and the Director of Civilian Marksmanship to the Secretary of War; Hearings on War Department appropriation bill before the Subcommittee of the House COm\u00ad mittee art Appropriations, 70th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 967-998 (1928), 22Hearings on War Department appropriation bill before a Subcommittee ot the House Committee on Appropriations, appropriation bill before a ~ubcommittce of the House Committee on Appropriations, National Establishment appropo,ition bill before Subcommittee ofthe House 1st sess., 27Mcmorandum the Director of Civilian Marksmanship to tIle Army Genera!

A tabulation of sales for the years for which information is available is shown in Table H-l. Support for tHb clubs, including those in schools, has followed a similar pattern in the last 40 years. In 1929, $275,000 worth of shooting equipment, including 2,426 rifles and lO million rounds of ammunition, were issued to 1,625 clubs and schools. In 1965 approximately $900,000 worth of such equipment \\\\!asjssued to 5,800 clubs,28 including the new issue of 2,225 weapons and millions of rounds of ammunition. 29 281'A Study of the Activities and Missions of the NBPRP,\" report to the Department of the Army by Mthur D.

Present Program 245 The Civilian Marksmanship Program has been drastically curtailed since 1967 as a result of Vietnam budgetary rE!strictions and doubts as to the cost effectiveness of the program)O Support for the national matches has bf)en tenninated; equipment is issued only to junior members of rille clubs and then only for the fIrst 2 years of ac\u00ad tivity; and only national match grade rifles are being offered for sal~i an.\u00a3! only to active competitive marksmen. 31 The Army estimates that the cost of the program has thus 'been decreased from approximately $5 million to $136,750.3 2 In addition, future NRA weapon buyers will be subject to a fingerprint and record check, as will officers of those junior rifle clubs which are eligible for support)3 The value of this increased vigilance is illustrated by the fact that a spot check during 4 months of 1967 of 9,663 prospective NRA weapon buy\u00ad ers led to rejection of 75 such prospective buyers, largely because of prior criminal records.3 4 IV. Evaluation Because the statutory basis for the Civilian Marksmanship Program has not been altered and a termination of the Vietnam war may lead to its reinstate\u00ad ment, the program must be evaluated as it was before the recent cutback. Some groups favoring the program believe any program which encourages gun use is good for that reason alone.35 This judgment is grounded on the general assumption that trained riflemen are needed to defend against outside attack or internal disorder. 36 The principal evidence offered to support this assumption is the extensive civilian programs conducted by the Russians, Chinese, East Germans, and Swiss.37 Whatever validity this assumption may once have qad, it is difficult to imag\u00ad ine, in light of the present strength of American military forces, a foreign power successfully hmding an anny in the UnIted States. The fact that the Chinese, Swiss, and East European countries are worried about such a threat may result from their exposed geographical position, their having less power\u00ad ful military forces, or perhaps from their desire to remind their populace of the possibility of foreign invasion. The assumption also suggests trained marksmen are a bulwark against in\u00ad ternal disorder. Yet proponents of disorder are also armed,38 and encourage\u00ad ment of gun use is perhaps as likely to escalate as to control disorder, unless the gun owners are part of disciplined groups such as the National Guard or the Swiss militia. .;l0See supra, footnote 35See, e.g.,s.tatement by F.tanklin Orth of the National Rifle Association, prepared for presentati.on to the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations of the Senate Com\u00b7 mittee OIl Appropriations, dated July 15, 1968, and the supplement to this statement, dated Aug. 1, 1968. 36/bid~ 37/bfd. 38See apl?

Gun Club Program The strongest specific argument in favor of support of junior gun clubs is that it increases the quality of shooters entering the Army. A report by Arthur D. Little & Co. showed that only 385, or 3 percent, or the 12,859 basic trainees in its sample had gun club training, and yet they provided 40 of the 131 recruits who qualified on the rifle range with scores within 10 points of the top.39 It is unknown whe ther this 3 percent, which. identified itself :.IS having a special interest in guns, would have scored as well without the Army sponsored program. The Little study suggests that the higher a soldierscQres on a standard rifle range, the better he is equipped for combat. Yet current Army \"train fire\" rifle instruction involves trainees' walking along a path and shooting at matl-sizc targets which unexpectedly pop up at various ranges and in different directions. 40 . In addition, the club program affects only 3 percent of Mmy trainees, 85 percent of whom are assigned tasks that do not involve their marksmanship abilities.41 The Army must insure that the results merit the expenditure\u00ad approximately $900,000 in recent years. Similarly, the Army must decide if the club pfCIgram in needed as a source for marksmanship instructors, if not riflemen, in time of emergency.42 Al\u00ad though a shortage ofinstructors was alleged during World War I mobiliza\u00ad tion,43 similar shortages have not been reported during World War IJ, the Ko\u00ad rean War, Or the Vietnam m.:tion. B. National Match Program Ithas been ar!,'Ued that the $3 million spent each year in support of the national matches increases interest in shooting by both military and civilian person\u00ad nel44 and aids the policemen who attend marksmansh~p schools while at the matchcs. 45 In addition to a possible question as to the value of increasing civilian in\u00ad terest: in shooting, it Can also be asked whether the matches provide desirable training to military personnel, particularty since the military forces already hold their own annual shooting matchlls. 46 Moreover, in addition to their own small armS schools, poHce may obtain small arms training through the FBI. There is no apparent need for schools conducted at the matches to train police. 39See l\"cport, supra, footnotc footnote p. 753. J r L The Atmy Civilian Marksmanship Program 247 C. Sales Program \"\"' ... The sales program js said to encourage marksmanship. Sales of .45 caliber pistols and shotguns, however, have at most a limited relationship to marks\u00ad manship. The most compelling argument for the sales program would seem to be that it allows the government the hjghest return on surplus military fire\u00ad arms and arnmunition. 47 Pursuit of th.isobjective would lead to selling sur\u00ad plus Army firearms at market value, not cost, to anyone who may legally possess them, not just to NRA members. Summary The statutes requiring the Army to assist marksmanship among the civilian population are based on assumJ>dons of 50 years ago which may no longer be valid today. These statutus should be re-evaluated in line with current mili\u00ad tary requirements. 47Sce, C.g., Hearings on Military 'Establishment appropriations Subcommittce PISTOL\" As far back as 1926, a debate outline entitled \"Outlawing the Pistol\"l set forth many of the argUl.nents on both sides of the handgun issue.2 The docu\u00ad ment is reproduced here because of its chann and surprising similarity to re\u00ad cent documents relating to fireanns control. Resolved: That the manufacture, sale, importation> transportation, and possession of pistols and of cartridges to fit them should be prohibited except as needed for anny, navy, police, and other official purposes. Affirmative 1. The pistol has become a menace to society in this country. A, The amount of murder in this country is appalling. 1. More than ten thousand people are murdered each year. n. This is more than in all-Europe with four times our popula\u00ad tion .. b. The murder rate, that is, the number of murders for each hundred thousand of population, is higher in the United States than in any other country in the world, and twice as high as in the second most murderous nation, Italy. 2. More than three hundred thousand people have been murdered in this country in the past fifty yeals, 1875-1925. 3. Some of our greatest and most useful citizens have been mur\u00ad dered. a. Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln, both victims of the pistol, are usually considered the two greatest statesmen this country has ever had. b. President McKinley and President Garfield were also victims of the pistol. B. The pistol makes these conditions possible. 1. About 90 percent of the murders in this country are committed by use of the pistol. a. It is easy to conceal, making it possible to get near the in~ tended victim before the weapon is displayed. lLamar T. Beman, \"Outlawing the Pistol\" (New York:H. W.

A pistol is a necessity to people carrying or having in their pos\u00ad session large, sums of money. C.. Some people have advised repealing all our present restrictions on , the ownership and possession of pistols and letting everybody go armed. 1. This will place the law abiding 011 a plane of equality with the armed bandits and the other murderers. 2. Many people think this will do more to decrease murder and check crime. a.

There would be bootlegging in pistols and cartridges just as there is now bootlegging of whisky and rnorphine. APPENDIX J THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS \\. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. Second Amendment, Unit~d States Constitution. The second amendment is frequently interpreted as prohibiting govern\u00ad mental interference with individual possession of firearms. This in terpretation is difficult to defend. In this Appendix the ancestry of the second amendment is traced from the English Bill of Rights through the American Revolution and Constitutional Convention, and the Supreme Court and lower court cases on the subject are reviewed. The English Bill of Rights Even before the Norman Conquest in 1066, English landowners were re\u00ad quired to have arms and men constantly ready forthF;.defense of the King.l These milites, or militia, remained the principalll;lethqd of defense for the Crown until the restoration of tile Stuart kings in 1660, when Charles II, having observed during exile in France the power of a king possessing a stand\u00ad ing army, organized a large body of soldiers paid out of the royal purse as guardians ofhi~ court and person.2 His successor, the Catholic J ames II, increased this nucleus into \"the largest concentration of trained full-time troops that England had even seen.\"3 He appointed fellow Catholics as officers, and deprived many of his Protestant subjects of militia status and the right to bear arms.4 1 See Hays, Tile Rightto Beal' Arms: A Study iI.Judicial Misinterpretation, 2 W. & M.

Firearms and Violence in American Life Incensed over these and other indignities,S a group of Tories and Whigs dispatched to William of Orange a request for assistance in delivering the realm from J ames II. Four months later, William landed in England, and marched unopposed to London. The royal army collapsed, and James fled\u00ad to the court of the Sun King, Louis XIV, never to return. . In the absence 'of a king, a provisional government was organized by William, and letters were sent to the boroughs and counties requesting them to send representatives to a convention. This Convention Parliament met for the first time on January 22, 1689, and declared the throne vacant. On February 12, 1689, a Declaration of Rights, embodying Parliament's under\u00ad standing of the proper roles of the Crown, Parliament, and the people, was agreed upon and presented to William and Mary the next day as a condition upon which the Crown would be offered. William announced, \"We thank\u00ad fully accept what you have offered us,\" and he and Mary were proclaimed King and Queen.6 . Thus did the Declaration (subsequently \"Bill\"7) of Rights become part of the law of England. Alleging that it contained the \"true, ancient, and indubitable rights of the people,\"8 the Bill held, among other things: That the raising or keeping of a standing army within\" the kingdom in time of peace unless it be with consent of parliament is against the law .... 9 and, in the very next clause, ... that the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their condition and as allowed by law.lO It is this latter provision.which is generally asserted to be the progenitor of the second amendment to fhe United States Constitntion. ll Therefore, it is important to note that the preamble to this act states the grievance to be the disarming of Protestants \"at the same time when Papists were ... armed.\" As one observer )1as noted: Parliament did not appear to be claiming for the people a right 0f individual seif-defense or self-effacement, but rather the gener~t tight, as a populace, to remain armed in the face of impossible military impositions. 'The resulting guarantee that Protestants might have 5Some of the most serious of the other objections were the use of the royal prerogative to. suspend and dispense laws; the reestablishment of the Court o~ High Commissi~n, with com:ommitant forcing of the Catholic religion upon the natIOnal chUrch; derual of freedom of election and debate in Parliament; and infrequent calling of Parliaments. For a catalogue of these and other grievances, see 1 W. & M., sess. 2, c. 2 (1689). 6See authoIities cited footnote 2, St.ipra; American Bar Foundation, SOl/rces of Our Liberties (Perry a.nd Cooper, cds., 1959). 7The Bill of Rights, enacted Dcc. 16, 1689, established the Declaration in statutory fonn.

More speciQcally, '. the grievance underlying the guarantee was that Protestants had been deprived of weapons \"at the same time when Papists were ... armed.\" The imposition lay more in the ~iscrimination than in the disarming.12 .~. .. The right granted by the Bill was only such as \"allowed by the law\" and the law at that time already regulated firearms to some degree. The offense of \"going about armed,\" for example, was founded in the cowmon law. It\u00ad was expres,Sed in the 1328 Statute of Northampton 13 and in the following sta tu.te of Charles II: .' . . No person who had no lands of the yearly value of 100 pounds, other than the son .and heir of an esquire ,or other person of higher degree, should be allowed to even keep a gun.14 Today England has among the strictest firearms laws in the world.15 Thus, to the extent one looks to English or feudal history for the source of the American \"right to bear arms,\" it must be recognized that a measure of governmental control over any such right has long been accepted. The first statuto!\"! expression of this right-in an age wen acquainted with such limitations-was not to assert a right of individuals, but rather to assert the general right of theJ>!otestant populace to remain armed in the face of religiously discriminatory impositions. If it is to be inferred that the second amendment reflects the English BHLof Rights, it must also be inferred that it reflects the limitation that the English \"right to bear arms\" was \"more nominal than real, as a defensive privilege.\"16 The American Revolution Among the grievances catalogued by Jefferson in the Declaration ofInde\u00ad pendence, none had greater emotional appeal than those against the oppres~ sion of military rule; the peacetime quartering of troops in private homes, the superiority of military to civil power, the court-martialing of civilians, and the seizure of militia arms. .

Prob. 400, 403. 162 Story,Cbriili,entaries on th~ Constitution 678 (3d ed., 1858). 256 Firearms an,ll Violence in A.merican Life Basic to all these grievances, of course, was the existence of a standing arrny. Jefferson had already observed that the King had resorted to \"large' bodies of armed forces\" to carry out his \"arbitrary measures,\" 17 and his indictment of George III for keeping \"among us in time of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures\" continued tPis theme. Rather than standing armie~, the colonjes' preferred to look to their militias for defense,I8 and any action by the King ,which tended to disarm ' the militia was viewed as an attempt to destroy the liberties of citizens. 'fhe British attempt to seize the militia weapons cached at Lexington and Concord led to the first important battle of the Revolution.19 No doubt-during this period there was also a considerable'body of thought that individuals had an inherent right to have their own weapons, distinct from the rights of states to maintain independont niilitias. Many colonists were confronted by a wilderness of animals and Indians, and obtaining food often depended on sharpshooting hunters. But disarming of individuals was apparently not one of the grievances leading to the Revolution; there is no evidence that preservation of any individual right to bear aims waG one of the purposes of revolution. 20 The Second Amendment With the English surrender at Yorktown, the victorious colonies bound themselves together with the Articles of Confederation. These were weak laws, however, based, on the absolute consent of all the colonies, and wide\u00ad spread' disaffection led in 1787 to a Constitutional Convention, with the predominant mood favoring the creation of a more effective national governme:nt. 21 I , During these constitutional debates, some delegates urged the. adoption of a prefatory bill of riglm. Failing in this, they offered piecemeal amend\u00ad ments. Among these was George Mason's unsuccessful proposal that the grant to Congress of the power to \"provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia\" be preceded by the clause: \"That the liberties of the people may be better secured against the danger of regular troops or st;anding armies in time ofpeace.\"22 No mention hasbeen fcund,however, ' of any proposal securing to individuals the right to have weapons. Further, Mason's famed \"Objections to the Proposed Federal Constitution,\" which <\\ 17 A Summar,), View of the Rights of British America, reprinted in Essential Works of the Founding Fathers 97, III (Kiegel, ed., 1964), quoted in Feller and Gotting, supra, note 2 at50. -: ' 18\"Thc ~~ strength and safety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy is the ,bravery ofits freeholders, its militia.\" James Lovell, quoted in Rossiter, Seedtime of the Republic 387 (1953). \"The sword should never be in the hands of any but those who have an interest in the safety of the community .. such as a well regulated mi\u00ad (Morris, ed., 1965). 198ee, e.g., Clark, Opening of the War o/the Revolution, 19th of Apri1177 5, at 5-8 (1875). supra, note 1 at 390-391. ~-IV Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention S9 (rev. ed. 1937), quoted in Fel\u00ad ler and Gotting, supra; note 2 at 57, and Rohner, supra, n.ote 2 at 57, n. 19.

' The Constitution was submitted to the states for ratification on September 28, 1787, and the struggle between Federalists and Anti-Federalists reached bitter jnteiJsit~. As a result; several states, although ratifying, criticized the\" absence of a bIll of basic human rights. To remedy this, they proposed amendments to be dealt with by the first Congress. ' '. Massachusetts was the first to propose sil,cll amendlTlerlts, but none of Its proposals concerned the right to qear arms. Samuel Adams in.troduced in the Massachusetts convention a proposal that the \"Constitution never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States wh.o are peaceab~e citizens from keep{ngtheir own amls,\" but even Adams' ultImately voted against this.24 New Hampshire, the ninth to ratify, proposed several amendments ~ong them the provisio~: \"Twelfth: Congress shall never disarm a~y . cItIzen unless such are 0\\' nave been in' aGtual\u00b7rebellion.\"25 This probably would have conferred the individual right so often asserted today, had it been adopted. \" ,J , In Virginia, whose wealth and popUlation were essential to the union the grant to Congress of power over the militia was the subject of exten~iye d~~a~e. But the~~ debates swirle~ around Congress' power to disarm the mJhtJa, \u00b7the states powers to a.rm It should Congress neglect to do so and the ways in'which Congress could use the militia. Concern with an i~di~ vidual interest in firearms did not appear26 and 'IS not reflected in the Virginia ~esolutions dealing with the militia: !h~1' no standing a~my or regular troops, shall \"be raised, or kept up, III time of peace; WIthout consent of two thirds of the members in both' houses. !h~t no soldier shall enlist for any longer term than four years, except 10 tIme of war, and then for no longer term than the continuance of the war.

Life 11 North Carolina proposed an amendment identical to the third Virginia r j prop~sal,28 while Rhode Island .recommended that \"the people have a right) to keep and bear arms,\" for t~e ~ffectiveness of the militia.29 A compromise in Virginia saw the Federalist James Madison rise to . champion a bill of rights-perhaps ghosted by James Mason30-in the first session of Congress. Among his proposals was the following: . , . The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a well armed and well regulated militla being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person,31 The language, of this early version of the second amendment 'illustrat~s Madison's (or Mason's) probable intent. The right tq bear arms was intended. to assist the militia-to keep it well armed. The last clause, which exempt:; \" conscientious o~jectors, reinforces this contention, for the entire provision must be taken as a scheme dealing with military service, not individual self-defense. Moreover; the last clause is phrased in individual terms, i.e., \"no person,\" whereas in referring to the right to bear arms the proposal , uses the collective term \"the people.\" This contrast supports the view.iliat the right to bear arms is for collective, not individual, benefit. Madison's proposals were referred to a select committee, which'reported the above provision in somewhat different form. In this form it passed the' House: A well regulated militia composed of the. body of the p~ople, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.32 In the House, debate was confined to the conscientious objector clause, although Elbridge Gerry o.fMassachusetts did comment that the purpose of organizing and maintaining a militia was to prevent the establishment of standing armies-\"the bane of liberty.\"33 There was no mention of any individual.right to bear ar.ms. In the Senate, th~ wording was changed to its present form. While the religious scruples clause was omitt.ed, the final ver~ion retains the collective \"people.\" The Senate debates, unfortunately, were not reported. This history supports the view that the second amendment was designed to protect the state militia, not to promote the individual's use offirearms. Whether \"militia\" is defined as organized military units or as all citizens subject to military duty, the \"right to bear arms\" refers to collective and not individual defense. Moreover, the COUtts which have interpreted the second amendment have consistently limited 'lmilitia\" to organized military units. 26Dumbauld, supra, notc , t I j \\. j'i t\"1 ! 1 II 11 ! I ! I j I II tl 1 I :1 t.f f l Th'e Second Amendment and the Right to Beru Anns 259 The Supreme Cou~t Cases Since the adoption of the second amendment, the Supreme Court has had four occasions directly to construe it. In ]876, in United States v. Cntikshank,34 the Court, in holding defective an indictment charging a conspiracy to prevent Negroes from bearing anns for lawful purposes, said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \"is not a right guaranteed by the Constitution.\"35 .' - ' . The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has lleen seen, means no more than it shall not be i~fringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national govermnent: leaving the people to look for their protection against any violation by their fellow citi\u00ad zens of the rights it recognizes to the states ... )6 (n 1886, in Presser v. [llinois,37 the Court held that an Illinois statute, which forbade bodies of men to associate together as military organizations or to drill or parade with arms in cities and towns unless authorized by law did not infringe the second amendment: [AJ conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment pro\u00ad hibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the National Government, and not upon that of the States. It was so held by this Court in the case of United States v. Cruikshank ... )8 In 1894, in Miller v. Texas,39 the Supreme Court held that a Texas statute prohibiting the carrying of dangerous weapons on the person did not violate the second ~mendment) since \"the restrictions of these amendmen ts [the second and fourth] operate only upon the Federal power, and have no reference whatever to proceedings in state courts.\"40 In 1939, in United States v. Miller,41 fhe Court upheld the National Fire\u00ad arms Act in the face of a second amendment challenge. In that case, the lower court dismissed an indictment charging interstate shipment of an un\u00ad registered shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length. The S\\tpreme Court reversed, holding that the second amendment must be interpreted in light of its \"obvious purpose\" of assuring the continued effectiveness of the militia. The Court said: In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or 3492 U.S. 542 (1875). 35/d. at 553. 36/bid. 37116 U.S. 252 (1886). 38Id. 39153 41307'U$.174 (1939). 260 Firennns and Yiolent;e jn American Life efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear Sl\\ch an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weallOn is any part of the ordinary equipment or that its use could contri6ute to the common defense.42 These Supreme Court cases establish two conclusions. First, the second amendment does not restrict state (cgulation of tIrearms. The states may pass any firearms laws they wish, consistent with their own constitutions, so long as they do not interfere with some other power of Congress, such as the power to arm the military. A state may even disarm its entire popu\u00b7 lation, save for those arms used by the Army, the FBI, or other federal agencies. Second, Congress may regulat;: firearms. By deciding United States v. Miller on the narrow ground of failure of proof, however, the Court permitted the inference that proof of a reasonable relationship between a weapon and the preservation of a well regulated militia might protect that weapon from regulation. But it is common practice for the Supreme Court to decide constitutional cases on such narr0W grounds in order to avoid deciding~arger, unnecessary questions, and no such inference should therefore be drawn. Lower court cases support this view and indica1te that Congress can regulate, even to the poin t of prohibition, the possession: of weapons-short of direct interference with state military personnel in the performance of their official duties. Lower Court Decisions A 1942 First Circuit Cl:ise, Cases v. United States,43 called attention to and rejected this implication in Miller. In that case, the defendant had Qeen con\u00ad victed of violating the Federal Firearms Act by receiving a firearm in interstate commerce after having been convicted of a crime of violence. The appeals court rejected a second amendment attack on the ground! that the dcfendaIlt had used his weapon to shoot up a nightclub and an acqUiaintance, events which permit rio \"inference that he was advancing his military training or that his weapon was being used for militapj purposes.\"44 [W]e do not feel that the Supreme Court. in this [Miller] case was attempting to formulate a general rule applicable to all cases. The rule which it laid down was adequate to dispose of the case before it and that, we think was as far as the Supreme Court intended to go. At any rate, the rule of the Miller case, if intended to be comprehensive and complete would seem to be already outdated, in spite of the fact that it was formulated only three and one half years ago, because of the well known fact that in the so called \"Command Units\" some sort of milit~ry use seems to have been found for almost any modern lethal weapon. In view of this, if the rule of the Miller case is general and complete, the result would follow that, under present day conditions, 42Id. at 178. 43131 F. 2d 916 (ist Cir. 1942). 44Id. at 923. :1 i ! i 1 1 lJ 11 l \\ }\\ L tl Ii , , The Second Amendment and the Right to Bear Arms 261 the federal government would be empow'ered to only regulate the possession or use of weapons such as a flintlock musket or a matchlock harquebus.

It seems to us Unlikely that the framers' of the Amendment intended any such result. ... 45 That same year, in United States v. Toi,46 tIN Third Circuit considered another ~cond amendment challenge to that provision of the Federal :Pire\u00ad arms Act which made it unlawful for any person convicted of a crime of violence to receive firearms or ammunition transported in interstate com\u00ad merce. That court held it abundantly clear from discussions of the second amendment at the time of its proposal, and from learned articles since, that, unlike the first amendment, it was \"not adopted wjth individual rights in mind, but as a protection for the states in the, maintenance of their militi\\l organizations against possible encroacluuents by the Federal power.\"47 Stating that \"weapon bearing was never treated as anything like an absolute right by the common law,\"48 the court concluded that the Federal Firearms ACt was consistent with the history and purpose of the second amendment and affirmed the conviction. See also United States v. Adams, 49 where the defendant demurred to charges of violations of tlle National Firearms Act on several grounds, includ\u00ad ing infringement of the second amendment. Declaring that the second amendment \"refers to the militia, a protective force' of government; to the collective body and not individual rights,\" the district court held that it had no application to the National Firearms Act.50 Some of the foregoing cases, particularly the Suprcme Court cases, were decided before recent decisions extended federal constitutional guarantees from some of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution to sta,'ie and.1ocal governments. 51 The Supreme Court has never ruled, however, that all of the 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights are applicable to the states through 451d. at 922. . 46131 F. 2d. 261 (3d Cir., 1942), revd. other grounds, 319 U.S. 463 (1943). 47lbid. 48lbid. 4911 F.

In Burton v. Sills, 37 Law Week 2380 (1969), the New Jersey Supreme Court recently rejected the argument that the second amendment invalidates the New Jersey firearms statute.55 The court said: The plaintiffs ... urge that \"a reinterpretation of the effect of the Second Amendment upon the states is due to bemade and the time is now with the :New Jersey statute to be the basis for reinterpretation. We have no hesitancy in rejecting the ... point grounded on the Second Amendment. ...

This privilege applies in civil as well as criminal actions, where the evidence disclosed is likely to lead to a criminal prosecution.3 Thus, it Was perhaps inevitable that on January 30, 1968, the Supreme Court should hand down three, cases\u00ad Marchetti v. United States,4 G:'Osso v. United States,5 and Haynes v. United States6-which cast a fifth amendment shadow over gun co.ntro~ proposals. In Marchetti ~he petitioner was charged with will(ul failure to register his name, address, and other information concerning his gambling operations with Internal Revenue officials and with willful failure to pay the $50 occupational tax levied on all persons engaged in the business of receiving wagers. In Grosso the charge was willful failure to pay the 10 percent excise tax imposed 1See, e.g.,.Mansfield, The Albertson Case: Conflict Between the Privilege Against Self Incrimination and the Government's Need for Information, 1966 Sup.

The eXC(lp\u00ad tions scmetimes threaten to swallow this rule, however. See, e.g., Shapiro v. United St,qtes, 335 U.S. 1 (1948) (required records exception); Wilsoll v.

Prior to 1968, its constitutionality under the fifth amendment had been twice tested and twice upheld by the Supreme Court. In 1953, in United States v. Kahriger,13 the Court ruled registration was a valid condition precedent to the payment of the gambling occupation tax. In support of this stand, the Court adopted the rationale of United States v. Sullivan, 14 where it had held that the fifth amendment did not excuse a taxpayer's refusal to file an annual income tax return, in that \"it would be an extreme if not an extravagant appli\u00ad cation of the fifth amendment to say that it authorized a man to refuse to state the amount of his income because it had been made in crime.\"15 Equally important, the Court in Kahrigcr narrowly restricted the prospective applica\u00ad tion of the privilege against self-incrimination by reasoning that it related \"only to past acts, not to future acts that mayor may not be committed.\"16 7Int. Rev. Code ofl954, \u00a7\u00a74401-4423. Briefly, the statutory system operates as fol\u00ad lows: Sec. 4401 imposes a 10 percent excise tax on all wagers placed. In addition, Sec. 4411 imposes a $50 annual occupation tax on all those subject to t:lxation under Sec. 4401. Pursuant to Sec. 4412 all p.ersonsliable (or these special taxes must regis\u00ad ter with the appropriate revenue ofticial, while Sec. 6107 requires revenue ofticials to maintain lists of those who have paid the taxes and to furnish copies of those lists to local prosecutors upon request. Sec. 4422 provides that payment of the special taxes does not exempt the taxpayer from penalties arising under any state or federal law prohibiting gambling. 8lnt. Rev.

I' j Firearms Control and the Fifth Amendment 265 Two years later, in Lewis v. United States, 17 the Court further reasoned that \"there is no constitutional right to gamble,\" and that consequently those who chose to gamble could not avoid payment of the tax.18 The necessariJy implied result, of course, was a fifth amendment waiver, with the choice to gamble implying the choice to register. The National Firearms Act had also previously been considered by the Court. In 1937, and again in 1939, the Court upheld the act as a valid regu\u00ad latory tax, although no fifth amendment issues weke raised or considered.19 By January 1968, however, several lower courts had held the registration re\u00ad quirement of the act unconstitutional on the ground that it required an admis\u00ad sion of unlawful possession. 20 Further, it is significant that in Albertson v. SACB, the Coun in 1965 nulli\u00ad fied the Communist registration requirements of the Subversive Activities Con\u00ad trolAct.21 It reasoned that, despite immunity from prosecution under that act, compliance with its registration provisionr would necessitate the dis\u00ad closure of information which would establish a prima facie violation of the membership clause of the Smith Act and would supply federal prosecutors with '-investigatory leads\" to violations of th~.t act. This created a \"substan\u00ad tial risk\" of self-incrimination.2 2 The Court distinguished Sullivan by ruling that the questions on the income tax return were neutral on their face and not designed to elict admission of criminal acts,23 while the SACB dealt in \"an area permeated with criminal statutes\" and with persons \"inherently suspect of criminal activities. \"24 The Court approached Marchetti, Grosso, and Haynes in much the same way as Albertson: it analyzed the ty pe of information required by the statu\u00ad tory scheme and the probable effects of its disclosure to law enforcement officials. Since the home states of Marchetti and Grosso had outlawed gambling, the Court held registration would have serVed to incriminate them, both by providing an investigatory lin..l( to past activities and by serving as evidence of intent and conspiracy to gamble in the future: We see no reason to suppose that the force of the constitutional pro\u00ad hibition is diminished merely because confession of a guilty purpose precedes the act which it is subsequently employed to evidence .... 17348 U.S. 419 (1955). 18348 U.S. at 423. 19United States v.

United States, 357 F. 2d 306 (5th Cir. 1966), where a conviction of unlawful possession was reversed because the indictment stated that the defendant had personally failed to register. . . With these lower court. cases-in mind, the government carefully fashIOned Its prose\u00ad cution in Haynes. At trial, those counts in the indictment which charged Haynes with failing to register were dismissed on motion of the U.S. attorney, who proceeded to trial under the only remaining count: unlawful possession. See Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968). 21Albertson v. SACB, 382 U,S. 70 (1965) . 221d. at 79. 23lbid. Several commentators did sound the alarm. See Mansfield, supra, footnote 1, 114-116,158-159 n. 95' McKay, supra, footnote 1,218-221. 24 ' 382 U.S. at 79. 266 Firearms and Violence in American Life Moreover, although prospective acts will doubtless ordinarily involve only speculative and insubstantial risks of incrimination, this will scarcely always prove true .... It is not true here.25 Therefore, the Court overruled Kahriger and Lewis. Th~woblem presented in Haynes, however, concerned internal statutory defects'rath(lr than the extrinsicincrimination of Marchetti and Grosso. 26 The incriminatory {!ffects of registration under the National Firearms Act were subtle.27 The a!;t outlined numerous requirements which must be met for a person to legaLly acquire, transport, import, or make certain firearms and criminally punished any failure to comply with these provisions. Further, the act provided that one who possessed a firearm acquired by him in Viola\u00ad tion of these requirements must register. 28 Compliance with the registration provision thus ~omp.elled an individual who acquired a firearm to admit that he had violated sQmeother section. Haynes' conviction was based on unlaw\u00ad ful possession, ri9f(m failure to register. But, one could la\\\\1fuUy possess a firearm lII'lder the act only if all of the requirements had been complied with or if one registered the weapon. Thus, if one acquired a firearm illegally, one could lawfully possess it-only by registering, which necessarily disclosed the unlawful acquisition. Th\\~ Court reasoned that the practical effects of both the registration and unlawful possession sections were, therefore, identical and that neither section could be enforced over a fifth amendment objection: \"The possession of a firearm and a failure to register are eguali\\y fundamental ingredients of both offenses.\"29 . However, the Courtrecognized- that there are a number of apparently uncommon circumstances in which registration is required of one who has not violated the Firearms Act; the United States.points chiefly to the situation of a finder of a lost or abandoned firearm.30 ... We agree that the existence of such situations makes it inappropriate, in the absence of evidence that the exercise of prot-ected rights would otherwise be hampered, to declare these sections impermitlsible on face.\u00b7 Instead, it appears, fr(lm the evidence now before us, that the rights of those subject to the Act will be fully protected if a proper claim of privilege is understood to provide afull defense to any p'{osecution either for failure to register ... or ... for possession of a firearm which has not been registered.3 1 25Afarchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 53-54 (1968). 26An inte~nal statutory defect in the fifth amendment sense exists where a statutory scheme IS so constructed that compliance with one section compels admission of a vier l~tion of a related section of the same statute. Extrinsic dangers lie in the fear that the dIsclosure of the required infonnation might result in prosecution for violation of an umelated $tatute. For another example of an internal statutory defect in the fifth amendment sense, see the federal statutes imposing taxation and registration on those who deal in narcotics or marihuana. Int. Rev.

Firearms Control and the Fifth Amendment 267 These three opinions, unfort~nately, give the misleading impression that it is essentially a simple matter to decide when a fifth amendment privilege applies-that it is merely a que~'t!on of whether a compelle,d disclosure tends to incriminate. However. more Ullin one commentator hasc1:lservelt, \"the law and lawyers have never made up their minds just what [the privilege] . ' .. is supposed to protect.\"32 {:. A simplistic approach would invalidate many of the informaU\\Jn-gathering activities of government. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the fifth amendment does not excus~a taxpayer's refusal to file an income tax, return; the taxpayer must conterit himself with refusing to answer those Iquestions on the return which iiicriminate him.33 Clearly, filing a partially complete return will attract attention and thereby tend to incriminate,34 but the Court has not extended thc:privilege this far. This Simplistic analysis migJ{i lead to a fifth amendment objection to the annual federal registration of aiiens35 or to state statutes which require motor vehicle accident reportirig. 36 It is possible that the courts may eventu\u00ad ally sustain fifth afl'ienillncnt objections in these and other areas. On the other hand, it may be unrealistic to read Marchetti narrowly as in-' validating only legislation specifically designed to entrap criminals into admis\u00ad sions of guilt. If the privilege turns Oil the intent behind.a particular statutory scheme, it should be noted that the Supreme Court went out of its way in Marchetti and Grosso to note that \"the prinCipal interest of the United States [in the wagering tax scheme] must be assumed to be the collection of revenue, and not the prosecgtion of gamblers.\"37 It seems likely that a more balanced approach must be 'taken, such as that suggested by one commentator in 1967: A large number of factors beyond the question ,of tendency to incrinii\u00ad nate must be considered; Among these are the purpose of the dis\u00ad closure requirement, the importance of the governmental objective sought to be achieved, and the necessity of self-disclosure asa means of achieving this objective. Also of relevance are the questions whether disclosure is conditioned upon engaging in an activity deemed basic to freedom, whether disclosure is conditioned upon engaging in an activity that is independently criminal, whether incrimination is prospective or retrospective. Finally, there is the question whether the purpose of the disclosure requirement can be achieved without the use of the informa\u00ad tion for criminal prosecution.38 32Kalven, supra, \"The Constitution no formulae',wlth WhICh we can calculate the areas, .. to which the privilege should extend, and the Court has therefore been obliged to fashion for itself standards for the application of the privi', , lege. \".
