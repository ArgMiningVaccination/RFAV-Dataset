I didnt know I was allergic to many of my favorite foods but now I can eat them with a peace of mind. I've also taken 2 of my daughters in for morning sickness. They were allergic to the HCG hormone but Dr Taylor relieved them with the NAET method. I only wish I knew about it when I was pregnant! Highly recommended!- Tyra Mackert. 10/13/2018 - I have seen Dr. Taylor for a few years and every time I've seen him, which is several dozen times, he had been very helpful in not only helping with my migraines but anything else my body has rejected. When you see him I guarantee you will feel revitalized when you leave. FYI: I have seen a few other local chiropractors and although good i prefer Dr. Taylor above all.- Ron Hamblin. 9/8/2018 - Very capable chiropractor. Warmly welcomed every time I have an appointment by all the staff. Get timely appointment reminders sent to my phone via text message the day before.- craig thieding. 8/6/2018 - My seasonal allergies were worse than they've ever been to the point that I was sick in bed all day. I went to Dr. Taylor and he did two allergy treatments on me, and within just a few hours I went from barely functioning to feeling back to normal!- Carmody Bowman. 5/15/2018 - When I first went to Dr Taylor, I was having frequent migraines lasting several days, severe chronic fatigue, and severe food and environmental sensitivities causing debilitating sickness. Because of these sensitivities and allergies, I was able to eat only meat, vegetables, and berries without becoming really sick. After receiving NAET treatments I've been able to expand the variety of healthy foods I can eat, I rarely get a migraine, and my energy has increased. Dr. Taylor has given me my life back.- Katherine Rainwater. 3/26/2018 - Extremely high quality service. Flexible pricing. Dr Taylor & staff are interested in your health, which is why I keep going back!- Brian Middleton. 4/21/2017 - Dr. Taylor is thorough and very skilled at removing allergenic blocks from your system. My son has seen dramatic improvement with a rash that bothered him for months. I know I was led to Dr. Taylor for a purpose. The ladies at the front desk were overly accommodating with my ever changing schedule. They made the experience very positive for both my son and I. Awesome group there!- Wendy Morris. 3/6/2017 - By far the best chiropractor I have seen since 1977, I have no more allergies and less migraine headaches, if you want fixed and fixed right you need to see him like now!- Ronald Hamblin. 6/13/2016 - Dr Taylor is very specific in his adjustments.
