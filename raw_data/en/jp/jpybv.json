These simple practices can greatly benefit from the right mindset and tools. Enter - the tuning fork. Marie marks the start of her many rituals with a tuning fork, a two-pronged metal bar that produces acoustic vibrations. Often used in sound healing ceremonies, tuning forks are known for calming the nervous system and aligning the mind and body. \"When I began tidying as my full-time job, I quickly learned how demanding the work could be,\" says Marie. \"I started using tuning forks as a way to center myself - their sonic vibrations have a subtle healing power that helps me to reset.\" Our guide to using a tuning fork will introduce you to its many benefits - for healing, self-care rituals and even discovering your ideal lifestyle. The Many Uses of a Tuning Fork Tuning fork therapy is known for bringing the body and mind into balance and supporting the release of negative thoughts or emotions. Many integrative medicine doctors, acupuncturists and other healers bring tuning forks into their professional practice, but you can also reap their benefits at home. As a general rule, anywhere that feels \"stuck\" can benefit from tuning fork therapy. The gentle sonic vibrations treat stress and anxiety, insomnia and even allergies. Even if you feel well mentally and physically, using a tuning fork can help quiet the mind before a big project or during a meditation or yoga session \u2014 an essential step in our busy world! Tuning Forks for Healing Perhaps the most common application, using tuning forks for healing is rooted in Eastern medicine. Their sonic vibrations are believed to stimulate qi, encouraging the body's energy to flow naturally. Striking a tuning fork, then holding it against an area that feels tense or painful is believed to alleviate symptoms and encourage healing. Tuning Forks for Self-Care Rituals Tuning forks can also stimulate mental energy and heighten self-awareness. This is one of Marie's favorite uses for her tuning fork. \"It's a simple practice that leaves me feeling renewed,\" she says. If you're feeling stuck creatively, emotionally or socially, use a tuning fork to help you find a path forward. It can also help the mind come to rest. Adding a tuning fork ritual to your nighttime routine signals that it's time to unwind. Tuning Forks for the Home Marie also loves using tuning forks to clear space in rooms and prepare for change \u2014 like how you might use sage. When one of her clients feels nervous about starting their first tidying festival, a tuning fork ritual can help ease them gently into an exciting new chapter. You can also strike a tuning fork to fill rooms or areas where the air feels stagnant with energizing vibrations. But perhaps Marie's favorite use of tuning forks involves using them to discover and embrace your unique [kurashi](https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-marie-kondo-book-kurashi-at-home), or way of life. Use one as you imagine your ideal lifestyle \u2014 then let this vision serve as an internal compass for how you live out your days. Tuning Forks and Crystals Using a tuning fork with a crystal can elevate and expand your rituals. Striking the fork against a crystal creates pure tones that are believed to resonate more deeply. Along with her tuning fork, Marie is never without a crystal or two! Choose the type of crystal that speaks to your needs on any given day. Marie recommends a trio of quartzes: [clear for balance](https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-decor-konmari-tuning-fork-crystal-set-quartz), [smoky for finding strength](https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-decor-konmari-tuning-fork-crystal-set-smoky-quartz) and [rose for unconditional love](https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-decor-konmari-tuning-fork-crystal-set-rose-quartz). How to Use a Tuning Fork Using a tuning fork is the perfect way to introduce more mindfulness to your home routines and rituals. Here's how: - Strike the tuning fork to start its vibrations. You can strike it against your knee or a nearby hard surface \u2014 or against [a crystal](https://shop.konmari.com/products/konmari-decor-konmari-tuning-fork-crystal-set-quartz)to increase the benefits. - Close your eyes and let the sound fill the space. Allow the mind to quiet and breathe deeply. - Bring the tuning fork close to the body. Hold it near your ear or try placing the base of the fork against the temple, in the center of the forehead or at a pulse point to further quiet the mind. You can also place it against an area that feels stuck, such as cramped muscles or sore joints. - Or move the tuning fork slowly around the room. This will help stimulate energy and movement in spaces that feel stagnant. - Envision your kurashi. Before opening your eyes, take a moment to visualize your ideal lifestyle. What is your next step?

She finds them especially [useful before big plans](https://konmari.com/how-to-use-a-tuning-fork/) and as a reminder of her time as a shrine maiden in Japan. \"I use them before speaking to a large group of people, visiting a new space or whenever I need to clear the air.\" For Marie, a tuning fork helps stimulate every part of the self, bringing body and mind, inside and outside, into alignment. \"I use a tuning to feel centered and present in the moment,\" she says, "}
