Chinese herbs are a [key part of Chinese medicine](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/whole-medical-systems/using-whole-medical-systems/#Chinese-medicine). Different parts of plants, such as the leaves, roots, stems, flowers and seeds, are used. Herbs may be taken as tablets or given as tea. Why use it Some people believe that herbs can unblock meridians and bring harmony to the forces in the body, such as Yin and Yang. What to expect The practitioner will take a case history and assess how your body is out of balance. This will include a tongue and pulse analysis. They will choose a combination of herbs and foods with the aim of bringing your body back into balance. Chinese medicine practitioners make a formula tailored specifically to your condition, or they can dispense herbal medicines pre-packaged as granules, pills or raw herbs. What is the evidence? As with [Western herbal medicine](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/western-herbal-medicine/), many Chinese herbs have been scientifically evaluated for how well they work for people with cancer. Studies have found benefits for some herbs, such as American ginseng for cancer-related fatigue. Research is continuing to examine the benefits of different herbs and different herbal combinations. Chinese herbal medicine is a complex area and it's best to see an experienced practitioner rather than trying to treat yourself.
