Accreditation is intended to assure stakeholders, students and the general public of the qualit y and integrity of higher educat ion institutions and programs. Through a continuous improvement pr ocess, accreditation also assures that the programs at the institutions are constantly advancing. These outcomes are achiev ed through rigorous internal and external review processes duri ng which the institution is evaluated against a common set of standards. SACS The University of South Florida St. Petersbu rg is accredited by the Commission on Co lleges of the Southern Association of Colle ges and Schools to award degrees at the baccalaureate, master's, and do ctoral levels. Contact the Comm ission on Colleges at 1866 Southe rn Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions abou t the accreditation of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg. AACSB The College of Business is accredited by AACSB International - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. AACSB International is the premier accrediting agency for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree pr ograms in business administrati on and accounting, and as such is the most widely -recognized and sought-after endorsement of business schools. Less than one-third of U.S. business school programs and only 15 perc ent of business school programs worldwid e meet the rigorous standards for AACSB accreditation. NCATE The College of Education was unanimously approved by the Unit Accreditation Board for national accreditation by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Educat ion (NCATE), the national accrediting body for schools, colleges, and departments of education authorized by the U.S. Department of Education. NCATE determines which schools, colleges, and departments of education meet rigorous national standards in preparing teachers and other school specialists for the classroom. ACEJMC The Department of Journalism and Media Stud ies (JMS) at USF St. Petersburg is one of 114 journalism programs nationally accredi ted by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. ACEJMC is the national accrediting body for professional programs in journa lism and mass communications. JMS, founded in 199 1, was first accredited in both its undergradua te and graduate programs in 2004. Re-accreditat ion of both programs became official Ma y 30, 2010 and will be in effect for seven y ears. About 25 percent of all journalism and mass communication programs in the United States are fully accredited. A far smaller percentage of programs are accredited at both undergraduate and master's levels.

These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majo rs and minors, and academic residence. Advisors, directors, departme nt chairs, and deans are available to help the student underst and and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is respon sible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degr ee will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for al l students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throughout their college careers and to be respons ible for completing requirements.

The minimum admission requirements are designed to help identify applicants whose academic background indicates potential for success at USF St. Petersburg; however, satisfac tion of minimum admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance. The admission of new students at all levels is made on a selective basis within curr icular, space, and fiscal limit ations. The selection process may include such fact ors as grades, test scores, pattern of co urses completed, class rank, educational objectives, past conduct, school recommenda tions, personal recommendations, and portfolios. Preference for admission in any ter m will be given to those applicants whose credentials in dicate the greatest promise of academic success. The University encourages applications from qualified applicants of both genders and from all cultural, racial, religious, ethn ic, and age groups. In the admission process, there is no discrimination on the basis of these factors or on the basis of disability.

These policies are further described under \"Applying for Admission\" and \"Requirements for Admission.\" The University supports equal educational opportunity for all st udents. Requests for waiver of the $30.00 application fee are considered by the Director of Enrollment and Marketing Services if payment of this fee creates severe financial hardship and se rves as a deterrent to application.

Transcripts and other admission documents All official transcripts, test scores, and any other required cr edentials must be received directly from the issuing agencies. It is the applicant's responsibility to initiate the request for credentials to the issuing agencies and to assure their receipt by the U SF St. Petersburg Office of Admissions. See \"Req uirements for Admission\" below for informatio n concerning required documentation. All credentials and documents submitted become the property of US F St. Petersburg. The originals or copies of the originals wil l not be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution, agency, or person. Applicants admitted on a provisional basis mu st submit all requested missing credential s, such as official final transcripts or test scores, that substantiate eligibility for admission before a second registration will be permitted. Provisional Admission An applicant admitted on a provisional basi s must submit the requested missing credenti als, such as official final transcripts or test scores that substantiate eligibility for admissio n before a second registration will be permitted. Applicants who do not meet standard Florida Department of Ed ucation minimum admission requirements may be admitted to the University on academic probation. Students admitted on probationa ry status must accumulate 30 semester credits and maintain a minimum cumulative 2.0 grade point average (G PA) each term enrolled with no single term GPA below a 1.0 before the probationary status is removed. (A term GPA below 2.0 in the first term of enrollment results in permanent ac ademic dismissal.) Academic Adv ising is mandatory prior to registration. Failure to meet these condit ions results in permanent academ ic dismissal from the Universit y. USF System Admission Criteria vs. Differential Admission Criteria Undergraduate students are admitted to USF St. Petersburg based on state university system admission criteria. Differential adm ission criteria, which are higher than the system admission criteria, are required for admission to USF Tampa. Students admitted to US F Tampa may register for classes offered by an y USF System institution or campus. Students admitted to USF St. Petersburg or USF Sarasota-Manatee, who do not meet the differential criteria are restricted from changing their home campus or registering for courses offered by USF Tampa until they achieve the required acad emic credentials. Students may apply to have the registration restriction removed, which will allow the students to take course s offered by any USF institution, when they have a cumulative postsecondary GPA that meets the current transfer admission criteria for USF Tampa. For the 2012-2013 academic year, a freshman who does not meet the di fferential admission criteria must earn at least 24 credit hours and have a 2.5 cumulative GPA and a transfer student who does not meet the differential admission criteria must earn at least 6 0 credit hours and have a 2.5 cumulative GPA to have access to courses offered at all USF institutions. Any exceptions must be requested on a course-by-course basis and wi ll be approved only when th e course is required for on -time progression toward degr ee for the student. Requests for exceptions must be initiated throug h the academic advisor at the home institution or campus and m ust be approved by the Dean of the appropriate college at USF Tampa. Non-degree Seeking Status Non-degree-seeking student enrollment is on a space-available basi s and has been established for those individuals who, while n ot desirous of earning a degree, would like to enroll in all levels of university courses. Teachers needing to take courses for ce rtification purposes, high school students (with the permission of their re spective guidance counselor), individuals desirous of taking cou rses for self-enrichment, and senior citizens are examples of those el igible to utilize this enrollment method. Former USF system undergraduate degree-seeking students may only enroll as non-degr ee-seeking students if they have completed their previous degr ee program or earned an equivalent degree at another institution. Sh ould the latter be the case, an official transcript (reflectin g the degree) from that institution must be sent to the Office of Admissions prior to registration. Performance in courses taken as a non-degree-seeking student wi ll not qualify an applicant for admission as a de-gree-seeking student. Similarly, courses taken as a non-degree-seeking studen t will not be utilized in determining an applicant's grade poin t average for purposes of admission. Applicants denied admission to USF St. Petersburg as de gree-seeking students will not be permitted to enroll as non-degree-seeking students. A non-degree-seeking student who has been di smissed from USF St. Petersburg is not el igible for admission to USF St. Petersburg as a degree-seeking student at the undergraduate level. Individuals enrolling as non-degree-seeking students who plan to submit a formal application to the University may not apply mo re than 14 semester hours toward an undergraduate degree. Non-degree-seeking students who have been dismissed from any US F system institution are not elig ible for admission to USF St. Petersburg as degree-seeking students at the undergraduate leve l. If extenuating circumstances contributed to the academic dismissal and the student meets other admissions requirements, a re quest for waiver of this rule may be submitted to the Facult y Committee on Student Admissions. This rule does not apply to a student who has earned a degree from a regionally accredited institution subsequent to academic dismissal. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the same academic poli cies as undergraduate degree-seeking students and must adhere to deadline dates published in the Universi ty Schedule of Classes. Non-degree-seeking students are not eligible to receive Univ ersity honors or participate in the USF St. Petersburg/Florida Public Community College cro ss-registration program. Non-degree-seeking students also are not el igible to receive financial aid. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the acad emic probation and dismissal policy listed in th is catalog. Potential non-degree-seeking st udents should also refer to the section o f the catalog of the college(s) offering the course (s) of interest to them to determine wh ether any special college requirements exis t that must be met prior to enrolling. Admission Denials Receipt of final official credentials which fail to substantiate eligibility will result in re scission of admission, reclassifi cation to non-degree status, and denial of continued enrollment in subsequent terms. An undergraduate applicant who is denied admission may be eligible to appeal and will be advised of applicable appeal procedure s by the Department of Enrollment and Marketing Services. An application for admission or a residency affidavit submitted by or on behalf of a student that contains false, fraudulent, o r incomplete statements may result in denial of admission, prev ention of further registration an d/or rescission of degrees awarde d. The University may refuse admission to a st udent whose record shows previous misconduct not in the best interest of citizens of the University community. Applicants who do not meet standard Florida Department of Ed ucation minimum admission requirements may be considered for admission to the University on academic pr obation at the discretion of the Office of Admissions. Students offered admission on probationary status must accumulate 30 se mester credits and maintain a minimum cumu lative 2.0 grade point average (GPA) each term enrolled with no single term GPA below a 1.0 before the probationary status is removed. A term GPA below 2.0 in the first term of enrollment results in pe rmanent academic dismissal. Academic Advising is mandatory prior to registration. Failure to meet th ese conditions results in permanent academ ic dismissal from the University. Required Summer Term Attendance All students entering the Universi ty with fewer than 60 semester hours of college level academic work are required to earn at l east 9 semester hours during one or more Summer terms prior to graduation. Required Orientation Prior to beginning classes, all new undergr aduate students are required to particip ate in an Orientation program at USF St. Petersburg. This program is designed to help new students beco me acquainted with the University, choose courses, register for classes, and complete all other necessary procedures. New students receive Orientatio n/Academic Advising/ Registration informat ion after admission. Required Proof of Immunity Prior to registering for classes, all students born after 1956 ar e required to present documentat ion of proof of immunity to ME ASLES (Rubeola) and RUBELLA (German Measles). It is further required th at all students must present pr oof of immunity to Hepatitis B and Meningitis or decline immunization by signature. Students living in USF St. Petersburg Housing must be vaccinated against menin gitis (no declination is permitted). Beginning January 2013, a Tubercul osis Screening will be Required for ALL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS and U.S.-born students residing at an address outside of the U.S. at the time of application and Most Academic Health Programs. (See Immunization Policy on page 31.) Limited Access Programs Undergraduates seeking entrance to limited access degree progra ms must meet special program requirements in addition to requirements for admission to th e University. While many limited access programs ad mit students only at the junior level, some programs admit students for the freshman or sophomore years. The admissi on criteria and procedures for limited access programs at USF St. Petersburg furnish equal access to A. A. degree holders from Flor ida public community/state co lleges, transfers from oth er SUS institutions, and USF St. Petersburg students of equivalent status. Transfer applicants with 60 or more transferable semest er hours who are seeking admission to limited access programs must meet the grade point average requirement specified by the progr am to be eligible for admission to USF St. Pe tersburg. Transfer applicants with 30 to 59 transferable semester hours who are seeki ng admission to certain limited access programs may also be required to higher transfer grade point average requirements necessary for eventual admission to such degree programs. The USF System, with approval of the Board of Governors and the Articulation Coordina ting Committee, has established the follow ing undergraduate programs as limited access: Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentration; all programs in the College of Business; all programs in the College of Education; an d the program in Graphic Design. The admissions requiremen ts for these programs may be found with other program info rmation in appropriate sections of this catalog. Minimum Requirements for Admission Freshman Applicants For the purpose of admission, orientation, and scholarships, applicants are considered freshmen unless they have attempted 12 o r more college-level credits after graduation from high school. Credits earned through du al enrollment or by exams will be used t o determine class standing after matriculation to USF St. Petersburg, but do not confer transfer status in the admissions process . To be considered for admission, freshman applicants must submit a USFSP Application for Admission, a non-refundable application fee of $30, an official high school transcript , official GED scores if applicable, SAT or ACT scores, and TOEFL or I-ELTS scores if applicable. Although USF St. Petersburg has minimum freshman admission re quirements, meeting these minimum standards does not guarantee admission. USF St. Petersburg also considers applicants who do not fully meet minimum requir ements but who have important attributes, special talents, or unique circumstances that may co ntribute to a representative and diverse student body. These freshman applicants are considered for admission by committee on the basis of other appropriate evidence of ability to do succe ssful academic work at USF St. Petersburg. In accordance with Board of Governors Re gulation 6.002 regarding the admission of undergraduate degree-seeking freshmen, for purposes of admission, USF St. Petersburg recalculates a high sc hool grade point average (GPA) based on grades earned in all co llege preparatory academic courses. In recalculating a GPA, USF St. Pete rsburg assigns additional weight s to grades earned in Honors, Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placem ent, dual enrollment and Internat ional Baccalaureate courses. The University requires a diploma from a re gionally accredited hi gh school or a state-approved General Education Development (G ED) diploma. Students admitted under the Early Ad mission Programs are exempted from this requirement. Students who are participatin g in an approved home sch ooling program are expected to provid e acceptable copies of annual eval uations for the equivalent of gra des 9 - 12. A portfolio or additional documentation may be requested if deemed necessary to complete an appropriate evaluation for admission. Other minimum requirements are outlined below. 1.

Freshman applicants who are between a 3.3 (B +) and 4.0 (A) grade point average as recalculated by USF St. Petersburg using all attempted academic courses are considered competitive. However, admission to the University is selective. Therefore, simply meeting requirements does not guarantee admission. 4. Criteria for admission based on a GED diplom a: An overall score of at least 300 for all five tests - at least 40 on each of the five tests - an SAT I verbal and quantitative combined score of 1010 or an ACT composite score of 21.

Applicants with fewer than 60 tr ansferable semester credits are considered lowe r-level transfers; upper- level transfers are tho se with 60 or more transferable semester credits (see below). Regardless of category, grade point averages (GPA) for purpose of admissi on will be computed based only on grades earn ed in courses that are acceptable for tran sfer credit and as calculated by USF St. Petersburg. USF St. Petersburg accepts transfer credits, without a course by course evaluation of the prior cour sework, only from instituti ons that are accredited by one of the regional accrediting agencies/commi ssions recognized by USF St. Petersburg at the time the credits are earned. (See \"Evaluation of Transfer Credit\" ). Courses approved for transfer by the St atewide Course Numbering System (SCNS) fr om non-regionally accredited institutions may be considered for tran sfer credit. Credits earned at an institution that is currentl y in \"candidacy\" status will not be considered for transfer credit until such time as the awarding in stitution receives full accredi tation. For an applicant applying from a non-regionally accredited school, the admissions decision will be based on prior work at a regiona lly accredited institution or on the transferab le work completed at a non-regionally accr edited institution as approved by SCNS. If all post-secondary work is from a non-regiona lly accredited school, not including SCNS a pproved coursework, the evaluation will be based on the high school record and test scores and the applicant will be regarded as a freshman for purposes of admission. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to ev aluate specific courses and deny transfer credit. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit that is de termined to be occupational or voca tional in nature except that work specifically approved as part of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science program or approved by the academic department of the student's major.

Students Entering the Florida Community College System and Planning to Finish their Degrees at USF St. Petersburg High school graduates planning to start their college education at a Florida co mmunity/state college sh ould confer with the community/state college counselor and ask that their academic prog ram be planned with the assistan ce of the USF St. Petersburg Undergraduate Catalog. This catalog explicitly describes the undergraduate program requirements and Florida's common prerequisites that should be followed to en sure maximum ease of transfer into the st udents' upper-level programs on a par with their native USF St. Petersburg counterparts. Students Entering the Florida Community College System and Planning to Finish their Degr ees in the State University System An articulation agreement, in effect sinc e April 13, 1971, and later adopted by the Fl orida Legislature in statute form as Flor ida law, governs an effective and orderly transfer of Florida community/state college students into the State University System (SUS). The agreement defines and establishes the Associate in Arts degree from a Florida public community/state college as the basis f or all articulation rights. Among these guarantees, the following are central to the transfer process: 1.A.A. graduates will be granted admission to a university within the SUS but not necessarily to the university or program of choice. 2.A.A. graduates will have the same opportunity to enroll in a university limited access program as the native university stude nt. 3.Upon transferring to a public university in the Florida SUS, A.A. graduates will be awarded at least 60 credit hours towards the baccalaureate degree, exclusive of occupational course s and basic required physical education courses. 4.Credits that are part of the A.A. degree earned through articu lated acceleration mechanisms, such as Advanced International Certificate of Education, Advanced Placement, dual enrollment, International Baccalaureate, early admission and credit by exam will be transferable to the state university. Such credit need s to be received directly from the credit-granting agency. 5.As participants in the Statewide Course Numbering System, rece iving institutions must accept all courses taken at the transfe r institution if the courses at each institution have the same pr efix and the same last three digits of the course number. 6.The university catalog in effect the year the A.A. degree st udent first enrolled at the commun ity/state college will remain i n effect for the student's entire program, provided the student maintains continuous enrollment as defined in that catalog. 7.Once a student has completed the general education core and this fact is noted on the transcri pt, regardless of whether or no t an A.A. degree is awarded, no other state university or co mmunity college to which the student may transfer can require additional courses to the general education core. Included in these transfer guarantees is the right of appeal. Students may appeal to the unive rsity and to the Statewide Articu lation Coordinating Committee Evaluation of Transfer Credit 1. The receipt and evaluation of transfer credit is the responsi bility of the Office of Admissions and Outreach. The Office of Admissions and Outreach will evaluate the a cceptability of total credits transferable to the University. The college of the student's major will assign equivalent courses in determining which courses are applicable toward a specific degree at the University. In some instances, exact course equivalents will also be determined by other college s that offer the same or simila r courses as part of their programs of study. Transfer students should be prepared with personal copies of their transcripts of a ll past course work to discuss advisement and placement with the appropriate academic advisor and should contact the college of their major soon after registration so that an official evaluation may be completed. 1. USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny credit for specific courses. USF St. Petersburg does not award transfer credit fr om institutions that it determines to be occupa tional or vocational in nature except for work that is specifically approved as par t of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science program or approv ed by the academic department of the student's major. 2. A course-by-course transfer credit evaluati on will be done for all out-of-state and pr ivate in-state A.A. degree holders. Effec tive Fall Quarter 1976, all courses from a Florida community or stat e college/university bearing the same State Common Course prefix and last three numbers as a USF St. Petersbu rg course are automatically transferred Transfer students may not be required to repeat these courses unless a college age-of -record policy is involved. That same au tomatic transferability of credits applies to courses completed at non-regionally accredited institutions that have been specifically approv ed by the SCNS. Excluded are graduate courses, studio courses in art, intern ships, practica, and performing arts courses. 3. All undergraduate degree programs at USF St. Petersburg require a minimum of 48 hour s of upper-level. This policy does not affect approved articulated prog rams based on the A.S. degree. For information regarding specific articulated A.S. degree programs, consult the USF St. Petersburg Office of Admissions and Outreach. 4. Credit will not be awarded for GED tests. 5. Military service school courses will be ev aluated with reference to the recommendation of the American Council of Education when official credentials have been presented. Such reco mmendation, however, is not binding upon the University. 6. For ROTC and military science courses take n after Fall Quarter 1975, the maximum credit will vary with each college.

Transient Applicants An undergraduate transient student is one who comes to the Univer sity from another regionally ac credited institution and wishes to take courses at USF St. Petersburg for one term only before re turning to the parent institution. Transient students may enroll at USF St. Petersburg as non-degree-seeking students. Transient students who wish to take USF St . Petersburg courses MUST HAVE PRIOR WRI TTEN APPROVAL from their college academic advisor to receive credit for courses take n. The Transient Student/Cross Enrollment fo rm should be used for this purpose. Non-Degree-Seeking Student Non-degree-seeking student enrollment is on a space-available basi s and has been established for those individuals who, while n ot desirous of earning a degree, would like to enroll in all levels of university courses. Teachers needing to take courses for ce rtification purposes, high school students (with the permission of their re spective guidance counselor), individuals desirous of taking cou rses for self enrichment, and senior citizens are examples of those el igible to utilize this enrollment method. Former USF system undergraduate degree-seeking students may only enroll as non-degr ee-seeking students if they have completed their previous degr ee program or earned an equivalent degree at another institution. Should the latter be the case, an official transcript (reflectin g the degree) from that institution must be sent to the Office of Admissions prior to registration. Individuals enrolling as non-degree-seeking students who plan to make formal application to the University may not apply more than 14 semester hours toward an undergraduate degree. Applicants denied admission to USF St. Petersburg as degree-seeking undergraduates may not enroll as non-degree-seeking student s. Performance in courses taken in this ca tegory will not qualify an applicant for admission as a degree-seeking student. A non-degree-seeking student who has been dismissed from any USF system institution is not eligible for admission to USF St. Petersburg as a degree-seeking student at the undergraduate leve l. If extenuating circumstances contributed to the academic dismissal and the student meets other admissions requirements, a re quest for waiver of this rule may be submitted to the Facult y Committee on Student Admissions. This rule does not apply to a student who has earned a degree from a regionally accredited institution subsequent to academic dismissal. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the same academic poli cies as undergraduate degree-seeking students and must adhere to deadline dates published in the Universi ty Schedule of Classes. Non-degree-seeking students are not eligible to receive Univ ersity honors or participate in the USF St. Petersburg/Florida Public Community College cro ss-registration program. Non-degree-seeking students also are not el igible to receive financial aid. Non-degree-seeking students are subject to the acad emic probation and dismissal policy listed in th is catalog. Non-degree seeking students who are academically dismissed from the Univ ersity may appeal to the Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) through th e ARC representative for the appropriate academic unit in whic h the student is pursuing courses. Potential non-degree-seeking stud ents should also refer to the section of the catalog of the c ollege(s) offering the course(s) of interest to them to determine whether any spec ial college requirements exis t that must be met prior t o enrolling. NOTE: Prior to registering for classes, all students born afte r 1956 are required to present docu mentation of proof of immunity to MEASLES (Rubeola) and RUBELLA (German Measle s).

Students living in USF St. Petersburg Housing must be vaccinat ed against meningitis (no declination is permitted). (See Immunization Policy on page 31.) Readmission (Former St udents Returning) A former student returning (FSR) is any degree-seeking undergrad uate student who has not earned his/her degree, has not been enrolled at USFSP in any of the last three terms, and wishes to re-enro ll in the University. Former students returning must be readmitted to the University. In order to be considered for read mission, a former student should file a new application for adm ission with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the deadline indi cated in the Academic Calendar for the term of requested re-ent ry. A new application fee is required. Former College of Education ma jors must contact the College of Education Academic Advisor fo r additional readmission requirements. The residency affidavit must be completed and residency stat us will be reassessed. To be readmitted, a student must meet the following requirements: Have a USF St. Petersburg GPA of at least 2.0.

If previously enrolled at USF St . Petersburg and academically dismissed at the end of the last term of enrollment, a student must fi le a petition with the Acad emic Regulations Committee for Academic Renewal I or II in conjunction with the application for readmission. Students who have a ttended one or more institutio ns since their last enrollment must request offi cial transcripts of all work attempted at the other institution(s) be sent to the USF St. Petersburg's Office of Admissions and Outrea ch.

FSRs who have been readmitted are not required to participate in an orientation program. Stud ents must meet with their academic adviso r for course selection. Transient students and non-degree-seeking students are not consid ered FSRs. These students who wish to enter as degree-seeking students must file an application with the Office of Admission s and Outreach prior to the deadline listed in the Academic Calendar for the request ed term of entry. An application for admission must be submitted by all FSRs who have not been admi tted to and enrolled in a USF S t. Petersburg degree program within the last three terms. Former or continuing USF degree-seekin g students must file another application for admission and pay the non-re fundable $30 application fee when applying for a second degree program, another level of study or readmission (see Readmission).

Internal processes (such as auditions, port folio reviews, and placement tests) utiliz ed in the various departments for the sole purpose of determining a student's most appropriate area, level, or sect ion placement in a program of study are not to be construed as examining mechanisms for the granting of credit. USF St. Petersburg/Florida Public Community College Cross Enrollment Some undergraduates may find it advantag eous to cross enroll at a Florida public community college while attending USF St. Petersburg. To prevent problems with financial and other registra tion issues, see a USF St. Petersburg academic advisor for det ailed instructions and course approval. Credit hours for the course(s) taken at the host institution will apply toward graduation onl y if prior approval was received from the student's US F St. Petersburg advisor. The grade point average will not transfer to USF St. Peter sburg. The Cross Enrollment contract is available on th e Forms page of the Financial Aid website. USF St. Petersburg Transient Students USF St. Petersburg degree-seeking students wh o wish to take all courses at another re gionally accredited institution for one se mester, MUST HAVE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL from th eir college academic advisor to receive credit for courses taken. The transient student/cross enrollment form should be used for this purpose. On e semester must have been comple ted at USF prior to becoming a transient student. The Consortium Agreement for Transient Study form is available on the forms page of the Financial Aid websit e. Senior Citizen Tuition Waiver* Florida residents who are 60 years of age or older as of registra tion day, and must have lived in Florida for the last 12 month s, may enroll on a space available basis in certain undergraduate and grad uate courses without paying fees . Academic credit is not awa rded, examinations are not required, and grades are not given. A parking permit is required. Many courses require departmental approval, prerequisites, or have other restrictions which may limit registration. If you are aware of these restrictions, you may acquire the necessary permits in advance of registration. There is a Registrations Worksheet for m to accomplish this. Additionally, the permits may be submitted el ectronically in OASIS by the issuing department. Under no circumstances will notes on plain paper without department letterhead be accepted. Students may not pre-register for courses in which they plan to use the Senior Citi zen Tuition Waiver. The waiver will not be processed if a Senior Citizen pre-regist ers and then submits a Senior Citizen tu ition waiver form for those courses. It is the student's responsibility to comple te and submit the waiver form allowing su fficient time for the form to reach The Of fice of the Registrar at USF St. Petersburg by the registration deadline. Financial Information Florida Residency For Tuition Purposes This notice summarizes the provisions of Florida Statutes and Un iversity Policy/ Procedure concerning Florida residency for tui tion purposes. In determining residency classification, students fa ll into one of two categories. They are either (1) independent students (students not claimed on parent's or legal guar dian's federal income tax statement or whose parents do not provide 50% or more of their support) or (2) dependent students (students, regardless of age, who are claimed as dependents by parent or legal guardian on federal income tax statement or whose parents provide 50% or more of their support). The law basically requires that a U.S. ci tizen/permanent resident alien/independent student or a dependent student's parent/leg al guardian has established and maintained a LEGAL Florida residence for at least twelve (12) months before the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency status is sought. The stud ent who comes to Florida to enro ll full-time in a Florida higher education institution as an out of state re sident and continuously enrolls in a Flor ida institution will not normally meet the Florida residency requirement for in-state tuition regardless of the length of time enrolled. USF St. Petersburg is required to obtain documentation of 12-months legal residenc e before a student is classified as a Florida resident for tuition purposes. A student is required to reques t Florida residency in writing and submit supporting documents no later than the fifth day of classes in the term for which classification is sought. The following is acceptable, non-conclusive evidence of the establishment of a legal residence in Florida. Two documents must b e dated/issued at least 12 months before the first day of cl asses of the term for which Florida residency is sought. 1. Proof of purchase of perm anent home in Florida. 2. Declaration of Domicile. 3. Florida's driver's license. 4. Florida voter's registration. 5. Florida vehicle registration. 6. Florida vehicle title. 7. Professional/occupational license in Florida. 8. Florida incorporation or other eviden ce of legal residence in Florida. 9. Full-time, non-temporary employment in Florida. PLEASE NOTE: Rent receipts, leases, employment records, tax returns, school/college records are NOT evidence of establishing a legal Florida residence. Students who are dependent on out-of-sta te parents or who come to Florida for educational purposes are generally ineligible for reclassification to Florida status. In rare cases, the law allows some students (e.g., military, publi c school teachers, etc.) who do not meet the basic requirements to be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes. For more information about exceptional categories, contact the Office of the Admissions & Records. Fees The levels of the Activity and Service Fee, the Health Fee, and the Athletic Fee are determined on each campus by a student fee committee appointed by the President of the University and the Student Government President. The committee includes USF St. Petersburg faculty and students with the majority of the committee being students. The fees may be reviewed on a yearly basis.

FINANCIAL AID Location/phone: USF St. Petersburg: BAY 110, (727) USF-4128 Office Hours: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Web Address: http://www.stpete .usf.edu/finaid Counselor Email: finaid@stpete.usf.edu USF St. Petersburg only requires the Free Application for Federa l Student Financial Aid (FAFSA) to apply for federal, state and USF financial aid funds. First, apply for a Fede ral Pin number at http://www.pin.ed.gov, th en complete and subm it the FAFSA online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov Be sure to list sch ool code #001537, to ensure USFSP receives an electronic copy of your information. Since many programs are funded on a limited basis, it is to yo ur advantage to apply between January 1 and March 1 of every year to be considered for the maximum amount and types of aid available. Other dates and detailed information regarding these programs are provided on our website through our Programs-At-A-Glance: http://usfwe b2.usf.edu/finaid/at_a_glance.asp. Scholarships are another financial aid option for incoming students. See the \"Scholarships\" section below. The Office of Financial Aid communicates important information re garding your aid via e-mail throughout the year. Therefore, it is extremely important that you ensure that your current e-mail addr ess is correct in OASIS. Through OASIS, you can also view the status of your financial aid, see any needed do cuments to complete your financial aid fi le, and see any awards offered to you. Degree-seeking, Financial Aid students enro lled at least half-time receive a tuition deferment. A tuition deferment prevents cancellation of registration for non-paymen t of fees and temporarily prev ents assessment of the late payment fee. Since financi al aid is disbursed after drop/add, check OASIS to see if you ha ve a tuition deferment prior to the start of each term (http://www.stpete.usf.edu/s p_oasis/index.htm). If you have tu ition deferment, and you have me t disbursement requirements, your financial aid will be applied against your student account charges. Most financial aid is disbursed through your student accoun t and is applied to tuition and other charges posted to the account before a check is issued for any remaining balance. Avoid paying a l ate payment fee by paying any remaining balance before the defermen t deadline Since tuition deferm ent prevents cancellation for non-payment, you must officially withdraw from all classes by the end of drop/add week to be relieved of liability to pay and t o ensure that tuition is not later paid by disbursed financial aid. Because we are required by fe deral regulations to verify the last date of attendance in classes, at the end of ea ch semester the Office of Fi nancial Aid mails letters to financial aid recipients who appear to have unofficially withdrawn (your semester grades are all M, F, U, or I.) Your last date of attendance may be considered the last date you submitted an assignment or took an exam, or your last date of actual a ttendance in classes. This letter requires a res ponse within 14 days, or it will be assumed you did not attend beyond the 50% point of the term. This may require you to repay a port ion of federal financial aid received. Federal regulations require all schools participating in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Satisfactory Academi c Progress (SAP) policy that confirms to the two requirements: Qualitat ive and Quantitative detailed on the financial aid webpage: http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/satisfactory_progress.htm These requirements apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financia l aid. Your satisfactory academic progre ss is based on your entire academic record, at all schools attended, regardless of whether yo u received financial aid. SAP is calcula ted each semester after grades have been posted to academic history by the registrar. On e week after the last day of final exams is a good time to check your status. If your SAP status is inelig ible, you will not qualify for a tuition deferment and must pay by the payment deadline (end of drop/add, which is the fifth day of classes) or your regist ration will be cancelled. SCHOLARSHIPS Scholarships are administered by a number of different offices within the University.

Veterans with a service-connected disability approved for bene fits under Chapter 31 may contact the Cashier's Office, BAY 132 n o earlier than one week prior to the start of classes for a book an d supplies voucher. Other VA benefits include additional amoun ts of compensation and pension, which may be payable to eligible vete rans and widows or widowers of veterans for the enrollment of dependent children. The students, parents, or guardians are respon sible for notifying the Veterans Services Office directly of enrollment changes and termination of enro llment. Monthly payments are directly ti ed to enrollment status. Any changes to enrollment status may cause an overpayment by the VA. *See \"Resident Status,\" above University Police The USF St. Petersburg Police Department pr ovides a full range of public safety services to the campus community 24 hours a day , 7 days a week.

Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Records & Registration about general questions concerning academic policies and procedures of their current registration or academic record. Note: Each student must be aware of the University's academic policies and procedures insofar as they affect him/her. Academic Regulations and Information Semester System USF St. Petersburg operates on a semester system. Semesters begin in Au gust and January with Summer Sessions beginning in May and June. See Academic Calendar for appropriate dates. Academic Load The maximum load of an undergraduate stud ent is 18 hours (Fall & Spring semesters) and 14 hours (Summer Term) unless approval i s received from the dean or an au thorized representative of the student's college. Students cl assified as Undecided must receive approval from the freshman/sophomore advisors in the Advising Center. In the Fall or Spring Semester 12 hours is the minimum lo ad for a student to be considered as full-time. Full-time Undergraduate Student Definition - Summer Term Sessions \"A\" & \"B\" (6 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 6 hours or more each session For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combination of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Session \"C\" (10 weeks) For: Academic purposes - 9 hours or more For: Financial aid - Students must enroll for 12 hours (undergraduate) in any combinat ion of Sessions \"A,\" \"B\", and \"C.\" Students receiving Veterans Administration benefits should confirm their Summer Term enrollment with the Veterans Coordinator i n the Office of Financial Aid. Undergraduates may not enroll in 6000-level co urses or higher without approval of the college/department in which the course is offered. Availability of Courses USF St. Petersburg does not commit itself to offer all the course s, programs, and majors listed in this catalog unless there is sufficient demand to justify them. Some courses, for example, ma y be offered only in alternate se mesters or years, or even less frequently if there is little demand. Excess Credit Hour Surcharge (USF Regulation 4.0102) In 2009, the Florida Legislature implemented Section 1009.286, Fl orida Statutes to encourage students to complete their baccalaureate degree as quickly and efficiently as possible. It es tablished what is commonly referred to as an \"Excess Credit H our Surcharge.\" The provisions of this section became effective fo r students who entered a Florida community college or a Florida state university for the first time in the 2009- 2010 academic year and thereafter. The bill requires universities to add a surcharge to each credit hour taken in excess of the total hours calculated, based on a percentage defined in law. See the following table: Students entering as FTIC SUS (First time in college State University System of Florida) or FTIC FCS (First time in college Florida College System) Fees to be Charged Prior to Fall 2009 NONE Fall 2009 -Summer 2011 50% for credits above 120% of total program hours Fall 2011-Summer 2012 100% for credits above 115% of total program hours Fall 2012 and thereafter 100% for credits above 110% of total program hours The surcharge is assessed only on the tuition portion of the seme ster hour cost, not on the fees. The number of total progra m hours required for the baccalaure ate degree will be identified by the student's de clared major. This is typically 120 semester hours, although, some programs have been approved to require more than 120 semester hours. Note: No institution may waive the excess hours surchar ge as the language of the statute is mandatory. Transfer of Credit to USF St. Petersburg USF St. Petersburg will accept credits only from those institutions accredited by one of the accrediting agencies/commissions recognized by USF St. Petersburg. However, USF St. Petersburg reserves the right to deny credit for specific courses. The recei pt and evaluation of total transfer cr edit are the responsibility of the Office of Re cords & Registration. The college of the student' s major will determine which courses are applicable toward a specific de gree and will assign equivalent courses (see Evaluation of Tran sfer of Credit under Admissions and Related Matters). USF St. Petersburg subscribes fully to all of the provisions of the statewide Articu lation Agreement (Rule 6A-10.024) and stron gly recommends that students complete the Associate in Arts certific ate before transferring. Special details for students who do no t plan to complete the associate's certificate requirements are availabl e from the Office of Records & Registration. Also, all transfe r students should refer to other entrie s about undergraduate transf ers in the Admissions section of this catalog. Former Student Returning The Office of Admissions will evaluate the acceptability of transf er of credits taken at regionally-accredited institutions sin ce last enrolled at a USF system institution. The college of the studen t's major will determine which courses are applicable for his/he r major. In some instances, exact course eq uivalents will also be determined by other colleges that offer the same or similar cou rse(s) as a part of their programs of study. Continuously Enrolled Degree-Seeking Student The Office of Admissions will determine the acceptability of tran sfer credits for continuing, degree-seeking students who take courses at regionally accredited institutions. However, PRIOR WRITTEN APPR OVAL MUST BE OBTAINED from the student's academic advisor if these credits are to be applicable to the USF St. Petersburg de gree program. A properly-execute d Transient Student form or Cros s Enrollment form should be used for this purpose. Registration for Admitted Degree-Seeking Students Continuing degree-seeking students register by appointment for their next semester's courses during the preceding term, either by internet or in person.. Appointm ent times and instructions for all registration pe riods may be viewed on the USF system's OASIS on-line schedule of classes fo r the appropriate semester. Prior to initial registration, all newly admitted undergraduate st udents and readmitted former undergraduate students returning are required to participate in an orientation and an academic advising session. Newly ad mitted students and readmitted Former Stude nts Returning receive orientation information by calling (727) 873- 4181, advising information by calling (727) 873-4511, and regist ration information by calling (727) 873-4645. Registered students may make schedule adju stments in the regular registration period during the preceding term or in the drop/a dd period during the first week of classes. (Deadline information is available in the Academic Calendar.) Degree-seeking students who do not register by the last busine ss day prior to the first day of classes may late-register the fi rst week of classes. A $100.00 late registration fee is charged during this week. (See the sect ion on fees for additional information an d the appropriate term's Schedule of Classes for dates.) To avoid canc ellation of registration, fees are due and payable for all regi stered courses of record on the fifth day of classes (end of drop/add period). (See Academic Calendar for dates.) NOTE: A Mandatory Medical History Form is re quired for all students (regardless of ag e). According to Florida Administrative Co de Rule 6C-6.001(4), \"Each student accepted for admission shall, prio r to registration submit on a fo rm, provided by the instituti on, a medical history signed by the student.\" Immunization Policy (Policy Number 33-002) 1. Introduction The University of South Florida St. Petersburg requires th e following immunizations for registration and specific immunization in order to be eligible for on-campus housing. 2. Statement of Policy a. ALL STUDENTS MUST HAVE: MEASLES - proof of immunity if born after 12/31/1956 RUBELLA - proof of immunity if born after 12/31/1956 HEPATITIS B - proof of immunity or signed waiver declining the vaccine MENINGITIS - proof of immunity or signed waiver declining the va ccine except as listed below b. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS ELECTING TO LIVE IN ON-CAMPUS HOUSING MUST HAVE: MENINGITIS - Medical documentation of immunization with Mening itis vaccine at age 16 or later. Declining by waiver of this vaccine is not acceptable for students in on-campus housing. No student will be assigned housin g without proof of vaccine. c. MEDICAL HISTORY FORM (required for all students, regardless of age) All students must complete the USF Mandat ory Immunization Health History Form http://www.shs.usf.edu/userfile s/files/Medical%20History%20Imm unization%20Compliance.pdf d. PROOF OF IMMUNIZATION Proof of immunization that will be accepted for each disease is as follows: 1. MEASLES a. Medical documentation of immunization with TWO (2) doses of live measles virus vaccine on or after the first birthday and administered at least 28 days apart. Pers ons vaccinated with killed or an unknown vaccine prior to 1968 must be revaccinated. Persons born before 1957 may be considered to have had a natura l infection and, therefore, do not need measles vaccine. The documented date of immunization for measles should indicate the day, month, an d year. However, only month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth OR b. Copy of laboratory serologic [IgG] evidence of measles immunity (lgG rubeloa titer) OR c. A written, dated statement signed by a physician on his or he r stationery, that specifies the date seen, and states that the person has had an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting th ree (3) or more days, a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or gre ater, a cough, and conjunctivitis, and, in the physician's opinion, is diagnosed to have had the 10 day measles (rubeola). 2. RUBELLA a. Medical documentation of immunization with live rubella virus vaccine on or after the first birthday. The documented date of immunization for rubella shou ld indicate the day, month, and year . However, only month and year will suffice if the month and year indicate that the immunization was given at least 13 months after the month of birth OR b. Copy of laboratory serologic evidence of rubella immunity (l gG rubella titer). 3. HEPATITIS B a. Medical documentation of immunization with 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine OR b. Copy of laboratory serologic evidence of Hepatitis B immunity (anti-HBs titer). 4. MENINGITIS a. Medical documentation of immunization with Meningitis vaccine at age 16 of later. 5. TUBERCULOSIS a. Beginning January 2013 (spring 2013), Tube rculosis Screening will be Required for ALL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS and U.S.-born students residing at an address outside of the U. S. at the time of application and Most Academic Health Programs. e. EXEMPTIONS RELIGIOUS - For religious exemption applications, contact USF Student Health Services MEDICAL - Requests for temporary or permanent medical exemptions must be submitted to USF St udent Health Services by the attending physician, must include reason for exemption and duration of exemption. In the event of a disease outbreak, student exempted from immunization requirements may be reques ted by the University, at the direction of the public health officials, to show titer proof of immunity, become immunized, or remain off campus for the duration of the outbreak. All requests for exemptions will be reviewed to ensure consistency in application. f. CONSEQUENCES Students who fail to comply with the re quirements as stated above will be bloc ked from registration and/or on-campus housing assignment. In specific circumstances, a temporary override may be granted, however, vaccination requirements must be completed before any further registration in subseq uent terms will be permitted and current registration may be suspended if any deficiency in immunization status is identified. SUS Health Insurance Requirement for International Students The State University System of Florida requ ires that all international st udents have medical insuranc e in order to register for classes at USF. Academic Advising for Undergraduate Students USF St. Petersburg seeks to guide all studen ts in selecting programs and courses best suited to their personal abilities, educa tional interests, and career objectives. Students who have been admitted to the University sh ould meet regularly, by appointment, with their Academic Adviser in the Academic Advising Center located in Davis Hall 134. This Center also serves as an initial point o f contact for non-admitted, prospective, and/or non-degree seeking students who need information about the University's academic structure. All students are encouraged to establish an advising relationship with the Academic Advising Ce nter and periodically visit thei r advisors to keep abreast of any policy, pr ocedural, or curriculum chan ges that may affect them. In fact, some colleges require advisor approval of student programs each se mester. It is important for students to k eep in mind that, although the University provides advising services to assist studen ts with academic planning, it is each stud ent's responsibility to see that all gradu ation requirements are met. Initial Advising and Registration It is necessary that all students meet wi th their academic advisors prior to first-class registration. The purpose of this init ial contact is to provide the advising unit with routine information to assi st it in collecting and maintaining the necessary records to as sure the student's proper progress toward education go als. Transfer students shou ld bring an unofficial or st udent copy of their transcr ipt(s) to this advising session. Declaration of Major Some first-year students enter the universi ty undecided about their career plans and intended majors. Many of the more than 17 undergraduate majors at USF St. Petersburg allow students consid erable options in their early co urse choices. Conversely, many other majors, and often the most popular majors, re quire completion of particular courses wi thin the first two years. In fields, such as education, business, and graphic design, students must satisfy st ate mandated course prerequisites and complete specific genera l education courses during the first two years to be admitted to those major as juniors and to allow graduation on a timely basis . It clearly is advantageous for students to make early decisions about their majors to be on track and to remain on-track toward their degrees and to graduate in a timely manner. Students are urged to declare a major upon entry to the university. If they are una ble to formally choose or declare a major or a pr e-major they should follow the multi-semester inquiry-based (for undecided) curricula that best matches their interests. All students must be officially declared in a major or a pre-major before they comple te 36 credits. Beginnin g Fall Semester 200 5, Continuing students who will have completed 36 or more credits will not be allowed to register for further credit coursework at the university until they have declared a major or pre-major. Transfer students must declare their majors upon entry to the university. Many resources are made available by the university t o assist students in making career decisi ons and choosing their majors. Information about these resources is readily available fr om academic advisors. Advising for Limite d Access Programs Students are cautioned that admission to th e University does not imply admission to all the programs and courses offered by the individual colleges; this is especially tr ue with respect to colleges with programs designated as limited-access. Colleges such as Business, Education, Mass Communications-Journalism and Media Studies, and the Program in Graphic Design have been designated a s limited-access and require completion of certain prerequisites be fore a student may declare a major. It is important that stude nts check the college sections of the catalog for advising and admi ssion requirements. Students planning to enter a limited-access program should be aware that their admission by the college may be denied or delayed and should be prepared with alternative pl ans of action. Course Attendance at First Class Meeting This policy was implemented so that USF St . Petersburg may effectively utilize classroom space and to insure that all students have maximum opportunity to enroll in classes wher e demand exceeds availability of seats. Students are required to attend the first class meetin g of undergraduate courses for which they registered prior to the first day of the term. Names of students who register prior to the first day of the term are shown on the first class roll in Blackboard for each course section. The first day class roll is used by professors to drop students who do not attend the first day of class. Stude nts having extenuating circumstances beyond their contro l and who are unable to attend the first class meeting must notify the instructor or the department prior to the first class meeting to request waiver of the first class attendance requ irement. Please note that the Registrar's Office does not add students to any cour ses. Students are required to add their course via OASIS. To avoid fee liability and academic penalty, the student is resp onsible for insuring that he/she has dro pped or been dropped from all undesired courses by the end of the 5th day of classes. This policy is not applicable to courses in the following cate gories: Educational Outreach, Open University (TV), FEEDS Program , Community Experiential Learning (CEL), Cooperative Education Trai ning, and courses that do not have regularly scheduled meeting days/times (such as, directed reading or study, individual research, thesis, dissertation, internship, practicums, etc.). Students are responsible for dropping undesire d courses in these categories by the 5th day of classes to avoid fee liability and academic penalty. USF's distance learning students must log- in to their course(s) during the first five (5) weekdays from the calendar start date of their online course(s). Students who are unable to log-in to their course(s) due to circumst ances beyond their control must notify th e instructor or the department prior to the calendar start date of the course to request waiver of the first class attendance requirement. General Attendance Only officially registered students or stud ents approved to audit a class are entitled to attend class. Students are responsibl e for being aware of all instructor-based and University issued attend ance policies and the requirements of the registrar for enrollm ent, drop/add and fee liability. Students are responsible for completi ng the academic requirements of each class as defined by the instructor and as set forth in any class syllabus. An instructor may make attendance mandatory and may impose penalties, includ ing failing a class, for excessive absences. It is university policy that student absences will be ex cused for military duty, jury duty, and religious days (as set forth in University policy 10-045). Excuse d absences for other documented reasons may be allowed at the discretion of the instructor. Th ough excused, the student is responsible for completing all academic work, examinations, assign ments and labs in a timely fashion. Procedures for Excused Abse nces and Make-up Work Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent from a cla ss or announced examination for the approved reason as noted above in a ccordance with this policy. In the event that a student is abs ent for one of these noted reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, quiz, etc.), the s tudent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to ma ke up such work or shall not have that wo rk averaged into the student's grade, at the discretion of the instructor. If excused for an absence, the student is responsible for comple ting all academic work, examinations, assignments, and labs wit hin a period of time and in a manner deemed appropriate by th e instructor. The manner for accommodating excused absences appropriately is in the hands of the instru ctor, but a student who is absent for an ex cused reason should not be at a disadvant age when compared to other students. The approved reasons for excused absences apply even if a student in a course has the option o f dropping an assignment grade (e.g., dropping the lowest quiz sc ore). Excused absences for other reasons may be allowed or decli ned entirely at the discreti on of the instructor. Even if individual absences are excused, excessive absences may threaten a student's satisfactory completion of a course. Absen ces may count from the first class meeting, including for students who hope to add the class after the first day. Jury Duty The University respects the need for all citi zens to serve on a jury when called to du ty. If a student serves as a juror, class absences will be considered excused when the student provides advance noti ce to the instructor, the instru ctor acknowledges the request, and the student provides written verifi cation of jury selection and pr oof of service. It is importan t to note that excused absence only applies to physical presence, and not to the academic work missed. A student, though excused, is responsible for all academic w ork, examinations, assignments and labs if applicable. These issues ar e unique to University students and clearly may present undue hardship for a student to serve while enrolled in an active course of study. Any potential student juror may notify the court of conflicts or undue hardship and request an excuse from service. The individ ual student must make the decision as to whet her jury service will present an undue hardship and then take the affirmative action t o request to be excused from service and may need to provide a written explanation to the court. If a student does not request to be excused and is selected to serve, the stud ent may miss a prolonged period of time resulting in the inability to complete the ac ademic requirements of classes. Documented Medical At tention for Illness Students are excused for absences from docu mented illnesses that requir e medical attention. While students should not attend cl ass with infectious conditions, even if medical attention is not soug ht, the decision to excuse abse nces from undocu mented illnesse s is at the discretion of the individual instructor. Consideration should also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness. Extended illnesses may interfere with the satisf actory completion of courses, and in such cases a student shou ld drop the course by the posted \"drop without acad emic penalty\" deadline via OASIS. After the drop deadline, students may submit an Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) petiti on with proper documentation to drop a course or withdraw for medical reasons. Students may find additional information through their college ARC representative. Early Notification of Instructor Requirem ent for University Sponsored Activities The University recognizes the importance of participation in Un iversity-sponsored activities such as music performances, athlet ic competition, and debate. It also recognizes that such participat ion may result in conflicts with scheduled class times. It is t he responsibility of participating students to provide a full list of anti cipated conflicting days to instructors by the end of th e first week of the term, and directors and advisors of Un iversity activity programs ha ve an obligation to assist students with this task. S tudents are responsible for identifying potential absences specific to a particular class; a general sche dule for a team or ensemble do es not satisfy this requirement. Studen ts should provide instru ctors with addenda and changes to scheduled conflicts (e.g., end-of-sea son tournaments, newly scheduled events, or rescheduled events) as so on as they are available. Directors and advisors of University activity programs should consult with part icipating students prior to registration to help them choose courses that do not have excessive anticipated conflicts Religious Days The university has an official Attendance Policy for the Observance of Religious Da ys (University policy 10-045) which provides that all students, faculty, and staff at the Universi ty have a right to expect that the Univer sity will reasonably accommodate their rel igious observances, practices and beliefs. Students are expected to attend classes and take examinations as determined by the University. The University will, at the begi nning of each academic term, provide written noti ce of the class schedule and formal examin ation periods. The university, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view of customarily observed religious holida ys of those religious groups or communities compri sing the University's constituency. No stud ent shall be compelled to attend class o r sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term or as provided in the course syllabus if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in ac cordance with this policy. Studen ts absent for religious reasons will be given reasonable opportunities to make up any work missed in the event that a student is absent for religious reasons on a day when the instructor collects work for purposes of grading (homework, pop quiz, etc), the student shall be given a reasonable opportu nity to make up such work or shall not have that work averaged into th e student's grade at the discretion of the instructor. Any studen t who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above may seek review of a complaint through established University Academic Grievance Procedures (found in the Graduate and Undergraduate Catalogs) and those provided by the Universit y's Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. Schedule Changes PLEASE NOTE: Class days, times and room assignments are subject to change as late as the first day of classes. For updates, please check OASIS at http://www.usfsp.edu/portals /students.htm Click on \"Schedule of Classes.\" Course Adds After a student has completed his/her registration on the date assigned, he/she may add courses on a space-available basis unti l the add deadline specified in the Academic Calendar. See the approp riate semester's University Sche dule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. Course Drops A student may drop a course(s) during the drop/add period (first five days of classes) and no entry of the course(s) will appea r on any permanent academic records. No tuition or fees will be assessed for course(s) dropped within that period. A student may withdraw from a course(s) between the second and te nth week of the semester (excep t for Summer sessions - see the Summer Schedule of Classes for dates). Ho wever, tuition and fees will be assessed fo r any course(s) withdrawn by the student af ter the first week. The student's academic record will reflect a \"W\" grade for any course(s) withdrawals between the second and ten th week of the semester. Under specific conditions, refund of tuitio n and fees may be requested in writing from the Office of Purc hasing and Financial Services. See \"Refund of Fees\" under Financial Information for complete details. Effective Fall 2011, all undergraduate students will be limited to a total of five course withdrawals while enrolled as a degre e-seeking or non-degree seeking undergraduate student at USF. The five cour se withdrawals will be limited to three course withdrawals for students with less than or equal to 60 seme ster credit hours, and two course withdraw als for students with more than 60 semeste r credit hours. Only in extenuating circumst ances will approval be granted for more th an five course withdrawals. Appeals for additional course withdrawals due to extenuating circumstances must be subm itted to the Academic Regulations Committee. Auditing Privileges and Fees A student who wishes to sit in on a class to review the course material may do so; ho wever, the student is not allowed to take exams, earn grades, or receive credit. The student's status for that cla ss is an audit and his/her presence in the classroom is as a l istener. A student must register to audit courses duri ng the late registration pe riod. (No audit registrations are processed during the re gular registration periods.) Fees for audit are the same as for full en rollment for credit except out-of -state tuition is not charged . See University Schedule of Classes for detailed instructions and dates. Cancelation Before First Class Day Students may cancel their registration by notifying the Office of Records and Registration in writing prior to the first day of classes. If fees have already been paid, the student may request a full refund of fees from the Cashier's Office. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the University without academ ic penalty during the first ten weeks of any term (except for Summer Sessions). He/she must submit a completed Wi thdrawal Form to the Office of Records an d Registration. No entry is made on the academic record for withdrawals submitted during the first week of the term. All subsequent withdrawals (through the tenth week of classes in the Fall and Spring Semesters) are posted to the academ ic record with \"W\" grades assigned to the courses. Withdrawal deadlines for the Summer sessions are listed in the Academic Cale ndar and are published in the Schedule of Classes for the Summ er Term. Students who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Students who withdraw during the drop/add period as stated in the Academic Calendar may receive a full refu nd of fees. All refunds must be requeste d in writing from the Cashier's Office. No refund is allowed after this period except for specified reasons. See Refund of Fees under Financial Information for complete d etails. Repeat Course Surcharges Initiated by the Florida Legislature (H.B. 1545 of 1997) to reduce costs, all state uni versities must monitor undergraduate stu dent progress and charge students the full cost of instruction for certain repeats of underg raduate courses. This policy became effe ctive Fall 1997 and requires USF St. Petersburg to charge students a su bstantial per-credit-hour surcha rge when they attempt a course three or more times at any USF system instit ution, unless the course is specifically desi gned to be repeated or is required to be repeated by their major. Requirements to earn a passing or high er grade than previously earned in a course do not exempt the surcharge. Students will be required to pay the surcharge in addi tion to the appropriate in-state or out-of-state tuition rates . It is important to note that all attempts count, including withdrawals after the first week of classes and courses with incomplete gr ades. The University may grant exceptio ns to this rule based on exte nuating circumstances and financial hardship. However, the Univer sity may only approve one appeal per course. The exceptions includ ed in the Statute are extenuating circumstances and financial hardship and are defined as follows: Extenuating circumstances are thos e circumstances determined by the University to be exceptional and beyond the control of the student and may include but not be limited to serious illness, do cumented medical condition preventing completion; death of an immediate family member, involuntary call to active duty, university error, other emergency circumstances or extraordinary situations. The criteria used by the University for determining financial ha rdship should include, but not be limited to, qualification for federal need-based financial aid. Students with other documented financial hardships may also be considered. The student must fill out a Fee Adjustment Request Form and indica te the request is for a waiver of the repeat course surcharge . He/she must also submit a statement that explains the request and provide all documentation rela ting to it. The completed form with documentation should be subm itted to the Office of Records & Registration for consideration.

GRADES , FINANCIAL AID REQUIREMENTS , AND REVIEW PROCEDURES The University is interested in each stud ent making reasonable progress towards his/ her educational goals and will aid each stu dent through guidance and faculty advising. To make students aware of their academic progress, the Un iversity has enacted a system o f grading and policies of Academic Probation and Academic Dismissa l that indicates whether or not a student is showing sufficient progress toward meeting degree requirements. Notations of Grades , Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal are posted to the student's academic record. When a student is academically dismissed from the University and is ineligible to re-e nroll, it may be in his/her best interest to re-evaluate his/her educational goals with an academic advisor. If the student's poor academic performance has resulted from extenuating circumstances or if after a period of time the stud ent feels he/she has gained adeq uate maturity and motivation, he /she may petition the Academic Regulations Committee for permission to re-enroll. See Academic Regulations Committee, for informatio n on petitioning. Academic Dismissal may have additional implications for a studen t receiving financial aid. If required, a student may need to complete the Satisfactory Progress for Financial Aid Recipients Petition. For more information, see http://usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/satisfactory_progress.htm. Grading System Effective Fall Semester, 2000, USF St. Peters burg faculty may use a plus/minus grading system to assign student grades. The use of the plus/minus grading system is at the disc retion of the individu al faculty member. A student's measure of academic achievement is recorded on the academic record based on the following grading system: Plus/Minus Grades E Course repeated, not included in GPA FF Failure/academic dishon esty I Incomplete IF Incomplete grade changed to Failure IU Incomplete grade changed to Unsatisfactory M No grade submitted by instructor MF Missing grade changed to Failure MU Missing gr ade changed to Unsatisfactory N Audit S Satisfac tory U Unsatisfactory W With drawal from course without penalty WC Withdrawal for extenuating circumstances Z Indicates continuing registration. Please note that the grade of C- will satisfy specified mini mum requirements of the Gordon Rule courses and the common prerequisites unless otherwise specified in the Catalog. Grade Point Average The University uses the quality points listed above. The grade- point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total hours attempte d within the USF system. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the numb er of credits assigned to each course by the quality point value of th e grade given. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M , MU, N, S, U, W, Z, and grades that are preceded by a \"E\" are subtract ed from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Date Day Event 27-Aug Monday First Day of Classes 7-Sep Monday Labor Day Holiday 12-Nov Monday Veterans' Day Holiday November 22-23 Thursday-Friday Thanksgiving Holiday 7-Dec Friday Last Day of Classes December 8-14 Saturday-Friday Final Exams 16-Dec Sunday Commencement Date Day Event 1-Jan Monday New Year's Holiday 7-Jan Monday First Day of Classes 21-Jan Monday ML King Holiday March 11-16 Monday-Saturday Spring Break 26-Apr Friday Last Day of Classes April 27-May 3 Saturday-Friday Final Exams 5-May Sunday Commencement Date Day Event Multiple attempts on courses designated as repeatable in the course catalog will prov ide for hours and quality points on each a ttempt to be applied to the student's grade point average. \"D\" and \"F\" grades established in USF system coursework not designated as repeatable for additional credit will be ca lculated into the student's GPA as many times as \"D's\" or \"F's\" are earned in the sa me course. If a student earns a grade of \"C-\" or higher in a course that may not be repe ated for additional credit and earns a \"C- \" of higher on a subsequent enrollment the new grade is not computed into the student's GPA unless the student applies for and is el igible to receive a grade forgiveness. \"I\" Grade Policy Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and grante d at the instructor's discretion only when students are unable to complete course requiremen ts due to illness or other circumstances beyond thei r control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: A majority of the student's work for a course is comp lete before the end of the semester (more than 50%). The work that has been completed is qualitatively satisfactory. The student requests consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade an d obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the fi nal decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must comple te and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form th at describes the work to be completed, t he date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete a ssignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters from the original date grades were du e for that course for undergraduates and non-degree-seeking students. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in th e department/college that offered the course and the Registrar's Office by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re-r egister for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade contract. Students may register to au dit the course, with the instruct or's approval, but cannot re-ta ke the course for credit until the \"I\" grade is cleared. An \"I\" grade contract that is not complete d within the approved time frame (including summer semester) will revert to the origi nal grade noted on the contract. \"I\" grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in th e GPA, retroactive to the semester the course is taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. \"M\" Grade Policy An \"M\" is automatically assigned as a default grade when the inst ructor does not submit a grade for a student. (Undergraduate r ules also apply to non-degree-seeking students.) Unless a change of gr ade is submitted, the \"M\" grade will remain on the transcript and will not be computed in the student's GPA. S/U Grade System No-option Courses. Certain courses have been designated as S/U co urses. The \"S\" and \"U\" grades are used to indicate the student 's final grade. These S/U only courses are identified with (S/U only ) after the course definition in this catalog. No grading syst em option is available to students or faculty in these courses. Option Courses. Any undergraduate course may be taken on an S/ U basis by a student under the following conditions and restricti ons: 1. Required courses in the major may not be taken on an S/U basis unless specifically designated 2. Courses supporting the student's majo r and state mandated common prerequisites may not be taken on an S/U basis. 3. Courses to satisfy 6A-10.30 (Gordon Rule ) may not be taken on an S/U basis. 4. Courses to satisfy USF St. Petersburg's B.A. foreign language requirement may not be taken on an S/U basis. 5. All elective courses for the major and all elective courses in the general education requirements, and all other free electi ve courses may be taken on an S/U basis except where: a. The certifying college restricts the number of courses that ma y be taken on an S/U basis in any one or all of the above area s or restricts the total number of S/U courses that can be accepted for all of the above areas. b. The certifying college specif ies that certain courses may not be taken on an S/U basis. c. The instructor of a course refuses to allo w the course to be taken on an S/U basis. 6. Once of the Major Works and Major Issues courses , if taken outside the student's major discipline(s) may be taken S/U credi t with instructor consent. Mechanism for Assigning S/U Grades . The method by which a student receives an \"S\" or \"U\" grade in an option course will consist of the following: 1. A written agreement signed by both instructor and student sh all be filed with the college of fering the S/U course. . The col lege shall set the deadline (no later th an the last day of classes for the term) for the student to decide if he /she wishes to take the course on an S/U basis. 2. The instructor shall assign fi nal letter grades A, B, C, D, F, or I, but wi ll transmit to the Registrar \"S\" or \"U\" consisten t with the following: a. Letter grade, A, B, C, or C- shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"S.\" b. Letter grades D or F shall be equivalent to a letter grade of \"U.\" \"S\" and \"U\" grades are not computed in the student's GPA. Grade Forgiveness Policy USF St. Petersburg's forgiveness policy permits an undergraduate to repeat a course and have the repeated grade computed in his/her GPA in place of the original gr ade, providing the repeat grade is posted as \"D-\" or higher (exception - see Honors at Graduation)and is higher than the first grade. Normally, grade forgiveness may only be applied to a specific co urse that a student chooses to repeat. No course taken on the S/U gr ade basis may have the grade forgiveness applied. Under unusual circumstances, a different but similar course may be used if the substitu te course has been previous ly approved by the college dean and is on file in the Office of the Registrar. The grade forgiveness policy cannot apply to any course in which the grade of \"FF\" has been recorded. Any undergraduate or non-degree-seeking student who wishes to implement grade forgiveness must: 1. Complete a \"Grade Forgiveness Request Fo rm\" (available in the Office of the Registrar) for each course to be repeated. 2. Adhere to the following conditions: a. A limitation of applying grade forgiv eness to three USF system courses with no more than one repeat per course. b. With prior approval of the college dean, a course different fr om a course on the approved list may be substituted in the fol lowing cases: . The substitute course is a change in pref ix, number, hours, or title, but not a subs tantive change in content from the original course. . The substitute course replaces a course no longer offered by the institution. . c. The repeated course must be taken under the standard grading sy stem (A-F) and the latest grade must be posted as \"D-\" or hig her (grades of S/U are not permitted) and be higher than th e first grade. . d. All grades remain on the transcript. Th e original course grade will be annotated wi th \"E\" to indicate that the course has subsequently been repeated and the original grade is not computed in the GPA. . e. Individual colleges may have further restrictions; therefore, the student should consult with his/her academic advisor. This policy is applicable to undergraduate and non-degree-seek ing students only, and applies to 1000-to-5000-level courses. Onc e students have been awarded a bachelor's degree from USF St. Pete rsburg, they may not repeat a co urse and be forgiven the origin al grade, taken prior to graduation. The policy applies only to courses taken originally at an y USF system and repeated at a USF system institution. Good Standing USF St. Petersburg students will be considered in good standing if they are currently enrolled or eligible to return to USF St. Petersburg. Academic Record The student's academic record shall not be changed after the student has graduated. Academic Probation and Academic Dism issal for Undergraduate Students The first time an undergraduate student's USF grade point averag e (GPA) falls below a cumulative 2.00, the student will be plac ed on Academic Probation (AP). From the beginning of academic probation, the student mu st maintain at least a 2.00 GPA each term, and may not totally wi thdraw from any term without cause. Any student who withdraws from all classes after the fifth day of classes while on Academic Prob ation will be academically dism issed. Once on Academic Probation, academic advising prior to registra tion is mandatory until the student is removed from probationary status. The student may remain on Academic Probation indefinitely as long he/she maintains a GPA of 2.00 or greater each term. If at any time while on Academic Probation, the student's term GPA fa lls below a 2.00, the student will be academically dismissed fro m the University. Once academically dismissed, a student may only return to USFSP under the University's Academic Renewal Policie s. If academically dismissed from USFSP, a student may not return to USFSP as a non-degree seeking student. The determination and notification of probationary status or acad emic dismissal will be made by the Registrar's Office on the student's academic record. A student who attends another college or university following academic dismissal will be classified as a transfer student and readmission will be ba sed on the total record accumulated from all colleges and universities attended. If a student is academically dismissed or falls below a 2.00 GPA from USFSP and subs equently receives a BA/BS from another four-year institution, that student, when accepted to the University with the post-b accalaureate status, will have his/her acad emic record cleared. Academic Renewal USF St. Petersburg recognizes that not every student's academic re cord is flawless and that many times students get off to such a poor start that their futu re academic opportunities are limited. USF St. Peters burg can offer many of those students a second c hance. The University's Academic Renewa l policy allows students previously dismissed from the university, to renew their pursuit of baccalaureate degrees without th e responsibility of having to overcome the entire burden of low grades and low grade- point-averages. To facilitate this opportun ity, students who qualify for Academic Rene wal may, with the approval of the Academi c Regulations Committee, have portions of their academic record ex cluded from calculation of their grade point averages (GPAs). T he entire academic record, however, will contin ue to be reflected on their transcripts ev en though a selected portion will not be counted in their GPAs. Academic Renewal students are admitted with the same terms of academic probation and dismissal as other undergraduate students. Academic Renewal will only be applied to a student's ac ademic record one time at USFSP. Academic Renewal I (ARI) - Students who have been academica lly dismissed or former students returning with a USF GPA below 2.00 may petition the Academic Regulations Committ ee to return to the University under AR-I if they have been away from the Universi ty for at least one academic semester A studen t will be considered for reinstatement to the University under Academic Renewal I if they complete all after completing all requirements for a Bachelor's degree, or an Asso ciate of Arts degree or an Arts degree equiva lent (including general education, and Gordon Ru le requirements) at a two- or four-year college. Under the Academic Renewal I policy , students will return to the Univ ersity with a 0.00 GPA and Academic Renewal I st udents will enter USF as juniors and their USF grade point average will be calculated from that point forward. While AR-I is best utilized by students who have earned less than 60 credit hours, it is not restricted to those students. Students with mo re than 60 credit hours returning to the University under AR-I w ill likely incur excess hours and associated monetary penalty. In order to graduate following re-admission under AR-I, all degree requirem ents must be met, and a minimum of 30 credit hours must be taken in residence at USF. Students who are admitted under AR-I may be excluded from admission to limited access programs and will not be considered for University Honors at graduation unless they m eet the criteria using all grades earned. Academic Renewal II (ARII) - ARII is available to students who were academically dismissed and have 60 or more earned credits from USFSP or other institutions of higher education. These Students may be readmitted to the University under Academic Renewal II i f they are able to provide convincing eviden ce indicating they are likely to be succe ssful. Generally, such students will have be en engaged in successful non-academic activities such as work or military service for at least one year or will have demonstrated recent academic success defined minimally as the co mpletion of at least 12 semester hours wi th a GPA greater than or equal to 2.00, no grades below C, no course withdrawals, an d the CLAS requirement being met. In order to be considered for readmission under ARII , students must submit a request to the Academic Regulations Commi ttee, who will, make a final decision regarding readmission. Following readmission under Academic Renewa l II, students will have their prior USF GP A set to 2.00. In order to graduate, stud ents must have a cumulative GPA of 2.00 and at least 30 USFSP credit hours with grades of C or higher, including a minimum of 15 USF credits earned following readmission under ARII. Students re-admitted under ARII may be excl uded from admission to limited access prog rams. Further, students who exercise the Academic Renewal II policy will not be consid ered for University Honors at graduation unless they meet the criteria using all g rades earned. College Policies for Academic Progress Colleges may determine and implement standards of academic progre ss for undergraduate students (majors in the college) in addit ion to those established by USF St. Petersburg. Students who do not meet the academic standards of progress set by their colleges w ill be placed on probation and may be disenrolled. The college dean is responsible for implem enting standards of academic progress and for notifying students of their probationary or disenrollment status. Colleges may restrict the course selections and the numbers of hours a student may take that do not apply toward completion of degree requirements. Students who exc eed this limit may have part or a ll of their registration canceled. Colleges are responsible for publicizing and students are responsi ble for knowing their college's policies for academic progres s. Class Standing A student's class is determined by the number of credits he/she has earned without relation to his/her GPA. 0C Unclassified Non-degree-seeking students 1F Freshman 0 through 29 semester hours passed 2S Sophomore 30 through 59 semester hours passed 3J Junior 60 through 89 semester hours passed 4R Senior 90 or more semester hours passed; however, no baccalaureate degree earned here or elsewhere 5B Baccalaureat e degree-holder working on a second undergraduate program or degree 6M Graduate student admitted to Master's Degree Program 6A Graduate student admitted to Specialist Degree Program 6C Graduate student Admitted to Candidacy 6D Gr aduate student admitted to a Doctoral Degr ee Program 7A-7D 1st-4th year professiona l program (M.D.) or post-doctoral status Change of Major All undergraduate students desiring to change their major should consult the Academic Advising Center. Administrative Holds A student may be placed on administrative hold by failure to meet obligations to the Univ ersity. When a student is on administrative hold, he/she may not be allowed to register, rece ive a diploma, or receive a transc ript. Settlement of financial accounts must be made at the University Cashier's Office. Each student placed on administrati ve hold should determine from the Office of the Registrar which office placed him/her in this status and clear the obligation with that respective office. Student Information Changes Notifications regarding changes of address, name, residency, and citizenship should be filed prom ptly with the Office of the Registrar. Final Examinations Examinations in academic subjects are, for most courses, an in tegral part of the learning proc ess and one part of a procedure for evaluating student performance and determining grades. USF St. Petersburg requires certain standards for the examination process in order to protect the academic integrity of courses and the best inte rests of both the studen t and the instructor. Testing in General: In each ac ademic course, the student is expected to undergo a meaningful testing and evaluation that will reveal the student's intellectual growth in the subject matter covered or otherwis e reflect the achievement of the course objectives. The instructor has the responsibility of maintaining a fair an d impartial testing and examination procedure, has the right to define and structure the testing process, and shall not be restrict ed as to form, style or content of the examination. It is th e policy of USF St. Petersburg that all stud ents facing an examination (of any type) shall have equal advance notice of the form and content of that examination. The University regards the ro utine use of all or part of th e same formal examination for successive academic terms as unsound poli cy except when used with adequate safe guards such as a random selection of questions from a large pool. Comprehensive Final Examinations: The last 6 days of the Fall an d Spring semesters shall be set aside for final examinations, and any comprehensive final examination must be given during this designated period. If a segment examination is given in lieu of a comprehensive examination, the segment examination must be given in the period designated during final examination week. The period of two hours shall be allotted for each final examination. If a student has a direct conflict of scheduled examinations or has three or more examinations scheduled on the same day, the student may petition the appropriate instructor to reschedule one of the student's examinations. The final examinat ion schedule shall be published in the same manner and place as the Schedule of Classes. Regional Chancellor's Scholar List Full-time USFSP undergraduate students wh o demonstrate superior academic achievem ent during one semester will be honored on a \"Regional Chancellor's Scholar List.\" To be eligible for the Regional Chancellor' s Scholar List, a student must complete a t least 12 USF credit hours of graded (A-F) courses, receive no in complete grades during the semester and earn a 4.0 semester GPA Dean's List Full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate superior acad emic achievement during one semester will be honored on a \"Dean's List\". To be eligible for the Dean's List, a student must be in a 'pool' (defined hereaf ter) and must complete 12 hours of graded (A-F) USF system courses with no incomplete grades during the semester. The Dean's List shall consist of the fewer of: 1 ) the upper 10% of the enrollment of the colle ge or 2)students in the college with a USF 3.5 GPA or above (ties at the 90th percentile will be incl uded in the group). The dean of the college in which the student is majoring or the Vice Chancellor of Academ ic Affairs for the undeclared students will recognize this academic ho nor. Students who believe they are elig ible should contact their academic advisor. Academic Regulations Committee The USF St. Petersburg Academic Regulations Committee (ARC) is re sponsible for serving as an un dergraduate academic board for students who are designated as USF St. Peters burg students and wish to se cure waiver or modification of an Undergraduate Academ ic Policy. The Committee is authorized to ac t both individually and collectively in responding to student petitions. Requests for exceptions to college-level ac ademic regulations are subjec t to the review and recommendation by the Dean of the college involved, not the ARC. Since any student has the right to appeal academic decisions, th ere is also an Academic Appeal Board to hear and adjudicate appeals to ARC decisions. The ARC Appeal Board is the final poin t of petition for a student - th ere is no higher authority. Students should contact their Academic Advisor if considering an ARC Petition. Student Academic Grievance Procedures I. Introduction (Purpose and Intent) The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida system an opportunity for objective review of fact s and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. Such review will be accomplished in a collegial, non-judicial at mosphere rather than an adversarial one, and shall allow the parties involved to participate. All parties will be ex pected to act in a profes sional and civil manner. The procedures that follow are designed to ensure objective and fair treatment of both students and instructors. These guidelin es are meant to govern all colleges, however, as individual USF institutions and the appr opriate colleges may have different level s of authority or titles, each student must obtain the specific designations used by each entity for levels of authority and titles in this process. In the case of grade appeals, the University reserves the right to change a student's grade if it is determined at the conclusi on of the grievance process that the grade given was incorrect. In such circumstances, the Dean or Vice Chancellor for Academic Affai rs may file an administrative grade change. The term \"incorrect \" means the assigned grade was based on something other than performance in the course, or that the assignment of the grade wa s not consistent with the criteria for awarding of grades as described in the course syllabus or other materials distributed to the student. In the case of all other academic grievances, t he University reserves the right to determine the final outcome based on the procedures detailed herein. In the case of Academic Integrity (USF Sy stem Regulation 3.027) violations, these St udent Academic Grievance Procedures apply and include an Academic Integrity Review Process at th e College Level as described in section III below. II. Terms and Guidelines An \"academic grievance\" is a claim that a specific academic deci sion or action that affects that student's academic record or status has violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students. Grievances may relate to su ch decisions as the assignment of a grade seen by the student as incorrect or the dismissal or failure of a student for his or her action(s). Academic gr ievances will not deal with general student complaints. \"Instructor\" shall mean any classroom instructor, thesis/dissert ation/directed study supervisor, committee member or chair, or counselor/advisor who interacts with the student in an academic environment. \"Department Chair/Director\" shall mean the academic head of a coll ege department or the director of a program\u2014or in all cases a \"Department's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances. \"Dean\" shall mean a College Dean or th e equivalent as indicated\u2014or in all ca ses a \"Dean's designee\" appointed to handle academic grievances for the unit. \"Time\" shall mean \"academic time,\" that is, periods when Univer sity classes are in session. The person vested with authority at the appropriate level may extend any of the time periods contained herein for good cause. Any extensions must be communicated in writing to all parties. For the purposes of this policy, each step shall be afforded three (3) weeks as a standard time limit. When a department considers a grievance according to published departme ntal procedures approved by the College Dean and Regional Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, as pe rtinent, the time line specif ied in this academic unit's procedures will govern the process and no additional notice of time extension is needed. \"Written communication\" shall mean communication by hard copy to the recipient's address of record. The \"burden of proof\" shall be upon the student such that the st udent challenging the decision, ac tion or grade assigned has th e burden of supplying eviden ce that proves that the instructor 's decision was incorrect, in all cases except alleged violations o f academic integrity. In cases where the issu e is academic integrity, the burden of pr oof shall be upon the instructor. In consid ering grievances, decisions will be based on the preponderance of the evidence. Neither party shall be entitled to bring \"l egal representation\" to any actual grievanc e proceeding as this is an internal revie w of an academic decision. As some Colleges may use different titles, the next level that applies to that Colleg e shall be substituted. III. Statement of Policy A. Resolution at the Department Level 1 The student shall first make a reasonable effort to resolve his or her grievance with the instru ctor concerned, with the date of the incident triggering the start of the process (i.e. the i ssuance of a grade; the receipt of an assignment) and the instru ctor shall accommodate a reasonable request to discu ss and attempt to resolve this issue. 2 If the situation cannot be resolv ed or the instructor is not available, the stud ent shall file a notifica tion letter within thr ee weeks of the triggering incident to the department Chairperson/ Director. This shall be a concise written statement of particula rs and must include information pertaining to how, in the student's op inion, University policies or procedures were violated. The department Chairperson/Director shall provide a copy of this statement to the instructor. 3 The department Chairperson/Director shall discuss the statement jointly or individua lly with the student and the instructor to see if the grievance can be resolved. If the department main tains its own grievance procedure,* it should be applied at this point. If the grievance can be resolved, the Chairperson/Director shall provide a statement to that effe ct to the student and the inst ructor with a copy to the College Dean. *Departments may develop their own formal procedures for cons idering grievances. Such procedures must be considered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and publis hed on the Department's web site. When suc h procedures exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Department Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to rem edy the situation. If the Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean. The student may, in such cases, request the College Level review as outlined in these University procedures. 4. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the department Chai r/Director shall notify both the student and the instructor, informing the student of his/her right to file a written re quest within three weeks to advance the grievance to the College Level. The instructor may file a written response to the grievance petition . Upon receipt of th e student's request to move the process to the College Level and the instructor's response to the grievance (if provided), the Chairperson/Director shall immediately notify the College De an of the grievance, provid ing copies of the student's initiating grievance statement, any inst ructor's written response to the grieva nce, and the written request from the student to have the process advanced to the College Level (which ma y include additional responsive or final statements by the student). Should the student not file a written requ est to move the grievance to the College Level within the prescribed time, the grievance will end. If the grievance co ncerns the Chairperson/Director or other officials of the department, the student has a right to bypass the department al process and proceed direct ly to the College Level. B. Resolution at the College Level 1. Upon receipt of the grievanc e, the College Dean shall either determine that the matter is not an academic grievance and dismiss it or within three weeks sha ll establish an Academic Grievance Committee. The membership of the Committee shall be constituted as follows: a. Three (3) faculty members and two (2) students (undergraduate or graduate as appropriate to the case) shall be selected from the college by the Dean. b. Wherever practical, the Committee shall not include members of the faculty or students of the department directly involved w ith the grievance, or faculty or students of the student's major department. The student or faculty may address the committee. However, if requested by the committee; facu lty or students from the department involv ed with the grievance or from the student 's major department may provide expert or other relevant testimony in the proceedings. 2. The Committee will operate in the following manner: a. The Committee Chairperson will be appointed by the College De an from among the three facu lty members appointed to the Committee. b. The Committee Chairperson shall be responsible for scheduling meetings, overseeing the deliberations of the committee and ensuring that full and fair consideration is provided to all parties. The Committee Chairperson shall vote on committee decisio ns only when required to break a tie. c. In Committee reviews involving Academic Integrity, the following Ac ademic Integrity Review Pr ocess shall be followed: The Committee Chairperson shall notify the student and in structor of the date and time of the meeting. The student and instructor may submit a li st of questions to the Committee Chairper son to be answered by the student and instructor. If submitted, the questions will be disseminated by the Committee Chairperson and the Committee Chairperson will ensure that the questions are answered in writing and submitted for review by the Committee, student, and instructor before the initial meeting. The student or instructor may request to attend a Committee meeting as designated by the Chairperson to present any final statement to the Committee and either may be present during th e other's final statement. Neither the student nor instructor may be present during the deliberations. The student or instructor may bring an advi sor (not to act as legal counsel or to participate in the meetings) to the meeting. Students shall be permitted to remain in the course or program during the Ac ademic Integrity Review Process. However, if the student is in a clinical or internship setting, the student may be removed from such setting until the issue of Academic Integrity is resolved. In such cases, the program will attempt to identify an alternat ive educational option to the clinical or internship to enable the student to co ntinue progressing in the program. d. All deliberations shall be in private and held confidential by a ll members of the Committee. The recommendation of the Committee shall be based on the factual evidence presented to it. e. Within three weeks of the Committee appointment, the Commi ttee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the student, instructor, department Chairperson/Director or Program Director , and College Dean a report of the findings and a recommended resolution. f. Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendatio n, the College Dean shall prov ide a decision in writing to all parties. g. The student or the instructor may appeal the decision of the College Dean to the University Leve l only if the decision of the College Dean is contrary to the recommendation of the Committ ee or if there is a procedural violation of these Student Acad emic Grievance Procedures. Such an appeal must be made in writing to the Vi ce Chancellor for Academic Af fairs within three weeks of receipt of the decision from the College De an. Otherwise, the College Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appea l within the University. C. Resolution at the Univ ersity Level The Vice Chancellor fo r Academic Affairs at USF St. Petersburg may delegate authority to a designated academic administrator at USF St. Petersbu rg to hear the appeal at the University level. 1 The student or the instructor may appeal at the University Leve l within three weeks of the rece ipt of a decision made at the College Level, when (1) the decision by a College Dean is contrary to the recommenda tion of a college Grie vance Committee, or ( 2) there is cause to think a procedural violat ion of these University Academic Grievance Procedures has been made. Within three we eks of receipt of the appeal to the decision, the Vice Chancellor fo r Academic Affairs in consultati on with the Faculty Senate and the Student Senate, shall appoint an Appeals Committee consisting of three faculty members drawn from the University Undergraduate Council or Graduate Council (as appropriate), and two st udents, undergraduate or graduate (as appropriate). 2 The structure, functions and operating procedures of the Appeals Committee will be the sa me as those of the College Committee (i.e. chaired by one of the appointed faculty members appointed by the Vice Chancello r for Academic Affairs who will not vote except in the case of a tie, having no representation from either party's resp ective departments, developing a recommendat ion to the Vice Chancellor fo r Academic Affairs. 3 Within three weeks of the appointment, the Committee Chairperson shall deliver in writing to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs a report of the findings of the Committee and a recommended resolution. 4 Within three weeks of receipt of the Committee recommendation, the Vice Chancellor for Acad emic Affairs shall provide a decision in writing to all parties. 5 If the Vice Chancellor's decision is that a grade change is merited, the Vice Ch ancellor shall initiate th e grade change on the authority of the Provost and so inform all parties. In all academic grievance appeals, the Vice Chancellor's decision is final and not subject to further appeal within the University. These procedures shall take effect commen cing (February 10, 2009) and shall supersede all other academic grievance procedures currently in effect. * Departments may develop their own formal procedures fo r considering grievances. Such procedures must be con sidered and approved by the College Dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, and published on the Department's web site. When such procedures exist, the Department's examination of the grievance will unfold as specified in the procedures. If the Departmental process upholds the student's grievance, the Depa rtment Chair will work with the College, the student and the instructor to remedy the situation. If th e Department does not uphold the grievance, the Chair will report the fact to the Dean . The student may, in such cases, request the College Leve l review as outlined in these university procedures. Procedures for Alleged Academic Dishonesty or Disruption of Academic Process Alleged violations of academic integrity or alleged disruptions of acad emic process will be handled initially by the instructor , who will discuss the incident with the st udent. It must be noted that the Faculty Senate considers the traditional relationship between student and faculty member as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. If the instructor observes the alleged dishonesty occurring during an examination, he/she should, with discretion , notify the student of the fact before the student leaves the examination. In all cases, the instructor must attempt to schedule a meeting with th e student to discuss the alleged dishonesty or disruptions. After the discussion, if the student and inst ructor have reached a mutual agreement as to the solution, the instructor shall fi le a statement with the College Dean, responsible for the course outl ining the facts of the incident and the agreed-upon solution si gned by both the instructor and student. A copy of this statement sha ll be given to the student. If no solution is reached, the matt er should be referred to the College Dean, for attempt at resolution. Integrity of Students 1. Fundamental principles: Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of Sout h Florida system's (University/USF) commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its Univer sity community. Academic integrity is grou nded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, respect and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one's own efforts. Knowledge and maintenance of the academic standards of honesty and integrity as set forth by the University are the responsibility of the entire acad emic community, including the instruction al faculty, staff and students. 2. General Policies: The following policies and procedures apply to all students, in structional faculty and staff who participate in administration of academic classes, programs and research at the University of So uth Florida St. Petersburg. This regulation asserts fairness in that it requires notice to any student accused of a violation of ac ademic integrity and provides a directive for discussion between the instructor and student to seek a fair and equitable resolution. If a fair resolution is not acco mplished in this discussion, th is regulation allows the student continued rights of due process under the academic grievance procedures based upon the preponderance of the evidence.

These sanctions are intended as general guidelines for the academic community with examples cited belo w for each level of violation. These exampl es are not to be considered all-inclusive . It is recommended that the instructor forw ard a concise written statement describing th e academic dishonesty of an incident wit h its particulars to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for violations in Levels Two through Four. These records will be maintained until graduation or until they are of no further admi nistrative value. This will enable better handling of multiple violations. (a) Level One Violations Level One violations may occur because of inex perience or lack of knowledg e of principles of academic integrity on the part of persons committing the violation. These violations address incident s when intent is qu estionable and are likely to involve a sm all fraction of the total course work, are not extensive, and/or occur on a minor assignment. The following are examples: 1. Working with another student on a la boratory or other homework assignment when such work is prohibited. 2. Failure to footnote or give proper acknowledgment in an ex tremely limited section of an a ssignment. Recommended sanctions for Level One violations are listed below: Reduction or no credit given for the original assignment. An assigned paper or research project on a relevant topic. A make-up assignment at a more difficult leve l than the original assignment. Required attendance in a non-credit workshop or seminar on ethics or related subjects.

Recommended sanctions for Level Two violations are listed below: Failing grade for the assignment involved with the grade in the course determined in the normal manner. Failing grade for the co urse, which may be an \"F\" or \" FF\" on the intern al transcript. (c) Level Three Violations Level Three violations are those that go beyond Level One or Two violations and that affect a major or essential portion of wor k done to meet course requirements, or involve premeditation, or ar e preceded by one or more violations at Levels One and/or Two. Examples include: 1 Copying on examinations. 2 Plagiarizing major portions of a written assignment. 3 Acting to facilitate copying during an exam. 4 Using prohibited materials, e.g. books, note s, or calculators during an examination. 5 Collaborating before an exam to de velop methods of exchanging information and implementation thereof. 6 Altering examinations for the purposes of regrading. 7 Acquiring or distributing an examination from un authorized sources prior to the examination. 8 Presenting the work of another as one's own. 9 Using purchased term paper or other materials. 10 Removing posted or reserved material, or preven ting other students from having access to it. 11 Fabricating data by inventing or deliberately altering material (this includes citing \"sources\" that are not, in fact, sources. 12 Using unethical or improper means of acquiring data. Recommen ded sanctions for Level Three violations are listed below: Failing grade for the course with a designat ion of \"FF\" on student's internal transc ript. Possible suspension from the Univer sity for one semester. (d) Level Four Violations Level Four violations represent the most serious br eaches of intellectual hone sty. Examples of Level Four violations include: 1. All academic infractions committed after return from suspension for a previous academic honesty violation. 1 Infractions of academic honesty in ways similar to criminal activity (such as forging a grade form, stealing an examination from a professor or from a Univer sity office; buying an examinatio n; or falsifying a transcript to secure entry into the Univer sity or change the record of work done at the University) . 2 Having a substitute take an examination or taking an examination for someone else. 3 Fabrication of evidence, falsification of data, quoting direct ly or paraphrasing without ac knowledging the source, and/or presenting the ideas of another as one's own in a senior thesis, within a master's thesis or do ctoral dissertation, in scholarl y articles submitted to refereed journals, or in other work represented as one's own as a graduate student. 4 Sabotaging another student's work through actions designed to prevent the student from successfully completing an assignment. 5 Willful violation of a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. Recommended sanctions for Level Four violations are listed below: The typical sanction for all Level Four viol ations is permanent academic dismissal from the University with the designation of \"Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty\" to be placed permanently on a student' s external transcript. (5) Additional Undergraduate Guid elines for Academic Dishonesty: (a) Grade Assignment An \"FF\" grade assigned to indicate academ ic dishonesty is reflected only on internal records an d prevents the student from repeating the course using the Grade Forgiveness Policy. Students with any \"FF\" grade on record will not be eligible for honors at graduation. If a student who has been accused of academic dishonesty drop s the course, the student's regist ration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes an y instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected by the instructor until after th e student has dropped or completed the course. Notification to the student of the \"FF\" gr ade and the option of appeal concerning the alleged acad emic dishonesty shall be the responsibility of the instructor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). Notice that a student has been dismissed for reasons of academ ic dishonesty will be reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Righ ts and Responsibilities as a student conduct violation. (b) Multiple Violations: 1. For the first \"FF\" recorded in an undergraduate student's USF academic record, the student will receive a letter from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs informing him or her of being placed on \"Academic Dishonesty Warning\" for the remainder of enrollment at USF and of appeal rights for the \"FF\" grade. 2. For the second \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be suspended for one full semester and readmitt ed only after writing a clear statement indicating remorse, understanding of the seriousness of the offense, and understandin g of the importance of integrity in all areas, including academic work. A letter informing him or her of this action and appeal rights will be sent from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. 3. For the third \"FF\" recorded, the undergraduate student will be permanently dismissed from the University for violations of academic integrity and with notice of that dismissa l as a part of the formal record and transcript. 4. The maximum penalty for receipt of any \"FF\" grade may be permanent dismissal from the University for violations of academic integrity and with a notice of that dismissal as a part of the student's formal record and transcript. (6) Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students:2 The Graduate School holds academic integr ity in the highest regard. Gr aduate students are responsible for being aware of and complying with University Regulations and Po licies and must conduct themselves accordingly. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty will depend on the seriousne ss of the offense and may range from the receipt of: An \"F\" or \"Zero\" grade on the subject paper, lab report, etc. An \"F\" in the course or activity in which credit may be earned. An \"FF\" in the course (leading to expulsion from the University). Academic Dismissal for any violations of acad emic dishonesty polici es or regulations. Possible revocation of the degr ee or Graduate Certificate followi ng a thorough investigation. Graduate students who are assigned an \"FF\" grade will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. Procedures regarding Ac ademic Dishonesty and Academic Dismissal may be found on the Graduate School website. (7) Additional Graduate Guidel ines for Academic Dishonesty: If a graduate student who has been accused of academic dishones ty drops the course, the student's registration in the course will be reinstated until the issue is resolved. Any assigned grade may be changed to an \"FF\", \"F\", or other grade depending on the instructor's decision or the ultimate resolution of an academic grievance procedure. This includes any instance of academic dishonesty that is not detected until aft er the student has dropped or completed the course. Notification to the graduate student of the \"FF\" grade and the option of appeal concerning th e alleged academic dishonesty and academic dismissal remains with the in structor and/or department chair (See Student Academic Grievance Procedures). A graduate student who has been dismissed for reasons of acad emic dishonesty will have this reflected on the student's transcript with the formal notation: Dismissed for Academic Dishonesty. More serious violations of academic integrity may be referred to the Office of Students Righ ts and Responsibilities as a student conduct violation. (8) Appeals: Undergraduate and Graduate Once the initial violation of the academic integrity regulation has been documented and fairly discussed by the student and the instructor, the student may appeal the inst ructor's decision that a violation has oc curred. At that point the student will foll ow the procedures outlined in the University of South Florida's student Academic Grievance Procedure Policy. For academic integrity violations that are reviewed at the depart ment and college levels, the respective commi ttees will consider all evidence availab le to determine if the instructor's decision was correct. The stud ent's ability to proceed within an academic program while an Academic Grievance is in process wi ll be determined by the individual academic program chair/director. 1 These policies apply to Undergraduate Students, even if taking graduate coursework. Graduate st udents are students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non-degr ee seeking students taking graduate coursework (such students should refer to Section IV Violations and Sanctions for Graduate Students) 2 These policies apply to Graduate Students (students admitted to a graduate degree program or graduate certificate, and/or non-degree seeking students taking graduate coursework). Underg raduate students should refer to Section III Violations and Sanctions for Undergraduate Students) Authority: Art. IX, Sec. 7, Fla. Constitution and Resoluti ons issued by the FL Board of Governors History-New 12-11-08. Disruption of Academic Process (1) Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educ ational process. Although disruptive student conduct is already prohibited by the University of South Florid a system (University/USF) Student Code of Conduct, the purpose of this regulation i s to clarify what constitutes disrupti ve behavior in the academic se tting; what actions faculty and relevant academic officers may t ake in response to disruptive conduct; and the au thority of the Office of Stud ent Rights and Responsibilities (or designated office ha ndling conduct issues in Student Affairs) to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings against students for disruptive conduct. (2) Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general cond uct of a student in a classroom or other ac ademic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) Directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, su ch as noisy distractions, persis tent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discus sion, or general Univer sity operations, or (b) Presents a danger to the health, safety or well-bein g of self or other persons. References to classroom or academic area include all academic settings (live or online, and including field experiences). References to Instructor include the course instructor, USF St. Petersburg faculty, administrators, and staff. Misconduct occurring in other campus areas on University premis es or which adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of its mission is already prohibited by the Studen t Code of Conduct and will be handled by those procedures. Academic discussion that includes disagreement with the course instructor during times when the instructor permits discussion i s not in itself disruptive behavior and is not prohibited. Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental health di sorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, they are he ld to the same standards of conduct as any student. The following applies to all campuses of the University of South Florida system; however, non-substantive procedural modifications to reflect the particular ci rcumstances of each separately accredited USF System institution are permitted. Information concerning these procedures is available through the Student Affairs Office. (3) Procedures for Handling Disr uption of Academic Process. (a) General Guidelines for Instructor: 1. If a student is disruptive, the Instruct or may ask the student to stop the disrupti ve behavior and/or warn the student that such disruptive behavior can result in academic and/or disciplinary action. Alleged disruptions of the academ ic process will be hand led initially by the Instructor, who will discuss the incident with the student whenever po ssible. It must be noted that the Facult y Senate considers the traditional relationship between student and instruct or as the primary means of settling disputes that may arise. 2. The Instructor is authorized to ask a st udent to leave the classroom or academic ar ea and desist from the disruptive behavio r if the Instructor deems it necessary. If the Instru ctor does this, s/he will send an Academic Disruption Incident Report within 48 hou rs simultaneously to: a. The department chair, b. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), c. The Office of Student Rights and Respon sibilities (OSRR) or the sepa rately accredited institution's/regional campus' designa ted office in Student Affairs, and d. The student. If the situation is deemed an emergency or circumstances requ ire more immediate action, the instructor should notify the appropriate law enforcement agency, OSRR and other authorities as soon as possible. Any filed Incident Report can, and should, be updated if new information pe rtinent to the situation is obtained. 3. An Instructor may also further exclude the student from th e classroom or other academic ar ea pending resolution of the matter. If the Instructor recommends exclusion (temporary or permanent) from the classroom pending resolution, the student must be informed of the exclusion before the next sche duled class (either by phone, email or in person). That notice must: a. Inform the student of the exclusion, b. Inform the student of his/her right to request an expedited review of the exclusion within two days to the Chair of the Department. If such academic exclusion occurs, and if the student requests a review, the Chair of the Department shall review the exclusion within two days of the date the student requests the review and decide if the st udent can return to the specific class and/or any academic setting. This decision may be appealed in writing by the student within two (2) da ys to the Dean of the college or the institutional designee (as appropriate) for review and de cision within two days. Any deci sion rendered at that point must be in writing and will serve as the final an d binding academic decision of the University. Each academic decision or sanction must be communicated to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities or the separately accredited institution's/regional camp us' designated office as soon as possible. (b) Possible Academic Sanctions and Grading Guidelines: Authority of an Instructor and the appropriate Chair or Assistant/Associate De an may result in any of the following sanctions: Warning to the student. Voluntary withdrawal by the student from the class(es). Temporary exclusion and/or permanent dismissal from the inst ructor's classroom or academic area, program, or college, pending an expedited appeal. Academic sanction, including assignment of a final grade. -- If the final determination is a di smissal from class, the grade assigned for the class will depend on the student's status at th e time of dismissal. If the student had a passing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned for the course. If the student had a failing grade in the class at the time of dismissal, a grade of \"F \" will be assigned for the course. These gr ades will become a part of the student's permanent record. In addition, if the academic disruption resu lts in dismissal from more th an the classroom or academic area of the incident, this grading policy may be applied in all classes affected. (c) Documentation and Academic Disruption Incident Report: Instructors should be aware that notes of the dates, times, witnesses and details of the incidents of disruption and the impact of the disruption on those pres ent may be important in any future proceedings which may be necessary. Referrals to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or designated office in Student Affairs require written documentation containing factual and descriptive information. The student is entitled to see this documentation. The Academic Disruption Incident Report must be submitted by hardcopy (not email) simult aneously within 48 hours to: 1. The department chair, 2. The Assistant/Associate Dean of the College (as determined by the College), 3. The Office of Student Rights and Respon sibilities or the separately accredited in stitution's regional campus' designated off ice in Student Affairs, and 4. The student. The form can be downloaded from the designated website in St udent Affairs or completed by way of memorandum containing the following information: Date of report Student's name USF Student ID number Instructor's name Instructor's phone number Instructor's e-mail Title of course, course number an d section Date/time/location of incident Detailed summary of the incident, including a description of the disruptive behavi or Witnesses Action, if any, taken by the instructor (e.g. , student warned, asked to leave the class, etc.) Recommende d course of action and reasons for this recommendation Instructor's signature (d) Possible Disciplinary Sanctions for Conduct by the Office of Stud ent Rights and Responsibilities: Upon receipt of the Academic Disruption Incident Report or other academic referral for disruptive conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or desi gnated office in Student Affairs may initia te the disciplinary process resulting in the imposition of any of the following sa nctions in addition to any academic sanctions imposed (in section b): Educational sanctions to include but not limited to educational programs/classes and written assignment Disciplinary probation Provisional suspension Suspension Restriction from certain or all class(es), program, college, residence hall, or any part or all of USF System institutions. Expulsion When an incident is being reviewed by OSRR or designated office in Student Affairs for possible disciplinary sanctions, current provisions affecting the student's academic status (temporary or otherwise) will be communicat ed by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or design ated office in Student Affairs to th e Instructor and appropriate academic administrators/instructors responsible for th e student's current academic standing as soon as possible, but within two weeks of the reported incident. Only final disciplina ry sanctions that affect the academic st atus of the student will be communicated to the Instructor(s) and appropriate academic administra tors after the disciplinary process is complete.

Exit requirements will provide stud ents with an opportunity during their ju nior and senior years at USF St. Petersburg to inte grate their knowledge within the context of liberal arts. Courses that satisfy the ex it requirements will, where appropriate, incorporate considerations of values and ethics; internat ional and environmental perspect ives; race and ethnicity; and gender. By their junior and senior years, students will have a foundation in liberal arts and be better able to reflect upon ethical issues in a constructive way. Students s eeking second baccalaureate degrees (those coded as 5B) are exempt from the liberal arts exit requirements. Students will take at least one of the Liberal Arts Exit courses outside their disciplinary cluster(s). For purposes of this po licy, the term \"discipline\" refers to the following fields: business, educ ation, fine arts, letters, natural sciences, and social science s (See list below of \"Outside the Disciplinary Cluster\" Liberal Arts Exit Courses). One of the Major Works and Major Issues courses, if tak en outside the student's major disciplinary cluster(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the consent of the instructor. Only cours es numbered 3000 or above may be used to satisfy the exit requirements. Exit requirements must be completed with USF St. Petersburg courses. All exit requirement courses will be semina r-size courses in which enrollment will be targeted at approximately 20 to 25 studen ts. These courses will be taught by regular faculty. Students majoring in the College of Education are permitted to grad uate with only six credits of Liberal Arts Exit courses, all of which may be taken in the College.

One of the Major Works and Major Issu es courses, if taken outside the student's major discipline(s), may be taken for S/U credit with the consent of the instructor. Major Works and Major Issues courses must offer the opportunity for integration of content. These courses will have a liberal arts content and, when appropriate, will contain in-d epth discussions of values and ethics, international and environmenta l perspectives, race and ethnicity, and gender. Courses may be interdisciplinary and may be team taught. This will provide stud ents with an opportunity to explore, in-depth and on an interdisciplinary basis, major topics that are impo rtant but outside of the major field of study. J. Literature and Writing (3 credit hours required): In addition, students will take three (3) se mester hours of approved exit requirement coursework in literature and writing. The se courses will allow students to read signif icant literature of the world and write at least 6,000 words. These courses also meet the Gordon Rule Communications requir ement. The writing requirement may be satisfied with assignments that include, for instance, revision and process writing. The course ma y be taken within the major if appropriate. The courses will focus on the dimensions of values and ethics, international and environmental perspectives, race and ethnicity, and gender.

Freshman English Requirement All first-time-in-college students are required to take Freshman English (a sequenti al two-semester course of study) in accorda nce with the following conditions: 1. First-time-enrolled students (a) who do not intend to take the CLEP Freshman English Test or (b) who have been notified of f ailing CLEP prior to registration and who do not intend to at tempt the exam a second time must take ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 sequentially. If a student fails the first course, he/she must repe at it before proceeding to the next Freshman English course. Students should normally take these course s during their freshman year, but these courses are high demand and it is possible that re gistration space will not always be available. 2. First-time-enrolled students (a) who have not taken CLEP prior to their arrival on campus or (b) who have failed but wish to repeat the test should attempt CLEP during their first nine (9) weeks. During this semester, they sh ould not enroll in ENC 1101. If a student either fails or doesn't attempt the CLEP examination duri ng his/her first nine (9) weeks, the student normally should t ake ENC 1101 in the following semester. In this case, the student will normally complete th e sequence by the first semester of his/ her sophomore year. These policies do not apply to first-time-enrolled students who can meet the Freshman English requirement with credit transferr ed from another institution or those with appropriate AP or IB English credit. Credit by Examination A student who feels he/she has already acquired the basic content of a course on his/her approved schedule should inquire about credit-by-examination. Some exams are offered through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Interested students should obtain additional information from their advisors or the USF System Office of Evaluation and Testing.

Candidates for graduation must have completed at least 30 hours of the last 60 hours of their un dergraduate credits in courses offered by the USF System Institution (home institution) from which the degree is to be conferred. Individual colleges and pro grams may have more stringent requirements, approved by the university, such as the number of specific courses in the major that must be completed at the institution from which a student may receive a de gree. Exceptions to the above rules may be made for students who are enrolled at other universities in USF approved exchanges, study abroad programs, co-op training programs or corresponde nce courses from the University of Fl orida.

Student's Choice of Catalog In order to graduate from USF St . Petersburg, each degree-seeking student must m eet all of the graduation requirements specifie d in the USF St. Petersburg catalog of his/her choice. A degree-seekin g student may choose any USF St. Petersburg catalog published during his/her continuous enrollment. Students who have transfer red from one Florida public inst itution to another are affected by this policy: Graduation requirements in effect at the receivin g SUS institution at the time a student enrolls at a Florida publ ic institution of higher learning shall apply to that student in the same ma nner that graduation requir ements apply to its native students provided the student has had continuous enrollment as defined in the SUS institution's catalog. At USF St. Petersburg, continuous enrollment is defined as enrolling as a degree seeking student at least one term each twelve month period. Therefore, students cannot choose a USF St. Petersburg cata log published prior to or during an academic year in which t hey did not maintain continuous enrollment. (Each catalog is considered to be published during the academic year printed on the tit le page.) If the student cannot meet all of the grad uation requirements specifie d in the catalog of his/her choice due to university deci sions and changes in policy matter, course offering, etc., appropriate substitutions will be determined by the dean of the college of the student's major. USF St. Petersburg's policies are subject to change and apply to all students regardle ss of their choice of catalog. If the stu dent's graduation requirements are affected by changes in University policies, appropriate arrangements will be made to preclude penalization of the student. Repeat Course Work The hours for a course that has been repeated may be counted on ly once toward the minimum 120 se mester hours of credit (earned hours) required for graduation. All credit hours (except when gr ade forgiveness is applied) are calculated in the GPA (See Repe at Course Surcharges.) Undergraduate Degrees USF St. Petersburg awards three undergraduat e degrees. They are the Bachelor of Scienc es, the Bachelor of Arts, and the Bachelo r of Fine Arts. Double Undergraduate Major Students may elect to graduate with two majors within the same undergraduate de gree.

File a separate request for certification for the minor in the department of the minor during the semester of graduation; 2. Apply for the minor on the \"Application for Degree,\" listing both the minor and the college responsible for the minor on the application; and 3. Have no \"I\" grade in required courses. Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The University may award a posthumous baccalaureate and master's degree to a student who was in g ood standing at the University at the time of his or her death and who had completed all substa ntive requirements for the degree. The University may also awar d baccalaureate and master's degrees in memoriam to a student who was in good standing at the University at the time of his or he r death. To award a non-thesis degree, the student would need to have co mpleted all courses required for the degree. Courses required fo r the degree, in which the student is enrolled at the time of his or her death, must have been comp leted to the satisfaction of t he faculty so that passing grades might be posted. All other requirements (e.g., gr ade point average, CLAST and other tests) must have been satisfied as well. To award a thesis degree, all courses must be completed as described above and the thes is must be sufficient ly complete to the satisfaction of the faculty so that certification of completion may be posted to the student's record. Procedures for Award of Posthumous Degrees or Degrees in Memoriam The chairperson of a department, on his or her own initiative or upon the request of the family of the student, may recommend a posthumous degree, or a degree in memoriam, by forwarding the re commendation to the respective de an of the college. If approved by the Dean, the recommendation with suppo rting documentation will be forwarded to th e Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for approval. If the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs approves the recommendation, the Office of the Registrar will be notified and the degree will be awarded at the next co mmencement ceremony or will be presented to the student's family in an appropriate setting. Diplomas for posthumous degrees will be identical to other degrees awarded in the same colleges and majors. Diplomas for Degree s in Memoriam will be prepared to read \"Bachelor of Arts in Memoriam , Bachelor of Science in Memoriam ,\" Master of Arts in Memoriam,\" etc., depending upon the degree the student was pursuing at the ti me of his or her death. Undergraduate students who have not chosen a major at the time of death will be aw arded the \"Bachelor of Arts in Memoriam.\" Honors at Graduation To be considered for honors at graduation, a baccalaureate cand idate must have completed at le ast 40 credits of graded upper le vel work at a USF System Institution and have earned a grade point average of 3.50 or higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Institution. For those students in programs requirin g multiple clinical experiences (such as Education), a baccalaur eate candidate must have completed at least 30 hours of graded upper level coursework and have earned a grade point average of 3.5 o r higher for all graded coursework attempted at a USF System Instit ution. In addition, to be eligible for honors, transfer studen ts and USF St. Petersburg students who have postse condary work elsewhere must have an overa ll GPA of 3.50 or higher counting all USF System courses as well as all tr ansferable work attempted at other institutions. The forgiveness policy at USF or other institu tions and plus/minus grades awarded at other institutions will not be appl icable in computing the GPA for honors. In addition, students w ith a record of academic dishonesty appearing on any transc ripts will not be eligible for honors at graduation. Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GP A of 3.50 but below 3.70 shall receive a diploma designatio n of cum laude (with honor). Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GP A of 3.70 but below 3.90 shall receive a diploma designatio n of magna cum laude (with high honor). Candidates with a USF System GPA of 3.50 or higher and an overall GP A of 3.90 or above shall rece ive a diploma designation of summa cum laude (with highest honor). In addition, each dean has the option to select on the basis of except ional achievement 1% of the college's graduates or 1 stud ent per semester for graduating with distinction . [For purposes of honors recognition at the commencement ceremony , students must have a 3.50 GPA before the term in which they plan to graduate to have honors recogniz ed publicly at the commencement ceremony.] NOTE: The GPA is not rounded up when determining honors at graduation (e.g., 3.69 is not the same as 3.70). Commencement USF St. Petersburg schedules two Commencement Convocations for US F graduates each year (Spring and Fall). After students have applied for their degree, early in the semester in which they inte nd to graduate, they may regist er to participate in the cerem ony online at http://usfweb2.usf.edu/co mmencement/register/ceremony_reg.asp This website will answer many of the questi ons with respect to graduate participatio n in the ceremony, including cap and gown ordering, honors and international sashes, graduate studies, care er counseling, USF alumni association and deadlines. Please re ad this information carefully and completely. Commencem ent is an exciting time for all graduates and our goal is to make your graduatio n from USF St. Petersburg a wonderful memory. Associate in Arts Certificate Requirements Upon the student's successful completion of the minimum requirements for the Associate in Arts Certificate, the University will present the student who has properly made appl ication with an appropriate certificate. 1.

In addition, the student mu st fulfill the writing and computation course requirements of 6A-10.030 prior to receivin g the Associate in Arts Certificate. 2. Application Procedure for the Associate in Arts Certificate. The Application for an Associate in Arts Certificate can be obtain ed from the Registrar's website http://www.stpt .usf.edu/admissions/forms.htm prior to th e application deadline . The deadline to apply for a degree/certificate in each semester is stated in the Academic Ca lendar in the catalog. 3. The Associate in Arts certificate must be awarded prior to the term that the stud ent becomes eligible for the baccalaureate degree. 4. Final processing for the Associate in Arts Certificate will be done after grades are processed at the end of the semester for w hich the student applied. All work, including tran sfer work taken in that se mester will be evaluated with respect to the requirement s for the Associate in Arts Certificate. 5. Any incomplete grades shown on the permanen t record of an Associate in Arts applican t at the time grades are processed will be treated as an F in the calculation of grade point average. 6. The General Education Requirements will be based on the approved University policy in effect in the catalog year the student chooses according to the University policy regarding the choi ce of catalog. The consideration of whether or not General Education Requirements are met will be made without consideration of the student's choice of major at the time he/she applies. 7. Residence credit will be broadly defined to include USF sponso red student exchange programs and the University of Florida Correspondence Division. University of Flor ida Correspondence Division credit will no t be included in the student's USF St. Petersburg grade point average. When the gr ades from USF sponsored student exchange program institutions are included in the grade point average calculation, they will al so be counted in the student's grade poin t average as work attempted at USF for th e Associate in Arts Certificate. 8. An applicant who has not been enrolled within the USF System fo r three semesters may be contacte d to ascertain whether or not that applicant meets the residency requirements. 9. In approving any application for the Associate in Arts Certificat e, satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades will be accepted accordi ng to the approved University policy in effect during the terms of the student's enrollmen t without regard for the student's declared major. Students must be aware that if th ey have taken any courses on a satisfactory /unsatisfactory basis where such grades are not acceptable by the college of the major, the students may be required to repeat particular courses for a traditional letter grade or take additional courses for a traditional letter grade to meet the college requirements. 10.All USF St. Petersburg colleges will acce pt the AA Certificate from any USF institut ion. That is, the student will be placed at least at the junior level and will be considered to have met the University's General Education Requirements. The applicability of th e courses taken by the student toward his/her major program will be determined by the college of th e student's major. Similarly, any special requirements for a student's pr ofessional certification (e.g ., Education) are not necessarily met by the Associate in Arts certificate, but could be included as part of the Genera l Education Requirements. Thus, st udents should ch eck with their colleges concerning meeting any special re quirements in an efficient manner. 11.The awarding of the Associate in Arts Certificate is posted on the permanent record but does not alter the calculation of th e grade-point average; nor does it interrupt the accumulation of the student's record. 12.Students who follow a baccalaureate degree program as recomm ended by a college will not nece ssarily be eligible for the Associate in Arts certificate prior to the completion of 90 semester hours.

The College of Arts and Sciences offe rs major fields of study as described in the following pages. Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Anthropology (ANT) on page 84 Criminology (CCJ) English English and American Literatu re (LIT) Professional and Technical Writin g (CWT) Government and Inte rnational Affairs Political Science (POL) History (HTY) on page 106 In terdisciplinary Social Sciences (ISS) Mass Communications with Journalism and Media Studies Concentration (COM) Psychology (PSY) Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) Art Studio-Graphic Design Concentration Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Environmental Science an d Policy (ESP) on page 97 Health Science (TBA) on page 103 Anthropology (ANT) Anthropology is the global, comparative st udy of human biological variation and cult ural systems over all periods, from the prehistoric to the present. The undergraduate program allows students to explore this subject through the discipline's four mai n areas of research: Biological Anthropology; Archaeology; Cultural Anthropology; and Li nguistics. Our perspectives are worldwide , but we also study nearby communities, in trying to understand patterns of human physical differences, language, religion, marriage customs, conflict resolution or the evolutio n of societies themselves. Students with an undergraduate degree often go on to gra duate programs in Anthropology but also find em ployment in a wide variety of settings in cluding: archeological contract companies; conducting research on urban community development; studying im migrant populations and how best to serve the health, social and educational needs of our increasingly diverse society. Students may also concentrate their studies in anthropology by choosing this as one of the two cognate disciplines required for Interdisciplinary Studies (ISS) Majors. This allows students to take introducto ry and advanced anthropology courses and combine them with a second co gnate discipline and a specific set of ISS courses. Students majoring in other fields may find anthropology coursework an ex citing and valuable supplement to their primary academic interes t. A minor in anthropology has been developed wi th this purpose in mind. The minor program is structured to allow the student maximu m flexibility in course selection within a broadly defined progressi on of anthropological interests. Thus, the student is able to tailor a minor in anthropology to best suit a special focus in the cont ext of an overall curriculum. Fu rther information about the major , new courses, and the Anthropology faculty can be found on the web at http://www.stpt.usf .edu/Coas/anthropology/ . Prerequisites (State Mandated Commo n Prerequisites) for Students tran sferring from a Community College : Students wishing to transfer to USF should complete the A.A. degree at the community college.

This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Fl orida and 28 participating non-public insti tutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online Statewide Course Numbering Syst em to obtain course descriptions and specific information abou t course transfer between participating Florid a institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org. Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and co ntent of its own courses and reco mmends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which studen ts normally take the course. Course prefix es and the last three digits of the cours e numbers are assigned by member s of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on thes e committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a me aning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with their generic titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the conten t of courses are referred to as \"s tatewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be tran sferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a fe w exceptions. (Exceptions are listed below.) For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 56 different postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit an d represents the year in whic h students normally take the course at a specific in stitution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" \"0\" ents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the co urse number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course, having the sa me prefix and course number without a lab indicator, whic h meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully co mpleted course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the co urse to be transferred is equivalent to one of fered by the receiving institution. Equivale ncies are established by the same prefix a nd last three digits and comparable faculty creden tials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A st udent who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at the community college is guaranteed to receiv e transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state univers ity if the student transfers. The student can not be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institutio n to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer studen ts on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer the eq uivalent number of credits to institutions on semester-term systems. For example, 4. 0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major divisi on of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub-cate gory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course.

C redit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary ed ucational institutions, and participating no npublic postsecondary educational institut ions to be academically equivalent to courses offe red at the receiving institut ion, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regar dless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall en sure that credits to be accept ed by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the facu lty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the re ceiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to cour ses that are entered in the sta tewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsec tion shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the Genera l Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific discipline s or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include varying topics co urses that must be evaluated in dividually, or applied courses i n which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by th e receiving institution. B. For courses at non-regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900-999 series are not auto matically transferable, and must be evaluated individu ally. These include such co urses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Thesis and Dissertations. D. College preparatory and voca tional preparatory courses. E. Graduate courses. F. Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences and study abroad courses with numbers ot her than those ranging from 900-999. G. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music, and Th eatre) and skills courses in Criminal Just ice (academy certificate courses) are not guaran teed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (i.e., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions The Statewide Course Numbering System makes available on its home page (http://scns.fldoe.org) a report entitled \"Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions\" that contains a comprehens ive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS i nventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.
