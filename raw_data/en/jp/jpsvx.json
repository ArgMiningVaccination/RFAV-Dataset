Dogs have about 1700 taste buds on their tongue, while humans have about 9000. This does not mean that dogs don't get as much enjoyment from their food as humans. Just as in humans the sense of flavor is the result of both taste and smell. [[10]](https://amzn.to/2PtcRIH) Humans have about 5 million scent receptors while dogs average about 220 million. \"Dogs have an extraordinarily acute sense of smell; it is about a million times more sensitive than that of people. They can detect odors at extremely low levels and can distinguish odors that are subtly different. This is why dogs are able to sniff out drugs and explosives at airports, search for human victims at disaster sites (including victims deep under water), and follow the scent track of criminals.\" [42] \"Odor molecules dissolve in the moisture that coats the inside of the canine nose. Signals are then sent from the olfactory membranes in the nose to the olfactory center of the brain, which is 40 times bigger in dogs than in people.\" [42] \"Dogs also have an organ on the roof of the mouth that allows them to \"taste\" certain smells. As in people, taste and smell in dogs are closely linked. However, dogs gain much more information about food from smell than from taste. Dogs have only about one sixth the number of taste buds that people do, and their distinct sense of taste is actually quite poor.\" [42] A dog's choice of foods first is based on the smell, then texture, and taste. Dogs can have a preference for a certain size and texture of foods. While we cannot fully appreciate how dogs experience the world, I think it is safe to say not even your dog wishes to eat the same food at every meal for months or years. Unless dictated by a specific health requirement it would be thoughtful to not feed your dog the same boring food all the time considering your dog's sophisticated nose that allows her to appreciate the scent of each individual ingredient. Variety can also serve a practical purpose for your dog which is covered below. Many believe their dog enjoys its food because they quickly inhale the same food for years and eats it in record time. In reality it may be that he is not so much enjoying his food, as much as he is eating everything as fast as he can because he doesn't want to go hungry nor does he understand there is not a food shortage. [This behavior can be developed before 8-weeks of age and is often learned due to how they were fed.](/s/How-To-Buy-A-Puppy-DEC-2017-zrh6.pdf) It would be far better they learned at an early age that there is no reason to eat like a vacuum, be defensive, or guard your food bowl. Adult dogs can do well on one meal a day but there are more advantages then trying to minimize bloat to feeding them twice a day. In addition to reducing hunger between meals especially when you are eating in front of them, one of the best reasons to feed your dog twice a day is that it gives you one more opportunity to provide them with something of value provided that you are feeding them something they enjoy. Free feeding is leaving a food bowl filled with a surplus of food available for the dog all day. [(For health reasons this is not recommended)](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2018/05/27/pets-therapeutic-fasting.aspx) Two possible problems with this type of unregulated feeding is first it requires the dog to self-regulate the amount of food it eats. Second you likely will not notice a change in the amount of food your dog is eating or other problems your dog encounters during eating as soon as you would with scheduled feedings. (lack of hunger, tooth problems causing pain which limits the amount of food the dog will eat, etc...) This could result in the delay of a medical diagnosis. Dogs have an internal clock that has \"proven to be accurate to within 30 seconds in a 24-hour period.\"[23] It is this internal clock that lets your dog know it is feeding time if you feed your dog at the same time each day. Dogs like routines, and some dogs, like some people are stressed without it. But be careful, a strict routine can cause stress in some dogs. If a routine becomes so predictable as to time, any disruption in this pattern can cause the dog to be stressed. Varying feeding times by at least 30-minutes can be helpful. Varying the feeding time by up to 2-hours can make the exact time unpredictable thereby lowering potential stress or problematic high-arousal which can occur when feeding times are set and predictable. There is still a routine, but it is not so rigid to cause anxiety when specific times are missed. This varying of times is beneficial especially when the owners schedule is unpredictable. Choices There is no shortage of choices when it comes to feeding your dog, nor is there a shortage of opinions on the food we should be feeding. Our understanding of nutrition is always subject to change as new discoveries are made. The information contained here has been obtained from a variety of sources. Noted here are many of the things I take into consideration when evaluating dog food for healthy dogs. Each dog is an individual and the information here is not meant to be complete or appropriate for all dogs. Pet owners have two primary options with regards to what they feed their pets. They can feed a home prepared food, or purchase a commercially prepared food for their pets. Generally speaking your choices are: Dry dog food (extruded kibble) Baked kibble (less common) Frozen raw Commercial Fresh and [lightly cooked](https://youtu.be/x_NcedlfyYM?t=4610) What is best type of food? Which of these options is best to feed is dependent on who is providing the answers. Some will say to just feed a food that meets minimum standards according to the [Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)](https://www.aafco.org/) which has established the minimum nutrient levels (Nutritional Adequacy) that are used as a standard for dog and cat food. \"Nutritional Adequacy statement\" (AAFCO statement) Almost every pet food label will state the food is formulated to meet the minimum nutritional levels established by AAFCO from low quality foods to premium expensive foods. The question is do we wish to feed an adequate food or choose optimal nutrition. [Others](http://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2016/12/questions-you-should-be-asking-about-your-pets-food/) go further and say \"that the ingredient list is one of the most useless aspects of the pet food label!\" In addition to the nutritional adequacy statement they state even more important is whether the manufacturer employs \"\"at least\" one \"full-time\" qualified nutritionist\", and that the manufacturer own the plant(s) where their food is manufactured. Y [ou will also be advised to stay away from raw or fresh foods](http://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2016/01/raw-diets-a-healthy-choice-or-a-raw-deal/). After reviewing the history of contaminated foods, seriously ill dogs, deaths, and pet food recalls from large and small companies with and without a nutritionist employed full-time I would not make my decision based on those recommendations.

There are a number of commercial foods available today that are advertised as being more economical to feed while still providing superior nutrition. However, it is important for pet owners to know that to produce a low-cost product, ingredients that are of lower quality, and thus lower cost, must be used. Therefore a cheaper product is probably going to be a lower-quality food, even though the guaranteed analysis panel may not reflect this. In addition, when considering the price of a pet food, the actual cost of feeding the animal must be calculated, not just the cost per unit weight of the food. Most low-quality, cheap ingredients have significantly lower digestibilities than the ingredients used in premium foods. A greater quantity of a food with low digestibility must be fed to an animal to provide the same amount of nutrition as found in a food with higher digestibility and nutrient availability. As a result, owners may find that they have to feed significantly larger portions of the cheaper food to their pet (see Chapter 18, pp. 177-180 ).\" Canine and Feline Nutrition: by Linda Case [22] [Dr. Karen Shaw Becker - rankings of 13 Pet Foods From Best to Worst](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2015/11/08/best-to-worst-pet-food-types.aspx) \"Most commercial pet foods are based on high-glycemic, genetically engineered (GE) corn, wheat, rice or potato \u2014 grains and starches that have no place in your pet's diet, creating metabolically stressful insulin, glucagon and cortisol spikes throughout the day.

Guaranteed Analysis & Typical Analysis Dog and cat foods in the USA are required to list a \"Guaranteed Analysis\" of the nutrient content of the food. The guaranteed analysis lists protein, fat, fiber, and moisture percentages as minimums or maximums and is not meant to provide exact percentages. The actual amounts can vary a little or a lot from the guaranteed analysis so I will show you how to determine this. Pet food manufactures in the USA are not required to list \"ash\" or \"carbohydrates\" in the food but some will provide this information if asked or have it listed on their website. A typical analysis differs from a \"guaranteed analysis\". A \"Typical Analysis\" reports the \"typical\" averages for the food. These percentages are generally much closer to the actual food composition than what is reported with the guaranteed analysis. A typical analysiss following European guidelines includes protein, fat, fiber, ash, and moisture if more than 14%. We cannot compare foods based on the \"Guaranteed Analysis\" alone since these numbers do not represent the full nutrient profile of the food. Differing types of foods (dry, canned, dehydrated, raw, etc...) have different amounts of moisture (water) so they will have great differences in the percentage of protein and fat listed on the label. Just subtracting the moisture content and comparing foods on a dry matter basis is not sufficient. To determine the actual amounts of protein, fat, and carbs in a food we need to know the calories. Quality & Digestibility Quality can vary greatly and it is affected by the source, type of ingredients, formula, heat, processing, fiber, and ash content. We are missing two important measurements to help us choose pet food. Overall (dry matter) digestibility and amino acid digestibility. This is important because commercial pet foods are represented as \"complete and balanced\" and our animals are generally not fed a wide rotating variety of foods that could negate a nutritional deficiency. Ingredients can look the same as listed but protein can be poor, moderate, or high quality. For a food to be high quality it needs to be both highly digestible and contain the proper amino acids available to have actual nutritive value once digested. Of the three major nutrients in pet foods (protein, fat, carbs) protein consistently has the lowest digestibility of the three. [45] Good vs. Poor Digestibility: \"The term digestibility coefficient refers to the percent of a food that the dog absorbs into his or her body during the process of digestion. As a rule of thumb, dry dog foods with digestibility values of 75 % or less will be of very poor quality, those with values between 75 and 82 % are classified as moderate in quality, and foods with digestibility values that are higher than 82 % are of high quality. If you see products with 88 % or more reported digestibility, you have a rock star.\" [https://thesciencedog.com/2017/02/01/digestibility-matters/](https://thesciencedog.com/2017/02/01/digestibility-matters/) [45] Protein is required in the diet but \"animals do not have a requirement for protein per se but have an amino acid requirement.\" [[4]](https://amzn.to/2QXqkdI) Proteins are made up of amino acids and dogs have a requirement for 22 amino acids like other animals. \"10 are essential and must be provided in their diet. \"Proteins that provide optimal proportions of all essential amino acids are referred to as high quality proteins.\" [ [4]](https://amzn.to/2QXqkdI) Quality proteins are highly digestible and provide usable essential amino acids. Protein quality and digestibility can be affected by ash content, cooking time, temperature, and fiber content. [4] \"Proteins of plant origin generally have lower digestibility than animal proteins because plant fiber and carbohydrates lower digestion, due to a reduced degradation rate of nutrients in the gut and increase bacterial activity\" [4] \"a large portion of protein in cereal-based dry pet foods typically comes from grains, including rice, corn, wheat and barley.\" [4] A poor coat, gas/flatulence, and poor stools can be a sign of a low quality protein diet. [3] [27] [28] There are also differences in forms of protein. e.g. raw, cooked, dehydrated (heat or cold), meals, and by-product meals. There can be [vast differences in the quality of meals](https://thesciencedog.com/2018/12/06/mind-your-peas-and-potatoes/). Meal quality is affected by the quality of the ingredients, cooking time, and processing temperature. The nutritive value of various meat by-products varies widely. As an example, meat by-products such as liver, kidney and lungs have excellent nutritive value whereas other meat by-products such as udder, bone and connective tissue have poor nutrient availability. [4] [Nutritionists at the University of Illinois](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329570588_Chemical_composition_true_nutrient_digestibility_and_true_metabolizable_energy_of_chicken-based_ingredients_differing_by_processing_method_using_the_precision-fed_cecectomized_rooster_assay) measured the protein quality of four types of pet grade chicken. Raw chicken Steamed chicken (cooked to 200 degrees F for 10 minutes) Retorted chicken (processed as in canned foods; cooked at ~ 250 degrees F for 30 minutes) Chicken meal (rendered/dried) [The results of this study](https://thesciencedog.com/2019/01/15/tastes-like-chicken/) showed that steamed chicken (cooked to 200 degrees F for 10 minutes) had the highest digestibility and had the highest \"digestibility values for all of the essential and non-essential amino acids\" - greater than 90 percent for all but two amino acids. 1. Steamed chicken - high quality 2. Raw chicken - high quality 3. Retorted Chicken (Canned) - moderate quality 4. Meal - low quality Meals are made from rendered (unknown quality of ingredients cooked and dried into a meal) The quality of \"meal\" can vary greatly. \"Chicken meal, however contains mostly rendered chicken necks and backs, which means it provides more ash per unit protein than poultry by-product meal.\" [4] A concern with meals that has surfaced again recently is meals containing pentobarbital resulting in the death of dogs. Pentobarbital should NOT be found in animal Food. \"Most of us probably think that pentobarbital comes from a couple of bad actors that use a euthanized animal when they know they aren't really supposed to. New evidence is showing that it may be a much more pervasive problem throughout the animal food supply than originally thought, and we have reason to believe rendered products can be a source for pentobarbital, if not controlled.\" Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) - NGFAPFI FEED AND PET FOOD JOINT CONFERENCE September 18, 2018 - Steven M. Solomon, D.V.M., M.P.H. Since pet food companies are not require to provide a true quality score (digestibility & nutrients) we are left with evaluating the ingredients, calories, guaranteed or typical analysis, and running our own calculations to gain insight on each food. To do this we start with the listed guaranteed analysis and the calories content. Ingredients Amount of protein, fat, carbs & calorie breakdown Essential nutrients - balanced or over/under Ingredients o Source (farm to table, trusted or foreign) o Quality (food or feed, organic, human grade) o Quantity (ingredient splitting, fairy dust, etc) Digestibility Calorie breakdown Amount of: Protein Fat carbs Essential Nutrients - is anything lacking?

(If high quality animal based protein) Homeskooling target: Protein 90+ g per 1000 calories - At a minimum 75 g per 1000 calories if high quality food animal based protein Higher protein is recommended for weight loss and senior dogs. The lower the protein the higher the fat and or carbs will be and that is not recommended. Dogs have no requirement for carbs, but they do need protein and fat. Dogs fed animal based higher protein diets vs animal and plant based protein diets \"had better body composition and a muscle-specific protein pattern identical to that in healthy young-adult dogs.\" [21] [All the above calculations and more can be made with the Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet available here.](/store?category=Pet%20Food%20Math%20Cheat%20Sheet) \"Avoid diets at the current time which appear to rely heavily on legumes to meet the protein content of the diet. This is difficult to evaluate on the label. If a fresh meat is first on the ingredient list, followed by a legume or legume protein, it's likely the legume that provides more contribution to the diet since it's dry whereas the meat is mostly water. Similarly, if there's a number of legumes listed and only one meat, that could also be a sign. Or if a legume is the first or second ingredient. Legumes can afford some nutritional benefits, but their history as a significant protein source is less well known. It may end up being perfectly safe, but the reason for higher inclusions (vs. meat) is generally for sustainability, processing, or cost.\" [https://justinshmalberg.com/blog/2019/7/3/dilated-cardiomyopathy-and-grain-free-diets-thoughts-on-the-fda-update?fbclid=IwAR171TanjB8k_Dc52tXBfuKqoHHx9PYRkofirdZfixuTrnaQXQtq-RVP7NM](https://justinshmalberg.com/blog/2019/7/3/dilated-cardiomyopathy-and-grain-free-diets-thoughts-on-the-fda-update?fbclid=IwAR171TanjB8k_Dc52tXBfuKqoHHx9PYRkofirdZfixuTrnaQXQtq-RVP7NM) Feed The Best You Can You Afford To start, just [select the best food you can afford](/dog-food-best-of-list).

But in order not to induce [nutritional deficiencies](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2017/10/09/5-mistakes-dog-parents-often-make.aspx) you will need supplements and or a [professional nutritionis](https://petfooddiva.com/canine-nutrition-consulting/)t to provide you [exact recipes](https://www.planetpaws.ca/healthy-pet-recipe-store/). \" [Owners of several big dogs could rapidly go broke feeding a fresh or raw diet, but to the extent that the dry kibble can be reduced, or lowered as a percentage of the diet, nutrition will be better.\" \"The solution is to feed as much raw, frozen, canned or freeze dried pet food as your budget will allow.](https://pattonanimalnutrition.com/what-to-feed-your-dog/)\" To compare the daily cost to feed differing foods [first determine the number of calories your dog needs each day](/daily-calorie-esitmator). Start by looking at the amount of food they are currently eating to determine the calories. Most commercial pet foods list the calorie content on the label. Calories on pet foods are generally listed as \"kcal\" which is the same as a \"calorie\" on human food labels. Calories will usually be listed as kcal/kg which the number of calories per kg which is 2.2lbs. (e.g. 3678 kcal/kg) Additionally calories will be noted for calories per cup (419kcal/cup), or for fresh frozen per oz (8 oz.: 422 kcal/patty) Like people [all dogs are different and will have differing calorie needs](https://youtu.be/x_NcedlfyYM?t=1h8m56s). The feeding guides on pet food labels are just a starting point and the recommendations may not be appropriate for your dog. With dry food determining the cost to feed per day and how long a bag of dry food will last can be a bit complicated because dry foods have differing densities and weights. The typical dry food is close to 4 oz per cup and has about 4 cups per pound. But foods can vary widely. One food can have close to 3 oz a cup (5 \u00bc cups/lb) and another about 5 \u00be oz a cup (2 \u00be cups/lb). With the [Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet](/choosingpetfoods) you can determine the cost to feed per day based on the calories your dog eats. The cheat sheet will calculate how many days the food will last and how much to feed Raw Foods Raw foods formulated for pets are available from commercial manufactures and sold in pet stores as either frozen or freeze-dried. [Foods that are dehydrated with heat can be excellent quality but they would rank below foods not exposed to heat like in freeze-drying](https://youtu.be/x_NcedlfyYM?t=45m5s).

Just because nutritional deficiencies aren't obvious in your dog doesn't mean they don't exist.\" [12] \"Although fresh meat is a good source of protein and some minerals, it doesn't represent a balanced diet. Wild canines eat nearly all the parts of their prey, including small bones, internal organs, blood, brain, glands, hair, skin, teeth, eyes, tongue and other tasty treats. Many of these parts of prey animals provide important nutrients, and in fact, this is how carnivores in the wild nutritionally balance their diets.\" [12] \"There are only two options for assuring nutritional adequacy in homemade diets: feeding a more expensive, whole food recipe that contains a significant number of diversified ingredients necessary to meet nutrient requirements, or using supplements.

Dog and cat foods will have a \"Nutritional Adequacy Statement\" which will indicate what type of pet and what stage of life the product is suited for. Start with the \"Nutritional Adequacy Statement\" which will state whether the food is \"Complete and Balanced\". (This is just one of many things to take into consideration) \"Complete and balanced\" for: All Life Stages\" Adult Maintenance Growth/reproduction (Puppies, gestation/lactation) All Life Stages, including for growth of large size dogs (70 lb or more as an adult) (See below) A food that is \"Complete and Balanced\" for \"All Life Stages\" is designed to meet [adequate nutritional levels established by the AAFCO](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/18_10/features/Why-All-Daily-Diets-Should-Meet-AAFCO-Nutrient-Guidelines_21319-1.html) for pregnant dogs, nursing dogs, growing puppies, and mature dogs. A food \"Complete and Balanced\" for \"Adult Maintenance\" is designed to meet the nutritional levels for adult dogs but not pregnant, nursing dogs, or puppies. If the label states the food \"is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only\" it does not provide complete nutrition so it is not \"Complete and Balanced\". The \"Nutritional Adequacy Statement\" is determined in one of two ways. This can be accomplished generally with either feeding trails or formulating a food to meet the nutrient profiles established by AAFCO for nutritional adequacy. Complete and Balanced?

But this is no guarantee that you are getting a quality food for your dog. A feeding trial for adult dog food typically uses eight dogs over one year of age. These dogs are tested on the food for six months and during that time they will undergo limited blood tests.

With large breed puppies I recommend you work with a [ nutritionist ](https://petfooddiva.com/canine-nutrition-consulting/)to help evaluate any food you feed. Is the food working for growing puppies and dog? A puppy is growing fast and they can develop nutritional deficiencies in a short period of time if not feed a quality diet. Once the puppy's growth plates close (14-18 months of age) the nutritional damage is permanent. Puppies should be kept lean (not plump) throughout growth. The goal would be a \"body condition score\" (BCS) of 4 on a 9 point scale. You won't limit their growth by keeping them lean. \"Adult size is genetically determined; feeding for a lean body condition simply slows down rate of growth, it does not stunt growth.

Whether you are feeding a raw, canned, or a dry dog food, look for quality ingredients. Start by avoiding the ingredients on the [ \"Ingredient To Avoid\" list](/ingredients-to-avoid). Be wary of commercial pet food that lists ingredients in generic terms like, meat (mystery meats), animal or meat by product, and poultry by-products. Per AAFCO regulations generic (mystery meats) can only be from beef, lamb, pig, or goats. [24] Look for named sources such as; lamb, turkey, beef, chicken, etc... or dehydrated chicken, dehydrated beef, lamb meal, turkey meal, beef meal, chicken meal, etc. A named animal protein generally indicates a higher quality product than generic meats or plant-source proteins. \"Because most animal-source proteins are generally of higher quality than plant-source proteins, foods that include an animal source protein as its primary protein source is recommended.\" \"The most commonly used concentrated plant-sources of protein are corn gluten meal, soybean meal and most recently, pea protein and potato protein.\" [5] (See [DCM](/dcm) below) \"As with human foods, federal law requires that pet food companies report all included ingredients in decreasing preponderance by weight on their product's label. This means that ingredients that are listed first are present in the highest amount in a given product. However, and here is the catch, the weight of each ingredient includes the moisture (amount of water) present in the ingredient at the time of processing. This makes interpretation a bit tricky because some ingredients contain a lot of water (up to 70 %) while others contain very little water (12 % or less). The result is that an ingredient that is listed first on the list may appear to be the most important component of the food, when in effect it contributed a lot of water and much less in the way of essential nutrients.

Plant Protein \"The most commonly used concentrated plant-sources of protein are corn gluten meal, soybean meal and most recently, pea protein and potato protein.\" [5] Other plant based protein sources are corn, rice, fava beans, chickpeas, lentil, quinoa, sorghum, barley, and millet. \"If an animal is consuming a diet containing predominantly plant protein sources, protein requirements may be higher than if the animal is consuming a diet containing predominantly animal protein sources.\" [29] \"Most plant proteins do not contain taurine, an essential amino acid for cats, and under some circumstances possibly a conditionally essential amino acid in dogs. Animal-based protein sources are recommended for both dogs and cats due to their pattern of essential amino acids.\" [[3]](https://amzn.to/2IgZKbE) Foods formulated to derive protein from plants often add synthetic amino acids to make up for deficiencies. \"Synthetic amino acids currently added to some pet foods include L-methionine or D, L-methionine, L-lysine, L-arginine and taurine.\" [[4]](https://amzn.to/2QXqkdI) Protein excess (toxicity) is not a practical problem unless fed at a very high level; \"synthetic amino acids mistakenly added to foods at very high levels can cause toxicity.\" [ [4]](https://amzn.to/2QXqkdI) \"Methionine excess can result in a hemolytic anemia with methemoglobinemia with Heinz body formation. However, the risk appears to be associated with purified amino acid supplementation, not with the consumption of intact dietary protein.\" [3] My preference is to choose foods that derived their nutrition from whole foods ingredients. I prefer to avoid foods that add synthetic vitamins like menadione sodium bisulfite a synthetic vitamin K, and synthetic amino acids like DL-Methionine, L-Lysine, L-Lysine Monohydrochloride,L-arginine, L-Tryptophan, and L-Tyrosine.

Canine Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals (Kindle Locations 867-873). Elsevier Health. Protein quality can vary greatly and it is affected by the source, type of ingredients, heat, processing, fiber, and ash content. Ingredients can look the same as listed but protein can be poor, moderate, or high quality. For a food to be high quality it needs to be both highly digestible and contain usable essential amino acids that have actual nutritive value once digested. [8] Since AAFCO does not require a true quality score for pet foods we are left with evaluating the ingredients, calories, guaranteed/typical analysis, and running our own calculations to gain insight on each food. To do this we need to know the guaranteed analysis and the calories content. \"When evaluating dry dog foods, a general rule of thumb is that the first five ingredients that you see in the list provide 80% or more of the food's nutrients.\" [[5]](https://amzn.to/2xAFs8U) \"when a high-moisture ingredient is listed first on the ingredient list of an extruded food, keep reading and pay special attention to the protein sources that immediately follow on the list. When a dry protein source (typically a meal) follows the fresh meat, this will be the protein source that actually provides the bulk of the protein to the food.\" [5] The food ingredient list below has a minimum of 23% protein and looking at the early ingredients listed it appears to be a lower quality heavy plant based protein food. Ingredient list: Chicken, Corn Meal, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Chicken By-Product Meal, Chicken Flavor, Brewers Rice, Dried Beet Pulp, Fish Meal, Dried Egg Product, Potassium Chloride, Fish Oil. Further down the ingredient list we find DL-Methionine. Although this food lists \"chicken\" as the first ingredient once the moisture (apprx 75%) is removed it likely would fall in the list to just in front of \"chicken flavor\" since it likely contributes only a very small amount of protein. Most pet food grade \"chicken\" is comprised of spent carcasses, basically chicken frames composed of small bits of muscle meat plus a lot of connective tissue and bone so I would consider it a low/moderate protein, low quality food, that is heavy plant based protein food. \"It is these chicken frames, plus varying amounts of internal organs, intestines, heads, and sometimes feet, that are sent to rendering plants and processed into chicken meal. They are also the primary source of the \"fresh\" chicken in dry dog foods that are marketed as chicken first. Although this labeling trick implies that this is the same chicken as the food that consumers purchase in the supermarket, it is not. Rather, this chicken is also a by-product of the human food industry - frames (and other stuff) - prior to being turned into a dry protein meal. The same applies to commercially produced raw and fresh cooked foods. Unless the producer specifies \"human grade\" (technically called \"edible\"), the chicken ingredients of their products are chicken by-products - not supermarket chicken breast and leg meat.\" [https://thesciencedog.com/2019/01/15/tastes-like-chicken/](https://thesciencedog.com/2019/01/15/tastes-like-chicken/) Another clue to the plant based content in the ingredient list above is the addition of DL-Methionine. \"Methionine is usually the first limiting amino acid in most commercial pet foods that contain animal tissues and plant protein sources.\" [16] Amino Acid Additives Taurine DL-Methionine L-Lysine L-Threonine L-Tryptophan Why high protein?

Protein quality and digestibility can be affected by ash content, cooking time, temperature, and fiber content. [4] \"Proteins of plant origin generally have lower digestibility than animal proteins because plant fiber and carbohydrates lower digestion, due to a reduced degradation rate of nutrients in the gut and increase bacterial activity\" [4] \"a large portion of protein in cereal-based dry pet foods typically comes from grains, including rice, corn, wheat and barley.

Retorted chicken (canned) was of moderate quality, while the chicken meal, the form of chicken that is included in almost all dry, extruded dog foods, lagged dramatically behind and was found to be an incomplete protein source for both adult and growing dogs.\" [[15]](https://thesciencedog.com/2019/01/15/tastes-like-chicken/) \"Poor quality proteins can lead to profound nutritive failure, accompanied by a rapid decline in weight, loss of appetite\" [4] Companies will make claims that their foods are highly digestible or have superior digestibility but these claims are meaningless without being backed by an actual measure reflecting digestibility in percentage points.

With a quality food your dog should not defecate (poop) more than the number of feeding per day. Additionally foods low in digestibility can be the cause of gas (flatulence), loose stools, and occasionally diarrhea. Low cost foods may reflect the low-quality ingredients that are used. Poor quality foods that are low in digestibility will require the dog to eat more to get the nutrition it needs. [Pet food formulator Steve Brown ](https://amzn.to/2PJMWx5)states that the gold standard is 49% of the calories would come from protein. With the number of overweight and obese dogs I think it reasonable to increase protein and limit carbohydrates. \"Limiting dietary carbohydrate is an important component of metabolic control for weight loss.

Many people believe that protein overworks older kidneys and that protein should automatically be decreased in an older dog's diet. This is false. Dietary protein does not stress or harm the kidneys of otherwise healthy senior dogs. On the contrary, healthy older dogs require slightly more protein. Protein minimizes loss of lean body mass that accompanies the aging process.

The protein stores of a senior dog turn over more rapidly than in younger dogs, and like humans, dogs can start to lose muscle mass as they age. Extra protein supplies amino acids that help make up for that loss, and these keep aging pups stronger and more mobile.

FIBER \"Fiber is the part of the plant material that the dog cannot digest; it's considered to be a carbohydrate.\" [7] There is no AAFCO minimum recommendation for fiber since \"Fiber is not considered essential in the diets of cats and dogs\" [11] \"The measure of fiber is typically reported on pet food labels as \"crude fiber\". This analytical method does not capture all forms of fiber and largely reports the insoluble portion.

[7] There is no AAFCO minimum or maximum recommendation for ash since each mineral has its own minimum recommendation and several have a maximum recommendation depending on the \"life stage\" the food is formulated. \"Ash analysis is of little value either for expressing mineral requirements or for indicating the useful mineral content of foods\" ...\"ash may not be a measure of total inorganic matter present, because some organic carbon may be bound as carbonate, and some inorganic elements (e.g., sulfur, selenium, iodine, fluorine and even sodium) may be lost during combustion.\" [4] \"Ash content is generally \"between 2% and 10% using higher values with dry, higher protein foods\" [3] Higher moisture foods will generally have 1 1/2% - 2% ash. Protein sources containing higher quantities of muscle meat will contain less ash. A food with high ash content is likely made with a large amount of bone e.g. \"chicken frames,\" \" [the part of the chicken that is left over after the chicken meat for human consumption has been removed or from chickens that have been removed from the human food supply for other reasons](https://amzn.to/2WfTBXr).\" Although a food may have a higher than average protein content we don't know the protein quality since frames would also contain a lot of connective tissue which lowers the protein quality. \"bone meal can contain a great deal more bone (raising the ash content and lowering the protein quality).\" [16] Another concern is contamination from lead which can come from bone meal.

For dogs that are overweight I avoid foods marketed for the \"less active\" dogs. If you checked the label you may find that this food has the same calories or more than the food you are feeding now. Many of these foods contain a high fiber content which can reduce the overall digestibility and insoluble fiber like cellulose can reduce mineral adsorption. \"A dry food that reports a crude fiber content that is higher than 5 or 6% has added fiber.\" [[5]](https://amzn.to/2xxutNz) High fiber can lead to increased need to defecate and a larger volume of feces. Instead I would limit treats and slightly reduce the amount of food feed, and increase their daily exercise. There's an old saying, if your dog is fat you're not getting enough exercise! Food Intolerance & Sensitivity Feeding the best food and ingredients is great unless your dog or cat has an intolerance or sensitivity to them. Food intolerances/sensitivities can manifest in (GI) gastrointestinal issues, chronic itching, gas rumblings, chronic gas, chronic burping, chronic skin, ear and foot infections, especially with the presence of yeast.[2] I have found that a small amount of an offending ingredient causes issues. Reactions can be cause by the differing proteins, or oats, millet, quinoa, lentils, barley, salmon oil, herring oil, etc. Dogs can experience allergic reactions the same as people. But food intolerance or sensitivity is more common than a food allergy. [NUTRISCAN: Salivary Diagnostic Test for Food Intolerance](http://www.hemopet.org/clients/14145/documents/Resources_for_Sharing/Nutriscan_Article_2017.pdf) If your dog or cat has itchy skin, diarrhea, gas, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease your dog or cat likely has a food sensitivity or intolerance. Does your dog lick obsessively? It may be due to a food sensitivity or intolerance. Having been down this road more than once the first place I start is with a food intolerance/sensitivity test by [NutriScan](https://www.homeskooling4dogs.com/food-intoleranceinsensitivity) since food intolerance/sensitivity it is more common than a food allergy. NutriScan helped eliminate the guesswork without putting my dogs through weeks/months of food trails and continually going to the vet to manage symptoms. Does your dog [eat grass regularly](/why-do-dogs-eat-grass)? Some grass eating is normal but excessive grass eating can be due to illness or gastrointestinal issue like a food intolerance. After running a [NutriScan food intolerance test ](https://amzn.to/2od02XT)on each of my own dogs and then eliminating several foods from their diet their grass eating reduced about 95%. Food intolerances/sensitivities can build up over time with exposure to offending ingredient(s). Rotating foods every two to three months can do more then add to our dog's enjoyment of his food, it may help to avoid the development of particular food sensitivity and food allergies. The greater the length of time and frequency a particular food is consumed the greater likelihood an intolerance/sensitivity can develop over time. \"dogs and cats may develop food allergies after prolonged exposure to one brand, type or form of food. In contrast, adverse reactions due to food intolerance may occur after a single exposure to a food ingredient because immune amplification is unnecessary.\" [4] Allergy reactions show up in allergy blood test as antibodies (IgE and IgG), but food sensitivity & intolerances are tested with a dog's saliva for a differing set of antibodies (IgA and IgM). With the NutriScan kit you collect saliva with a small cotton dental rope. You can do this at home or at the vet's office. Then ship the kit back to [Hemopet](http://www.hemopet.org/) for testing. limited ingredient diet A limited ingredient food (Limited Ingredient Diet - LID) does not have a standard definition. It generally means the food is limited to one animal protein. Some manufactures state that their food is limited to one animal protein and one carbohydrate. And still others define it further as having an overall lower number of ingredients. Selecting a food with a single identified animal protein is a desirable goal since it is recommended to rotate and feed a variety of differing proteins and brands of food over time to help correct for any excesses, insufficiencies, or imbalances. Another advantage is that dogs fed the same food over time are more likely to develop particular food sensitivity and food allergies. Many owners select a limited ingredient food in an attempt to avoid foods that may be the cause of food allergies or food intolerance/sensitivities. Food elimination diets are often used to test for adverse food reactions (AFR). \"The elimination diet trial should be performed for a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks and ideally 10 to 12 weeks... Although maximum improvement may take up to 10 to 13 weeks,\" [Applied Veterinary Clinical Nutrition] \"It is noteworthy that dietary trials confirm or rule out adverse reactions to food but do not indicate the underlying mechanism (allergy or intolerance).\" [Small Animal Clinical Nutrition 5th edition] A problem found with several limited ingredient diets is that they often contain additional food ingredients not listed on the label. \" ten of twelve pet foods tested herein as limited antigen diets may not reliably rule out a diagnosis of AFR, and the use of homecooked diets should be considered whenever the dog fails to respond to dietary restriction\" [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpn.12045](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpn.12045) \"ten of the twelve selected commercial dry limited antigen diets, all novel protein diets, were unsuitable for use in diagnostic food elimination trials because they contained ingredients belonging to one or two zoological classes (mammalian, avian or fish) not listed on the label.\" [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpn.12045](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpn.12045) Thyroid Disease ( [Dr. Jean Dodds](http://www.hemopet.org/education/jean-dodds-veterinarian.html)) Hypothyroidism is the most common endocrine disorder of dogs.

Classical clinical signs of hypothyroidism only appear once >70% of the gland is damaged. [Thyroid Testing](http://www.hemopet.org/hemolife-diagnostics/veterinary-thyroid-testing.html) Certain foods contain naturally occurring substances called goitrogens that can interfere with the thyroid gland's production of hormone. \"The two main groups of goitrogen-containing foods are cruciferous vegetables and soy products.\" \"The grain millet is also mildly goitrogenic.

If your dog or cats stops eating the food you have been feeding don't add or mix in anything to make the food more appetizing. They may have refused to eat due to an infestation of mites, or the presence of bacteria, mold, or rancid fats. Improper [food storage](/dog-food-storage) can result in bacteria and mold growth, and fats going rancid. Consuming this food can contribute to chronic health problems. Offer your dog something else to eat. If they eat the new food you offered, there may be a problem with the food you've been feeding. If your dog is refusing something else tasty you offered, they may not be feeling well. For a healthy adult dog there is no harm in them fasting, in fact it is [recommended by many veterinarians](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2018/05/27/pets-therapeutic-fasting.aspx).

Originally, the word was used to describe someone with whom you shared a meal.\" I share almost everything I eat with my dogs' as long as it is safe and they do not have a food intolerance / sensitivity to it. Since I adopted them I treat them like family. Dogs are not our peers, but we should be their best friend. \"The occasional feeding of table foods should not be of concern for healthy pets unless the food composes more than 10% of the daily dry matter intake\" [[4]](https://amzn.to/2QXqkdI) \"Dry matter\" can be determined with the Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet. Can dogs eat cheese? Yes, but in small quantities. Some types of cheese you can give dogs are cottage cheese, mozzarella or soft goat cheese and low-fat cream cheese, all of which contain little amounts of fat. [32] \"Not all dogs digest cheese well, and while cheese contains little lactose when compared to [whole milk](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/can-dogs-drink-milk/), dogs with severe cases of lactose intolerance may have adverse reactions to cheese, even in small quantities.\" [33] \"keep your pet away from blue cheeses such as stilton. The fungus used to make these cheeses produces a substance called roquefortine C, which dogs can be sensitive to. This substance can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, high temperatures and even seizures. The risk of these symptoms is higher if your dog eats a large amount of cheese.\" [34] [35] [36] Breed Specific Foods Royal Canin, IAMS, and Eukanuba all make breeds specific foods for dogs as small as Chihuahua's to German Shepherds. The big question is does it matter? Reviewing the three companies Chihuahua dog foods show similar ingredients in differing quantities. One thing it appears all three have in common is that they appear to be low on meat protein since all three foods have listed at least one synthetic amino acid in the ingredients. Nor do all three foods match with regards to the \"Guaranteed Analysis\" with respect to a minimum level of protein, fat, and fiber. The calories range from 323 up to 407 per cup. It is similar for the Labrador Retriever foods. All three appear to be low on meat protein; one has added taurine and L-carnitine, and another has DL-Methionime, and L-Carnitine, with the third listing L-Lysine, L-Tryptophan, and DL-Methionime. Nor do any of the three match on minimums for protein (23%, 25%, & 28%), or fat. The calories range from 276 - 348 per cup. It is the same story with the German Shepherd foods. All three add synthetic amino acids and the calories range from 314-365 per cup. One thing all three companies appear to agree on is that German Shepherds need less protein than Chihuahua's. (22%, 23%, & 24%) What also stands out is these breed specific foods appear no different than many other adult dog foods on the market. What makes all this even more interesting is that at the time of this review (September 2018) Royal Canin, IAMS, and Eukanuba are all owned by the worlds largest pet food company, Mars Petcare. Working with breeders of the most popular registered breeds seems to be a smart marketing strategy to have the best chance of capturing customers early. To answer the questions of does it matter, I believe canine nutritionist Linda Case sums it up well. \"These foods (obviously) target owners of specific breeds who wish to believe that significant (and scientifically proven) differences in nutrient needs exist among dog breeds (they do not).\" \"comparisons of these foods often expose a distinction without a difference\" - [Linda Linda. Dog Food Logic ](https://amzn.to/2QtrQE7) [Does Your Dog Need a 'Breed-Specific' Diet?](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2011/12/22/breed-specific-diet-for-dogs.aspx) The Myth: Kibble Is Good for Your Pet's Teeth \"Dry pet food is promoted as helping to keep pets' teeth clean, but it's complete nonsense. Kibble is no better for your dog's or cat's teeth than crunchy human food is for your teeth.\" [(Healthypets.com)](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2017/09/30/why-pet-owners-favor-dry-pet-food.aspx) Variety & Rotation are Important It is frequently recommended to feed a variety of proteins and brands of foods and to rotate them often for several reasons. Dogs fed the same food over time are more likely to develop particular food sensitivity and food allergies. If a food is imbalanced, has an excess of a nutrient, or is deficient in an ingredient, rotating foods will limit long term exposure. Your dog will likely enjoy variety. [Hair arsenic level in rice-based diet-fed Staffordshire bull terriers](https://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/vetrec/early/2019/10/30/vr.105493.full.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0WoL4iQ0b3IYeziZ46TrDhwPhh36p-EuO_1gqItWBzi__jnfx8EnMNIQ4) \"dogs and cats may develop food allergies after prolonged exposure to one brand, type or form of food. In contrast, adverse reactions due to food intolerance may occur after a single exposure to a food ingredient because immune amplification is unnecessary.\" [4] The goal is to rotate and feed a variety of differing proteins and brands of food over time to help correct for any excesses, insufficiencies, or imbalances. Select several quality foods with a with a similar protein, fat, and calorie content to compare and make a decision on what to feed. With the Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet you can run the math to analyze and compare any type of pet food. Dry kibble, canned food, baked kibble, freeze-dried, raw, etc. You can get a copy of the [Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet here](/choosingpetfoods). How To Compare Foods based on the \"Guaranteed analysis We cannot compare foods based on the \"Guaranteed Analysis\" alone since these numbers do not represent the full nutrient profile of the food. Differing types of foods (dry, canned, dehydrated, raw, etc...) have different amounts of moisture (water) so they will have great differences in the percentage of protein and fat listed on the label. Just subtracting the moisture content and comparing foods on a dry matter basis is not sufficient. Two foods with the same moisture content, and percentage of protein can provide differing amounts of total protein. To compare foods we need to know what percentage of calories come from protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and how many grams (g) of protein per 1,000 calories the food provides. To determine this we need to run the math using the \"Guaranteed Analysis\" and the \"Calorie Content\". [Steve Brown pet food formulator](https://amzn.to/2RIQDVw) states the gold standard for the food calories breakdown would be: Calorie Breakdown (Not \"Guaranteed Analysis\") Protein 49% Fat 44% Carbohydrate 6%. Note that the percentage of calories is not the same as the \"guaranteed analysis\" %. To determine the percentage of calories we have created the [Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet](/choosingpetfoods) which you can use to analyze and compare any type of pet food. Dry kibble, canned food, baked kibble, freeze-dried, raw, etc. Enter the information from the \"Guaranteed Analysis\" and the \"Calorie Content\" on the food label and the [Pet Food Math Cheat Sheet](/choosingpetfoods) and it will do all the calculations so you can compare any type of food.

In mulling over this conclusion, we realize that we should not have been surprised to make this discovery. After all, we know perfectly well that humans grow, reproduce, and live to ripe old age on diets that differ enormously in what is considered normal and acceptable to eat. As long as the diet includes sufficient amounts of a variety of minimally processed foods\u2014meat, dairy, fruit, vegetables, grains (or their substitutes)\u2014the needs for essential nutrients and energy will be met. The same goes for dogs and cats. As we have said, it is extremely difficult to induce a nutrient deficiency in a person or animal eating enough of a variety of foods. This means that you have lots of options for feeding pets healthfully. You can choose a feeding method that not only meets the nutritional needs and preferences of your particular animal, but also\u2014and we think this is an important consideration\u2014 one that fits comfortably with the way you live and with your personal dietary beliefs and preferences. If this concept seems as surprising to you as it did to us, it is because nobody would ever know this from surveying current books on how to care for pets. The books that are out there tend to cite every bit of research or experience they can muster to argue that you must feed your pet only one kind of diet\u2014only commercial pet food, only one or another alternative pet food, only meat, only grains and vegetables, only raw foods, or only home-cooked foods.
