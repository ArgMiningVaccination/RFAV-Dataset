Examples of alternative therapies include herbal remedies, acupuncture, reflexology, exercise, meditation, massage and yoga. Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by an intense and relentless sense of hopelessness, worthlessness, emptiness and despair. Clinical depression interferes with working, eating, sleeping and more aspects of your life. It can be caused by one or more factors, including chemical imbalances, high levels of stress, traumatic experiences, life transitions and more. Approximately 10% of people suffer from depression. The two most common treatments for clinical depression in are psychotherapy and medications. A therapist provides counselling (talk therapy) and a family healthcare provider or psychiatrist provides medicine (such as SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). These treatments can be very effective. However, if you don't respond to them, or if you want to supplement your treatment, you might want to consider alternative therapies. Alternative Therapies recommended for Depression are \u00b7 Herbal remedies: Herbal remedies are made from plants of the wide variety of available herbal therapies, \u00b7 Acupuncture: Acupuncture is the method of healing that prevents and cures specific diseases and conditions. \u00b7 Reflexology: For this treatment, the reflexologist applies pressure to different pressure points on your feet, hands, ears and face. \u00b7 Exercise: In general, exercise is a safe and easy way to improve your well-being. \u00b7 Meditation: Meditation is a form of relaxation and introspection. \u00b7 Massage: Massage uses touch to promote relaxation while decreasing tension and stress. \u00b7 Yoga: Yoga is a type of exercise and spiritual practice. \u00b7 Deep breathing: Taking slow, deep breaths in, then slowly exhaling, while your mind focuses on the breath. Benefits and Risks of alternative therapies for depression \u00b7 Herbal remedies: Check with your healthcare provider before you start using an herbal remedy to make sure there are no drug interactions with your antidepressants or other medications. \u00b7 Acupuncture: In a recent clinical study, acupuncture has been shown effective in decreasing depression at three months, compared to usual care. For people who suffer from both pain and depression, acupuncture may be better than counselling and standard of care at reducing both. \u00b7 Reflexology: Reflexology is thought to improve your mood, help you sleep and relieve tension. \u00b7 Exercise: Different forms of exercise can lower your stress, reduce depression and increase your energy level, balance, flexibility and ability to relax. \u00b7 Meditation: Meditation has many benefits including helping you with stress and anxiety and entering a place of stillness and calm. \u00b7 Massage: The release of serotonin and dopamine, and the decrease of cortisol during a massage may help improve the symptoms of depression, lessen pain and improve sleep. \u00b7 Yoga: The postures and movements in yoga teach you how to hold your body in a way that can make you feel stronger, better to breathe and function and to create an improved sense of overall wellbeing. \u00b7 Deep breathing: Focusing on taking slow, deep breaths, by counting to give when inhaling, then counting to five while exhaling, helps depression both physically and mentally. Conclusion Scientists have yet to agree about the effectiveness of the alternative therapies listed here. It is difficult to predict a prognosis. Part of the journey of using alternative therapies is that you will have to do some experimentation to figure out what works and what doesn't work for you. Some people who have used alternative therapies have had success, and others haven't. Stay in contact with your healthcare provider while you use these therapies. Many alternative therapies are not covered by insurance. You might have to pay out-of-pocket. However, there are free resources where you can learn about yoga and meditation, and you can exercise on your own (under your healthcare provider's supervision). Do some research about resources in your community and ask your healthcare provider for referrals. "}
