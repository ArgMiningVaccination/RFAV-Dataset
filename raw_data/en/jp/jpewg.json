As with any psychologically active compound, there is a chance that you will experience some side effects when you take THC gummies or other cannabis edibles.

Yes, the passing of the [Agriculture Improvement Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr2/BILLS-115hr2enr.pdf) of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Act, made it federally legal to manufacture and sell cannabis products provided they met certain conditions.
