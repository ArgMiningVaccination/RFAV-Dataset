Use of antipyretics to diminish fever correlates with 5% increase in mortality rates among humans with influenza Uncontrolled fever with extreme inflammatory resp onse is associated with worse outcomes in the case of sepsis and neurological diseases (Mayo Clinic, 2018 ) Fever Treatment: Quick Guide to Treating a Fever For healthy adults age 18 and older, rest and drink plenty of fluids for fever up to 102 deg rees Fahrenheit. Call doctor if also shortness of breath, stiff neck, severe headache, or other unusual symptoms. No need for antipyretics For healthy adults age 18 and older, take antipyretics for fever over 102. Call doctor if fever does not come down wi th medication or consistently over 103. Treatment will vary for adults taking chemotherapy or adults that are immunocompromised (Mayo Clinic, 2016 ) Diarrhea: Diagnosis and Treatment Most diarrhea is acute and will resolve on its own Diarrhea can be caused by antibiotics or other medications If diarrhea is caused by chronic condition, consult with a specialist for treatment The best treatment is replac ing lost electrolytes and fluids through water, juice and broth Avoid certain foods that could be cause such as dairy, fatty foods, spicy foods, and high -fiber foods Antidiarrheals may help but if bacterial or parasitic infection can actually worsen o Want the body to expel the bacteria or parasite causing the diarrhea so antidiarrheals will prevent this and possibly worsen infections Take probiotics to restore natural bacteria in gut, especially when taking antibiotics.

Evidence Table E : Fatal Four and Sepsis Author (s), Date Findings Relevant to Selecting Priority Group (Baily, 2017 ) The Fatal Four Fatal four often go undiagnosed in people with IDD because people do not recognize s/s Aspiration is the inhalation of food, fluid, medication or other foreign material into the trachea and lungs during or follow ing swallowing. People with IDD have increased risk factors for aspiration including decreased alertness, chronic chest congestion, and behavioral issues related to eating. Aspiration can lead to pneumonia, which often goes undiagnosed until symptoms are serious Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it produces. Dehydration can cause decreased cognitive ability, const ipation, increased seizure frequency, and in extreme cases coma and death. People that need assistance drinking or have impaired ability to feel thirsty are at an increased risk The most common causes of preventable death in people in community settings wi th IDD are due to complications related to constipation, such as bowel obstruction. Many medications can cause constipation and the longer it goes unaddressed, the more difficult it is to treat Individuals with IDD have a higher incidence of seizure disord ers or epilepsy. (Cedars -Sinai, 2019 ) Aspiration from Dysphagia Dysphagia is difficulty swallowing which can cause aspiration About 50% of people with dysphagia have aspiration Some signs and symptoms include \"Feeling that food is sticking in your throat or coming back into your mouth Pain when swallowing Trouble starting a swallow Coughing or wheezing after eating Coughing while drinking liquids or eating solids Chest discomfort or heartburn Fever 30 minutes to an hour after eating Too much saliva Feeling congested after eating or drinking Having a wet -sounding voice during or after eating or drinking Shortness of breath or fatigue while e ating Repeated episodes of pneumonia \" People may have silent aspiration meaning no signs and symptoms Some things to treat dysphagia can help prevent aspiration such as \"Changing your diet (such as thickening liquids or not having liquids) Changing your position while eating (such as eating upright, tilting your head back, or bending your neck forward) Not eating in bed Eating smaller bites of food Eating with supervision Not talking while eating Not being distracted during meals Eating when you are most alert Using tools such as straws Doing exercises to strengthen your lips and tongue Using special swallowing methods \" (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2018 ) Dehydration Dehydration can be caused by vomiting and diarrhea, fever, excessive sweating, decreased fluid intake, and increased urinatio n.

Sepsis is an extreme , life-threatening response to an infection in the body. It is caused when an infection continues to spread in the body and the immune system is una ble to fight it off alone. If it is not treated, it can lead to organ failure and death People at higher risk for sepsis include those with chronic diseases such as kidney disease, diabetes and cancer, people over the age of 65, children under 1 and people that are immunocompromised Some signs and symptoms include, shortness of breath, fast heart rate with low BP, fever with shivers and feeling cold, confusion or disorientation, clammy or sweaty, and extreme pain. Prevention: get vaccines as recommend ed by the CDC; take good care of chronic diseases ; wash hands regularly; clean out cuts and treat immediately , keep covered while still open Know the signs and symptoms and act immediately if you suspect sepsis Evidence Table F : Developmental Disabilities and Dementia Author (s), Date Findings Relevant to Selecting Priority Group (CDC, 2018 ) Facts About Developmental Disabilities Developmental disabilities are a group of conditions due to an impairment in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas. These conditions begin during the developmental period, may impact day -to-day functioning, and usually last throughout a person's lifetime. Developmental disabilities occur among all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. (AAIDD, 2018 ) Definition of Intellectual Disability Intellectual disability is a disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adap tive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills. This disability originates before the age of 18. Intellectual functioning \u2014also called intelligence \u2014refers to general mental capacity, such as learning, reasoning, problem solving Generally, an IQ test score of around 7 0 or as high as 75 indicates a limitation in intellectual functioning. \"Adaptive behavior is the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that are learned and performed by people in t heir everyday lives. \" \"Includes social skills, conceptual s kills (language, literacy, money, time, number concepts) , and practical skills (activities of daily living, occupation, \" \"Finally, assessments must also assume that limitations in individuals often coexist with strengths, and that a person's level of life functioning will improve if appropriate personalized supports are provided over a sustained period. \" When determining level of ability must consider the following \"community environment typical of the individual's peers and culture linguistic diversity cultural differences in the way people communicate, move, and behavior \" \"The goal is to enhance people's functioning within their own environment in order to lead a more successful and satisfying life. Some of this enhancement is thought of in terms of self -worth, subjective wellbeing , pride, engagement in political action, and other principles of self -identity. \" \"Intellectual Disability is no longer considered to be a static condition with no room for improving abilities \" (American Psychiatric Association, 2017 ) What is Intellectual Disability? Intellectual disability involves problem in general mental abilities including intellectual functioning (learning, problem solving, judgement) and adaptive functioning (activities of daily living such as communication and independent living) ID affects about 1% of the population and of those individuals about 85% are consi dered to have mild ID on a range of mild, moderate, severe Is determined during developmental years (before age 18) Specific full scaled IQ tests scores are not required for diagnosis but are still used as part of the process for diagnosing intellectual function. An I Q score of 75 or less indicate s significant limitation in intellectual functioning . IQ score must be considered in context of persons' difficulties in general mental abilities Adaptive functioning is also considered which includes: \"Conceptual - language, reading, writing, math, reasoning, knowledge, memory Social - empathy, social judgment, communication skills, the ability follow rules and the ability to make and keep friendships Practical - independence in areas such as personal ca re, job responsibilities, managing money, recreation and organizing school and work tasks \" Assessed with individual and interviews with others such as family and teachers (CDC, 2018 ) What is Cerebra l Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affect ability to maintain posture and mobility Most common movement disorder in children Ranges from severe requiring equipment to walk or may not be able to walk at all to mild in which a person may walk awkwardly but does not require equipment to walk Symptoms include \"Stiff muscles (spasticity) Uncontrollable movements (dyskinesia) Poor balance and coordination (ataxia) \" Common treatments include medicines; surgery; braces; and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. No single treatment is the best one for all children with CP. Before deciding on a treatment plan, it is important to talk with the child's doctor to un derstand all the risks and benefits. (Cerebral Palsy Alliance, 2018 ) How Does Cerebral Palsy Affect People? CP can affect posture, balance, ability to move, ability to communicate, move, eat, sleep a nd learn CP can vary from minimal symptoms and affects with movement to having very little to no control over body movements requiring 24-hour care 1 in 2 or 50% of people with CP have an intellectual disability 1 in 4 have a seizure disorder; CP with ID have a higher incidence of seizure disorder at 48% 1 in 3 have hip displacement 1 in 4 have bladder control issues Higher than average incidence with reflux disorders with 1 in 15 requiring a GT to eat 3 out of 4 experience pain from numerous causes such as hip displacement, skin breakdown , contractures, abnormal posturing (American Psychiatric Association, 2018 ) \"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. The effects of ASD and the severity of symptoms are differe nt in each person. \" What is autism spectrum disorder? First symptoms tend to develop around age 2 -3 years old Ranges from mild to severe and no two children with autism spectrum DO appear the same \"While many people with autism have normal intelligence, many others have mild or significant intellectual delays. Also, those with ASD are at greater risk for some medical conditions such as sleep problems, seizures and mental illnesses. \" Characteristics include: \"social interaction and communication problems, difficulty relating to people, things, and events, and restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities \" (Autism Speaks, 2019 ) DSM -5 Criteria Autism Spec trum Disorder is diagnosed based on \"Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts , Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history, Occur during developmental period \" Severity levels range from 1 -3 \"Level 3: Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others. For example, a person with f ew words of intel ligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and, when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches \" o Extreme difficulty coping, inflexibility in behavior , great distress with any changes \"Level 2: Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For exampl e, a person who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal communication. \" o Difficulty coping with change, inflexible behaviors, distress with changes \"Level 1: Without supports in p lace, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful response to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interacti ons. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to - and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful. \" o Inflexibility in behavior, difficul ty switching between activates (American Psychiatric Association, 2017 ) What is ADHD? \"Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought). \" It is more common among boys than girls and can affect adults as well as children \"Inattentive type - six (or five fo r people over 17 years) of the following symptoms occur frequently: Doesn't pay close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in school or job tasks. Has problems staying focused on tasks or activities, such as during lectures, conversations or lon g reading. Does not seem to listen when spoken to (i.e., seems to be elsewhere). Does not follow through on instructions and doesn't complete schoolwork, chores or job duties (may start tasks but quickly loses focus). Has problems organizing tasks and work (for instance, does not manage time well; has messy, disorganized work; misses deadlines). Avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as preparing reports and completing forms. Often loses things needed for tasks or daily life, su ch as school papers, books, keys, wallet, cell phone and eyeglasses. Is easily distracted. Forgets daily tasks, such as doing chores and running errands. Older teens and adults may forget to return phone calls, pay b ills and keep appointments. \" \"Hyperactive/impulsive type - six (or five for people over 17 years) of the following symptoms occur frequently: Fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat. Not able to stay seated (in classroom, workplace). Runs about or climbs where it is inap propriate. Unable to play or do leisure activities quietly. Always \"on the go,\" as if driven by a motor. Talks too much. Blurts out an answer before a question has been finished (for instance may finish people's sentences, can't wait to speak in conversati ons). Has difficulty waiting his or her turn, such as while waiting in line. Interrupts or intrudes on others (for instance, cuts into conversations, games or activities, or starts using other people's things without permission).
