By removing stressors to the nervous system through chiropractic adjustments, nutrition supplementation, and neurofeedback, we aim to release the innate ability of the body to self-heal and thrive CHIROPRACTIC CARE & Brain Based Wellness Information TESTIMONIALS I first visited Dr. Siebenaller a month ago after reading many reviews online. I was suffering from crippling lower back pain, that made it impossible for me to do normal daily tasks. I had never been to a chiropractor before, but my pain was so unbearable that I was willing to do anything to feel better. The first day I met with Dr. Siebenaller I was so bad that I could hardly stand up. He and my wife had to help me get through the door. Now, only a month later, I am back to my normal self. I have full movement and my back has never felt better. Words cannot describe how thankful I am for Dr. Siebenaller's help. I now reccomend Fully Alive Chiropractic to everyone I know suffering from any kind of back or neck issues. Stop living in miserable pain. Stop taking countless pain medications that do little to nothing to help ease the pain. Go see Dr. Siebenaller and get yourself back to normal When I first came to Dr Siebenaller he asked me what my goal was. With lower back problems I said to be able to get back into daily walking. With just a few treatments before going to DC on vacation, I was able to do a tremendous amount of walking around the city without any pain. I also experienced a Frozen Shoulder. I was very impressed with the personal concern and the amount of research he did to find the best treatment for my shoulder. He told me that some say it may take up to a year to fully recover. He told me we won't accept that. My shoulder is getting close to 100% after just a few short months. Now I'm on the maintenance program. He has also helped me lose 20lbs so far with his nutrition advice. Dr Nathan is very professional, very kind and very committed to your health. The office and staff are also a class act. Highly recommend and fully trust Dr Siebenaller. My husband and I have been going to chiropractors for many years with good results. However, Dr Nathan takes treatment to a much higher level. He treats the\"whole person\"; body, mind and spirit. When physical adjustments are necessary they are gentle yet effective. He is a \"one stop shop\" for all our holistic health care needs. We consider him our \"primary physician\" and the conventional medical system as supplemental when needed. I love Dr. Siebenaller's holistic approach. He focuses on wellness and I appreciate that greatly. I'm thankful his supplement recommendations are homeopathic as opposed to a prescription of some sort. His perspective of helping the body to repair itself blew me away. In a society where so many are focused on for hiding symptoms, Dr. Siebenaller stands out as correcting the problems, so that there aren't any symptoms.
