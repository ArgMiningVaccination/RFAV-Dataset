Roosevelt. It continues to offer outstanding medical care and advances in the art and science of medicine to the Midtown and Upper West Side neighborhoods. This booklet highlights the development of the Hospital itself, as well as its contributions to developing new ways to treat and care for patients in need. November 10: James Henry Roosevelt is born into a prosperous merchant family in NYC. He studies law at Harvard University. At the age of 30 years, just as he is establishing his legal career and becomes engaged to Julia Maria Boardman, a young woman from an old New Y ork family, he falls ill from an unknown ailment and becomes disabled, having difficulty walking without crutches. He breaks his engagement and closes his law office. Roosevelt did not become a bitter recluse, but decides to live frugally and manage his fortune to leave a legacy large enough to \"establish ... a hospital for the reception and relief of sick and diseased persons and for its permanent endowments.\"1800 November 30: James H. Roosevelt dies. His will leaves his fortune, just under one million dollars, to the named T rustees of what will be the Roosevelt Hospital.1863 1864 1864 1869 2 January 14: The Board of T rustees holds its first meeting at the home of James I. Roosevelt, a trustee of the future Roosevelt Hospital. February 2: The Act of Incorporation for Roosevelt Hospital is passed by New Y ork State Legislature. April 5: A plot of land, a square block plot bordered by West 58th and West 59th Streets and 9th and 10th Avenues, is purchased from Hospital T rustee Augustus Schell for $185,000. The land had been part of the old Somarindyck Farm which was originally part of a land grant from Gov. Nicolls in 1667, and had come into possession of the de Lancey family in 1729. That family lost it in the Revolutionary War because of T ory activities and it was sold in 1785 to John Somarindyck.October 29: The cornerstone for Roosevelt Hospital's first building is laid. General Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States, was present for the ceremony.1869 3 1871November 2: Roosevelt Hospital is dedicated and opens with 180 beds; a Medical Board is created to formulate medical policy, determine and enforce medical standards, and recommend appointments and promotions. Two services are established: the Medical Division and the Surgical Division. 1871November 8: The first patient is admitted to the Hospital. 1871April 25: T rustees approve the construction of a single story pavilion east of the Ward building for such cases as \"are either contagious or so much deteriorate the atmosphere as to require treatment in a separate ward.\" This building is named Surgical Ward V , depicted here, to the right of Syms. Copper plaque celebrating the event, hung in the lobby of the Administrative Building.41871Dr. W.D. Schuyler was appointed the first House Physician and Surgeon. 1874The Uterine Service is established under the Medical Division of Roosevelt Hospital. 1877 September 10: An ambulance service is instituted at Roosevelt Hospital, which takes over one of the casualty districts established by the City. The Hospital adds a shed and stable near the morgue building to house the horse-drawn carts. 1881 William Halsted, MD organizes an Out-Patient Dispensary in the basement of the Administration building and remains its director until 1886. The unit grows quickly and a new single floor building is added in 1885 to meet the growing need. 1882William Halsted, MD performs the first radical mastectomy for breast cancer in the Unites States at Roosevelt Hospital. 1885William Halsted, MD pioneers the use of cocaine anesthesia on peripheral nervous system for minor surgical operations (Nerve blocks).51885 December 31: Roosevelt Hospital opens a one-story out-patient building, prompted by the rapid growth of Halsted's Out-Patient Dispensary. The Out-Patient Department functions there until the opening of the T ower Clinic in 1953. 1886Robert Hall, MD performed and reported on what is thought to have been the United States' first survival of a patient after early surgical removal of a perforated appendix. Dr. Hall dies in 1897 - of a ruptured appendix. 1887The College of Physicians and Surgeons moves from E. 23rd St. and Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South) to a new building on 59th Street across from Roosevelt Hospital. Many of the original staff of Roosevelt were graduates and teachers at P&S, which may have instigated P&S students observing Roosevelt Hospital clinics and led to Roosevelt becoming the main teaching hospital for the school in the future. 1888December 1: The Uterine Division separates from Medical Service and changes its name to the Gynecological Division, with a staff of two physicians. 1888Robert F . Weir, MD joins the Roosevelt Hospital surgical staff. Characterized as \"one of the most brilliant surgeons of his time,\" he pioneers in rhinoplasty, and is among the first to adopt, urge the use of, and teach Lister's methods of antisepsis. He performed the first well documented total removal of an unequivocal brain tumor in America at New Y ork Hospital on March 9, 1887. 1889William J. Syms, a retired New Y ork arms merchant, bequeaths Roosevelt Hospital $350,000 in his will. Of this, $250,000, or \"as much as T rustees deemed proper,\" was for the creation of a surgical operating theater building with all desirable furnishings, appliances, and adjuncts, used for surgical purposes only, under the direction of Dr. Charles McBurney. Several years prior Syms had been a surgical patient of McBurney's and they had established a friendly relationship. The Syms Operating Theatre costs $200,000; the balance was set aside for 'future needs.'Syms Operating Theatre Out-Patient Department on the right.61890December 8: The James W. McLane, Jr. Gynecological Operating Room opens. The Gynecology Service, which started in 1874 as the Uterine Service, is growing and in need of a dedicated operating room. The room, the gift of Dr. James W. McLane, Roosevelt Hospital president, 1905- 1913, dedicated to the memory of his son, James W. McLane, Jr., is equipped with sterilizers, storage areas, and scrubbing facilities. It is a one-story, skylighted building that connects directly to the ground floor gynecology ward in the Ward building.James W. McLane Jr. Memorial Theatre 1892November 3: The Syms Operating Theatre at Roosevelt Hospital opens. Designed by architect W. Wheeler Smith, with input from Charles McBurney, MD, it was a gift of retired arms merchant William J. Syms. It was among a new generation of operating rooms equipped for aseptic surgery. It featured a tiered amphitheater accommodating 184 observers, and a conical skylight, which allowed for abundant natural light. The building included visitors' rooms; recovery rooms; living quarters for nurses, assistant surgeons, and a private chef; a surgeon's room; laboratory rooms; rooms for photography and microscopes; two small operating rooms; an ether room; and various preparation rooms for bandages, instrument sterilization, and storage. It had separate circulation systems for visitors, the surgical staff, patients, and residents of the building. Though considered the most modern surgical building when it opened, its final surgery was in 1941, when more up-to-date facilities were available in the Private Patients Pavilion. It was used as a mortuary for a time, and held the blood bank of the Hospital. In 1953 the interior was gutted and the Pathology Department took over the space. It fell into disuse in the 1970s. Its exteriors received landmark status in 1989. Since 2009 it has been the home of the Speyer Legacy School.First Public Clinic in Syms Amphitheatre 71893Dr. Charles H. McBurney first performs the McBurney incision, the classic procedure for appendectomies, at the Roosevelt Hospital; William Mayo, MD, of the future Mayo clinic, is in the audience. 1896November 16: The Roosevelt Hospital School of Nursing admits its first students: 27 transfer students and 7 probationary students. 1896 The Private Patients Pavilion: The one story Out-Patient Building, far right, is enlarged by an additional five stories to create a Private Patients Pavilion with floors to house the student nurses and interns. Private Patient floors opened November 19. 1896Roosevelt Hospital 'ex-internes' meet at the Hospital on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its opening and organize The Roosevelt Hospital Alumni Association. Its purpose is \"maintaining loyalty to the institution and promoting its broader usefulness.\" 1897Thomas L. Bennett, MD introduced the nitrous oxide-ether sequence for anesthesia, thought to be its first use in America. Bennett later designed the Bennett Inhaler, long considered standard equipment in anesthesia administration.81898 The two-story Accident Building opens in 1898. The first story is for treatment of emergency and accident cases. The second story, a medical ward for sick children, opens in 1899, equipped in memory of Netta Bolton Bliss by her sister, Catherine A. Bliss. It includes a 12-crib children's ward, which Abraham Jacobi, MD, widely known as the \"Father of American Pediatrics,\" directs. It is initially known as The Abraham Jacobi Ward for Sick Children, and is endowed in memory of Ella May Clark, by her husband. In 1903, Catherine A. Bliss endowed the ward in perpetuity, the name was changed to the Catherine A. Bliss Ward for Sick Children, and the building became known as the Bliss Building. Netta Bolton Bliss Ward 1898Roosevelt Hospital's Ward V is turned over to the United States Department of War during the Spanish-American War to provide care for troops from New Y ork and New Jersey training camps who fall ill with typhoid and other contagious diseases. 1899September: The first American to die as the result of an automobile accident, Henry Bliss, is brought to Roosevelt Hospital. 1899November: The Roosevelt Hospital School of Nursing Alumnae Association is organized when members of the classes of 1897, 1898, and 1899 meet in Directress Mary A. Samuel's office. The first elected officers were President Anna L. Thompson ('97); Vice President Nellie Lee ('97); Secretary- T reasurer Elizabeth M. Burns ('98), and T rustees Carbetta Jones ('97) and Helen Barker ('97). This first class worked to help form the States Nurses' Association in 1901 and helped in the passage of the Nurse Practice Act, in 1903. The Association is formally incorporated in 1914. 1900A Radiology Department is established at Roosevelt Hospital, located in the Ward Building.91900The horse-drawn ambulance carts are replaced by electric vehicles that \" travel sixteen miles an hour, weigh 4,800 pounds... and cost about $3,000.00 each.\" In 1903 they return to horse carts, which are cheaper and more dependable. 1906A visiting nurse for the Surgical Division of the Out-Patient Department is hired to oversee the recuperation of patients at home. That salary is provided by funding from Mr. Harkness, a Hospital T rustee. In 1908 another patron provides the funds for a nurse dedicated to securing appropriate convalescent housing for patients being discharged from the Hospital, but still in need of some level of medical oversight. These are the early positions that would lead to the establishment of a formal social services department. The early versions of this service are called the Relief Bureau and then the Bureau of Home Welfare (circa 1912), then the Department of Home Welfare (1915), and finally the Social Service Department in 1932. 1907Full length \"fresh air balconies,\" 13 feet wide by 107 feet long, are added on the eastern side of the wards in the old Ward building. Balconies-Medical Pavilion 1908A new laboratory building is erected alongside the corridor between the Medical and Surgical Pavilions, providing room for pathological and bacteriological laboratories, and allowing the means to keep pace with the rapidly developing fields of bacteriology, physiological chemistry, and serum therapy, with rooms for clinical records, a new roof garden adjoining the children's medical ward, and one adjoining the children's surgical ward. The lab opens March 1, 1909, operating under the direction of Dr. Eugene Hodenpyl. 101908The Roosevelt Hospital ambulance service is discontinued completely due to high operational costs, including the legal costs of frequent accidents. It is estimated that the service answered some 80,000 calls in its 30 years of service. 1910Karl Connell, MD becomes assistant surgeon at Roosevelt Hospital. During his tenure, he developed the celebrated Connell anesthetometer, the Connell airway, and the Connell meter for measuring gas flow. He also perfected a gas mask, the Connell Mask, which was used by the armed forces during World War I. 1911 January 1: A new Nurses' Residence building, which is erected largely through the untiring efforts of Dr. James W. McLane, Hospital President, and surgeon, opens. Plot Plan of the Hospital Block with new Nurses' Residence on right. 1912A fireproof building is erected by Dr. Lewis R. Morris for use of the Harriman Research Laboratory. The two-story brick building is used for research in metabolism and digestive ferments being conducted by the chemists of that staff under the direction of Dr. William G. Lyle. 1913Pediatrics is recognized as a distinct service with Rowland G. Freeman as its attending. 1913Philip Van Ingen, MD joined the staff as pediatrician, eventually becoming Director of Pediatrics.

Russell Memorial Building161949Initially sponsored by the Volunteer Department, the Occupational Therapy Department is developed slowly and now requires full-time personnel. 1949September: The ambulance service extends to include the west side of Lexington Avenue. This change was requested by the Hospital in an effort to render service consistent with the professional staff and equipment available. Two new ambulances were purchased to replace those bought in 1946. 1949While the ground work for the creation of the Division of Psychiatry is being formulated, New Y ork State invites Roosevelt Hospital to host the New Y ork State Psychiatric Pilot Plan, which is based on the assumption that early recognition and treatment of psychiatric problems will greatly reduce the necessity of institutionalizing these patients in later life. Under this program a psychiatrist will be assigned to each medical, surgical, and specialty division in the Hospital and out-patient services. The Psychiatric Department in the Out- Patient Service will also be expanded to conform to the Pilot Plan. The department and pilot program are under the direction of Dr. Robert W. Laidlaw. 1950 A Psychiatry Fellowship is initiated in the Out-Patient Clinic. 1950The Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation is formally established. 1950J.

The unit employs 50 grams of radium, loaned to Roosevelt Hospital from Belgium's Union Miniere du Haut Katanga, the largest radium pack ever accumulated in one unit in the world. This facility will be entirely underground and will be located between the proposed T ower Building and the Russell Building. The Clinic treated its first patient on March 17. Arrival of 50 Gram Radium Unit from Belgium, 1952.181952The Cytopathology Laboratory opens. 1952May 12: Formal affiliation with Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons is signed. The Board of T rustees approved the formal affiliation on October 24, 1951. For many years the Hospital has had an informal agreement with CU.

Plans to convert the old Harriman Lab into a modern animal research laboratory to accommodate the needs of this program are underway. 1954A Department of Electroencephalography, under the Directorship of Dr. Bernard L. Pacella, was established at the Hospital in October. Funds secured by Dr. Arthur J. Antenucci made possible the purchase of the equipment for this department and are helping to support it on a maintenance basis. Miss Alberta Domalakes, formerly with the New Y ork University-Bellevue Medical Center, is appointed Chief Electroencephalography T echnician and is serving on a fulltime basis. The electroencephalograph, which is a diagnostic instrument used in psychiatric, neurological, neurosurgical, and general medical work, records brain waves and is an important aid in determining pathology of the brain. 1955January: A gift of $10,000 from the Vivian B. Allen Foundation is presented to the Hospital to establish a scholarship fund for nurses at the student and graduate level. Part of the funds will be used to help students enter the School of Nursing and part to help nurses acquire advanced degrees. It was named the A. Isabelle Byrne-Mary L.

Maxwell Chamberlain, MD, Chief of Thoracic Surgery, develops and reports on a technique of segmental pulmonary resection for the treatment of tuberculosis. The procedure is universally adopted and represented a major step in the development of the specialty of thoracic surgery.201956Psychiatric in-patient facilities for adults and children are made available when the 9th floor of the Joseph T . T ower Memorial Building opens for patient care. A 16-bed unit is the final step in the integration of psychiatry into all phases of the hospital on both an in- and out-patient basis. A new pediatric floor opens in the T ower Building, with two suites that include rooms for parents of hospitalized children, as well as separate private and semi-private pediatric facilities for the first time in the history of the Hospital. Built and furnished at a cost of more than $250,000 as a memorial to the late Bayard Dominick, this service is located on the 8th floor of the T ower Building, adjacent to the existing children's ward. In keeping with developments in pediatrics care the unit has unlimited visiting hours, and allows mothers to help with the bathing, feeding, and care for their children. The new floor holds 14 patients. The James I. Russell ED (left), T ower Clinic (center), and Syms Operating Theatre (right), circa 1950s. 1956An out-patient psychiatric clinic for adolescents opens on April 11, the first in a New Y ork City voluntary hospital. 1956Mrs. Harriet Bush is elected President of the Board of T rustees of the Hospital, the first woman to be elected to this post in the history of the Hospital.

Their uniquely designed square bodies afford room to carry four patients on stretchers, in double-decker fashion, or eight persons seated. \"The approach to design was a radical departure from the traditional concept of streamlining, since the Hospital was interested primarily in creating a functionally safe mobile unit permitting more efficient patient care,\" stated Executive VP Peter B. T erenzio, President and Director of the Hospital. The new two-tone gray ambulances were the gift of the J.P . Stevens Company, a textile concern, and the Theodore Luce Foundation. 1957After two years of searching studies the Board of T rustees approves an $8 million Progress Fund campaign which is launched publicly this year. The $1 million modernization program nearly completed this year is phase 1 of the overall project. Phase 2 provides for construction of a new building, presently including a clinical lab with facilities for research and obstetrical service, a surgical suite of 8 ORs, a recovery room for 24 patients, a urological suite, a battery of diagnostic labs, semi-private rooms, headquarters for 300 volunteers, an auditorium, and conference rooms for teaching. 1957Plans for the destruction of the last original hospital building, the 1869 Administration Building, at right, to make way for the new Garrard Winston Memorial Building, are announced; destruction to begin in spring 1958, construction in fall 1958.
