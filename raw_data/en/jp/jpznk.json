Important Questions Answers Why this Matters: What is the overall deductible ? Student Health & Counseling Center (SHAC) provider $0 Individual/ N/A Family UNM Health s (combined) $250 Individual/ $500 Family Doesn't apply to prevent ive care, prescription drugs , and services that charge a copay . Copays don't count toward the overall deductible. You must pay all the costs up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay for covered services you use. Check your policy or plan document to see when the deductible starts over (usually, but not always, January 1st). See the chart starting on page 2 for how much you pay for covered services after you meet the deductible . Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You don't ha ve to meet deductibles for specific services, but see the chart starting on page 2 for other costs for services this plan covers. Is there an out-of- pocket limit on my expenses? Yes. Student Health & Counseling Center (SHAC) , UNM Health & PPO p roviders (combined) $6,350 Individual/ $12,700 Family The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay during a coverage period (usually one year) for your share of the cost of covered services. This limit helps you plan for health care expenses. What is not incl uded in the out-of-pocket limit ? Premiums, penalty amounts, balance -billed charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out- of-pocket limit . Is there an overall annual limit on what the plan p ays? No. The chart starting on page 2 describes any limits on what the plan will pay for specific covered services, such as office visits. Does thi s plan use a network of providers ? Yes. Please call 1-844-866-2224 or see https://unm.myahpcare.com . If you use an in -network doctor or other health care provider , this plan will pay some or all of the costs of covered services. Be aware, your in - network doctor or hospital may use an out -of-network provider for some services. Plans use the term in -network, preferred , or participating for providers in their network . See the chart starting on page 2 for how this plan pays different kinds of providers . Do I need a referral to see a specialist ? No. You don't need a referral to see a specialist. You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan. Are there services this plan doesn't cover? Yes. Some of the services this plan doesn't cover are listed on page 5. See your policy or plan document for additional information about excluded services . 2 of 8 Copayments are fixed dollar amounts (for example, $15) you pay for covered health care, usually when you receive the service. Coinsurance is your share of the costs of a covered service, calculated as a percent of the allowed amount for the service. For example, if the plan's allowed amount for an overnight hospital stay is $1,000, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $200. This may change if you haven't met your deductible . The amount the plan pays for covered services is based on the allowed amount . If an out-of-network provider charges more than the allowed amount , you may have to pay the difference. For example, if an ou t-of-network hospital charges $1,500 for an overnight stay and the allowed amount is $1,000, you may have to pay the $500 difference. (This is called balance billing .) This plan may encourage you to use Student Health & Counseling Cente r (SHAC) providers by charging you lower deductibles , copayments and coinsurance amounts.

Does this Coverage Provide Minimum Essential Coverage? The Af fordable Care Act requires most people to have health care coverage that qualifies as \"minimum essential coverage.\" This plan or policy does provide minimum essential coverage. Does this Coverage Meet the Minimum Value Standard? The Affordable Care Act establishes a minimum value standard of benefits of a health plan. The minimum value standard is 60% (actuarial value). This health coverage does meet the minimum value standard for the benefits it provides.

If you aren't clear about any of the underlined terms used in this form, see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/SBCUniformGlossary.pdf or call 1- 844-866-2224 to request a copy. Questions and answers abou t the Coverage Examples: What are some of the assumptions behind the Coverage Examples? Costs don't include premiums . Sample care costs are based on national averages supplied by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and are n't specific to a particular geographic area or health plan. The p atient's condition was not an excluded or preexisting condition. All services and treatments started and ended in the same coverage period. There are no other medical expenses for any member covered under this plan. Out-of-pocket expenses are based only on treating the condition in the example. The patient received all care from in- network providers . If the patient had received care from out-of-network providers , costs would have been higher. What does a Coverage Example show? For each treatment situation, the Coverage Example helps you see how deductibles , copayments , and coinsurance can add up. It also helps you see what expenses might be left up to you to pay because the service or treatment isn't cove red or payment is limited . Does the Coverage Example predict my own care needs? No. Treatments shown are just examples . The care you would receive for this condition could be different based on your doctor's advice, your age, how serious your condition is, and many other factors. Does the Coverage Example predict my future expenses? No. Coverage Examples are not cost estimators. You can't use the examples to estimate costs for an actual condition. Th ey are for comparative purposes only. Your own costs will be different depending on the care you receive, the prices your providers charge, and the reimbursement your health plan allows. Can I use Coverage Examples to compare plans? Yes. When you look at the Summary of Benefits and Coverage for other p lans, you'll find the same Coverage Examples . When you compare plans, check the \"Patient Pays\" box in each example. The smaller that number, the more coverage the plan provides. Are there other costs I should consider when comparing plans? Yes. An important cost is the premium you pay. Generally, the lower your premium , the more you'll pay in out -of- pocket costs, such as copayments , deductibles , and coinsurance . You should also consider contributions to accounts such as health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible spending arrangements (FSAs) or health reimbursement accounts (HRAs) that help you pay out-of-pocket expenses .

Home study, correspondence,Internet classes and television (TV) courses do not fulfill the eligibility requirements that the student must activelyattend classes. The Company maintains its right to investigate student status and attendance records to verify that theeligibility requirements have been met. If the Company disc overs the eligibility requirements have not been met, the only obligation is refund of premium. No eligibility rules or variations in premium will be imposed based on a Student's health status, medical condition, claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurab ility, disability, or any other health status factor. A Student will not be discriminated against for coverage under this Policy on the basis of race, color, national origin, disab ility, age, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Variations in the administration, processes or benefits of this Policy that are based on clinically indicated, reasonable management practices, or are part of permitted wellness incentives, disincentives and/or other programs do not constitute discrimination. DISCONTINUANCE OF INSURANCE TERMINATION DATE OF INSURANCE An Insured's coverage will end on the earliest of the date: Sthe Policy terminates; Sthe Insured is no longer eligible; or Sthe period ends for which premium is paid. A Dependent's coverage will end on the earliest of the date: She or she is no longer a Dependent; Sthe Insured's coverage ends; or Sthe period ends for which premium is paid; or Sthe Policy terminates. REFUND OF PREMIUM A pro- rata refund of premium will be made only in the event: Sof a Covered Person's death; or Sthe Covered Person enters full- time active duty in any Armed Forces; and SWe receive proof of such active duty service ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS Eligible students who enroll may also insure their Dependents. Dependent enrollment must take place at the initialtime of student enrollment (or within 30 days, if the premium is billed on the student's tuition); exceptions to this rule are made for newborn or adopted children, or for dependents who become eligible for coverage as the result of a qualifying event. (Please see \"Qualifying Events,\" page 3, for more details.) \"Dependent\" 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Partner; or an Insured's child, stepchild, child of a Covered Person's Domestic Partner, foster child, dependent grandchild or spouse's dependent grandchild; or a child who is adopted by theInsured or placed for adoption with the I nsured, or for whom the Insured is a party in a suit for the adoption of the child; or a child whom the Insured is required to insure under a medical support order i ssued or enforceable by the courts.

Proof of the child's condition and dependence must be submitted to the Company within 31 days after the date the child ceases to qualify as a dependent, under this plan, for the reasons listed above. During the next two years, the Company may, from time totime, require proof of the continuation of such condition and dependence. After that, the Company may requireproof no more than once a year. Dependent coverage is available only if the student is also insured. Dependent coverage must take place within the exact same coverage period as the Insured's; therefore, it will expire concurrently with the Insured's plan. A newborn child will be covered for the first 31 days following the child's birth, provided the covered student: 1) Enrolls the child within 31 days of birth, and 2) pays any required additional premium.

Note: UNM Student Health Plan cannot use genetic information or require genetic testing in order to determine or to limit or deny coverage. WHEN COVERAGE BEGINS UNM Student Health Plan will determine your effec tive date of coverage accordin g to the provisions of the Administrative Services Agreement. This Plan does not cover any service received before your effective d ate of coverage (which, for eligible fa mily members, may be later than the subscriber's effective date). Also, if your prior coverage has an extension of benefits provision, this Plan will not cover those charges incurred after your effective date that are covered under the prior benefit plan. CHANGES TO COVERAGE After initial enrollment, you may need to add eligible family members to, or remove them from your coverage, update your address, or switch from Individual to Family coverage, or vice versa.10 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Your ability to change coverage types (e.g., from Family to Individual coverage, etc.) will depend on the rules and regulations set forth by the University of New Mexico. Please contact Academic HealthPlans at (855) 865-0352 to findout when you can change your coverage type or remove a person from your coverage. ADDING A FAMILY MEMBER TO COVERAGE A subscriber may apply for coverage of an eligible family member (such as a new spouse or a newborn child). Within 31 days of acquiring the newly eligible family member, the subscriber must: Srequest that the student notify Academic Health Plans of the change, Scomplete and submit all necessary enrollment/change forms and legal documentation of proof of dependency, and Spay any additional premium or other employee contribution for coverage, which may mean changing, for example, from Individual to Family coverage. Adding a Spouse or a Domestic Partner If a subscriber adds coverage for a spouse within 31 days of marriage, the effective date of the new eligible family member's coverage will be no later tha n the first of the month following the date your group received the completed and signed enrollment/change application form. If the subscriber does not submit a completed and signed enrollment/change application form to his/her benefits administrator or to BCBSNM (or to the COBRA administrator), along with necessary documentation and, if required, change from Individual (or Employee +Child(ren) coverage, if applicable) to Family coverage within 31 days of marriage, the spouse may not be added to coverage except as a late applicant (or as specified under \"Special Enrollment\" later in this section). You may also have the option of applying for a Two- Person (Empl oyee + Spouse) coverage type. Ask your employer which coverage types are available to you. For example, if you are applying for coverage for a new spouse and his/her eligible child(ren), you will have to change to Family coverage. See \"Adding an Eligible Child,\" below. Domestic partners and their eligible children may be added to existing coverage only during the open enrollment period. Adding an Eligible Child If you do not submit an application for an eligible child or add additional coverage, if required, within the time frames below, the child will be considered a late applicant , except as specified under \"Special Enrollment.\" Newborn Children You must add coverage for the newborn within 31 days of the birth in order for newborn care to be covered beyond 48 hours for a routine delivery or greater than 96 hours for a C - section delivery. If the application is not received within 31 days and additional premium or other employee contributions for coverage, if any, are not paid, the newborn is considered a late applicant. Note: If the parent of the newborn is an eligible child of the subscriber (i.e., the newborn is the subscriber's grandchild), benefits are notavailable for the newborn. Adopted Children A child placed in the subscriber's home f or the purposes of adoption may be a dded to coverage as soon as the child is placed in the home. However, application for coverage can be made as late as 31 days following legal adoption without being considered late. (Although a child over the age of 18 is not eligible for adoption, an adopted child is covered as any other child, subject to the same eligible child age limitations and restrictions.) Note: An adopted child who is not enrolled within 31 days of adoption or placement in the home will be considered a late applicant unless the child was previously enrolled in a student health plan or other creditable coverage within 30 days ofhis/her adoption or placement f or adoption and has had prior c reditable coverage since that date with no significant lapse (i.e., 63 or more days). Legal Guardianship Application for coverage must be made for a child for whom the subscriber or the subscriber's spouse becomes the legal guardian within 31 days of the court or administrative order granting guardianship.11 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Stepchild Application for coverage must be made for a stepchild within 31 days of the marriage to the stepchild's biological parent. Court Ordered Coverage for Children When an employee or employer is required by a court or administrative order to provide coverage for an eligible child, the eligible child may be enrolled in the subscrib er's Family coverage, or Employee/Children coverage, if available and will notbe considered a late applicant. (If the subscriber has Individual or Two-Person coverage, he/she may be required to pay additional premium in order for the eligible child to be added.) If not specified inthe court or administrative order, the eligible child's ef fective date of coverage will be the date the order has been filed as public record with the State or the effective dat e of Family coverage, or Employee/Children coverage, if available, whichever is later. UNM Student Health Plan must receive a copy of the court or administrative order. LATE APPLICANT Unless eligible for a special enrollment, applications from the following enrollees will be considered late: Sanyone not enrolled within 31 days of becoming eligible for coverage under this Plan (e.g., a newborn child added to coverage more than 31 days after birth when, for example, Family coverage (or Employee/Children coverage, if available) is not already in effect, a child added more than 31 days after legal adoption, or a new spouse or stepchild added more than 31 days after marriage) Sanyone enrolling on the group's initial BCBSNM enrollme nt date who was not covered under the group's prior plan (but who was eligible for such coverage) Sanyone eligible but not enrolled during the group's initial enrollment Sanyone who voluntarily terminates his/her coverage and applies for reinstatement of such coverage at a laterdate (except as a provider under USERRA of 1994) Application for coverage from late applicants will be accepte d only during your group's open enro llment period, except as described under \"Special Enrollment for Active E mployees and Their Eligible Family Members\" and under \"Switch Enrollment and Changes in Plan,\" provisions of this Section 2. ENROLLMENT Student are automatically enrolled and it is the stude nt responsibility to waiver out of coverage semester if they have other coverage. SPECIAL ENROLLMENT There are four instances (\"qualifying events\") in which an eligible person can obtain a \"special enrollment\" right (see definition in Section 10: Definitions. You have a limited amount of time during which you may request a special enrollment. If you do not request special enrollment within the time period specified below, you will be considered a late applicant. Note: There are no special enrollments for persons applying for any continuation coverage if offered under your Plan. You must enroll in these coverages timely. Qualifying Events The four instances of special enrollment are: Loss of Prior CoverageAn eligible student who declined coverage when initially eligible b ecause of having other comprehensive medical coverage and who later involuntarily loses the other coverage (or who reaches a life time maximum under the prior benefit plan), may apply for coverage for himself/herself and eligible family members. (The eligible family members need not have been covered under the prior benefit plan when the employee has beengranted a special enrollment under this provision.) Currently enrolled students may also add eligible family12 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224members to coverage under this provision if the eligible family member had prior creditable coverage that was involuntarily lost or had reached life time benefit maximum under the other carrier's benefit plan. (See definition of \"involuntary loss of coverage\" in Section 10: Definitions.\") If a completed and signed enrollment/change form is r eceived within 31 days of losing the other coverage (or within 31 days of receiving the first denial notice informing the student or eligible fa mily member that he/she had reached a life time limit), the applicant(s) will notbe considered late. Documentation from the prior carrier - supporting the fact that the person had prior creditable coverage that waslost involuntarily - may be submitted at a later date, but the student must submit the completed and signed enrollment/change form within 31 days of the loss of coverage (or denial notice). Note: Enrollment changes cannot be processed until all documentation is provided. If the student lost prior coverage, special enrollmen t is available to the student and any eligible family members of the employee (including spouse). If an eligible family member of the student lost prior coverage, special enrollment is available for the affected eligible family member and the student (not other eligible family members). The choice to quit paying premiums, for example, because the subscriber or one family member under the other carrier's benefit plan r eaches a life time benefit maximum in notan example of involuntary loss of coverage for the entire family. However, in the case of one eligible family member losing prior coverage, although all family members may not be eligible for a \"special\" enrollment, eligible family members may be enrolled at the same time as the special enrollee, subject to late applicant provisions. Also, in order to be eligible for a special enrollment due to loss of prior coverage, the declining person must havecompleted a waiver of coverage statement when first eligible to enroll, and the reason stated for decliningcoverage must have been due to having other coverage. If a student requests a special enrollment for self only, eligible family member(s) only, or both, Academic Health Plans may require proof of loss of coverage or proof of the date of the event. Change in Family Status A student who acquires a new eligible family member due to marriage, birth, adoption, or pl acement for adoption may apply for a special enrollment in this Plan for himself/herself and other family members who are eligible for coverage under this Plan. Application for special enrollment of the student and his/her eligible family members will notbe considered late if submitted within 31 days of the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement of the eligible child in the subscriber's home. If sub mitted more than 31 days following the change in family status, special enrollment is not available. SNewborn or Adopted Child: For a change in family status due to birth of an eligible newborn or adoption of a child, coverage begins on the date of birth or adoption (or, if earlier, on the date of placement in thesubscriber's home). SMarriage: The effective date of coverage for all persons granted a special enrollment due to marriage will be the same as the new spouse's effective date of coverage as described under \"Adding An Eligible FamilyMember to Coverage.\" This right to special enrollment upon a change in family status applies to the student and to all eligiblefamily members. Establishing a new domestic partnership and adding a child to coverage due to a court order are notconsidered a change in family status for purposes of the \"Special Enrollment\" provision. Loss of Medicaid/SCHIP Eligibility If an eligible student or his/her eligible family member is not currently enrolled in the Plan and loses eligibility under Medicaid or under a state child health plan (SCHIP), the person losing such coverage may enroll in the Plan without being considered a late applicant. To be eligible for special enrollment, the person must apply for coverage under the student health plan no later than 60 days after the date of termination of Medicaid or SCHIP coverage. (In order for an eligible family member to be eligible for special enrollment, the student must becovered under the student health plan. If the student is not enrolled in the Plan when the eligible family memberbecomes eligible for assistance, the student must en roll into the Plan at the same time as the eligible family member.) Documentation from the state - supporting the fact that the person had Medicaid/SCHIP coverage thatwas lost involuntarily - may be submitted at a later date with the employer's approval, but the employee must13 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224submit the completed and signed enrollment/change form within 60 days of the loss of coverage. Note: Enrollment changes cannot be processed until all documentation is provided to the University. If the student lost Medicaid/SCHIP coverage, special enrollment is available to the current University and any eligible family members of the student (including spouse). If an eligible family member of the current student lost Medicaid/SCHIP coverage, special enrollment is available for the affected eligible family member and the student (not other eligible family members). Medicaid/SCHIP Student Health Plan Premium Assistance Eligibility A state may offer premium subsidies through Medicaid or a state child health plan (SCHIP) to low- income children and their families for qualified University- sponsored coverage. This includes premium assistance forcontinuation coverage under federal or state law. Therefore, if an eligible student or an eligible family member is not enrolled in the Plan and later becomes eligible for student health plan premium assistance under Medicaid or under SCHIP, the eligible person may enroll in the Plan without being considered a late applicant. To beeligible for special enrollment, the affected person must apply for coverage through the University no later than60 days after becoming eligible for premium assistance. (In or der for a family member to be eligible for special enrollment, the student must be covered under the University's health plan. If the student is not enrolled in thePlan when the eligible family member b ecomes eligible for assistance, the student must enroll in to the Plan at the same time as the eligible family member.) Documentation from the state - supporting the fact that the person is eligible for premium assistance from Medicaid or SCHIP - may be submitted at a later date with the University's approval, but the student must submit the completed and signed enrollment/change form within 60 days of the affected person's premium assistance eligibility date. Note: Enrollment changes cannot be processed until all documentation is provided to the University. The current student who is eligible but not enrolled for coverage under the terms of the student health plan (or a dependant of such an student who is eligible but not enrolled for student health plan coverage under such terms) may enroll in the student health plan upon becoming eligible for a state premiumassistance subsidy under Medicaid or SCHIP if special enrollment is requested in a timely manner. Applying for Special Enrollment Application for special enrollment must be made within the time period specified for each of the qualifying events above in order to qualify you and/or your eligible family member(s) for a special enrollment right. Please contact Academic Health Plans for details about special enrollment privileges that apply to you and your eligible family members.

Whenyou need health care, you have the choice of obtaining benefits from the Student Health and Counseling Center (SHAC), UNM Health Provider or a Preferred Provider. It's important to understand the differences between them. When you receive treatment or schedule a surgery or a dmission, ask each of your providers if he/she is a BCBSNM preferred provider. (A physician's or other provider's contract may be separate from the facility's contract.) Yourchoice can make a difference in the amount you pay and the benefits available to you unless otherwise specified in the Plan. Services obtained from Out- of- Network Providers (any provider outside the UNM Health Network or BCBSNM PPO Network) will not be paid EXCEPT for ambulance and emergency services. Your Choices Covered Charges *For covered charges related to claims from providers that contract directly with BCBSNM, see \"Covered Charges\" in Section 8: Claims Payments and Appeals. *For covered charges related to claims from out- of- network providers, see \"Exceptions for Non- preferred Providers\" later in this Section 3: How Your Plan Works. *For covered charges related to claims from providers outside New Mexico, see \"BlueCard\" in Section 8: Claims Payments and Appeals. PROVIDER DIRECTORY AND ONLINE PROVIDER FINDER When you need medical care, there are a variety of ways you can choose a UNM Health Provider or Primary Preferred Provider (PPP) or other preferred provider in your area. You can also access mental health providers (including those specializing in chemical dependency) and participating pharmacies. Note: Only those providers listed under Family Practice, General Practice, Internal Medicine, Gynecology, Obstetrics/Gynecology and Pediatrics are considered Primary Preferred Providers (PPPs). See \"Cost-Sharing Features,\" later in this section for details. Whichever method you choose, the provider directory gives each provide r's specialty, the language spoken in the office, the office hours, and other information such as whe ther the office is handicapped accessible. (To find this information on the website directory, click on the doctor's name once you have found one you want to know more about.) The website directory also gives you a map to the provider's office. Note: Providers who are listed in the directory as having a \"participating\" contract are not\"preferred\" providers (unless they are also listed as having a \"preferred\" provider contract). You will not receive the \"Preferred Provider\" benefit level when receiving services from a \"participating\" network provider. You must use providers in the \"preferred\" provider network in order to obtain the highest level of benefit under this Plan for nonemergency care. However, if you live in or travel to a state that does not offer Preferred Provider contracts, you can receive the \"Preferred Provider\" benefit level by visiting \"participating\" providers in that state. If you are in an emergency situation, call 911 if necessary or go directly to the nearest emergency room. Although provider directories are current as of the date show n at the bottom of each page of a printed directory or as of the date an Internet site was last updated, the network and/ or a particular provider's status can change without notice. To verify a provider's current status, request a current directory, request a paper copy of a directory (free of charge), or if you have any questions about the directory, contact a UNM Health Customer Care. It is also a good idea to speak with a provider's office staff directly to verify whether or not they belong to the BCBS Preferred Provider networkbefore making an Customer Service: 844-866-2224Web- Based BCBSNM Provider Finder To find a Preferred Provider in New Mexico or along the border of neighboring states, please visit the Provider Finder section of the BCBSNM website for a list of network providers: www.bcbsnm.com The website is the most up- to- date resource for finding providers and also has an Internet link to the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association website for services outside New Mexico.

The initial benefit period is from a member's effective date of coverage, but ends on the date it would normally end, which may be less than 12 months. BENEFIT LIMITS There is no general lifetime maximum benefit under this Plan. However, certain services have separate benefit limits per admission or per plan year. (See the Summary of Benefits for details.) Benefits are determined based upon the coverage in effect on the day a ser vice is received, an item is purchased, or a health care expense is incurred. For inpatient services, benefits are based upon the coverage in effect on the date ofadmission, except that if you are an inpatient at the time your coverage either begins or ends, benefits for the admissionwill be available only for those covere d services received on and af ter your effectiv e date of coverage or those received before your termination date. COST-SHARING FEATURES For some services, you will pay only a fixed- dollar amount copayment for covered charges. In other cases, you willhave to meet a deductible and pay a percentage of the covered charge (preferred providers will not bill you for amounts in excess of the covered charge). When you receive a number of services during a single visit or procedure, you may have to pay both a copayment and a deductible (if applicable) plus a percentage of the covered charges that are notincluded in the copayment. Refer to your Summary of Benefits for details. YOUR DEDUCTIBLE Your deductible (if applicable) is the amount of covered charges that you must pay in a plan year before this Planbegins to pay its share of the applicable (preferred or nonpreferred provider) covered charges you incur during the sameplan year. If the deductible amount rema ins the same during the plan year, you pay it only once each plan year, and it applies to all preferre d or nonpreferred provider cove red services you receive during that plan year. Individual Deductible The individual deductible amounts indicated on your Summary of Benefits apply to the UNM Health and BCBSNM network benefits. Once a member's deductible payments for the UNM Health or the BCBSNM preferred provider services reach the individual deductible amount, this Pla n will begin paying its shar e of that member's covered preferred provider charges. Services performed at the Student Health and Counseling Center (SHAC) are not subject the individual deductible. Covered charges for preferred provider services are notapplied to the nonpreferred provider deductible and covered charges for nonpreferred providers are notapplied to the preferred provider deductible.18 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Family Deductible An entire family meets the applicable annual deductible when the total deductible amount for all family members reaches the amount specified on your se parately issued Summary of Benefits. (The deductible amounts for three or more family members are combined to satisfy the family deductible.) Note: If a member's Individual deductible is met, no more charges incurred by that member may be used to satisfy the applicable Family deductible. What Is Not Subject to the Deductible The following are not applied to the annual deductible: Scharges covered under \"Prescription Drugs and Other Items\" SPrimary Preferred Provider office visit copayments Sthe following services when receive d from preferred providers: preventive care, routine diagnostic tests, (excluding MRIs, PET scans, and CT scans) Admissions Spanning Two Plan Years If a deductible has been met while you are an inpatient and the admission continues into a new plan year, no additional deductible is applied to that admission's covered services. However, all other services received during the new plan year are subject to the deductibles for the new plan year. Timely Filing Reminder Most benefits are payable only after BCBSNM's records show that the applicable deductible has been met. Preferred providers and providers that have \"participating-only\" provider agreements with BCBSNM will fileclaims for you and must submit them within a specified amount of time (usually 180 days). If you file your ownclaims for covered services from nonparticipating providers, you must file them within 12 months of the date of service. If a claim is returned for further information, resubmit it within 45 days. SeeSection 8: Claim Payments and Appeals for details. COPAYMENTS When you visit a preferred provider in his/her office, th e office visit charge is subject to the PPP office visit copayment described below. Other services received during the visit, services of other preferred providers, and theservices of nonpreferred providers are subject to the deductible, coinsurance, and out- of- pocket limit provisionsdescribed below. Office Visit Copayment When you receive office services from a preferred provider, you pay only a fixed-dollar amount (or copayment), for his/her covered office visit charge . The copayments for \"Primary Preferred Provider\" (PPP) and PPO Specialist office visits are listed on the Summary of Benefits. However, all other services received during the office visit (such as physical therapy or chemotherapy) will be subject to regular deductible and/or coinsurance requirements and/or to an additional copayment as listed on the Summary of Benefits. Primary Preferred Provider (PPP) is a preferred provider in one of the following medical specialties only: Family Practice; General Practice; Internal Medicine; O bstetrics/Gynecology; Gyn ecology; or Pediatrics. PPPs donotinclude physicians specializing in any other fields such as Obstetrics only, Geriatrics, Pediatric Surgery or Pediatric Allergy. Preferred (PPO) Specialist is a practitioner of the healing arts who is in the Preferred Provider Network - but does not belong to one of the specialties defined above as being for a \"Primary Preferred Provider\" (or \"PPP\"). A PPO Specialist does not include hospitals or other treatment facilities, urgent care facilities, pharmacies, equipment suppliers, ambulance companies, or similar ancillary health care providers. Drug Plan Copayment When you purchase covered prescription drugs and other items through the drug plan, your responsibility may be either a fixed-dollar amount or a percentage of the covered charge. (You may also have to pay the differencebetween the cost of a brand-name drug and its generic equivalent.) In either case, drug plan copayments are not19 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224subject to the deductible or out- of- pocket limit provisions. See \"Prescription Drugs and Other Items\" for more information about the drug plan. COINSURANCE For some covered services, you must pay a percentage of covered charges (coinsurance) after you have met your annual deductible. After your share has been calculated, this Plan pays the rest of the covered charge, up to maximum benefit limits, if any. You pay a lower percentage of c overed charges when you visit a preferred provider. Remember: The covered charge may be less than the billed charge for a covered service. Preferred providers may not bill you more than the covered charge. Note: If you receive covered services from an \"unsolicited\" provider, as defined in this section, you will be responsible for amounts over the covered charge. Preferred Providers When you receive covered services fro m a preferred provider, you pay an annual d eductible and, after meeting the deductible, you pay a percentage of covered charges (coinsurance). Preferred provider office visit charges arenot subject to the coinsurance or deductible unless listed as otherwise on your summary. Other services of apreferred provider and services of a nonpreferred provider aresubject to deductible and coinsurance. OUT-OF-POCKET LIMIT ForNongrandfathered plans, the out-of-pocket limit is the maximum amount of deductible, coinsurance, and copayments that you pay for most covered services in a plan year. After the out-of-pocket limit is r eached, this Plan pays 100 percent of mos t of your preferred pr ovider covered charges for the rest of the plan year, not to exceed any benefit limits. Individual Limits Once your coinsurance amounts for pref erred provider services in a plan y ear reaches the individual preferred provider amount indicated on the Summary of Benefits, this Plan pays 100 percent of most of your covered preferred provider charges for the rest of the plan year. Family Limits An entire family meets the out-of-pocket limit during a plan year when the total coinsurance for all familymembers reaches the am ount specifi ed in the Summary of Benefits. (When a member meets the Individual out-of-pocket limit, no more charges incurred by that member may be used to satisfy the applicable Familyout-of-pocket limit.) What Is Not Included in the Out-of-Pocket Limits The following amounts are notapplied to the out-of-pocket limits and are noteligible for 100 percent payment under this provision: Spenalty amounts Samounts in excess of covered charges (including amounts in excess of annual or lifetime benefit limits, if applicable) Snoncovered expenses (including services in excess of annual or lifetime day/visit limits) See the Summary of Benefits for your deductible amounts, coinsurance percentages and out-of-po cket limit amounts. CHANGES TO THE COST-SHARING AMOUNTS Copayments, coinsurance percentage amounts, deductibles, and out-of-pocket limits may change during a plan year. Ifchanges are made, the change applies only to services received after the change goes into effect (for inpatient services, benefits are determined based on the date you are admitted to the facility). You will be notified if changes are made tothis Plan. If your group increases the deductible or out-of-pocket limit amounts during a year, the new amounts must be met during the same plan year. For example, if you have met your deductible and your group changes to a higher20 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224deductible, you will not receive benefit payments for services received after the change went into effect until the increased deductible is met. If your group decreases the deductible or out-of-pocket limit amounts, you will not r eceive a refund for amounts applied to the higher deductible or out-of-pocket limit. BENEFIT LEVEL EXCEPTIONS Benefits will be provided as indicated on the Summary of Benefits, except as listed below. Emergency Care If you visit a nonpreferred provider for emergency care servi ces, the Preferred Provider deductible and coinsurance is applied only to the initial treatment, which includes emergency room services and, if you are hospitalized within 48 hours of an emergency, the related inpatient hospitalization. (Office/urgent care facility services are not considered \"emergency care\" for purposes of this provision.) For follow-up care (which is no longer considered emergency care) and for all other nonemergency care, benefits are not available for the services of a nonpreferred provider, even if a preferred provider is not available to performthe service, except as specified below. (See \"Emergency and Urgent Care\" in Section 5: Covered Services for more information.) Transition of Care If your health care provider leaves the BCBSNM provider n etwork (for reasons other than medical competence or professional behavior) or if you are a new member and your provider is not in the provider network when you enroll, UNM Health may authorize you to continue an ongoing course of treatment with the provider for a transitional period of time of not less than 30 days. (If n ecessary and ordered by the treating provider, UNM Health may also authorize transitional care from other out- of- network providers.) The period will be sufficient to permitcoordinated transition planning consistent with your condition and needs. Special provisions may apply if the required transitional period exceeds 30 days. If you have entered the third trimester of pregnancy at the effective date of enrollment, the transitional period shall include post- partum care directly related to the delivery. Call theUNM Customer Care for details. Unsolicited Providers In some states, the local BCBS Plan does not offer preferred provider contracts to certain types of providers (e.g., home health care agencies, chiropractors, ambulance providers). These provider types are referred to as \"unsolicitedproviders.\" Unsolicited providers vary from state to state. If you receive covered services from an \"unsolicited provider\" outside New Mexico, you will receive the preferred provider benefit level for those services. However, the unsolicited provider may still bill you for amounts that are in excess of covered charges. You will be responsiblefor these amounts, in addition to your deductible and coinsurance . Ancillary Provider Once you have obtained preauthorization for an inpatient admission to a preferred hospital or treatment facility, your preferred physicia n or hospital will make every effo rt to ensure that you receive anc illary services from other preferred providers. If you receive covered services from a preferred physician for outpatient surgery or inpatient medical/surgical care in a preferred hospital or treatment facility, services of a nonpreferred radiologist, anesthesiologist, or pathologist will be paid at the preferred provider level and you will not be responsible for any amounts over the covered charge (these are the only three specialties covered under this provision). If anonpreferred surgeon provides your care or you are admitted to a nonpreferred hospital or other treatment facility, you willbe responsible for all associated charges. Note: Except as described above, the preferred provider benefit level will not apply to nonemergency services when received from a nonpreferred provider \u2014 even if a preferred provider is not available in your area toperform the services.21 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224The rules establishing the order of benefit determination between this Plan and any other Health Care Plan covering you on whose behalf a claim is made are as follows: 1. The benefits of a Health Care Plan that does not have a Coordination of Benefits provision shall in all cases be determined before the benefits of this Plan. 2. If according to the rules set forth below in this section the benefits of another Health Care Plan that contains a provision coordinating its benefits with this Health Care Plan would be determined before the benefits of thisHealth Care Plan have been determined, the benefits of the other Health Care Plan will be considered before thedetermination of benefits under this Health Care Plan. The order of benefits for your claim relating to paragraphs 1 and 2 above, is determined using the first of the following rules that applies: 1.Nondependent or Dependent. The Health Care Plan that covers the person other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber, or retiree, is the primary plan, and the Health Care Plan that covers the person as a Dependent is the secondary plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Health Care Plan covering the person as a dependentand primary to the Health Care Plan covering the person as other than a dependent, then the order of benefitsbetween the two plans is reversed so that the Health Care Plan covering the person as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber, or retiree is the secondary plan and the other Health Care Plan is the primary plan. An example includes a retired employee. 2.Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Health Care Plan. Unless there is a court order stating otherwise. Health Care Plans covering a Dependent child must determine the order of benefits using the followingrules that apply. a. For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) The Health Care Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the Calendar Year is the primary plan; or (ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the Health Care Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the primary plan. b. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced, separated, or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) if a court order states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Health Care Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Health Care Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Health Care Plan isgiven notice of the court decree. (ii) if a court order states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of 2a must determine the order of (iii) if a court order states that the parents have joint custody wit hout specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisionsof 2a must determine the order of benefits. (iv) if there is no court order allocating responsibility for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: (I) the Health Care Plan covering the custodial parent; (II) the Health Care Plan covering the spouse of the custodial parent; (III) the Health Care Plan covering the noncustodial parent; then (IV) the Health Care Plan covering the spouse of the noncustodial parent. c. For a Dependent child covered under more than one Health Care Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of 2a or 2b must determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. d. For a Dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' Health Care Plans and has his or her own coverage as a Dependent under a spouse's Health Care Plan, paragraph 5, below applies.22 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224e. In the event the Dependent child's coverage under the spouse's Health Care Plan began on the same date as the Dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' Health Care Plans, the order of benefits must be determined by applying the birthday rule in 2a to the Dependent child's parent(s) or your provider must obtain preauthorization from UNM Health before you are admitted as an inpatient or receive certain types of services. In order to receive benefits: Sservices must be covered and medically necessary; Sservices must not be excluded; and Sthe procedures described in this section must be followed regardless of where services are rendered or by whom. Preauthorization determines only the medical necessity of a specific service and/or an admission and an allowable length of stay. Preauthorization does not guarantee your elig ibility for coverage, that benefit payment will be made, or that you will receive benefits. Eligibility and benefits are based on the date you r eceive the services. Services not listed as covered, excluded services, servi ces received aft er your termination date under this Plan, and services that are not medically necessary will be denied. Medically Necessary/Medical Necessity is defined as health care services determined by a provider, in consultation with BCBSNM, to be appropriate or n ecessary, according to any applicable generally accepted principles and practices of good medical care or practice gui delines developed by the federal government, national or professional medical societies, boards and associati ons, or any applicable clinical protocols or practice guidelines developed by BCBSNM consistent with such federal, national and professional practice guidelines, forthe diagnosis or direct care and treatment of a physical, behavioral, or mental health condition, illness, injury, or disease. Please note:Preauthorization is a requirement that you or your provi der must obtain authorization from BCBSNM before you are admitted as an inpatient and before you receive certain types of services. Even when this Plan is not your primary coverage, these preauthorization procedures must be followed. Failure to do so may result in a reduction or in a denial of benefits.Most preauthorization requests will be evaluated and you and/or the provider notified of BCBSNM's decision within 15 days of receiving the request ( within 24 hours for urgent care requests). If requested services are not approved, the notice will include: 1) the reasons for denial; 2) a reference to the health care plan provisions onwhich the denial is based; and 3) an explanation of how you may appeal the decision if you do not agree with thedenial (see Section 8: Claims Payments and Appeals ). Retroactive approvals will not be given, except for emergency and maternity- related admissions, and you may be responsible for the charges if preauthorization is not obtained before the service is received. How the Preauthorization Procedure Works When you or your provider call, UNM Health Customer Care representative will ask for information about your medical condition, the proposed treatment plan, and the estimated length of stay (if you are being admitted). The Health Services representative will evaluate the information and notify the requesting provider (usually at the timeof the call) if benefits for the proposed hospitalization or other services are preauthorized. If the admission or otherservices are not preauthorized, you may appeal the decision as explained in Section 8: Claims Payments and Appeals . BCBSNM PREFERRED PROVIDERS If the attending physician is a preferred provider that contracts directly with BCBSNM, obtaining preauthorization is not your responsibility \u2014 it is the provider's. Preferred providers contracting with BCBSNM must obtain preauthorization from BCBSNM (or from the Behavioral Health Unit (BHU), when applicable) in the following circumstances: Swhen Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Swhen a covered newborn stays in the hospital longer than the mother Sbefore providing or recommending a service listed under \" Other Preauthorizations,\" later in this section Note: Providers that contract with other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans are not familiar with the preauthorization requirements of BCBSNM. Unless a provider contracts directly with BCBSNM as a preferred provider, the provider is not responsible for being aware of this Plan's preauthorization requirements. NONPREFERRED PROVIDERS OR PROVIDERS OUTSIDE NEW MEXICO If any provider outside New Mexico (except for those contracting as preferred providers directly with BCBSNM) or any Nonpreferred Provider recommends an admission or a servi ce that requires preauthorization, the provider is not obligated to obtain the preauthorization for you. In such cases, it is your responsibility to ensure that preauthorization is obtained. If authorization is notobtained before services are received, your benefits for covered services will be denied and you will be entirely responsible for the charges. The provider may call on your behalf, but it is your responsibility to ensure that BCBSNM has authorized those services. INPATIENT PREAUTHORIZATION Preauthorization is required for all admissions before you are admitted to the hospital or other inpatient treatment facility (e.g., skilled nursing facility, residential treatment center, physical rehabilitation facility, long- term acute care(LTAC). Type of inpatient admission, readmission, or transfer: When to obtain inpatient admission preauthorization: Nonemergency Before the patient is admitted. Emergency, nonmaternity Within 48 hours of the admission. If the patient's condition makes it impossible to call within 48 hours, call as soon as possible. Maternity- related (including eligible newborns when the mother is not covered)Before the mother's maternity due date, soon after pregnancy is confirmed. BCBSNM must be notified as soon as possible if the mother's stay is greater than 48 hours for a routine delivery or great- er than 96 hours for a C- section delivery. Extended stay, newborn (an eligible newborn stays in the hospital longer than the mother)Before the newborn's mother is discharged. Penalty for Not Obtaining Inpatient Preauthorization If you or your provider do not receive preauthorization for inpatient benefits, but you choose to be hospitalized anyway, nobenefits may be paid or partial payment may be made, as indicated in the table below: If, based on a review of the claim: Then: The admission was not for a covered service . Benefits for the facility and all related services will be denied.* The admission was for an item listed under \"Other Preauthoriza- tions, \" (e.g., air ambulance).Benefits for the facility and all related services will be denied.* The admission was for any other covered service but hospitaliza- tion was not medically necessary .Benefits will be denied forroom, board, andother charges that are not medically necessary.* The admission was for a medically necessary covered service. Benefits for the facility's covered services will be reduced by $300.* *The admission review penalty of $300 is the provider's responsibility. Charges for noncovered and denied services arenot applied to any deductible or out-of-pocket limit. Inpatient preauthorization requirements may affect the amounts that this Plan pays for inpatient services, but they do not deny your right to be admitted to any facility and to choose your services.25 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: review for all nonemergency inpatient services, preauthorization is required for the services listed below. Most preauthorizations may be requested over the telephone. If a written request is needed, have your provider call a Health Services representative for instructions for filing a written request for preauthorization. An out- of- state network provider may call on your behalf, but it is your responsibility to ensure that BCBSNM is called. Preferred providers that contract directly with BCBSNM are responsible for requesting all n ecessary preauthorizations for you. (See \"Inpatient Preauthorization\" regarding inpatient preauthorization requirements.) If preauthorization is not obtained for the following services and all related services, the service will be reviewed formedical necessity and subject to one of the following actions in the chart below: No Preauthorization Received Claim Disposition: In- Network Claim Disposition: Out- of- Network Service is medically necessary Claim is paid based on member's benefit planClaim is paid based on member's benefitplan Service is not medically necessary Claim is denied; member held harmless Claim is denied; member responsible forpayment Sair ambulance services (unless during a medical emergency) SPET scans ;cardiac CT scans ;MRIs Senteral nutritional products, special medical foods, andcertain drugs covered under \"Prescription Drugs and Other Items;\" Shome infusion therapy (HIT), excluding antibiotics Shospice Scertain injections, (IOP) treatment Stransplant procedures including pretransplant evaluations All services, including those for whic h preauthorization is required, must meet the standards of medical necessity criteria described in Section 5: Covered Services, \"Medically Necessary Services,\" and will not be covered, if excluded, for any reason. Some services requiring preauthorization may not be approved for payment (for example, due to being experimental, i nvestigational, unpr oven, or not medically necessary). The complete list of services requiring preauthorization is subject to review and change by BCBSNM. The preauthorization requirements noted above do not apply to mandated benefits, unless permitted by law and stated in the provisions of a specific mandated benefit. The med ical necessity requirements noted above do not apply to mandated benefits, unless permitted by law. It is strongly recommended that you request a predetermination for benefits for high- cost services in orderto reduce the likelihood of benefits being denied after charges are incurred. See \"Advance Benefit Informa- tion/Predetermination\" later in this section for further information. Preauthorization of Mental Health/Chemical Dependency Services All inpatient mental health and chemical dependency services must be preauthorized by the BCBSNM Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. Preauthorization is also required foroutpatient psychological testing, neur opsychological testing, intensive outpatient program (IOP) treatment, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment of mental disorder and/or chemical dependency. Preauthorization isnotrequired for outpatient/office group, individual, or family therapy visits to a physician or other professional provider licensed to perform covered services under this health plan.26 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224For services needing preauthorization, you or your health care provider should call the BHU before you schedule treatment. NOTE: Your provider may be asked to submit clinical information in order to obtain preauthorization for the services you are planning to receive. Services may be authorized or may be denied based on the clinical information received. ( Clinical information is information based on actual observation and treatment of a particular patient.) If you or your provider do not call for preauthorization of nonemergency inpatient services, benefits for covered, medically necessary inpatient facility care may be reduced by an amount that is equal to the preauthorization (or admission review) penalty, if any, indicated for medica l/surgical admissions. If inpatie nt services received without preauthorization are determined to be not medically necessary or not eligible for coverage under your Plan for anyother reason, the admission and all related services will be denied. In such cases, you may be responsible for all charges. If preauthorization is notobtained before you receive outpatient services, your claims may be denied as being not medically necessary. In such cases, you may be responsible for all charges. Therefore, you should make sure that you (or your provider) have obtained preau thorization for outpatient services before you start treatment.

ADVANCE BENEFIT INFORMAT ION/PREDETERMINATION If you want to know what bene fits will be paid before receiving services or f iling a claim, BCBSNM may require a written request. BCBSNM may also require a written statement from the provider identifying the circumstances of the case and the specific services that will be provided. An advance confirmation/predetermination of benefits does not guarantee benefits if the actual circumstances of the case differ from those originally described. When submitted, claims are reviewed according to the te rms of this benefit booklet, your eligibility, or any other coverage that applies on the date of service. UTILIZATION REVIEW/QUALITY MANAGEMENT Medical records, claims, and requests for covered services may be reviewed to establish that the services are/were medically necessary, delivered in the appropriate setting, and consistent with the condition reported and with generallyaccepted standards of medical and surgical practice in the area where performed and according to the findings andopinions of BCBSNM's professional consultants. Utilization management decisions are based only on appropriateness of care and service. BCBSNM does not reward providers or other individuals conducting utilization review for denying coverage or services and does not offer incentives to utilization review decision-makers to encourageunderutilization.28 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224SECTION 5: COVERED SERVICES This section describes the services and supplies covered by this group health care plan, subject to the limitations and exclusions in Section 3: How Your Plan Works andSection 6: General Limitations and Exclusions . All payments are based on covered charges as determined by BCBSNM. MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES A service or supply is medically necessary when it is provided to diagnose or tr eat a covered medical cond ition, is a service or supply that is covered under this Plan, and is determined by BCBSNM's medical director (in consultationwith your provider) to meet all of the following conditions: Sit is medical in nature; Sit is recommended by the treating physician; Sit is the most appropriate supply or level of service, taking into consideration: \u2014 potential benefits; \u2014 potential harms; \u2014 cost, when choosing between alternatives that are equally effective; and \u2014 cost effectiveness, when compared to the alternative services or supplies; Sit is known to be effective in improving health outcome s as determined by credible scientific evidence published in the peer-reviewed medical literature (for established services or supplies, professional standards and expert opinion may also be taken into account); and Sit is not for the convenience of the member, the treating physician, the hospital, or any other health care provider. All services must be eligible for benefits as described in this section, not listed as an exclusion and must meet all of the conditions of \"medically necessary\" as defined above in order to be covered. Note: Because a health care provider prescribes, orders, recommends, or approves a service does not make it medically necessary or make it a covered service, even if it is not specifically listed as an exclusion. BCBSNM, at its sole discretion, will determine medical necessity based on the criteria above. AMBULANCE SERVICES This Plan covers ambulance services in an emergency (e.g., cardiac arrest, stroke). When you cannot be safelytransported by any other means in a nonemergency situati on, this Plan also covers medically necessary ambulance transportation to a hospital with appropriate facilities, or from one hospital to another. Air Ambulance Ground ambulance is usually the approved method of transportation. This Plan covers air ambulance only when terrain, distance, or your physical condition requires the use of air ambulance services or for high-risk maternity andnewborn transport to tertiary care facilities. To be covered, nonemergency air ambulance services requirepreauthorization from BCBSNM. BCBSNM determines on a case-by-case basis when air ambulance is covered. If BCBSNM determines that groundambulance services could have been used, benefits are limited to the cost of ground ambulance services. Exclusions This Plan does notcover: Scommercial transport, private aviation, or air taxi services Sservices not specifically listed as covered, such as private automobile, public transportation, or wheelchair ambulance Sservices ordered only because ot her transportation was not ava ilable, or for your convenience29 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS This Plan covers the habilitative and rehabilitative treatment of autism spectrum disorder through speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and applied behavioral analysis (ABA). Providers must be credentialed toprovide such therapy. Treatment must be prescribed by the member's treating phys ician in accordance with a treatment plan. Treatment must bepreauthorized by BCBSNM to determine that the services are to be performed in accordance with such a treatment plan; if services are received but were not approved as part of the treatment plan, benefits for services will be denied. Services not preauthorized by BCBSNM must be performed in accordance with a treatment plan and must be medically necessary or benefits for such services will be denied. Once maximum functionality has been r eached and no additional improvement is expected, no therapies are covered unless required to maintain that member's currentfunctionality (that is, in the absence of additional treatment, the patient would suffer a setback). No benefits are available for any treatments not show n to be habilitative or rehabilitative. SeeSection 4: Preauthorizations for more information about preauthorization requirements. Services are subject to usual member cost- sharing features such as deductible, coinsurance, copayments, and out- of- pocket limits - based on place of treatment, type of service, and whether preauthorization was obtained fromBCBSNM. All services are subject to the General Limitations and Exclusions except where explicitly mentioned as being an exception.

This Plan contains a coordination of benefits (COB) provision that prevents duplication of payments. When you are enrolled in any other valid c overage, the combined benefit payments from all cove rages cannot exceed 100 percent of BCBSNM's covered charges. (Other valid coverage is defined as all other group and individual (or direct- pay) insurance policies or health care plans including Medicare, but excluding Indian Health Service and Medicaidcoverages, that provide payments for medical services and are considered other valid coverage for purposes ofcoordinating benefits under this Plan.) When this Plan is secondary, all provisions (such as obtaining preauthorization) must be followed or benefits may be denied . The following rules determine which coverage pays first: No COB Provision \u2014 If the other valid coverage does not include a COB provision, that coverage pays first. Medicare \u2014 If the other valid coverage is Medicare, then Medicare pays first. Child/Spouse \u2014 If a covered child under this health plan is covered as a spouse under another health plan, the covered child's spouse's health plan is primary over this health plan.Subscriber/Family Member \u2014 If the member who received care is covered as an employee, retiree, or other policy holder (i.e., as the subscriber) under one health plan and as a spouse, child, or other family member under another, the health plan that designates the member as the employee, retiree, or other policy holder (i.e., as thesubscriber) pays first. If you have other valid coverage andMedicare, contact the other carrier's customer service department to find out if the other coverage is primary to Medicare. There are many federal regulations regarding Medicare Secondary Payer provisions, and other coverage ma y not be subject to those provisions. Child \u2014 For a child whose parents are not separated or divorced, the coverage of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year pays first. If the other valid coverage does not follow this rule, the father's coverage pays first. Child, Parents Separated or Divorced \u2014 For a child of divorced or separated parents, benefits are coordinated in the following order: \u2014Court-Decreed Obligations. Regardless of which parent has custody, if a court decree specifies which parent is financially responsible for the child's health care expenses, the coverage of that parent pays first. \u2014Custodial/Noncustodial. The plan of the custodial parent pays first. The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent pays second. The plan o f the noncustodial parent pays last. \u2014Joint Custody. If the parents share joint custody, and the court decree does not state which parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans follow the rules that apply to children whose parents are not separated or divorced. Active/Inactive Employee \u2014 If a member is covered as an active employee under one coverage and as an inactive employee under another, the coverage through active employment pays first. (Even if a member is covered as a family member under both coverages, the coverage through active employment pays first.) If the other plan does not have this rule and the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the next rule applies. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage \u2014 When none of the above applies, the plan in effect for the longest continuous period of time pays first. (The start of a new plan does not include a change in the amount or scope of benefits, a change in the entity that pays, provides, or administers the benefits, or a change from one type of planto another.)63 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Responsibility For Timely Notice BCBSNM is not responsible for coordination of benefits if timely information is not provided. Facility of Payment Whenever any other plan makes benefit payments that should have been made under this Plan, BCBSNM has the right to pay the other plan any amount BCBSNM determines will satisfy the intent of this provision. Any amount so paid will be considered to be benefits paid under this Plan, and with that payment BCBSNM will fully satisfy its liability under this provision. Overpayments - Right of Recovery Regardless of who was paid, whenever benefit payments made by BCBSNM ex ceed the amount necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision, BCBSNM has the right to recover the excess amount from any persons to or for whom those payments were made, or from any insurance c ompany, service plan, or any other organizations or persons.

If the other valid coverage pays benefits to you (or your family member) directly, give your provider a copy of the payment explanation so that he/she can include it with the claim sent to BCBSNM or to the local BCBS Plan. (If anonparticipating provider does not file claims for you, attach a copy of the payment explanation to the claim that you send to BCBSNM or to the local BCBS Plan, as applicable.) PARTICIPATING AND PREFERRED PROVIDERS Your \"preferred\" provider may have two agreements with the local BCBS Plan \u2014 a preferred provider contract and another participating provider contract. Some providers have only the participating provider contract and are not considered preferred providers. However, all participating and preferred providers file claims with their local BCBSPlan and payment is made directly to them. Be sure that these providers know you have health care coverageadministered by BCBSNM. Do notfile claims for these services yourself. Preferred providers (and participating providers contracting directly with BCBSNM) also have specific timely filing limits in their contracts with BCBSNM (usually 180 days). The providers' contract language lets them know that they may not bill the employer or any member for a service if the provider does not meet the filing limit for that service andthe claim for that service is denied due to timely filing limitations. NONPARTICIPATING PROVIDERS A nonparticipating provider is one that has neither a preferred or a participating provider agreement. If yournonparticipating pr ovider does not file a claim for you, s ubmit a separate cla im form for each family member as the services are received. Attach itemized b ills and, if applicable, your other valid coverage's payment explanation, to a Member Claim Form. (Forms can be printed from the BCBSNM website at www.bcbsnm.com or requested from a Customer Service Advocate.) Complete the claim form using the instructions on the form. (See special claim filinginstructions for out-of-country claims under \"Where to Send Claim Forms\" later in this section.) Payment normally is made to the provider. However, if you have already paid the provider for the services being claimed, your claim must include evidence that the charges were paid in full. Upon approval of the claim, BCBSNMwill reimburse you for covered services, based on covered charges, less any required member copayment. You will be responsible for charges not covered by the Plan.65 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224ITEMIZED BILLS Claims for covered service must be itemized on the provider's billing forms or letterhead stationery and must show: Smember's identification number Smember's and subscriber's name and address Smember's date of birth and relationship to the subscriber Sname, address, National Provider Identification number (NPI), and tax ID or social security number of the provider Sdate of service or purchase, diagnosis, type of servic e or treatment, procedure, and amount charged for each service (each service must be listed separately) Saccident or surgery date (when applicable) Samount paid by you (if any) along w ith a receipt, cancelled check, or other proof of payment Correctly itemized bills are n ecessary for your claim to be processed. The only acceptable b ills are those from health care providers. Do notfile bills you prepared yourself, canceled checks, balance due statements, or cash register receipts. Make a copy of all itemized b ills for your records before you send them. The bills are not returned to you. All information on the claim and itemized bills must be readable. If information is missing or is not readable, BCBSNMwill return it to you or to the provider. Do not file for the same service twice unless asked to do so by a Customer Service Advocate. If your itemized bills include services previously filed, identify clearly the new charges that you are submitting. (See \"Where to Send Claim Forms\" below, for special instructions regarding out-of-country claims.) WHERE TO SEND CLAIM FORMS If your nonparticipating provider does not file a claim for you, you (not the provider) are responsible for filing the claim. Remember: Participating and preferred providers will file claims for you; these procedures are used only when you must file your own claim. Services in United States, Canada, Jamaica, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico If a nonparticipating provider will not file a claim for you, ask for an itemized bill and complete a claim form the same way that you would for services r eceived from any other nonparticipating provider. Mail the claim forms and itemized bills to BCBSNM at the address below (or, if you prefer, you may send to the local Blue Cross Blue ShieldPlan in the state where the services were received): Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico P.O. Box 27630 Albuquerque, New Mexico 87125-7630 Mental Health/Chemical Dependency Claims Claims for covered mental health an d chemical dependency services received in New Mexico should be sub mitted to: BCBSNM, BH Unit P.O. Box 27630 Albuquerque, New Mexico 87125-7630 Drug Plan ClaimsIf you purchase a prescription drug or other item covered under the drug plan from a nonparticipating pharmacy or other provider in an emergency, or if you do not have your ID card with you when purchasing a prescription or other covered item, you must pay for the prescription in full and then submit a claim to BCBSNM's pharmacy benefit manager. Do not send these claims to BCBSNM. The bills or r eceipts must be issued by the pharmacy and must include the pharmacy name and address, drug name, prescription number, and amount charged. If not included in66 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224your enrollment materials, you can obtain the name and address of the pharmacy benefit manager and the n ecessary claim forms from a UNM Health Customer Care or on the BCBSNM website at www.bcbsnm.com. Services Outside the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or Canada For covered inpatient hospital services received outside the United States (including Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada, show your Plan ID card issued by BCBSNM. BCBSNM participates in a claimpayment program with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. If the hospital has an agreement with theAssociation, the hospital files the claim for you to the appropriate Blue Cross Plan. Payment is made to the hospital by that Plan, and then BCBSNM reimburses the other Plan. You will need to pay up front for care received from a doctor, aparticipating outpatient hospital, and/or a nonparticipating hospital. Then, complete an International Claim Form and send it with the bill(s) to the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center (the address is on the form). The International Claim Form is available from BCBSNM, the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center, or on- a- member/coverage- home- and- away.html The BlueCard Worldwide International Claim Form is to be used to submit institutional and professional claims for benefits for covered emergency services received outside the United States, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For filing instructions for other claim types (e.g., dental, prescription drugs, etc.) contact your Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan. The International Claim Form must be completed for each patient in full, and accompanied by fully itemized b ills. It is not n ecessary for you to provide an English translation or convert currency. Since the claim cannot be returned, please be sure to keep photocopies of all bills and supporting documentation for your personal records. The member should submit an International Claim Form (available at www.bcbs.com), attach itemized bills, and mail to BlueCard Worldwide at the address below. BlueCard Worldwide will then translate the information, if necessary, and convert the charges to United States dollars. They also will contactBCBSNM for benefit information in order to process the claim. Once the claim is finalized, the Explanation of Benefits will be mailed to the subscriber and payment, if applicable, will be made to the subscriber via wire transfer or check. Mail international claims to: BlueCard Worldwide Service Center P.O. Box 72017 Richmond, VA 23255- 2017 CLAIMS PAYMENT PROVISIONS Most claims will be evaluated and you and/or the provider notified of the BCBSNM benefit decision within 30 days ofreceiving the claim. If all information needed to process the claim has been sub mitted, but BCBSNM cannot make a determination within 30 days, you will be notified (before th e expiration of the 30-day period) that an additional 15 days is needed for claim determination. After a claim has been processed, the subscriber will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB indicates what charges were covered and what charges, if any, were not. Note: If a Qualified Child Medical Support Order (QCMSO) is in effect, the QCMSO provisions will be followed. For example, when the member is an eligible child of divorced parents, and the subscriber unde r this Plan is the noncustodial parent, the custodial parent may receive the payment and the EOB. If A Claim or Preauthorization Is Denied If benefits are denied or only partially paid, BCBSNM will notify you of the determination. The notice to you will include: 1) the reasons for denial; 2) a reference to the health care plan provisions on which the denial is based; and3) an explanation of how you may appeal the decision if you do not agree with the denial. (See \"Grievance Procedures,\" later in this section.) You also have 180 days in which to appeal a decision.67 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Covered Charge Provider payments are based upon preferred provider and participating provider agreements and covered charges as determined by BCBSNM. For services r eceived outside of New Mexico, covered charges may be based on the local Plan practice (e.g., for out-of-state providers that contract with their local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, the covered charge may be based upon the amount negotiated by the other Plan with its own contracted providers). Youare responsible for paying copayments, deductibles, coinsurance, any penalty amounts, and noncovered expenses.For covered services receive d in foreign countries, BCBSNM will use the exchange rate in effect on the date of service in order to determine billed charges. Participating and Preferred Providers Payments for covered services usually are sent directly to network (preferred or participating) providers. The EOB you receive explains the payment. Nonparticipating Providers If covered emergency services are received from a nonparticipating p rovider, payments ar e usually made to the subscriber (or to the applicable alternate payee when a QCMSO is in effect). The check will be attached to an EOB that explains BCBSNM's payment. In these cases, you ar e responsible for arranging payment to the provider and for paying any amounts greater than covered charges plus copayments, deductibles, coinsurance, any penaltyamounts, and noncovered expenses. Accident-Related Hospital Services If services are administered as a result of an accident, a hospital or treatment fac ility may place a lien upon a compromise, settlement, or judgment obtained by you when the facility has not been paid its total billed charges from all other sources. Assignment of Benefits BCBSNM specifically reserves the right to pay the subscriber directly and to refuse to honor an assignment of benefits in any circumstances. No person may execute any power of attorney to interfere with BCBSNM's right topay the subscriber instead of anyone else. Emergency Service Pricing Notwithstanding anything in this booklet to the contrary, f or out- of- network emergency care services, the covered charge shall be equal to at least the greatest of the following three amounts - not to exceed b illed charges: Sthe median amount negotiated with in- network providers for emergency care services furnished; Sthe amount for the emergency care service calculated using the same method the Plan generally uses to determine payments for nonparticipating provider services but substituting the in- network providercost- sharing provisions for the out- of- network cost- sharing provisions; or Sthe amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency care service. Each of these three amounts is calculated excluding any in- network copayment or coinsurance imposed with respect to the member. Medicaid Payment of benefits for members eligible for Medicaid is made to the appropriate state agency or to the provider when required by law. Medicare If you are 65 years of age or older, BCBSNM will suspend your claims until it r eceives (a) an Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB) for each claim (if you are en titled to Medicare), or (b) Social Security Administration documentation showing that you are not entitled to Medicare.68 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224Overpayments If BCBSNM makes an erroneous benefit payment to the subscriber or member for any reason (e.g., provider billing error, claims processing error), BCBSNM may recove r overpayments from you. If you do not refund the overpayment, BCBSNM reserves the right to withhold future benefit payments to apply to the amount that you owe the Plan, and to take legal action to correct payments made in error. Pricing for the following categories of claims for covered services from noncontracted providers will be priced at billed charges or at an amount negotiated by BCBSNM with the provider, whichever is less: Scovered services required during an emergency and received in a hospital, trauma center, or ambulance Sfor PPO health plans, services from noncontracted providers that satisfy at least one of the three conditions below and, as a result, are eligible for the Preferred Provider benefit level of coverage -covered services from noncontracted providers within the United States that are classified as \"unsolicited\" as explained earlier in Section 3: How Your Plan Works and as determined by the member's Host Plan while outside the service area of BCBSNM -preauthorized transition of care services r eceived from noncontracted providers -covered services received from a noncontracted anesthesiologist, pathologist, or radiologist while you are a patient at a contracted facility r eceiving covered services or procedures that have been preauthorized, if needed BCBSNM will use essentially the same claims processing rules and/or edits for noncontracted provider claims that are used for contracted provider claims, which may change the covered charge for a particular service. If BCBSNM does not have any claim edits or rules for a particular covered service, BCBSNM may use the rules or edits used by Medicare in processing the claims. Changes made by CMS to the way services or claims are priced for Medicarewill be applied by BCBSNM within 90- 145 days of the date that such change is implemented by CMS or itssuccessor. IMPORTANT: Regardless of the pricing method used, the BCBSNM covered charge will usually be less than the provider's billed charge and you will be responsible for paying to the provider the dif- service. This difference may be considerable. T h ed i f f e r e n c ei s notapplied to any deductible or out- of- pocket limit. In the case of a noncovered service, you are responsible for paying the provid-er's full billed charge directly to the provider. Reminder: Contracted providers will notcharge you the difference between the BCBSNM covered charge and the billed charge for a covered service. BLUECARDRPROGRAM Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico (BCBSNM) has relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter-Plan Program Arrangements.\" Whenever you obtain healthcare services outsideof the BCBSNM service area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Programs,which includes the BlueCard program. Typically, when accessing care outside of the BCBSNM service area, you will obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e. are \"contracted providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some insta nces, you may obtain care from noncontracted providers. BCBSNM payment practices in both instances are described below. (Note: Under PPO plans, \"contracted providers\" arereferred to as Preferred Providers and \"noncontracted providers\" are referred to as Nonpreferred Providers.) Inter-Plan Program Arrangements link the BCBSNM provider network with other individual Blue Cross Blue Shield networks across the country to provide you broad access to contracted providers. Contracted providers may be contracted with either BCBSNM or the Host Blue. Noncontracted providers are not contracted with either BCBSNM or the HostBlue.69 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224You always have the choice to receive services from contr acted or noncontracted provide rs in New Mexico or outside New Mexico, but the differe nce in the amount you pay may be substantial. When services are received by you outside of New Mexico from either contracted or noncontracted providers, the Host Blue will provide BCBSNM with a covered charge based on what it uses for its own local members for services received from either contracted or noncontracted providers in the state where the Host Blue is located. For purposes of the Inter-Plan Arrangements described in this section, \"covered charge\" means the amount that BCBSNM determines is fair and reasonable for a particular covered and medically n ecessary service, as provided to BCBSNM by a Host Blue. After the member's share of the covered charge is calculated, BCBSNM will pay theremaining amount of the covered charge up to the maximum benefit limitation, if any. For services r eceived in foreign countries, BCBSNM will use the exchange rate in effect on the date of service in order to determine the covered charge. Services Received from Contracted Providers Outside New Mexico Under the BlueCard Program, when you access covered services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, BCBSNM will remain responsible for fulfilling BCBSNM contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue isresponsible for contracting with and generally handlin g all interactions with its contracted providers. Whenever you access covered services outside of the BCBSNM service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: Sthe billed charges for your covered services; or Sthe negotiated price or \"allowable amount\" that the Host Blue makes available to BCBSNM. If the services are provided by a contracted provider of the Host Blue, the provider will submit your claims directly tothe Host Blue to determine the allowable amount. BCBSNM will use the allowable amount to determine the coveredcharge so that your claim can be processed timely. The covered charge will be an amount up to, but not in excess of,the allowable amount the Host Blue has passed on to BCBSNM. B ecause the services were provided by a contracted provider, you will receive the benefit of the payment/rate negotiated by the Host Blue with the provider. As always,you will be responsible for any applicable deductible, copay and/or coinsurance amounts (\"member share\"). Theamount that BCBSNM pays together with your member share is the total amount the contracted provider hascontractually agreed to accept as payment in full for the services you have received. Often, this \"allowable amount\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with your healthcare provider or provider group that may include type s of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based o n a discount that results in exp ected average s avings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price BCBSNM uses for your claim b ecause they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Federal law or the laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your liability calculation. If federal law or any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge,BCBSNM would then calculate your liability for any covered services according to applicable law. Services Received from a Noncontracted Provider Outside of New Mexico If services are provided by a noncontracted provider, the p rovider may, but is not required to, submit claims on your behalf. A noncontracted provider has not negotiated his/her payments/rates with either the Host Blue or BCBSNM. Ifthe noncontracted provider does not submit claims on your behalf, you will be required to submit the claims directlyto the Host Blue. You will be subject to balance billing when you r eceive services from a noncontracted provider. This amount may be significant. \"Balance billing\" means tha t the noncontracted provider may require you to pay any70 190482 (07/16) UNM Health Customer Service: 844-866-2224amount that the provider bills that ex ceeds the sum of what BCBSNM pays toward a c overed charge and your member share of the covered charge. Member Liability Calculation 1. In General Under Inter-Plan Program Arrangements, when services are received outside the state of New Mexico from a noncontracted provider, the covered charge will be determined by the Host Blue servicing area or by applicable law and will be passed on to BCBSNM. BCBSNM will use the Host Blue's covered charge as its covered chargeso that your claim can be processed timely. BCBSNM's covered charge will be an amount up to but not in excessof the covered charge the Host Blue has passed on to BCBSNM. In addition to being responsible to pay yourmember share, you may be subject to balance billing by the noncontracted provider who provided services toyou. Before you receive services from a nonc ontracted provider, you should ask for a wr itten breakdown of all amounts that you will have to pay, including member share and balance billing amounts for the services you willreceive. 2. Exceptions In certain situations, BCBSNM may use other payment bases, such as billed charges for covered services, as thepayment we would make if the healthcare services had been obtained within our service area, or a specialnegotiated payment, as permitted under Inter-Plan Program Arrangements policies, to determine the amountBCBSNM will pay for services rendered by noncontracted providers. In these situations, you may be liable forthe difference between the amount that the noncontracted provider bills and thepayment BCBSNMwill makeforthe covered services as set forth in this paragraph. COMPLAINTS (GRIEVANCES) AND APPEALS: SUMMARY OF PROCEDURES If you want to make an oral complaint or file a written appeal about a claims payment or denial, a preauthorization denial, the termination of your coverage (other than due to nonpayment of premium), or any other issue, a BCBSNMCustomer Service Advocate is available to assist you.

If you have a question about these procedures, please call aCustomer Service Advocate at the phone number printed on the back of your identification card. NOTE: Wheneverthese procedures require that an action be taken by any party, including BCBSNM, within a certain period of time from receipt of a request or document, the request or document will be deemed to have been received within three working days of the date it was mailed. Change in state or federal law or regulations, or interpretations thereof, may change the terms and conditions of coverage. GENERAL INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS Inquiry - A general request for information regarding claims, benefits, or membership. Complaint - An expression of dissatisfaction by you, either orally or in writing. Issues may include, but are not limited to, claims payments or denials, quality of care, and locating a network provider. The Claims Administrator, BCBSNM, has a team available to assist you with inquiries and complaints. To make an inquiry or complaint, contact a Customer Service Advocate at the phone number on the back of your ID card or by mail at the address on the inside front cover of your benefit booklet (inquiries about behavioral health services are directedto the Behavioral Health Unit; appeals are directed to the general BCBSNM Appeals Unit as indicated later in thisappendix notice). INITIAL INTERNAL REVIEW OF CLAI MS/PREAUTHORIZATION REQUESTS When you or your treating health care professional requests a preauthorization or files a claim for a health care service,BCBSNM first determines whether the requested service i s covered under your Plan. If the requested service is not covered, BCBSNM will not review for medical n ecessity, but will send you notice that there is no coverage for the requested service. Only if the requested service is possibly covered, will BCBSNM review for medical n ecessity. If the requested service is approved as medically necessary, you will receive notice of that determination. An approval does not ensure that the service will be covered. For example, if you are not eligible for coverage at the time services are r eceived, if the service you receive is different from t he service authorized, or if your benefit pla n changes or terminates before you receive the service in question, the service may still be denied. Preauthorization - A decision by BCBSNM that a health care service has been reviewed and, based upon the information available, meets BCBSNM's requirements for coverage and medical n ecessity.
