Surgery We perform a wide array of surgeries, including sterilization procedures, soft tissue surgeries, and orthopedic procedures.

Dentistry We offer a wide range of dental procedures, including dental cleanings (with ultrasonic scaling and polishing), extractions when required, and dental radiography. Prescription medicine and diets We have a fully stocked pharmacy and we also carry a variety of prescription diets that are used to treat and support different medical conditions. Microchips Microchips can be implanted under the skin of your pet as a means of permanent identification. This can allow a lost pet to have a greater chance of being reunited with their owner. DIGITAL Radiology We utilize in-house digital radiology equipment that allows us to take x-rays of your pet to help in the diagnosis of medical conditions. In the majority of cases, we can do this during the course of the office visit. Laboratory Services We utilize in-house CBC and Chemistry and urine analyzers that assist us in monitoring the health of your pet, as well as to diagnose medical conditions. By performing these tests in-house, we are often able to diagnose medical conditions quicker than by sending routine bloodwork and urine to outside laboratories. However, there are specialty tests that we may have to send to an outside laboratory to help with diagnosis. Anesthesia We utilize safe, state of the art, gas anesthesia for our surgical patients. Specialty Referrals We work with veterinary specialists in the area for advanced diagnostics (ie-ultrasound imaging, echocardiography) and specialized procedures, such as advanced surgeries, as well as cancer treatment.

In the event of an after-hours emergency, we work in conjunction with Royal Vista, Four Seasons, CSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Fort Collins Veterinary Emergency and Rehabilitation Hospital.
