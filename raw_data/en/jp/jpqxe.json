{"title": "COVID-19: Coronavirus Updates - Logan University", "author": null, "url": "https://www.logan.edu/healthupdate/", "hostname": "logan.edu", "description": null, "sitename": "Logan University", "date": "2020-03-12", "cleaned_text": "Logan University Health Updates Effective today (August 15), Logan will discontinue COVID contact tracing. As COVID transitions into a post-pandemic phase, the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/prioritization.html) (CDC) no longer recommends universal case investigation and contact tracing. Logan continues to encourage all individuals to take safety precautions and practice prevention strategies whenever possible. The CDC now recommends isolating for 5 days with the onset of COVID symptoms and testing positive, regardless of vaccination status. Face coverings are recommended for those who have been exposed to an individual with a positive case of COVID. It is recommended that exposed individuals test five days after exposure. See additional CDC guidelines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). Logan Students, Faculty and Staff- The St. Louis County Department of Public Health, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has altered their guidance on isolating when testing positive for COVID as well as for those who have had a close contact exposure to COVID. These changes, as well as a recent surge in COVID cases across the nation due to the Omicron variant, has prompted a re-examination of our current return to campus policies. Based on the best evidence, as it relates to our institution and the current STL County policies and mandates, the following policies will be in place for the Spring 2022 trimester start: - Face coverings are encouraged when in large groups or in close contact with others. The use of face coverings in mitigating the spread of airborne viruses, such as COVID, is well documented and should be factored into your educated personal choice on its use. - Use of face coverings will remain mandatory for all students, faculty, patients and staff in the Logan University Health Centers, including Montgomery Health Center, Mid Rivers Health Center and our health center in the Stephen A. Orthwein Center at Paraquad. - The current CDC/STL County guidelines in terms of isolation when testing positive for COVID and quarantine when a known close contact exposure has occurred will be followed. A summary of the updated guidelines can be found here: [CDC/STL Country Guidelines](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Updated-CDC-STL-County-Guidelines-on-Isolation-Quarantine.pdf) As stated in my original announcement, this decision was not based on one single trigger, rather the monitoring of information over time (including the data from the recent surge in cases) and the development of effective preventative therapeutics. At this point, all individuals are aware of the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID and its variants, and have had ample time to evaluate their personal choice. It is important that all individuals respect everyone's personal choice regarding vaccinations and/or the use of face coverings on Logan's campus. We continue to monitor COVID statistics for our campus and St. Louis County and are prepared to respond as needed. Stay well, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Logan Faculty and Staff- Over the past 22 months, Logan has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with caution, diligence and flexibility, following guidance from federal, state and local authorities with each decision made. As we stated from the beginning, we have monitored and modified our guidelines and protocols as necessary based on the most current information available. After much consideration and weighing of recent research and data, effective tomorrow, Monday, Dec. 20, Logan University will remove the face covering mandate for campus, with the exception of the Health Centers. Face coverings will remain in place for all students, faculty, patients and staff in the Logan University Health Centers, including Montgomery Health Center, Mid Rivers Health Center and our health center in the Stephen A. Orthwein Center at Paraquad. This decision was not based on one single trigger, rather the monitoring of information over time including the development of effective preventative therapeutics. At this point, all individuals are aware of the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID and its variants, and have had ample time to evaluate their personal choice. It is important that all individuals respect everyone's personal choice regarding vaccinations and/or the use of face coverings on Logan's campus. Additionally, we continue to monitor COVID statistics for our campus and St. Louis County and are prepared to respond as needed. Stay well, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Students, faculty and staff- We are aware of the decision announced yesterday that [rescinds the face-covering mandate in St. Louis County.](https://stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-departments/public-health/covid-19/public-health-orders/rescinding-face-covering-order-12-09-2021/) Logan's current face covering policy remains in place while we actively review our positioning in light of additional resources and current information. We plan to have an announcement regarding Logan's face covering policy following the Dec. 18, 2021 Commencement Ceremony. Stay well, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Students, faculty and staff- As health providers and educators who believe in evidence-based care and personal choice, we do not agree with mandates that challenge those tenets. At the same time, Logan University is a complex organization comprised of three types of regulated institutions - a large employer, a health care facility, and an institution of higher learning - each potentially falling under different and evolving regulations coming from various parts of our government, including the Occupational Safety & Health Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our attorneys are reviewing the recent mandate language and we are waiting for clarification and definitive direction from the public agencies that maintain oversight of our various operations. In the meantime, all members of the Logan community are encouraged to share their perspectives with their elected representatives and can find suggestions for doing so [here](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative). For more background on the proposed requirements, [this](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/federal-vaccine-mandates-are-finally-here-what-employers-need-to-know) feature in the National Law Review may be helpful. Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Logan Students, Faculty and Staff - This morning, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced a January 4, 2022 vaccine mandate deadline for all federal workers and contractors and a requirement for companies with more than 100 employees to either mandate vaccines or conduct regular COVID testing of employees. We are actively seeking guidance and direction from our legal counsel and will communicate more information as we receive it. Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Logan Students, Faculty and Staff- As the COVID-19 pandemic approaches the two-year mark, we have all witnessed the impact of information and how it is shared. Facts and myths seem to circulate equally well, with sometimes damaging consequences on individual health and, in a recent case, on our reputation as chiropractors. This month, the Associated Press published a story carried in many national media outlets titled: Anti-vaccine chiropractors rising force of misinformation. The article blames chiropractors as a whole for sharing baseless information, and specifically claims it is \"a profession that has become a major purveyor of vaccine misinformation during the pandemic.\" This gross generalization is frustrating, knowing that millions of lives are improved every year through chiropractic care that increases quality of life on many levels...and there are providers in all areas of health care who hold wildly different opinions on any number of topics. Targeting all chiropractors is as ill-informed as the pandemic misinformation cited in the story. The essential distinction here is the basis for those opinions and subsequent individual choices - evidence-based information, data and facts must be the cornerstones of prudent health decision making. Logan University's College of Chiropractic is committed to three things in all we do and teach: evidence-informed methods; critical thinking; and patient-centered care. This three-fold commitment has driven our consistent position through the pandemic, which has been to monitor and share recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and the St. Louis County Department of Health. Our campus - including our Health Centers - follows all mask recommendations; we have served as a COVID testing site; and we readily share information on vaccine availability with faculty, staff and students. We will continue to be advocates for science and informed personal decision-making. Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Logan Students, Faculty and Staff- Following [Monday's email](https://www.logan.edu/fall-2021/latest-communication-faqs/) about continuing the face covering policy into the Fall trimester, we received several responses that ranged from \"are we doing too much?\" to \"are we doing enough?\" The responses were all read and given due thought and consideration. We are well aware of the impact COVID has had on human lives and the havoc it has brought to the way we study, work and live. With appropriate hygiene, distancing, face coverings and vaccinations, COVID appeared to be dramatically decreasing. With the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant in recent months, the relaxing of safety guidelines and slower than expected vaccination rates, the infection rate has risen to January 2022 levels. The rapidly evolving science and evidence surrounding the pandemic is new to all of us. This pandemic has brought out passionate viewpoints and we are aware of the varying ideologies and positions surrounding the issue. We also understand the delicate balance of keeping our community safe and taking reasonable safety measures while at the same time allowing our students to gather and learn on campus. Currently, we find ourselves among the majority of colleges and universities recently surveyed in Missouri which are implementing face covering policies and not mandating vaccinations to return to campus. Our policies and actions may come as a relief for some and a frustration for others; these are complex times and our decisions are multi-layered. As we return to campus next week, I urge you to respect others by adhering to our safety policies ... consider your classmates, colleagues, instructors and their families. We all are hoping and striving for a safe and successful trimester, and expect compliance with this and future policies. Stay well. Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Logan Students, Faculty and Staff - As we come together for the Fall 2021 trimester, our number one concern is the health and safety of the campus community amid COVID-19. Since mid-June, COVID cases have increased in and around St. Louis and are now at [ January 2021 levels](https://stlouiscountymo.gov/st-louis-county-departments/public-health/covid-19/covid-19-data-reports/). Given these current conditions, as well as the rise of the Delta variant, it is important that all Logan employees, students and guests continue to wear effective and appropriately fitted face coverings while in classrooms, common areas and our Health Centers. This is in alignment with current direction from the St. Louis County as well as 83 percent of 40 colleges and universities in Missouri, which were recently surveyed. Changes to this face covering policy will be determined by a number of factors including, but not limited to, campus transmission rates, campus 14-day positive rates, and guidance from local, state and national public health departments. Please be vigilant in following COVID safety procedures, such as staying home when exhibiting symptoms of COVID and reporting confirmed cases of COVID in order to protect others and minimizing spread. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 should quarantine and contact Student Affairs at 636-230-1870 or [studentaffairs@logan.edu](mailto:studentaffairs@logan.edu). Employees should contact their immediate supervisor as well as consult with Human Resources. All individuals should not return to campus until they have been cleared by a health care professional. It is everyone's responsibility to report confirmed cases, as it enables us to conduct contact tracing and report COVID cases on campus and within our Health Centers. As always, we appreciate the Logan community's compliance and cooperation. Thank you for your ongoing patience and support. Sincerely, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Frequently Asked Questions - What is Logan's face covering policy? Until further notice, all Logan employees, students and guests must continue to wear effective face coverings while in classrooms, common areas and our Health Centers. Additionally, face coverings should be worn when any individual is in sustained close contact with others and in group settings. - Why is Logan instituting this policy? We don't want to have to return being fully online. We know that wearing face coverings on campus has significantly mitigated the on-campus transmission of the COVID virus, as evidenced by the lack of transmission to lab partners of COVID positive students. The vast majority of COVID positive cases that have been reported by the Logan student body or faculty have been traced back to an initial off-campus exposure. Additionally, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that majority of deaths related to COVID are a result of unvaccinated individuals and those who are in the younger age range. - What if I have concerns about wearing a required face covering on campus? Refusal to follow this policy may result in student dismissal that day, which will be counted as an unexcused absence. For employees, failure to wear a face covering may result in disciplinary actions, up to suspension and/or termination. Students who feel they cannot wear a face covering should contact Student Affairs to see if reasonable accommodations can be made due to related disability. Employees with concerns about wearing a face covering should speak with their immediate supervisor and consult with Human Resources. - Are face coverings available on campus? Yes, face coverings are available at the following entrances of the Administration Building (Front Lobby A1, ATM Lobby A2, MHC A3, Lot 9 A19, Courtyard A5), as well as Science Building S1, Purser Center P1, Alumni House AH1 and Wellness Center W6. - What kind of face coverings are not allowed? Neck gaiters and bandanas are not considered appropriate face coverings. All face coverings must be worn appropriately, covering the nose and mouth. Choose a face covering that fits snug, without gaps. In general, face coverings should have two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric covering both the mouth and nose. Find more recommendations here. - What if I test positive for COVID-19? Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 should quarantine and contact Student Affairs at 636-230-1870 or [studentaffairs@logan.edu](mailto:studentaffairs@logan.edu). Employees should contact their immediate supervisor as well as consult with Human Resources. All individuals should not return to campus until they have been cleared by a health care professional. It is everyone's responsibility to report confirmed cases, as it enables us to conduct contact tracing and report COVID cases on campus and within our Health Centers. Faculty, Staff and Students- Yesterday, St. Louis County Judge Nellie Ribaudo issued a temporary restraining order, halting a mask mandate in St. Louis County until a court decision is reached on Aug. 17. While we acknowledge this ruling, we also recognize the increase in COVID cases on our campus. Over the last seven days, we have learned of five new cases among faculty, staff and students four of which were reported this week alone. In order to avoid moving to virtual commencements, online final exams and an increased risk of infections originating from campus which could result in additional University policies Logan's face covering policy will remain in effect on campus and in our Health Centers through the month of August. Compliance by all individuals is required while indoors (this includes classrooms, hallways and common spaces) and in group settings, except while eating/drinking or alone. Refusal to follow this policy may result in student dismissal that day, which will be counted as an unexcused absence. For employees, failure to wear a face covering may result in disciplinary actions, up to suspension and/or termination. Students who feel they cannot wear a mask should contact Student Affairs to see if reasonable accommodations can be made due to related disability. Employees with concerns about wearing a mask should speak with their immediate supervisor and consult with Human Resources. Face coverings are available at the following entrances of the Administration Building (Front Lobby A1, ATM Lobby A2, MHC A3, Lot 9 A19, Courtyard A5), as well as Science Building S1, Purser Center P1, Alumni House AH1 and Wellness Center W6. Please ensure all face coverings are worn appropriately, covering the nose and mouth. Note, neck gaiters and bandanas are not considered appropriate face coverings. For more information on appropriate face coverings, click here. Thank you in advance for your compliance on this matter. Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Students, faculty and staff- Effective tomorrow, Tuesday, July 27, Logan University will re-implement face-covering guidelines per St. Louis County's mandate and guidance of our legal counsel. According to the order: - Face coverings are required to be properly worn by all individuals ages 5 and older while in indoor and enclosed public buildings and spaces and public transportation vessels in St. Louis County. - Face coverings are recommended in indoor private settings and crowded outdoor settings where there is close contact with other people who may not be fully vaccinated. - The only exceptions are for individuals who are: - Alone in a separate room, office or interior space - Eating or drinking - Specific individuals who are exempt from requirements are: - Children under 2 (and those between ages 2 and 5 who are under direct supervision of an adult) - Persons with health conditions that prohibit a face covering - Persons who have trouble breathing, or are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the Face Covering without assistance; - Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, or someone who is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing, where the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication The full order can be found [here](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstlcorona.com%2Fdr-pages-messages%2Fpublic-health-orders%2Fall-public-health-orders-archives%2Fface-covering-order%2F&data=04%7C01%7CNina.Kult%40logan.edu%7C91a51f8b4c2f4313050708d95074d737%7C12b0502287ae4711b25c041c20615f0a%7C0%7C0%7C637629285027268015%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=6UCHu%2BY26HOHlQvQ7ltcsVbocPKLT0H%2FJNffNmsxH1o%3D&reserved=0). Students who feel they cannot wear a mask should contact Student Affairs to see if reasonable accommodations can be made due to related disability. Employees with concerns about wearing a mask should speak with their immediate supervisor and consult with Human Resources. While the risk of COVID-19 infection and subsequent transmission to others is very low among those who are fully vaccinated, it is not zero. However, the evidence tells us the vaccination is still the most effective method to reduce the risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 virus and its variants. COVID will pass when a sufficient number of people are vaccinated or it runs its course, which may include a number of variants. The quicker the pandemic passes, the quicker the economy and individual lives will improve. I urge you to choose responsibility and compliance, both here and off campus, so we can resume full in-person instruction in the Fall as planned. With everyone striving for compliance, I am confident we can get there. At this time, August graduation ceremonies will go on as planned, with these restrictions in place. I encourage to you review the Frequently Asked Questions which can be found below. Stay well, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University Frequently Asked Questions - What if I test positive for COVID-19? - Any student, faculty or staff member who has tested positive for COVID-19, should quarantine, needs to contact Student Affairs or their immediate supervisor as well as consult with Human Resources, and not return to campus until they have been cleared by a health professional. - What does it mean to be 'fully vaccinated?\" - According to the CDC, \"people are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 2 weeks after they have received the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or 2 weeks after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson [J&J]). Unvaccinated people refers to individuals of all ages, including children, that have not completed a vaccination series and waited the required time to reach full immunity [[i]](#_edn1).

Unvaccinated people refers to individuals of all ages, including children, that have not completed a vaccination series and waited the required time to reach full immunity - Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? - The decision to receive a vaccine is a personal health choice; however, with the 2-dose (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccine, efficacy rates at preventing COVID-19 infections are 95% and single dose (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine efficacy rates are 72%. Choosing to be vaccinated is a highly effective preventative measure as well as a highly effective public health measure to mitigate the spread of the virus. Individuals residing with children under 12 or immune compromised individuals who may not be eligible to receive a vaccine should consider the mitigation effective of being vaccinated in the spread of the virus [[ii]](#_edn1).

Individuals residing with children under 12 or immune compromised individuals who may not be eligible to receive a vaccine should consider the mitigation effective of being vaccinated in the spread of the virus - Will the vaccine protect me against the delta variant of the COVID-19 virus? - The United States is now dealing with the delta variant of the coronavirus, a highly contagious variant that was first identified in India in December. As with previous varants, the delta variant has spread to many countries across the world an dis now responsible for most COVID-19 new cases. The unvaccinated population is at high risk for infection by the delta variant which continues to move quickly, especially in areas of low vaccinations rates. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the 2-dose vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) up to 96% effectiveness against the delta variant infection and vaccination is critical to rapid resolution of the delta variant. - [iii] Sakay, Yasemin Nicola. \"Here's How Well COVID-19 Vaccines Work Delta Variant.\" Healthline, Healthline Media, 16 July 2021, www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-how-well-covid-19-vaccines-work-against-the-delta-variant#Vaccines-vs.-delta-variant. - Where else do I need to wear a face covering? - Current CDC guidance says \"all travelers are required to wear a mask on all planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations.\" - Will this mandate change in the future? - The mandate could be updated based on new information, such as an decrease in transmission rates nationally or locally. While shifting guidance can be frustrating and sometimes confusing, it is essential that recommendations reflect both the latest scientific understanding and the current situation \"on the ground.\" As scientists learn more about this novel virus and how it is transmitted in different populations, and as new variants emerge that could potentially target different populations (e.g., children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated), we must continue to ensure that our guidance reflects the most up-to-date knowledge of the current situation locally, nationally, and globally. Due to decreased demand, the drive-thru COVID-19 PCR and Antibody Testing provided by Lab Test Diagnostics on Logan's campus will discontinue. Drive-thru COVID-19 PCR and Antibody Testing is available at Lab Test Diagnostics, 10007 Kennerly Road, St. Louis, MO 63128. Click [here](https://www.labtestdiagnostics.com/) for more information. EFFECTIVE TUESDAY, JUNE 1, 2021 In response to the new CDC and St. Louis County COVID guidelines, Logan University is rescinding the current face covering and social distancing policies for fully vaccinated individuals. Those who are vaccinated are welcome to continue wearing a face covering, if they prefer. Please note: faculty, staff, clinic patients and students assigned to Health Centers will be required to wear a face covering while in that setting, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes the Montgomery Health Center, Mid Rivers Health Center and the Logan Health Center at the Stephen A. Orthwein Center at Paraquad. The daily self-screen and temperature screening will no longer be required to enter University buildings, and all campus entry points will be open. Individuals are still encouraged to assess their health status, prior to reporting to campus. If you are not fully vaccinated, you remain at an elevated risk for contracting and transmitting the virus. To protect your own health and the health of people around you, it is vital that you continue to wear a face covering when in public around other people, practice social distancing and maintain other CDC-recommended measures to prevent the spread of COVID. Additional information regarding what activities and services may be re-opened or expanded to allow face-to face gatherings will be forthcoming from departmental supervisors in the weeks ahead. Logan intends to restore full on-campus operations for the Fall 2021 trimester. Guidance will be updated based on new information, such as an increase or decrease in COVID transmission rates. Stay well, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University As we welcome new students to Logan next week, and welcome back our current students and faculty, we wanted to share a few reminders aimed at keeping our campus community safe. We are still under St. Louis County restrictions concerning COVID-19 and while outdoor face covering restrictions have been eased for vaccinated individuals, indoor face covering and social distancing requirements have not changed for Logan University. It is important that all employees, students and guests of Logan adhere to the following guidelines and policies to ensure the vitality of our community: - 6-foot social distancing on all areas of campus - inside and outside. - Face coverings by all individuals - faculty, staff, students and visitors - inside buildings at all times. - Individuals who meet any of the following criteria are not required to wear a face covering when outdoors only: - fully vaccinated (14 days have passed since completion of the prescribed COVID-19 vaccine regimen), - socially distanced from others who do not live in their household, or - are with others who are fully vaccinated. - Completion of COVID screening with a green outcome screen before coming to campus. - Temperature checks at all facility entrances. Thank you for your patience and cooperation - we look forward to a successful summer trimester! Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD President, Logan University As a reminder, we are still under St. Louis County restrictions. It is important that all employees, students and guests of Logan adhere to the following guidelines and policies to ensure the vitality of our community: - 6-foot social distancing on all areas of campus - inside and outside. - Face coverings by all individuals - faculty, staff, students and visitors - both inside at all times and outside when you cannot maintain a 6-foot distance. - Completion of COVID screening with a green outcome screen before coming to campus. - Temperature checks all facility entrances. Thank you for your patience and cooperation! Faculty and Staff- Logan University has lifted travel restrictions for faculty and staff. Please work directly with your supervisor for travel approvals and refer to this CDC resource for travel recommendations. As we look ahead to the Summer 2021 trimester, we want to share our plans of what instruction will look like for our students, faculty and staff. While we are seeing a downward trend in the number of COVID-19 cases and an uptick in the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, those factors alone are not enough to return to how we were operating pre-March 2020. Logan will continue the current hybrid model (online delivery of lecture courses and on-campus, hands-on practical portions) for the Summer 2021 term, which begins May 13. This model will include block scheduling of practical courses in order to reduce the number of times per week students and faculty are required to report to campus. We continue to make evidence-informed decisions based on COVID-19 case monitoring, COVID-19 spread and vaccine availability, with the goal of progressively opening our campus to more in-person functions as circumstances allow. Based on these trends, we plan on permitting in-person student club meetings on a limited basis and we will continue to monitor our capacity to permit further in-person meetings and events. We also anticipate that the continued downtrend in COVID cases, as well as the widespread availability of vaccine, will continue through the summer, allowing us to return to normal campus operations in the Fall. As always, we are keeping our finger on the pulse of current safety and accessibility guidelines provided by St. Louis County and the CDC. We are grateful for our community's responsiveness, cooperation and diligence in following our procedures. Thank you for your ongoing patience and support. Sincerely, Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, Please be aware that we have implemented a new self-screening questionnaire. All Logan students, faculty, staff and guests are required to complete the questionnaire on a daily basis, whether coming to campus or not. On days that you will be on campus, the questionnaire must be completed prior to arriving. The self-screening questionnaire uses an algorithm to determine whether or not you are cleared to be on campus. Based on your responses, you will get either a green result (allowing you to proceed to campus), a yellow result (indicating you should stay home and monitor symptoms) or a red result (indicating you should stay at home and contact Student Affairs or your supervisor). When you receive your results, an icon will appear at the top of your screen. You may be asked to recall this icon to ensure you've taken your questionnaire. The icon will change each day. Please use the appropriate link to start your questionnaire: - Student Screening Link: [https://checkforcorona.com/logan-students#/screening](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcheckforcorona.com%2Flogan-students%23%2Fscreening&data=02%7C01%7CNina.Kult%40logan.edu%7C89b74da6b41541d9ce5808d8559be2e2%7C12b0502287ae4711b25c041c20615f0a%7C0%7C0%7C637353475302409259&sdata=IIvLn89hgRcKh8ylHxA5v6leV2r%2By6%2BJuBXGkDEx8WM%3D&reserved=0) - Employee Screening Link: [https://checkforcorona.com/logan-employees#/screening](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcheckforcorona.com%2Flogan-employees%23%2Fscreening&data=02%7C01%7CNina.Kult%40logan.edu%7C89b74da6b41541d9ce5808d8559be2e2%7C12b0502287ae4711b25c041c20615f0a%7C0%7C0%7C637353475302419258&sdata=yO3IIkvFT6j6wQrRAvXRogbmgeTv%2FXNV6IqPq5NjRzA%3D&reserved=0) - Visitor Screening Link: [https://checkforcorona.com/logan-visitors#/screening](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcheckforcorona.com%2Flogan-visitors%23%2Fscreening&data=02%7C01%7CNina.Kult%40logan.edu%7C89b74da6b41541d9ce5808d8559be2e2%7C12b0502287ae4711b25c041c20615f0a%7C0%7C0%7C637353475302419258&sdata=Ikd5luVk0UpAOKS17wZy4bvScK6DZyX8%2Bxfq1LaWjIE%3D&reserved=0) If you arrive on campus and have forgotten to do your daily screening, please use the above link or scan the QR code, which will also be on signs at each entrance. In general, if you do not feel well, please stay at home and contact your health care provider. Additionally, employees should contact their direct supervisor; students should contact Student Affairs at (636) 230-1870. Thank you for your cooperation in helping keep our campus safe! Logan University [Doctor of Chiropractic](https://www.logan.edu/academics/doctor-chiropractic/) Students, Looking ahead to Fall 2020, our goal - as a University - was to develop a flexible approach to academic instruction considering adjustments if conditions improve or worsen. Many options were considered while keeping the health and safety of the Logan community top of mind. Given the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and current rise in infection rates regionally and across the United States, we have decided to move forward with a hybrid format. This plan includes a full 15-week format for the online delivery of lecture courses and an 11-week compressed format for on-campus, hands-on lab practical portions. The on-campus practical portion will conclude by November 20, 2020 and credit hours for practical portions will be met through expanded assignments and activities. All students will be required to return for the hands-on lab practical portion and students in on-campus and off-campus clinical rotations will be required to fulfill the entire 15-week trimester. More information on how we will accommodate students who cannot return due to international travel restrictions or quarantine will be forthcoming. Benefits of this hybrid model include: - It permits students who are not in clinic to complete their on-campus activities prior to the Thanksgiving break and not return to campus until Spring 2021 semester. The Fall term will begin on the scheduled start date of Thursday September 10, 2020. - It allows us to be more flexible should the CDC, state or county public health authorities impose additional restrictions. - By maintaining a block schedule for the fall term, the number of times per week students and faculty are required to report to campus are reduced, thereby lessening exposure to larger groups. - It provides enhanced opportunities for student experience and demonstration of practical/clinical competencies required for successful progression in the program. The final block schedule for Fall 2020 be communicated to you no later than Friday, July 31. We are reviewing all of our current safety and accessibility procedures as we move toward Fall and continue to monitor and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that promotes the safety of all students, faculty, staff, patients and guests. Our policies and procedures will be aligned with guidance and recommendations from the CDC and public health authorities. Please email any questions or concerns to [CampusReturn@logan.edu](mailto:CampusReturn@logan.edu). Students, Faculty and Staff: As you arrive back on campus, we wanted to make you aware of a few new processes and procedures that have been implemented since our Return-to-Campus Plan was released. - In accordance with a [public health order](https://stlcorona.com/dr-pages-messages/public-health-orders/order-requiring-members-of-the-public-and-employees-to-wear-face-coverings/)issued by St. Louis County on July 1, Logan requires all individuals to wear a face covering while on campus and in campus facilities when other people are present. It is important that all individuals, who over the age of 9 and who do not have a disability, abide by this order while on Logan's campus. - Minor changes have been made to the block schedule: [Please see here for revised schedule.](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SU20-Practical-Course-Schedule-7.3.20.pdf) - For faculty and staff with offices, please remove the \"out of office\" signage from your office door when returning to campus. This will alert the Physical Plant staff that your office may be cleaned and disinfected on regular basis. - Out of an abundance of caution, students, faculty and staff are discouraged from eating together on Logan's campus when face coverings cannot be worn. - All water fountains and water coolers on Logan's campus will not be accessible. Please be sure to bring a personal water bottle with you. Additional clarification for those with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Based on current guidelines from St. Louis County, individuals with confirmed cases must quarantine for 14 days from the date of positive test AND have been entirely asymptomatic for 3 days. After they satisfy the criteria, the Department of Public Health Medical Officer reviews the case and issues a release letter. Asymptomatic contacts must also quarantine for 14 days. Assuming they remain asymptomatic, they can return afterwards. As a reminder to all, please do not report to campus if you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. The above changes and revisions have been updated in the Logan University Return-to-Campus Plan which can be found [here](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Logan-Return-to-Campus-Plan-7.3.20.pdf). Logan University Return-to-Campus Task Force Students, Faculty and Staff: As we anticipate the arrival of students and additional faculty and staff on Logan's campus beginning Monday, July 6, we have created a [Return-to-Campus Plan](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Logan-Return-to-Campus-Plan-6.29.20.pdf) that outlines new measures and procedures that will affect everyone coming to campus. Please review this plan in its entirety and understand that tweaks to this plan in the coming weeks may be necessary for improvement and overall success. We ask for everyone's patience and agility as we, as a community, implement this plan together. As always, the health and safety of our students, employees, patients and guests remains a top priority. We remind and encourage everyone to practice safe social distancing and take care to protect themselves and others. Should you have any questions or concerns, please direct them to [CampusReturn@logan.edu](mailto:CampusReturn@logan.edu) and the Task Force will answer in a timely manner. Thank you for your support, guidance and cooperation. Logan University Return-to-Campus Task Force Students: Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act established the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) to provide students with emergency financial aid. In order to award HEERF funds to students, the Department of Education (ED) requires all institutions to provide regular information regarding the funding, awarding and number of students receiving these emergency grants. - The Department of Education notified Logan University that it was approved to receive HEERF funds totaling $224,284 of which $112,142 (50%) was to be awarded in direct emergency grants to students. The university completed the necessary certification and agreement for the funds while developing a process to award the emergency grants to students. - In order to qualify for the emergency grants, students had to be eligible for Title IV funding as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and enrolled in on-campus courses as of March 13. At the time this funding was made available, Logan University had an estimated 735 students who could be eligible. - All students wishing to receive the emergency grant needed to submit an application requesting the funds. Applications were reviewed and, if approved, received grants ranging between $50 to $500 per application. Approved requests had to meet Title IV eligibility, qualifying expenses, and enrollment criteria. - All eligible students received an email solicitation to apply for the emergency grants as well posting the information regarding the grants on the Logan University website. - As of June 23, 2020, $104,918 has been awarded to 244 students. For more information on eligibility and the application process for this financial aid please refer to the [CARES Act info sheets.](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Federal-CARES-Act-Student-Emergency-Aid.pdf) Students and Faculty: As indicated in prior communications, the College of Chiropractic will be resuming on-campus delivery of the laboratory components of many practical skills courses, effective July 6, 2020. The intent of this return is to maximize opportunities for development and assessment of student competencies required for progression through the Doctor of Chiropractic program and, ultimately, graduation and practice, while following CDC guidelines to ensure safety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These courses have been scheduled in morning and afternoon blocks throughout the week as represented by the table below. In addition to the resumption of hands-on, practical learning opportunities, the design of this schedule provides: - Reduced number of campus visits for each class cohort. - Concentrated opportunities for student engagement during each campus visit. - Reduced number of individuals on campus at any time. The schedule below was updated with the schedule updates announced on July 3. Courses not resuming on-campus delivery during the remainder of the term will continue to be delivered remotely. Those courses will provide flexible opportunities for student participation, thus facilitating students' engagement with all courses in the program. Students who are unable or unwilling to return to campus for practical coursework on July 6 have the option to continue these courses remotely for the remainder of the term. Students electing to remain off-campus through the end of the SU'20 term must inform their Academic Success Coach no later than Monday, June 22 via this [form](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2FPages%2FResponsePage.aspx%3Fid%3DIlCwEq6HEUeyXAQcIGFfCn4tv4n9p-tDrkKYxOwTPQRURUtKVlc0WUFQM01ORFI4SVhZMURJSDRQRC4u&data=02%7C01%7CJordan.Ackerman%40logan.edu%7C257a7490c0254a3b8fc708d814a40aee%7C12b0502287ae4711b25c041c20615f0a%7C0%7C0%7C637282042160339873&sdata=p%2Bb%2FuAkjJaC%2BCYsVM7MzB0qUe5CHoiO6Mg36aoCz8Wg%3D&reserved=0). For those returning to campus, we will be employing a variety of safety measures including: - Interpersonal distancing in practical lab and other spaces - Daily screening procedures - Wearing of protective masks - Physical barriers - Expanded sanitation and disinfection practices Additional information about public health and safety measures for on-campus activities will be forthcoming in separate communications. The most recently communicated health and safety measures can be found in the [Return-to-Campus FAQ's](https://www.logan.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Return-to-Campus-Plan-FAQs-6.16.20.pdf). We are excited to resume on-campus teaching and learning in these courses that are integral to chiropractic training and practice. We look forward to seeing you all on campus soon! Students: As you know, some hands-on practical courses will resume on campus starting July 6.

Students, Faculty and Staff: First and foremost, I have been overwhelmed by the support you all have provided over the past few months. Through these difficult times and unprecedented challenges, you have demonstrated courage, leadership and solidarity in such a way that makes me proud of those who call Logan their home. We have been working extremely hard on developing a multi-phase, return-to-campus plan that keeps your health and safety a top priority. St. Louis County's recent announcement to reopen has allowed Logan to move forward with this plan in accordance with federal, state and county guidelines. As always, we are monitoring the situation on a daily basis and will keep you informed of any changes in County or CDC policy/recommendations that may impact the plan. - Montgomery and Mid-Rivers Health Centers have remained open on a limit basis and will progressively ramp up. Additional clinic shifts for students will be added as patient volume resumes and telehealth services which began during COVID-19 will continue. - Logan will resume practical/lab courses on July 6, 2020 for all Trimester 1 - 8 Doctor of Chiropractic students as well as the faculty and staff who support those practical/lab courses. - For those students who are uncomfortable or unable to attend clinical experiences and practical/lab courses, Logan will continue to provide virtual experiences. - Face-to face lecture courses will resume September 10, 2020, the start of the fall trimester. At that time, we intend to have all remaining faculty and staff return to campus. - That said, new procedures, safety precautions and social distancing practices will be in place to safeguard you, our patients and faculty/staff health and well-being. This will include screening procedures, sanitation and physical barriers procedures, smaller course section sizes and staggered class start times, among other recommendations from the CDC. More information regarding schedules as well as the implementation of the above public health measures will be forthcoming from the Registrar's Office, Human Resources and Academic Affairs as well as other appropriate divisions. All students are encouraged to join the Dean of Students and College of Chiropractic Dean for regular video chats regarding additional information on the return-to-campus plan.
