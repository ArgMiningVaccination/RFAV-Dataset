According to the Centers for Disease Control, 42 million Americans are currently infected by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and most do not know it. New data indicate that AHCC\u00ae, a unique extract from Shiitake mushroom mycelium, could be a valuable tool in the fight against high-risk HPV infections. In this free webinar, Judith Smith, Director of Women's Health Integrative Medicine Research Program (WHIM) at UTHealth McGovern Medical School, will present her groundbreaking HPV study and discuss its implications for supporting the immune system in clearing high-risk HPV infections. According to this Phase II study, published in Frontiers in Oncology, daily use of AHCC\u00ae translated into clearance of HPV infections in two-thirds of study participants after six months. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). You'll gain: - A better understanding of HPV infection rates, screening guidelines, vaccination efficacy, and the rising incidence of HPV-associated cancers - Details of the UTHealth AHCC\u00ae study methodology, analysis, results, and potential clinical implications - Insight on AHCC\u00ae: what it is, how it works, and what it means for immune health - Actionable steps you can bring to your patients SPONSORED BY THE AHCC ASSOCIATION About AHCC\u00ae: AHCC\u00ae is a functional food derived from the mycelium of shiitake mushrooms. There are more than 30 human clinical studies, and over 50 papers on AHCC in Medline-indexed scientific journals. It has been proven to support immune system health through enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activation. It also has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. AHCC is utilized by over 1,000 healthcare facilities worldwide to reduce the incidence of infections in both healthy and immunocompromised patients, to improve cancer outcomes, to decrease chemotherapy-related side effects, to help control HPV infections, to manage viral loads in Hepatitis-C patients, and to help those with liver disease. The AHCC\u00ae Association was founded to educate consumers and healthcare professionals on the benefits of AHCC\u00ae, to promote AHCC\u00ae research; and to protect the industry and consumers from adulterated versions of AHCC\u00ae supplements.
