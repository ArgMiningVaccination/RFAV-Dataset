Kelly Grocoff, MSW, who works as a private licensed psychotherapist in Ann Arbor and for a community mental health agency in Detroit, has recently partnered with The Lamaze Family Center Ann Arbor to offer a series of classes called \"Sex and Intimacy After Baby: Making it Matter for Moms\" and several other related lectures and workshops. The classes will start in early September and run for five weeks on Monday evenings, with a one-day intensive \"teaser\" workshop scheduled in late July or early August. The one-day class will address physical changes, hormonal changes, pelvic floor health, and emotional/relationship changes after having a baby. In addition, Grocoff is holding a short introductory lecture in June at The Lamaze Family Center called \"Mom's Night Out\" that will address the challenges that new moms and couples with young children face. \"What I found with the last class series that I ran, once you open the door and let people know these are important topics to discuss, the flood gates just open,\" said Grocoff, who is in the process of becoming a certified sex therapist through The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT). Grocoff structured the series around the book Sex Matters for Women, which was written by three local sex therapists, Sallie Foley, MSW, Sally Koped, MSW, and Dennis Sugrue, PhD. However, she tailors the classes to reach new moms who are interested in how their sexual relationships have changed since having kids and how their bodies have changed since giving birth. Topics like breast feeding, painful sex, and barriers to having sex when you have children will be discussed.\"If you improve your sexual relationship, then you'll improve other parts of your relationship and vice versa,\" said Grocoff. In her last series of classes, participants reported that they felt more empowered to talk with their partners about sexual changes and that these classes had initiated a valuable conversation that could continue for the rest of their lives.

Licensed social worker, Cesar Valdez, who has been practicing mind/ body/spirit-oriented psychotherapy for the past 14 years and has been an established Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) practitioner, is offering a ground breaking new therapy called Induced After Death Communication (IADC) intended to help people overcome extreme grief after the passing of a loved one. \"What draws me to this therapy is its incredible power to heal the sadness connected to grief and feelings of loss of a loved one and replace it with the feelings of real connection, peace and contentment,\" said Valdez. Going beyond traditional grief counseling, IADC encourages clients to explore the possibility of intimate communication with the deceased. Many clients have reported communications, including sensing the energy of the person that died, seeing their image, feeling a sensation of being touched by a hand or embraced, sensing a familiar smell of the person who died, hearing the deceased's voice and even having a conversation with their loved one who has passed. These communications have helped them to feel reconnected and have transformed their feelings of loss. The client usually only needs two extended sessions to achieve results, but must wait for at least six months after their loved one has died to allow time for the initial shock and denial stages of the death to subside. Much like the EMDR practice of having a client focus on his/her finger and track that movement while also focusing on various emotions, IADC utilizes eye movements similar to those experienced during sleep to process negative emotions such as anxiety, intense trauma or sadness. Instead of the EMDR practice of encouraging clients to experience any and all feelings that come up, IADC clients focus specifically on the deep sadness and grief associated with the loss of their loved one. Valdez says the new therapy can be very intense. He carefully screens potential IADC clients because not everyone is ready to deal with the extent of his or her grief feelings. His clients must be \"both willing and able to tolerate the full intensity of their sadness and allow the sadness to go wherever it needs to go.\" Although there is much research on EMDR with proof the therapy is helpful, IADC is new and still needs to be studied further . Dr. Al Botkin, the EMDR specialist from Chicago who discovered IADC and who trained Valdez, is working on getting more IADC studies underway. What's New in the Community Network Spinal Analysis is like \"defragging your computer, but instead you're defragging the cerebral spinal brain,\" says Shawn Hoga of the Triumph Network Studio , located within the Center for Sacred Living. Psychotherapist Kelly Grocoff tailors her classes to reach new moms who are interested in how their sexual relationships have changed since having kids and how their bodies have changed since giving birth. Continued on page 10 Photo by Amy Hoga See article on page 12.\"Some people embrace this therapy because it is consistent with their beliefs and others may have doubts or be entirely skeptical, but [you should] know that our belief systems play no role in whether the therapy works or not,\" said Valdez. \"I, as a practitioner, remain neutral about that. I don't suggest a source for those experiences because really it is just a matter of just resolving the grief,\" said Valdez. \"Is it your brain that is creating the experiences of perceived communication [with the deceased] or is it actual spiritual communication? That is left up to the experiencer to determine.\" For in-depth information about IADC please visit Dr. Botkin's website at www.induced-adc.com or call Cesar Valdez at (734) 929-6574, visit his website at www.cesarvaldezlmsw.com, or email him at cesvaldez@gmail.com. New Books By Area Authors There will be a book signing at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore on Wednesday, May 4, at 7 p.m. with local first-time author Craig Toepfer in support of his newly released book, The Hybrid Electric Home - Clean, Efficient, Profitable. This compelling account of the past, present and future of electricity in America reveals the untold story of how electricity became pervasive in our lives. Author Craig Toepfer, an expert on wind electric generators and hybrid vehicles, examines how we supply and use electricity today and suggests future methods for homes, businesses, and communities, taking readers on a fascinating historical tour of electricity from discovery to ubiquity . Showcasing wind, solar, and other natural forms of energy, The Hybrid Electric Home explores methods that will improve overall energy efficiency and economic security as society transitions into tomorrow's clean energy economy. Toepfer, who now lives in the Waterloo Recreation Area in Chelsea and is restoring an antique windmill to use on his new property, first became interested in the environment and energy as an engineering student at the University of Michigan. His interest turned into a lifelong fascination with wind electric generators produced during the 1930s that were used on farms throughout the Great Plains States. In The Hybrid Electric Home he suggests the history of energy supply to rural America has poised many communities to stand at the forefront of the clean energy movement. \"In rural areas that weren't served by the power companies originally, they had their own equipment and many of these homes and farms had windmills on them to produce electricity. It makes more sense for people today who live far away from cities to be able to produce their own electricity than to run power lines down every road for miles and miles to get to these homes.\" A pioneer in the clean energy movement, Toepfer was among the first in the United States to connect a wind generator to a home and the electric network. He represented the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) in the 70's, helped develop the grid inter-tie concept for connecting wind generators and solar panels to the electric grid, and has applied his hybrid and energy experience to advanced vehicle design and engineering in the automotive industry. He was inspired to write The Hybrid Electric Home after author Craig Gillis interviewed him for a book called Wind Power . \"I had been out of the windmill business for about 15 years. I never thought of writing a book,\" he says. But when Gillis saw all of his old wind generators and his historical literature collection, he insisted he write a book. \"He was so persuasive that I accepted the challenge.\" To purchase The Hybrid Electric Home - Clean, Efficient, Profitable, please come to the book signing at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room and Bookstore on May 4. To purchase online, visit Toepfer's website at www.hybridelectrichome.com, email him at hybridhome@me.com or call (734) 417-5500.

The association's purpose is to provide a base of support to promote naturopaths, students and educators, and to set standards and offer continuing education and political support for the profession. \"I'm excited that this is starting here in the Ann Arbor area and that it will grow,\" said Mary Light, who is the advisor and \"midwife\" of the whole idea. The board of directors is all from Southeastern Michigan. The organization looks forward to branching out by hosting its first national conference in Ann Arbor. School directors and educators from east to west are very enthusiastic about its development. Check out www . americannaturopathsassociation.org for more information. In January the Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts started a new meetup.com group for the community called Natural Medicine Ann Arbor and holds regular meetings for the group to gather. \"People might not be sure how to connect with others that are into natural medicine,\" said Mary Light. In the spirit of neighborhood support and connecting with like-minded others, the group has about 30 current members and counting.

New Classes Naturopath and Flower Essence Practitioner Merri Walters of Great Lakes Sacred Essences is teaching a Level I Certification Flower Essence Practitioner in an eight-month mentoring course starting in September 2011. Walters, a local intuitive healer who works with flower essences, herbs, homeopathic remedies, counseling and other healing modalities, is recognized and respected as a \"healer's healer\" among Ann Arbor's holistic community. In this mentoring course she will teach the basics of working with flower essences and will interact individually with students to help them increase their intuitive skills. The class is designed to help healthcare practitioners across the full spectrum of modalities learn to integrate flower essences into their current healing practice and personal/family life. \"I am dedicated to elevating the use of flower essences to their rightful place as one of our most powerful healing tools,\" said W alters. Flower essences come from flowers or other natural sources and are made through a water and sun process. Walters prepares them with intention, prayer, and love, being guided by nature spirits and divine intuition. When she administers the essences, her clients receive the energy, wisdom or the intelligence of the flower as they take it internally. This can prompt a change in the person if it is the right flower essence for that person. \"The way the flower essences work is that they often get to the bottom of what a health or an emotional issue is and unlock it,\" said Walters. Merri Walter's Great Lakes Flower Essences has over 250 individual flower essences available for purchase. For more information about her, the mentoring course, and Great Lakes Flower Essences, please go to www. sacredessences.com, email her at sacredessences@gmail.com or call (734) 663-3160. Numerologist and spiritual development counselor, John Ashbrook, who wrote a column for Phenomenews for 16 years called Spiritual Ponderings , is offering a new class called 1227 Spiritual Development on Saturday, June 18, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., that includes a light, healthy lunch and will be held at the Days Inn in Canton. The class will be teach students how to use and reap the benefits of powerful affirmation prayers and will cover a variety of other topics about personal development. The spiritual meaning of numbers, their significance in relation to current world events and how they are affecting everyone will also be discussed. \"The class is very relaxed and interactive, where people can ask questions, participate and ponder things,\" said Ashbrook. \"I believe for people to be healthy human beings, they have to express their individuality. And that is what I have devoted my entire career to: helping people find things in themselves which they can express and ideas that will give them satisfaction. From their expression of individuality they gain their self-esteem,\" Ashbrook explains. \"The forming of self-esteem is directly proportional to personal expression. The more you express your individuality, the more you like yourself, and then the better you get along with other people,\" he adds. Ashbrook is also offering a new career guidance service that he developed in response to so many people switching careers because of the economy . He uses numerology charts as a guide to direct people to other career paths that they would be able to pursue successfully. \"They just have different talents that I point out that they may or may not be aware of,\" said Ashbrook. His career advice seems to go far. \"John is a master at the psychology of the soul. My life has totally transformed from his classes. John gives you the tools to re-create your life in a better way,\" said Mary Ann Archer from Harbor Springs, a successful retail jewelry shop owner who credits Ashbrook for her success. The Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts has started a national professional organization called the American Naturopaths Association.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 11 Numerologist and spiritual development counselor, John Ashbrook, who wrote a column for Phenomenews for 16 years called Spiritual Ponderings , is offering a new class called \"1227 Spiritual Development.\" Continued on page 12 Ashbrook has been doing private counseling sessions that are based on numerology for almost 22 years and has written over 150 articles for Phenomenews , the extensive holistic guide that closed its doors after 30 years, in 2009. Many articles from the magazine are posted on his website. For more information, please call (734) 326-3433 to get on the mailing list for specifics or book a private consultation.

Naturopath and homeopathic master clinician, Moshe Daniel Block, is coming to The Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts to teach a two-day workshop called Mind/Body Connection on June 18 and 19 from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The workshop stresses the importance of truly looking within for the cause of illness by exploring how negative belief systems and unbalanced mind patterns can lead to illness in the body. Block will share methods for releasing unhealthy thought patterns for healing and wellbeing. Block draws on the traditions of western naturopathy, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, energy healing, Kabbalah, basic sciences and counseling to help students understand how disease manifests in the body and how negative emotions form from disharmony in the mind. He believes in the balance of a foundation in strong education and teaching principles and using the intuitive process when addressing issues. \"Few Naturopath practitioners seem to be actually practicing with a true holistic model,\" said Block, who is hoping to bridge that gap. He explained that even in the homeopathic world there is an incorrect model of western medicine that is still being used. In that model, the patient isn't taking responsibility for his/her own healing and will go to a Naturopathic doctor that prescribes pills, such as nutraceuticals or supplements, for their problem. Block wants to see that changed and have his profession look at the root causes behind the problem, not just treat the symptom with pills, and really begin to treat truly with holism. In 1995, Block was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder, Myasthenia Gravis, and his conventional neurologist said it was progressive, incurable and potentially fatal. But Block had an intuitive feeling he was going to heal himself and he embarked on a serious dedicated path to do just that. Shortly after his diagnosis, Block attended a one-week program at the Option Institute in Massachusetts and learned about belief systems and their impact on health. He had an epiphany about his own need to be perfect and his pattern of harshly judging himself and creating anger. He said his body was reflecting this concept in his own immune cells that were attacking his body . Block went on to school at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine and graduated in 2000. He does not have Myasthenia Gravis anymore and has helped many people overcome autoimmune ailments as well.\"In most of my cases, I help the patient establish the theme that is moving through their life which is reflecting in their bodies. I am going to teach participants in the workshop techniques on how to recognize these patterns and how to release and correct them,\" said Block. Block is originally from Canada and is the author of three books: The Revolution of Naturopathic Medicine - Remaining True to Our Philosophy , Book 1 of The Last Four Books of Moses - Letting Go of Free Will, and The Nu Covenant of Solomon (only available as an e-book).

Be The Light's clairvoyant reader and healer, Molly Ann Indura, is offering a new class called Energy Maintenance. The class will be held in Ann Arbor on Sunday, May 22, and again on Sunday, August 14. Both classes run from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Indura has helped thousands of people release energy burdens to get clear and become connected to the light. Included in the course are techniques to ground energy, connect to source, bring your own energy back to yourself and remove other people's energy that may be draining. \"I feel really humbled and honored to do this work and to be allowed to have the opportunity to assist people in being the light in their own lives,\" said Indura. Prior student Stephanie Krupp, an executive recruiter from Dexter, said about the class, \"I found I was very energized by the process and was able to use the techniques Molly taught us later on.\" As a healer, Indura often uses energy telekinesis (using her mind and will to move energy), cord cutting and DNA activation techniques. She frequently offers monthly discounts on different services. Her Isis Healing is currently featured at a special discounted rate throughout the summer months and involves \"taking all the energy that people spend on emotional drama and redirecting it into our ancient intuitive mind, leading to a huge increase in clarity and energy for life.\" She is also a full-time student at Eastern Michigan University studying fine arts and education and lives with her 12-year-old daughter in Ann Arbor.

New Businesses and Practitioners Chiropractor Dr. Shawn Michael Hoga has recently opened his Network Spinal Analysis (NSA) studio called Triumph Network Studio within The Center for Sacred Living, located on the west side of Ann Arbor. Hoga has found the NSA technique more effective at achieving health objectives than traditional chiropractic manipulation. \"My son, Oliver, was heading down the road to autism, and through NSA we fetched him back from the brink,\" said Hoga, the humble father of four, with a fifth baby expected in May. NSA is a transformative healing technique that is budding out of chiropractic. It uses light touch to cue the nervous system to self-assess and self-correct and express energy efficient strategies for healing. The objective is to work with what is strong within the body system and harness that energy to \"entrain\" an area that needs help to be transformed into optimal functioning. \"Entrainment\" is a physics concept that was discovered to show the tendency for two oscillating bodies to lock into phase so that they vibrate in harmony , often noticed in musical instruments synchronizing together. \"Through what is called a 'spinal gateway' there is a high energy efficient state that uses the other body systems to liberate stored tension and then reorganizes the tissues awaiting transformation to higher levels of health expression,\" said Hoga. Hoga performs the therapy on individuals and in groups. He finds the group energy often facilitates the healing he observes in his patients. Hoga said that every individual's bio-field can affect another's field and this happens to the benefit of the patient. \"This process encourages letting go and trusting so that my body can open up and heal and find its balance,\" said Rose Wisniewski, a social worker from Ann Arbor who has been coming for regular treatments. Wisniewski said she is sleeping better and her issues around fatigue have improved. According to Hoga, NSA is the most researched chiropractic technique and is considered groundbreaking in that it is a wellness discipline concept. With NSA, the practitioner is focusing on the well areas of the body and letting the nervous system organize and correct the areas that are not. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 12 Naturopath and homeopathic master clinician, Moshe Daniel Block, is coming to The Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts to teach a two-day workshop.What's New in the Community Continued from page 11Continued on page 14Hoga has an interesting way of looking at his compensation fee. \"I don't want to break you, I want you to break through,\" he said in reference to his fee system, which is based on what the client wants to and can pay. He works with a sliding scale for clients to make it affordable for everyone. \"I have received anywhere from $20 up to $1,000 for just one treatment,\" said Hoga, who recognizes that clients need to maintain their dignity while answering their financial responsibilities and also acknowledging his integrity towards them. NSA is like \"defragging your computer, but instead you're defragging the cerebral spinal brain,\" said Hoga. Triumph Network Studio has made it their passion to help other families in the area that have children encountering Autism, Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, Aspergers and Sensory Integrative Disorders. Hoga is planning on hosting a free demonstration open house on Sunday, May 22 from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom's community room.

Brighton Natural Wellness Center is a holistic healing center on Grand River Avenue that opened its doors in September of 2010. The center is located in a beautiful Victorian house and offers many different services, including BowenWork, Reiki, hypnosis, massage, intuitive astrology, psychic readings, handwriting analysis, angel card readings, ceremonies, workshops, classes and more. \"This is a gift for the community, my angels have been saying,\" said Jude Shepard, hypnotherapist and program coordinator for Brighton Natural Wellness Center (BNWC). \"For me, it's about creating a place of transformation and connection among members of the community.\" There are many continuing monthly activities at the center, such as the wise women spiritual support community circle, a past life exploration class, a drumming circle, and a divine light meditation creation circle. The BNWC hosts A Light Fair every fourth Saturday of the month so the community can sample the many talents of the over 30 active healers, readers, therapists or artists that work there. All summer long, starting in May, the center is sponsoring a living foods preparation workshop every third Saturday called \"The New You with Raw Foods\" taught by Joyce Oliveto, a gourmet living foods chef, teacher, author and speaker. A \"Walk for Natural Wellness\" is set for Tuesday, August 9 from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. in downtown Brighton. See the first entry under Upcoming Events. \"I've worked in western medicine for over 25 years and we are just not doing enough. There is something missing. The work we do here (at the center) is helping with that problem,\" said Shepard. BNWC is one of the only places that offers BowenWork, a type of acupressure and massage that allows the body to heal itself whether physical or emotional, utilizing the autonomic nervous system. Shepard, a Bowen practitioner, became fascinated with the technique after she had an injury to her lower back and it resolved with Bowen. In addition, the center offers free BowenWork for kids every second Saturday of the month. Besides offering healing services to the community and public, BNWC has networking opportunities available for practitioners and artists if they join the center as a member. The membership allows a therapist to put up advertising fliers, post their biography on the website, use the space by renting the rooms, or display and sell their art at the center. For more information about healing services, membership, workshops, transformational meetings or the Wellness Walk please visit www.BrightonWellness.org or call (810) 599-8855 and email jude@AmiracleToday.com. Healing-In-Motion PLLC Therapy and Wellness, a holistic physical therapy center, has a new owner as of June 2010. Lisa Wiley, an occupational therapist and certified hand specialist, bought the business and has made the backbone of her business about helping people relieve chronic pain and restriction of motion through the John F. Barnes Myofascial Release (JFB MFR) technique. Myofascial release is a type of therapy used to treat pain and restriction of motion from any area of the body, such a person's neck, back, hips, or elbows. Fascia is like a white filament that surrounds all of our cells and muscles. When the fascia is stuck together, there is friction and pain. A practitioner can work into the area by relaxing contracted muscles, increasing circulation, increasing venous and lymphatic drainage, and stimulating the stretch reflex of muscles of the overlying fascia. \"I like to see people get better, I like to help people help themselves get better,\" said Wiley. \"I think there is a need out there for places where people can come to get one-on-one attention with a therapist and they can openly decide to have some direction in their health care.\" The center's specialty is treating pelvic pain, especially for women recovering from having a baby . \"Many people come to us that have had many types of therapies for pelvic pain and find with the JFB MFR they get results. This is significant because many people live with pelvic pain not knowing something can be done to help them. People need to know there is help out there,\" said Wiley. \"The principle of myofascial release is to treat the whole body. If your low back hurts one would think that the therapist would treat the low back, but the problem could be a referred pain that could be coming from somewhere else that often gets overlooked,\" she added. Mike Kelly, an actor and screenwriter from Ann Arbor, said the center got to the root of his problems and helped him tremendously. Wiley recently launched a DVD in January 2011 on how to treat tennis elbow under the name of Bare Bones Therapy, a self-help treatment program you can get at www.barebonestherapy.com. The Healing-In-Motion therapists are actively involved in updating their skills with continuing education classes. Besides physical and occupational therapies they also offer massage, a wellness program that involves advanced myofascial release, and community education classes for self-treatment, stretching and personal training. For more information, please visit www.healing-in-motion.com. Contact the center at (734) 913-4816 or email therapy@healing-in-motion.com. LifeRhythms opened its doors to the public in March in Ann Arbor. Joya D'Cruz, an Ohio licensed marriage and family therapist, brings her expertise to the area as a Certified Focusing Trainer. D'Cruz offers individual counseling and Focusing sessions. The hallmark of Focusing therapy is learning how to treat yourself lovingly and gently while listening curiously, internally, for solutions to your problems. She explained that many people try to solve problems by talking, analyzing, taking hasty action and \"figuring things out,\" which seems to get them nowhere. \"We are like dancers, each following our own musical beat, and sometimes we fall out of rhythm. At these times, if we pause and listen inwardly, we can get back into rhythm again,\" said D'Cruz. \"Sometimes it just takes that one little step of checking where the answer really lies, which makes all the difference in the world.\" D'Cruz said she has found that many people are not really listening to themselves, paying attention to where their life is taking them now or what is good for them internally in the present moment.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 13 Brighton Natural Wellness Center is a holistic healing center on Grand River Avenue that opened its doors in September of 2010. \"We are like dancers, each following our own musical beat, and sometimes we fall out of rhythm. At these times, if we pause and listen inwardly, we can get back into rhythm again,\" says Joya D'Cruz of LifeRhythms.See article on page 13.By using the Focusing technique it has become D'Cruz's goal to help people to listen to where their life is moving them forward. She gets people to a safe place, guides them through the inward body messages, stays with them to process through the emotions, and invites them to be open to receiving answers from the body itself. D'Cruz's wisdom comes from her Zen meditation practice in her own life. She explains that Zen creates a space for people to accept themselves, accepting the fact of reality just as it is, and realizing nothing is permanent. Focusing assists this attitude and is a natural extension of it, she adds. LifeRhythms helps people who are struggling in relationships and who would like to create more joy and ease in those relationships, and for people who feel stuck or overwhelmed with emotions. LifeRhythms is hosting Focusing training workshops throughout the summer on how to use it to solve problems in daily life.

The Healing Hearts Center, a non-profit community for creative collaboration, will have an official grand opening in early May for their farm/healing center in Dexter. The directors, Sarah Steven and Matthew Raphael, are very excited about the possibilities of the center and its potential for transformational work. From renting out space to local healers, to working with clients, to housing and raising animals, and a vision of biodynamic farming bringing the community together, this center is sure to intrigue. \"We have already had many Ann Arborites coming to us saying, 'I want to keep bees,' 'I want to grow more shitake mushrooms,' 'I want to keep goats and make goat cheese,'\" said Steven. She adds they are open to all of these ideas and wish to support people's dreams and goals. They want people to think of the center as the new community resource center with a mission to share in collective evolution and growth. The center's 1885 farmhouse is located on Joy Road just past Zeeb Road and sits on six acres and has two barns. In the pole barn, they will hold workshops and house large groups for parties and events planned by locals who wish to share their knowledge and skills with the community. The old barn is where they plan to keep animals on one side and use the other side for performance-theater shows this summer. They will be acquiring a mule in the spring and are open to housing all type of animals for the community , such as cows and goats. The parlor in the farmhouse is where Steven and Raphael offer clients their specialized bodywork, Wazoga. It will also serve as a shared space for other healers to rent as well. \"Through Wazoga, we teach people how to speak without words,\" said Steven regarding the technique which utilizes a combination of massage/yoga and breathe work that can be used alone or with couples. \"When we can be in touch with ourselves then we can actually share ourselves with another person,\" she added. Steven is hoping to make the farm \"off the grid\" one day. There are 67 acres of land behind the property that the City of Ann Arbor bought to preserve for agricultural use only. She is hoping to see the community buy the land back someday and set up biodynamic farming and gardening. Steven wants to bring the community together through growing food and raising animals. The center will eventually be looking for interns and apprentices to work at the healing center or on the farm. Steven and Raphael are very excited about the birth of the center. They are also expecting a baby in June and planning on having an underwater birth at the farmhouse.

The group's mission is to change the way society views and plans for death by taking a more holistic approach to end-of-life planning. Emphasizing the need for conscientious, personalized legacy plans, their services help a person organize their documents and clearly express their final wishes, intentions, and ideas of how they want to be commemorated. Clients can also work with financial advisors and estate attorneys, plan their Life Celebration, funeral or memorial service, and prepare an autobiography and portrait album to be shared with family and friends. This unique approach goes beyond traditional estate planning and addresses the confusion and stressful dynamics that can often come up when someone dies. \"It's about the heart and soul of it,\" said Callan Loo, President of Peaceful Crossings. \"You take this really tough process and make it much easier to relieve the strain when someone is grieving.\" At Peaceful Crossings, they believe the client should think of their end-of- life celebration as if they were planning a wedding. The ceremony should reflect their wishes, beliefs, cultural background and values, religious or non-religious, as well as those of their loved ones and family. Loo explained that if a person doesn't take the extra step of defining what his or her end-of-life celebration is supposed to look like, then it's basically left for someone else to do. \"And you know, most people really don't want a bunch of people sitting around crying.\" To help a person plan and host their desired celebration, Loo's team connects with local funeral homes and offers a celebrant service to families going through the grieving process. Loo is a certified celebrant through the In-Sight Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and specializes in creating meaningful celebrations that will be true to the person who has passed and helpful to those who are mourning. Additionally, Peaceful Crossings offers life and grief coaching for those that need additional counseling for processing through the loss and change. \"Many people do not like the product/service that the traditional funeral homes offer because it's not personal,\" said Loo. At a traditional funeral, people go to the funeral home and the body has been embalmed and has an open casket. Loo explained that many people experience this and are mortified because usually the body does not look like the \"Uncle Bob\" that they once knew and loved. \"It's just something that is dressed up to look like Uncle Bob. It looks bad and smells bad and that stuff goes in the ground. Many people go up to say a few words and their intentions are good, but they do not know how to present this person's life. That is what people have had to work with,\" said Loo. Peaceful Crossings hopes to change these traditional dynamics and help many people along the way. They also work with families looking to have at-home funerals and green burials. For more information, please visit www.peacefulcrossings.com, call 734-660-8622 or email callan@peacefulcrossings.com.

The earth is like a child that knows poems. - Rainer Maria Rilke As spring conjures up ideas of rebirth, renewal, and re-growth, now is the time that people are going outside and giving in to their child-like yearnings to run, jump, and play . Beyond bringing immediate joy, walking and running can provide long-lasting benefits, like strengthening the body and nourishing the soul. And considering the beautiful backdrop the Ann Arbor area provides for such outside pursuits, why not take part in these natural ways to feel carefree and connected to the earth? Both beginners to competitors alike can reap the benefits. There is a \"mindful\" approach to fitness that is taking off locally and turning health-filled visions into a reality for many, from beginning runners and injured athletes to fitness runners and performance athletes. It' s called Chi Running, and it has a corresponding low-impact version, Chi Walking. Chi, pronounced \"chee,\" is Chinese for energy or life force. Veteran marathoner and ultra-marathoner Danny Dreyer invented the technique of Chi Running, and authored the book, Chi Running . The practice, which blends key concepts from the ancient martial art form of T'ai Chi with optimal running techniques, has taken off worldwide and has gained media attention from sources such as NPR, The New York Times, and ABC News, according to the website, www.chirunning.com. Sage Advice from an Obsessed Runner Randy Step, president and CEO of seven Running Fit stores throughout Michigan with headquarters in Ann Arbor, said while there may be new fads in the running community, one time-tested approach that he advocates is using good form. In fact, Randy's store offers weekly runs that focus on the basics of technique to keep his patrons healthy and injury free. \"Good form is something that hasn't changed in the thirty years I've been running,\" Randy said. \"The latest thing is the barefoot running craze...Some people are touting the fact that shoes are causing injuries, but that is not entirely true...If a person is injured, don't blame the shoe \u2014 blame the form.\" For those looking for a written program to reinforce proper biomechanics, Randy's stores sell Danny Dreyer's books. Chi Running was originally published in 2004 and a revised edition came out in 2009. Its companion, Chi Walking , was published in 2006. Randy, who also has cultivated an online presence at www.runningfit.com with his \"Obsessed Runners Column,\" wrote four years ago that Danny's book is \"a must-read. I guarantee this book will drive you crazy and haunt you on every run.\" Today, he still maintains his position that \"there is absolutely nothing in the book that I don't think is good. I think it' s all great.\" Run Like a Child Again Sarah Young, one of three certified Chi Running instructors in Michigan out of a pool of 135 worldwide, travels across the state to teach people how to adopt this technique into their running and walking practices. Sarah, who is also a massage therapist and personal trainer who holds a master 's degree in exercise science, believes Chi Running and Chi Walking are growing because they teach people to move their body the way nature intended. According to Sarah, one of the big differences in Chi Running compared to other running methods is that it emphasizes holistic movement through the body's fascia, muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments. Most running styles rely solely on muscle and bone biomechanics. Sarah adds that using \"the old power running\" technique \u2014 where people push off with the legs, heel strike and toe off \u2014 does not coincide with how our bodies are designed to move. \"What I tell people is that Chi Running basically takes you back to how you ran as a kid,\" Sarah said. \"Adults usually have to unlearn bad habits and retrain the patterns in the body.\" While overcoming bad form can be hard, re-establishing proper patterns in the body can be learned through the following six areas, as summarized from Chi Running : good posture, forward lean, relaxed lower leg, pelvis locked, proper upper body form, and attentiveness to cadence. Those are the key conditions that Chi instructors pass on to their students to make running easier, help energy flow, and keep people injury free. \"Before getting involved in this, I thought that someone was trying to make a buck off Eastern thought...Then I went to a Chi Running and Chi Walking workshop and I was blown away! After that, I signed up for the instructor training \u2014 which really says something, because I wasn't a runner at the time. I was just that taken with it,\" Sarah said. \"Chi Running is growing and it offers a lot of substance. It really goes down to the core, to help people make a significant shift \u2014 if they are open to it.\" A Mindful Approach to Movement The founder of Chi Running, Danny Dreyer \u2014 who has a running career that spans 40 years, built in places like Boulder and San Francisco \u2014 is currently based in Asheville, North Carolina, where he and his wife, Katherine, run their parent company, Chi Living. According to Danny, Chi Living represents how to have a mindful approach to everything in life, which translates into a more joyful existence. Danny embarked on a more attentive approach to exercise in his 20s when he began training for ultra-marathons as a meditative practice (typically 30-, 50-, and 100-mile races). Shortly after, a friend introduced him to his first T'ai Chi Master, which forever altered his future, according to Danny. Danny said he best summarizes the practice of Chi Running and Chi Walking through two themes that are derived from T'ai Chi: alignment and relaxation. Alignment is the gathering to center for the defining sense of one's self, and relaxation is the expansiveness of letting go and opening up. \"Today, my mind's dream is to convert running from a sport to a practice... so that means that, every time you go out for a run, you are paying attention. So you always have this conversation between your mind and your body ,\" Danny said. \"So in an ultra [marathon], the idea is the same...If you take care of all of the pieces along the way, you'll last longer.\" While distance running may only appeal to a select few, walking is something that most people can begin with when trying the Chi approach. To get started, Danny encourages people to pay attention to simple things like how they feel when their foot hits the ground, if their hips are moving side to side, what their posture is like, and how their breathing feels. Just by doing those small things, in Danny's opinion, individuals gain a greater depth of experience that carries over into all aspects of their lives. Chi Running (and Chi Walking) Takes Off in Tree Town \"My dream is to convert running from a sport to a practice...so that means that, every time you go out for a run, you are paying attention. So you always have this conversation between your mind and your body.\" - Danny Dreyer, originator of Chi RunningThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 17 Chi Ties Run Deep in Ann Arbor One person who believes in Chi Walking is Judy Ramsey, a craniosacral therapist and co-owner of a therapeutic massage practice in Ann Arbor called Head To Toe Therapies. Judy \u2014 who also happens to be Danny's sister \u2014 believes the practice has kept her injury-free in her own physically demanding profession for the past 15 years, and recommends it to many of her patients. \"We try to help people become very aware of their bodies, because most injuries happen when people are not aware of their bodies and the pain levels,\" Judy said. \"Chi Running and Chi Walking help people to become more conscious of what every part of their body is saying to them.\" Judy, who goes Chi Walking frequently with her business partner, Rachel Egherman, said that the approach \"gets you further, faster, easier than anything we've ever tried.\" Judy also added that she takes pleasure in Chi Walking in a number of natural settings, as well as in Briarwood Mall early in the morning. \"I like to do the Chi Walking and feel the energy coming from my feet and just let it carry me,\" Judy said. \"You can be fairly noncompetitive with a walk, but be very mindful of everything around you and treat your senses to the experience.\" Another reason that Judy recommends her brother's books is because of the holistic lifestyle they promote. In Judy's opinion, the Chi books provide healthy tips to keep people's bodies more efficient and their minds more conscious. Back-Door Enlightenment Once the proper mechanics and the mind/body connection are in place, Danny believes people have established the right conditions for energy to flow, which may provide an opportunity for a spiritual experience. The self-described \"spiritual seeker\" said he also is a firm believer that having a spiritual experience \"must be grounded in the body\" and is \"not just an intellectual thing.\" \"In the 60s and 70s, all these gurus came over from India... They were trying to teach quiet to this crazy Western culture. They were grounded in being,\" Danny said. \"The Western world is established on movement so, I thought, why not combine the two?\" In terms of best experiencing spirituality, Danny echoes the Taoist principles of tuning into the five senses during his trail runs, in order to tune out his mind. He also added that the Christian Bible passage about the body being a temple resonates in him. \"The biggest lesson I've learned is to listen to your body. Your body is your biggest teacher,\" Danny said. \"Your body is your temple, where you go to learn about the invisible world... So if you listen to your body and treat it well, you're going to find out a lot of information that people read books and books and books to find out.\" Danny said that what has surprised him is that people pick up the book to learn to run better, and then they quickly realize it is not all about running. According to the vast majority of e-mails and testimonials sent to his website, the predominant theme from people who have read Chi Running is not about what they've learned from a running perspective, but rather how the book has changed their lives. \"It is hard to get across the fullness of this whole thing and the depth that it has...It's one of those things I call 'back-door enlightenment.' People start off running and then become interested in the spiritual. It is a process of discovery and that is the coolest thing for me. That's what I want it to be for others.\" ### Randy Step's Top Running SpotAs a passionate trail runner, Bird Hills Park is a gem, and right in town.From the parking area at the M-14 Barton Drive exit, hop over the AmtrackTracks, cut through a bit of woods and you land on Huron River Drive, turnright, west, about 100 yards and hit the Barton Trail on your right, takingyou over the Huron river and dumping you at the foot of Bird Hills Drivewhere it intersects Huron River Drive.

And yet, as the economy in Michigan has steadily declined over those years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. The following are profiles of two local business owners who have left their \u2014 more mainstream \u2014 jobs, not because they were forced out, but because it was time to pursue their dreams. They tell us how they've been faring in this economy, and you'll see that it took courage for each of them to make the leap. And perhaps you will be reminded, as I was, that there is still opportunity in this country that we should not discount. As one business owner said, \"There are still reasons why people want to come here, and those reasons are worth not getting apathetic about.\" I couldn't have said it better myself. Organic Bliss Melissa Bryant, owner After spending 15 years in the mortgage lending industry, Melissa Bryant was ready for a change. She liked the industry well enough, but didn't like the fact that it was \"just a job.\" \"I realized I didn't want to live with the idea that I lived for the weekend,\" Melissa says. She liked the job in general and the travel that went along with it, \"but it just wasn't fulfilling on a deeper level.\" Melissa had already begun making lifestyle changes by beginning a yoga practice and eating healthier foods. She and her husband, Jason, also began \"greening up\" their home by using cleaning products that were safer for the environment, and they became interested in sustainability . These changes, made over the course of five years, are really what drove Melissa to make a change in her career. With no experience in retail, Melissa still decided she wanted to establish a boutique that offered natural and organic body care, baby care, and lifestyle products. In June of 2008, she opened Organic Bliss in downtown Ann Arbor. Inside the boutique you will find \"a range of carefully selected organic products that will help you maintain a healthy, balanced, and eco-friendly lifestyle.\" Melissa's standards for inventory within the store are very high. \"I truly care about the products I bring into the store,\" she said. \"A lot of research goes into a product before it finds a home in the store. I really search for high-quality, pure products that promote a healthy body and mind, and preserve our environment through sustainable farming methods and eco-friendly packaging.\" Inside Organic Bliss, you'll find natural, pure organic items ranging from aromatherapy, body care, hair care, baby care, cosmetics, and fragrances to books, clothing, accessories, and yoga supplies. You don't have to research the quality or purity of anything you might want to purchase, because that work has already been done for you. Melissa's goal is to provide products which are safe for the consumer. Also, she makes sure that ingredients that go into the products she sells are grown with sustainable farming methods in mind and that the packaging is as eco-friendly as possible, in order to save our resources and preserve the planet. Melissa admits that retail is a risky venture in any economy , because you're never really sure what people will buy. This is especially true for the local, independent retailer. She has had to make changes to her business plan because of things she's learned along the way. The good part about that is that the business is growing, slowly but steadily, and she has built a really good customer base. \"I never realized that [organic] skin care, cosmetic care, and baby care products would be as popular as they are, when I first started out.\" Melissa said. \"And I didn't know they were particularly popular as gifts, as I've found them to be.\" Organic Bliss is a direct reflection of the lifestyle changes Melissa and her husband began making several years ago. Has she found the fulfillment that her previous career lacked? \"Y es,\" Melissa said. \"Still, it's been a huge lifestyle adjustment, because it's a 24/7 thing. Even when I'm out of the store, I'm always thinking about it. But, I can definitely say I'm no longer searching.\" Organic Bliss, 117 E. Liberty St., Ann email: info@organicblissproducts.com; website: www.organicblissproducts.com Leaps of Faith: Tales of Newer Local Businesses Melissa Bryant's standards for the inventory at Organic Bliss are very high. \"I truly care about the products I bring into the store. A lot of research goes into a product before it finds a home in the store.\"Melissa Bryant of Organic Blissbeezy's coffee & caf\u00e9: simple, honest food Bee Mayhew, owner Bee Mayhew opened her restaurant in November of 2008 with the idea of providing her guests with simple, honest food. \"My vision really was to find that space between the idea that everything must be purchased locally , and the ability to provide good food made from pronounceable ingredients in a budget range that almost anyone can afford. The state of the economy when I opened was as bad as it was going to get, so to be able to provide a plate that included free-range chicken and eggs, while spending a little less on my deli meat in order to provide good food in a price range of five to ten dollars a plate, was quite a feat.\" Even in finding that space, Bee still does her best to buy locally by using produce vendors like Frog Holler and by using the Ypsilanti Food Co- Op. Even when she has to use her \"big box\" supplier, she uses Gordon Food Service, because it is a Michigan-based business. \"I feel that people need to use their voices with these bigger suppliers that already have the food lines established, to make them better. Ask them to better advertise their Michigan-grown and -produced items, so that you can purchase them. Everything I do here is about balancing resources so that it all works. Compromising commitment doesn't always have to be a negative thing.\" The tight quarters and open kitchen of beezy' s creates an atmosphere that invites everyone to become involved with what's going on. It's a little more laid-back, a little goofy, and a little less pretentious than the usual dining experience. This makes it easy for a visitor to feel comfortable enough to comment on the experience. \"And that involvement, I think, is essential to my business,\" Bee said. So I asked her what she means by \"simple, honest food.\" \"It's food you could make at home but don't have to,\" Bee answered. \"It's food like your mom or your grandma used to make. It's things made from scratch and things made with sass.\" Bee has traveled widely throughout the country and has been in both Mexico and Canada. Actually, she was born in Canada. She and her siblings were raised on their mother's bartending salary and moved frequently, to go where the money took them. By the time she was 12 years old, she was unofficially helping out in the restaurants where her mother tended bar . At 16, she got her first job, at a restaurant in Petoskey, and worked there in fits and starts for nearly 10 years, learning all the positions and eventually becoming the general manager. She came to Ann Arbor to work with Zingerman's before opening her own restaurant. With that background, Bee should have run as far from the food industry as possible, but as she says, \"food service and the service industry in general is a noble profession, and I just feel that this is where I'm supposed to be.\" So, for the first time in her life, Bee is putting down some roots in Y psilanti. And it is that \u2014 putting down roots \u2014 which she considers her \"deepest act of rebellion.\" She's become more of a homebody, which allows her to \"create my own idea of what I want my family to be.\" And, of course, beezy's has become a natural part of her family. beezy's coffee & caf\u00e9: simple, honest food, 20 email: beezy@beezyscafe.com; website: www.beezyscafe.com ###The Crazy Wisdom Journal May - August 2011 Page 21 Bee Mayhew of beezy's coffee & caf\u00e9 So I asked Bee Mayhew of beezy's coffee & caf\u00e9 what she means by 'simple, honest food.'

Proponents of eating local argue how local food systems spur economic development and increase people's access to fresh, healthy food in the 21st Century. Research institutions, food market experts, and national media in the U.S. have been reporting that demand for locally sourced produce, diary products, and meats is on the rise. On a cold and blustery day this March, stakeholders in Washtenaw County's local food system convened at the 3rd annual HomeGrown Local Food Summit. Farmers, food business owners, chefs, non-profits, community organizers, educators, and public policy experts met at the day-long conference to reflect on the local food community's successes and struggles over the past year and share ideas for the future. I took the opportunity to learn more about locally sourced food from local foodies before, during, and after the summit. There are good signs that Washtenaw County has a maturing local food movement. In many ways, the county is riding the cusp of contemporary food initiatives with zeal. The county also faces all sorts of stumbling blocks to progress - sometimes quite monumental ones. Many of the people I spoke with made a point to let me know that local food and demand for it have \"always been here\" in Washtenaw County. But they agree that the local food movement has really accelerated in the last decade, even more so in the last few years. Defining 'Local Food' You have to decide for yourself how far away 'local' food can grow before you no longer consider it to be 'local.' There is no standard definition, although Congress's 2008 Food, Conservation and Energy Act (also known as the Farm Bill) says anything less than 400 miles away or within the state constitutes 'locally or regionally produced agricultural food products.' People in Washtenaw County accept different definitions, frequently preferring much shorter distances than that. This article mostly focuses on farms, businesses, and initiatives happening within the boundaries of Washtenaw County. However, the county's extended 'local food' network only multiplies as you move outward to surrounding communities. With that, the diversity of food products to choose from multiplies. You can already find a lot of what you like to eat grown and raised right here in the county . However, a greater network of growers, processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers exists around us, as well. The local food system in Washtenaw County Washtenaw County residents can eat food sourced from within the county in a number of different ways, whether you buy directly from farmers, choose local products at the grocery store, or dine at restaurants that support local farms. There are now 17 farmers' markets spread throughout the county where farmers sell directly to customers. There are also easily a dozen Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) projects in the county that sell shares of their yield directly to members. (For more information on many of the individual CSAs, read our cover story on CSAs in the May thru August 2009 issue of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal on our website archive at: http://www.crazywisdom.net/PDF/CSA.pdf) Locally sourced products are also sold on the shelves of some of the grocery stores in town and a number of local chefs use locally sourced ingredients in their menus. A food system includes more than producers and consumers. It also encompasses things like food processing businesses and distribution companies. A thriving local food system creates room for new niche market businesses to grow. The good news is that more food related businesses have been popping up in town over the last few years. There is also a push to get more locally sourced food into institutions like schools, hospitals, and restaurants, as well as to encourage municipalities to adopt 'buy local' practices. The bad news - which might astound you - is that only a tiny fraction of the food that Washtenaw County residents eat is sourced from within the county. County residents only spend about 1% of the $1 billion we spend on food each year on food produced in the county. The rest of our money leaves the local economy. The same goes for food produced here - the vast majority of both our food and money leaves the county. Jeff McCabe hosts SELMA Cafe with his wife Lisa Gottlieb each week, and he is deeply involved with new farmer development in Washtenaw County and hoop house builds. McCabe proposes we try spending 10% of our food budget on food from the county. \"At last year's summit, we introduced this idea of 'Ten Percent Washtenaw' looking specifically at what can happen within our own community here if we build a local food system. Just getting to where we source 10% of the $1 billion a year we eat in this county would be creating a $100 million food system. It would mean thousands of new jobs. You can look at it from almost any perspective that's important to you, whether it's food access, food security, jobs, economics, health outcomes, energy - all of those things are benefited when we build this local food system,\" he says. Farms sourcing the county Several area farms were identified as local food \"mentors\" during a summit presentation by Kim Bayer , the president of Slow Food Huron Valley, and Dan Bair, the manager of the Farm at St. Joe's hospital. Community Farm of Ann Arbor, located in Chelsea, is one of the oldest CSAs in the country, founded in 1988. Chelsea's Tantr\u00e9 Farm, owned by Deb Lentz and Richard Andres, is the biggest CSA with about 400 members. The King family at Frog Holler Organic Farm , located in nearby Brooklyn, MI, has been growing organic food for nearly 40 years. Michigan is one of the most diverse farming landscapes in the county . However some foods are harder to find than others and the growing season is limited by our cold winters. For example, it is harder to find fresh local produce when it is not in season. A number of farms in Washtenaw County are using hoop houses to extend the growing season. Hoop houses are inexpensive greenhouses made by wrapping a plastic roof over flexible piping. Funds from McCabe and Gottlieb' s community breakfasts have already helped build hoop houses on area farms, like Tomm and Trilby Becker's relatively new CSA Sunseed Farm, and others. The couple started a \"Farmer Fund\" to fund more hoop house projects. The plan is to build 20 hoop houses in 20 days this summer. Numerous people at the summit said they would like to see more meat and dairy producers in the area; however, there are already some of note in our county. Back Forty Acres farm, in Chelsea, for example, raises a variety of pasture-raised poultry and grass-fed livestock, including chicken, turkey, lamb, goat, rabbit, pork, duck, geese, and free-range brown chicken eggs, according to the farm's product list. Incubating young chickens: The new Tilian Farm Development Center Farmland in Ann Arbor Township, off Pontiac Trail, will be the site of a farm incubator. The idea behind the Tilian Farm Development Center is to provide new farmers with land, equipment, and support for two years. The project is possible because of the formation of the 4-Seasons Farmer Development Program funded by a U.S.D.A. grant. Members of the steering committee discussed the program at an afternoon \"breakout\" session at the summit. Jeff McCabe is involved in the project, along with MSU Student Organic Farm's Jeremy Moghtader, Food System Economic Partnership (FSEP) director Jennifer Fike, and 4-Season Farm Development Program manager, Andrea Ridgard. Local Food Report: An Update on Washtenaw County's Local Food Movement In many ways, the county is riding the cusp of contemporary food initiatives with zeal. The county also faces all sorts of stumbling blocks to progress - sometimes quite monumental ones.Jennifer Fike The new Tilian Farm Development CenterThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 23 \"The goal from our perspective is that these folks are successful and that in two years they can move their business within our community to somewhere that is long term and sustainable for them,\" Ridgard announced. While the farmers are on the land, they hope to supply them with all of the equipment, mentorship, and knowledge they need to succeed after its time to let the next set of farmers get their start on the land. Niche businesses in processing, distribution, and marketing In the last few years, a number of new, independently owned niche businesses have sprung up around local food. A few years ago, local food distribution company Eat Local Eat Natural started gathering meat, dairy and eggs from nearby farms in their refrigerated trucks to distribute to local restaurants and other food retailers. Dawn Thompson and Jane Pacheco started a new online business, Lunasa, which sells local goods and food for pick-up twice a month. Ed Weymouth is biking local food to people and businesses in Ann Arbor through his unique new delivery business, Arbor Cycle. And Karl and Cara Rosaen have launched their nationwide website, Real Time Farms, which gives visitors up to date information about what local farms are growing, what restaurants are serving on their menus, and ways to find local food artisans and farmers' markets in your area. Filling a niche by fermenting: The Brinery The Brinery , a new fermented foods processing business, was \"birthed out of a surplus of cabbage from Tantr\u00e9 Farm last year,\" says owner and Ann Arbor-raised briner David Klingenberger . He sells sauerkraut, pickles, and kimchi through the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market and local independent grocers, and a number of downtown Ann Arbor restaurants serve his products. \"I cut my teeth at Tantr\u00e9 Farm,\" Klingenberger recalls. He helped them start their CSA and farmers' market business back in 2001, working and living at the farm on and off over the years. \"I first fermented sauerkraut there about ten years ago and just sold it to people through the farm. Then, last year, I came back to Michigan after being out West. They had a surplus of cabbage and I was ready to start my own foods entrepreneurial business,\" he explains. The new entrepreneur is \"impressed by the number of new food related niches that have been created around local food in the last few years.\" However , \"I noticed that there wasn't a fermented foods business in the community I had gotten to know through working at Tantr\u00e9 Farms and [by] making other connections over the years. I thought, this is a niche that's not being exploited and I wanted to fill it as soon as possible,\" he explains. Klingenberger buys surplus vegetables from local area and Michigan farms to produce his products. However, he would love to establish bigger contracts with farms instead of only buying their surplus. \"A lot of small farmers want to grow for a This year Americans will spend 49% of their food budget dining in at restaurants, ordering delivery, driving through fast food establish- ments, and eating meals prepared by other types of food vendors.David Klingenberger Continued on page 24 St. Joe's first hoop house Nine Mile @ Woodward Ferndale, MI July 15-17 Come explore the second annual Live Green Fair in Downtown Ferndale. 150 organizations showcase the best in green living.

Institutions Washtenaw County's food movement has been a strong advocate for getting more locally sourced food into institutions like schools and hospitals that serve a lot of food to people. For example, community gardening non-profit Growing Hope is getting grade schoolers involved in food growing through school day, after school, and summer programs, under the direction of Amanda Edmonds . St. Joseph Mercy Hospital has a new farm on the property that grows food year-round, the Farm at St. Joe's, which is managed by Dan Bair. Economic development non-profit the Food System Economic Partnership (FSEP) has been developing \"Farm to Institution\" programs, which executive director Jennifer Fike says aim at helping schools, restaurants, and hospitals with sourcing food from area farms. \"W e've been successful in that we have 'Farm to School' programs in three of the five counties that we serve and we are looking to expand that further,\" she announced at the summit. Fike says the demand for locally sourced food is already there. \"When we work with these institutional buyers we find that the supply is not keeping up with the demand. These institutions want to buy local food year-round, but there isn't enough of it out there yet to be able to serve them,\" she says. For information about the Ecology Center's effort to bring local, healthy food to hospitals, see our interview with Hillary Bisnett in our last issue, at: http://cwonline. squarespace.com/storage/journal-issue-47/ecology%20center%20web%2047.pdf The case of restaurants This year, Americans will spend 49% of their food budget dining in at restaurants, ordering delivery, driving through fast food establishments, and eating meals prepared by other types of food vendors, according to the National Restaurant Association. This is potentially good news for local farmers and independent food businesses across the country, especially since chefs purchasing locally sourced meat and produce are the top two 'hottest trends' in the restaurant industry right now (according to their nationwide survey of chefs who contributed to their 2011 Restaurant Industry Forecast). The Jolly Pumpkin's food philosophy has been locally-minded from the start (it was founded in 2009), according to the restaurant's head chef Maggie Long. Long has been in town for 26 years In late May, Perseus Books is publishing Oran Hesterman's Fair Food: Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food System for All. Hesterman lives and work in Ann Arbor, and is the president and CEO of the Fair Food Network. \"What I really like about this program is that it's not about spending more money, it's about shifting who you are spending it with.\" - Ingrid Ault, Director of Think Local First of Washtenawand says local food is much more than a 'trend' in Washtenaw County. \"We live in a community that has always been extremely supportive. The Farmers' Market has always been here and the farms have always been here, even though some come and some go,\" she says. However, \"it certainly seems like people are becoming more aware of what is going into their food these days. People ask about our menu on a daily basis,\" she notices. During the growing season, the percentage of locally sourced food on their menu is upwards of 90%, Long reports. The chef prefers to buy directly from farms rather than using a distributor - although she doesn't mind having independently owned local food businesses, like distributor Eat Local Eat Natural, and online local food market, Lunasa, around when she needs help getting the ingredients she wants. \"Personally, I like face time. I go directly to the farmers, talk to them and convey their back stories to my staff,\" she explains. A slightly more expensive meal is worth it to the Jolly Pumpkin's customers, according to Long. \"I have to charge a little more for it, but it's a far better product. People walking in the door get it. They know that what they are putting into their bodies is a good thing,\" she says. In Long's experience, \"Dealing with farms nearby really cuts down on costs. You don't have the shipping costs because it's not coming from across the country. A lot of the financial benefit is in the back end, which you don't always see,\" she says. Ann Arbor Brewing Company first hired chef Nicole Young a few years ago to spearhead an effort to buy more locally sourced food. About a year ago, the WCC culinary arts graduate became head chef of their downtown Ann Arbor restaurant. \"Instead of buying everything from big distributors, we are now buying the majority of our products from a network of local growers - especially in season,\" she says. Although planning a more local-friendly menu \"takes some adjusting,\" Young thinks it is well worth it. \"It's an adjustment to not be able to always get the product you are looking for in the quantity you want on a moment's notice. For example, you can order a case of 12 oz. sirloin steaks from a big distributor really easily. But you can also buy larger cuts of local meat and break them down or even buy a whole cow,\" she explains. \"I'd love to see more local cheese producers in the area, and fresh local produce can be hard to find during the winter (although we are hoping to make connection with some hoop houses),\" she says. \"To some extent, these things influence what we put on our menu, but once you make that adjustment, it's better. The quality of the ingredients you get is worth it,\" Young concludes. Think Washtenaw First Think Local First of Washtenaw director Ingrid Ault sees \"natural connections between buy local movements and local food movements,\" she says. About 30 of its members are food related businesses. There is also a natural connection between the HomeGrown Local Food Summit's call for a \"Ten Percent Washtenaw\" campaign and projects that Think Local First is currently working on. Ault says one of their big pushes in the next couple of years will be to encourage a \"ten percent shift\" in municipal spending in Washtenaw County. Think Local First's final goal is to support the passage of a purchasing resolution stating that 10% of Washtenaw County's municipal purchases be spent in the local economy. \"I hope that Think Local First can be a champion for this government spending initiative,\" she says. \"What I really like about this program is that it's not about spending more money, it's about shifting who you are spending it with,\" she says. \"I think it's a myth that buying local has to cost more,\" she explains. Part of the push will include encouraging the municipality to source 10% of its own food budget on local food. \"Dealing with farms nearby really cuts down on costs. You don't have the shipping costs because it's not coming from across the country. A lot of the financial benefit is in the back end, which you don't always see.\" - Maggie Long, Jolly PumpkinLocal Food Report The good news is that more food related businesses have been popping up in town over the last few years. There is also a push to get more local- ly sourced food into institutions like schools, hospitals, and restaurants, as well as to encourage municipalities to adopt 'buy local' practices.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 24 Continued from page 23Weblinks for Resources Mentioned in the Local Food Report HomeGrown Local Food Summit http://localfoodsummit.org/http://localfoodsummit2009.blogspot.com/Selma Caf\u00e9 - Jeff McCabe and Lisa Gottlieb http://www.repastspresentandfuture.org/Slow Food Huron Valley - Kim Bayer, presidenthttp://www.slowfoodhuronvalley.com/Farm at St. Joe's - Dan Bair, farm managerhttp://www.sjmercyhealth.org/the-farm-at-st-joesCommunity Farm of Ann Arbor - CSA farm in Chelseahttp://www.communityfarmofaa.org/Tantr\u00e9 Farm - Deb Lentz and Richard Andreshttp://tantrefarm.com/Frog Holler Organic Farm - the King family http://www.froghollerorganic.com/Back Forty Acres Farm - Larry and Kevin Doll http://www.backfortyacres.com/Sunseed Farm - Tomm and Tribly Beckerhttp://www.farmsunseed.com/Tilian Farm Development Center - Jeff McCabe, Jeremy Moghtader, Jennifer Fike, Andrea Ridgardhttp://www.realtimefarms.com/farm/4757056/tilian-farm-development-centerEat Local Eat Natural - Bill Taylor, Tim Redmond, Scott Aikenshttp://www.eatlocaleatnatural.com/Lunasa - Dawn Thompson and Jane Pachecohttp://www.lunasa.us/Arborcycle - Ed Weymouth http://www.arborcycle.com/Real Time Farms - Karl and Cara Rosaen http://www .realtimefarms.com/ The Brinery - David Klingenbergerhttp://thebrinery.com/Growing Hope - http://www.growinghope.net/Food System Economic Partnership (FSEP) - Jennifer Fike http://www.fsepmichigan.org/Jolly Pumpkin - Maggie Long http://www.jollypumpkin.com/annarbor/Ann Arbor Brewing Company - Nicole Young, executive chefhttp://www.arborbrewing.com/Think Local First Washtenaw - Ingrid Ault http://www.thinklocalfirst.net/Double Up Food Bucks - Rachel Chadderdon http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/Michigan Good Food Charterhttp://www.michiganfood.org/Fair Food Network - Oran Hesterman http://www.fairfoodnetwork.orgHomeGrown Festival, September 10, 2011http://www.homegrownfestival.org/Conclusion There is much more that goes into the local food movement than can fit into this article, including public assistance programs like \" Double Up Food Bucks\" at farmers' markets. People eligible for a SNAP Bridge Card (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) can use their Bridge Card at farmers' markets. For each dollar they spend, they receive one \"Double Up Food Buck\" token that they can use to purchase more Michigan-grown fruits and vegetables at farmers' markets. There are also public policy initiatives happening that impact the local food movement. The Michigan Good Food Charter is a good place to continue learning about issues related to local food systems on your own. It's also worth noting the upcoming publication of Ann Arborite Oran Hesterman's new book, Fair Food ~ Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food System for All. The book will be available at Crazy Wisdom at the end of May. Hesterman is the founder of the Fair Food Network, and has been a leading force in the sustainable food revolution over the last quarter century. See our interview with Hesterman in the Fall 2010 issue of the CW Journal at: http://cwonline.squarespace.com/storage/journal-issue-46/hesterman.pdf . Events like the HomeGrown Local Food Summit and the festival they throw in the fall are excellent opportunities to immerse yourself in the world of local food and to meet Washtenaw County's food community. Summit time won't roll back around again until March 2012, but save the date for the next HomeGrown Festival, which will be held September 10, 2011, in Ann Arbor. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 25 a2yoga.net froghollerorganic.com Also at Downtown Home & Garden Available mid-April - June The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 26 Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky Photography by Rachael Waring Jim Neuenschwander was first interviewed by the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal more than twelve years ago, when he was 38. He was the first of Ann Arbor's second generation of integrative medicine doctors to set up shop. (The first generation basically consisted of Lev Linkner, Dennis Chernin and Patricia Kelly.) He was then a handsome young doctor --- idealistic, committed and passionate about the practice of alternative medicine. Now, 50, he is still handsome, still engaging, still committed and passionate. His idealism, though, has been tempered by his years of dealing with the medical system, and his years of working with the complexities of his patient's medical challenges. Nonetheless, he remains constructive and forward-thinking in his approach to patient care, and in his belief in an integrative approach to medical issues. Jim was raised in Dearborn. He received his BS in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Michigan in 1981, and his MD from the U of M in 1985. He is the founder and Medical Director of the Bio Energy Medical Center on Professional Drive, near the Whole Foods Market on Washtenaw Avenue. (http://www.bioenergymedicalcenter.com/) He lives with his wife of 12 years, Tricia Neuenschwander, who also works as the Office Manager for Bio Energy. He has three grown children by his first marriage, and Tricia also has three grown children. They live in White Lake Township on Oxbow Lake, about an hour from Ann Arbor. Jim is a lively and forthright conversationalist. He has a good sense of humor and a fine ironic bent, both of which may have held him in good stead as he navigates the absurdities, frustrations and sadnesses of our health care maze. Bill Zirinsky: Jim, it's been 12 years since we last interviewed you. At the time, you were a young physician with a determination to provide an integrative medical care approach for people in the Ann Arbor region. At the time, only a few other allopathically trained physicians were doing this, in town. Now, you're 50, a new grandfather, and there are quite a number of integrative group practices around town. Let's start with some questions about the evolution of your integrative medicine practice. Are you glad that you're an integrative physician? Do you sometimes wish you could just have a standard old medical practice, using all the regular diagnostic tools and methods? It would be easier, no? Dr. James Neuenschwander: Every day I pull my hair out considering the way medicine is practiced. We actually know the cause of many illnesses; and yet, we persist in treating only symptoms. We are taught half-truths that are repeated often enough that everyone believes them. A perfect example is the treatment of heart disease. In the 1980's, it was determined that heart disease was definitely caused by free radical damage brought about by inflammation. We have known this for 30 years. And yet, which medication did your cardiologist put you on to reduce inflammation? None (with the exception of aspirin, which he put you on for blood thinning and not inflammation). A wise man once said that no disease is the result of a medication deficiency. Heart disease is not caused by a Lipitor deficiency. Despite all of this knowledge, most people (including doctors) are still stuck in the false model that cholesterol causes heart disease. If this model were true, we would be curing heart disease right and left. Certain models in medicine are true \u2014 bacterial infections cause most ulcers. How do I know this? Because if I put a person who has an ulcer on one month of antibiotics, I usually cure them of the ulcer. If cholesterol caused heart disease, all I would have to do is put someone on a statin drug and their heart disease would be cured. It is thought that 80% of what we do in traditional medicine simply does not work. I would put that number at 99.9%. How many therapies (outside of antibiotics) are curative? Not many. How many parents are told that their children's autism is incurable, because they have no drugs to treat it? And yet, we are able to significantly help over 50% of the kids we see by using nutritional and off label approaches. The true tragedy in all this for me is that The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Dr. James Neuenschwander of Bio Energy Medical Center The Rewards and Challenges of Practicing Integrative Medicine in the Age of Obamacare \"My heroes have always been people that looked at a problem that many others had already examined, and were able to find simple answers because they thought outside the box.\" \"Every day I pull my hair out considering the way medicine is practiced. We actually know the cause of many illnesses; and yet, we persist in treating only symptoms. We are taught half-truths that are repeated often enough that everyone believes them.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 27 I have seen and learned too much. I know there is a better way for much of what we do in medicine, and I see the damage that is done because most of my profession opts for the traditional way. Would it be easier to go the traditional route? I would need to take an amnestic and forget everything I have learned and seen in the past 20 years. And yes, there are days that amnesia sounds good; but then again, I also have days that I would long to be the greeter at Meijer. Bill Zirinsky: Are you as \"alternative\" as you used to be, however you would define that? Dr. James Neuenschwander: Interesting question. I am certainly more integrative than I used to be. I have learned that to get at the root of health requires nothing but alternative approaches. Detox, exercise, meditation, and good nutrition are what you need for this. However, to get past some people's genetics or toxicities can require the use of medications. Frequently these are being used off label (for something other than their original use, i.e. we frequently use seizure medications to treat behavioral disorders). The paradox is that those of us that are integrative frequently have a far deeper understanding of the medications than many of our allopathic colleagues, who tend to prescribe based on the last position paper published by their respective specialty colleges . I have lost much of my fear of using medications where appropriate, but I certainly have not lost my belief in the use of alternative therapies to truly get to the root of health. BZ: Do you find it rewarding to see the slow but steady growth in integrative medicine, and the number of younger people who are on your integrative/complementary path? Dr. James Neuenschwander: Yes, I do. All we need is about 100,000 more of them, and we should be all set. I think the problem is that we are not taught to think independently in medical school. You have to have a good brain to get through medical school; and yet when you do, you are told not to think but to follow protocol. Most of the way medicine is practiced no longer requires a physician \u2014 only a computer with the appropriate decision tree. If you go to an emergency room with chest pain, most of the orders are pre-written and frequently started before the doctor even evaluates you. Much of medicine is like this. What we need are medical schools that teach doctors to think, to question, to seek out information beyond what the next blockbuster drug company is trying to disseminate, and to find the source of their patient's illness and then treat with the best modality for that patient, rather than what the protocol dictates. BZ: Do you have more competition for patients than you used to, or less...or is that something doctors steer away from talking about? Dr. James Neuenschwander: I suppose there is more competition, but there is also more need. I have been around long enough that I don't really have to worry about this. We offer a fairly unique product, and when that becomes so common that I don't have enough patients to keep me busy, then it is time for me to retire; I have accomplished what I dreamed of and changed the way we practice medicine. But, I am not holding my breath (or purchasing my retirement villa). BZ: You used to use a Voll machine. What does that do? Do you still believe in it, and have time and evidence shown it to be legitimate and useful? Dr. James Neuenschwander: We still use a Voll machine. It measures the resistance of skin to the flow of a small, electrical current at specific reflex points. These points correspond to various internal organs; so, the Voll allows us to get an energetic map of what is going on in the body. This type of testing is the most sensitive testing you can find. It is, in essence, measuring the body's subtle energy fields. This is where imbalances/disease starts. I have an outstanding Voll operator in my homeopathic physician, Uma Desai. Dr. Uma has become very skilled in the use of our Voll machine. We updated our machine last year so that it is state of the art. I am always impressed. When Dr. Uma comes to me concerned that she picked up a heart or other condition on the Voll, it is almost always confirmed when I do medical testing. I use the Voll for a number of things. First, it is a good way to determine a person's sensitivity profile. Patients will often have sensitivities to environmental chemicals or even the medications/supplements they take. The Voll is a good way to test for these. Secondly, I use the Voll when I get \"stuck.\" When I am not finding answers with my standard testing, the Voll frequently will show the way. The third place I use the Voll is simply to get a snap shot of a person's health. They may look healthy but are really in need of care. BZ: You were a strong believer in homeopathic medicine, even though you were trained as an allopath at U-M Medical School. Are you still? And what is it best suited for, in your opinion? Dr. James Neuenschwander: Homeopathy is interesting stuff. We are administering minute quantities of a substance to treat the very symptom that substance would cause in a full dose. Have a fever? Take a homeopathic dose of a substance that causes a fever. They seem like nothing, but I have seen them do incredible things. I think homeopathics work well on children. Jim and Tricia Neuenschwander \"The Internet has been a godsend. The more information that is out there, the more people will expect in their own health.\" The Neuenschwanders at their office on Professional Drive in Ann Arbor Continued on page 28They work well as subtle detoxifiers. They work well to change long-term (constitutional) health patterns. And, they are the primary mode of treatment for many people that have lived long and healthy lives. BZ: I see that you continue to have an acupuncturist on staff, as you have, for many years. When do you bring the acupuncturist in to your medical cases? How does that work? Dr. Neu: Acupuncture is its own system of medicine. Traditionally it was used to keep a person healthy. In traditional culture, you paid the acupuncturist to keep you healthy. When you got ill, it was considered a failure of your treatment, and you stopped paying: the exact opposite of our current system, which rewards only the treatment of illness rather than the maintenance of health. Acupuncture seems to work best in certain conditions. First, it is outstanding in the treatment of pain. This is what most people think of when they envision acupuncture. I got interested in acupuncture after suffering from severe sciatica for three months. One treatment cured me. I got on the table in pain and got off that table out of pain. That was 18 years ago, and it has never returned. It helps with all types of pain: back pain, migraines and other headaches, abdominal pain, joint pain, muscle pain, and pain from acute injury , to name a few. Acupuncture is also one of the few ways to access the nervous system, especially the central nervous system. This makes it helpful in treating neuropathies or neuropathic (nerve mediated) pain such as those caused by diabetes or the shingles. It can also help with ringing of the ears and vertigo. Acupuncture has benefit with abdominal conditions such as constipation, pain, IBS, and pelvic pain. It has been shown to improve outcomes in fertility treatments, including doubling the success rate of IVF, improving hormonal balance in men and women, improving ovulation, increasing sperm counts, and others. The list is long. Basically, I tell my patients to try it for about 5 treatments. If they respond, they have a tool they can use for their health. If not, then acupuncture is not for them. BZ: And colonics. They \"still don't get no respect,\" as Rodney Dangerfield used to say, in the wider medical community. Tell us why you believe in their value? And has it been frustrating to you to see myths and fish tales persist, with respect to its safety, its usefulness, its value? Dr. Neu: For some reason, no one wants to talk about poop. Our digestive tract lies at the core of our health. It is, obviously, the place from which we get our nutrition; but recent research has shown that it is also what controls our immune system. We all know what stool looks and smells like. Given the choice, would you rather have that stuff inside you or outside of you? I choose the latter. We were all taught that whatever your normal stool frequency is, that is normal bowel function. Normal, maybe. Healthy? No way. This is another of those mass myths that are perpetuated by simply repeating them enough times to enough people. Healthy bowel function is having a bowel movement after every meal. That means at least three times a day for most of us. It should take less than a minute, should be 18-24 inches long, and should float. If you don't have that kind of function, consider colonics. Even if you do, consider colonics anyway . We live in a toxic world and eat toxic, radiated food. We no longer feed our digestive tract the natural bacteria or fiber it needs to stay healthy . Given that much of our chronic health conditions are related to toxicity, this is cheap insurance. BZ: You mentioned to me that you treat more children than you used to. How did that come about, and what are kinds of problems and issues are you specializing in, in treating children? Dr. Neu: My wife, Tricia, had a colleague who had an autistic son. She had heard that the child was essentially cured of autism using an alternative approach. When she investigated that approach, she discovered that it was all the same stuff I was doing with adults. She approached me to get educated on treating kids. I was already busy enough with my patients, but Tricia convinced me otherwise. We treat children with all types of childhood disorders \u2014 whether it be asthma, allergies, autism, ADHD, speech delay, sensory processing disorders, digestive issues, reflux, autoimmune issues, or any number of other issues; our approach works on many of these issues. Children are wonderful, because they are healing machines. The progress it might take an adult a year to make, will take a child a month. It is very rewarding to see children that have behavioral issues, are unable to talk, or are on five medications for their asthma get better by removing the things that are making them worse and adding in the nutrients their bodies need. There is nothing more touching that to have a child that could not speak and whose parents were told that there was nothing that could be done, say \"thank you\" and \"please\" and \"I love you, Mom\" instead of hitting themselves in frustration because they can't speak. These childhood disorders have become an epidemic. Autism is up from one in 10,000, when I was a medical student, to one in 90 eight-year-olds; and, perhaps as many as one in 70 three-year-olds. Asthma, allergy, and autoimmune rates have followed that trend (not quite as impressively). In another 10 years, it will be abnormal to have a neurotypical kid that is not allergic and can breathe. BZ: You are a very strong believer in good nutrition and nutritional information. How does that relate to caring for sick kids, kids with autism, childhood diseases? Dr. Neu: We all have genetic glitches that affect our individual ability to tolerate environmental insults (hey environment, your mother wears army boots \u2014 sorry, I am getting a bit punchy). If the environment does not stress that system, we don't get symptoms. So we know, for example, that many kids with autism or asthma have issues with their detoxification system. Autistic kids tend to be low in glutathione and lack methylated B vitamins. These two processes mean that they are going to be more susceptible to things in the environment that require glutathione or methyl B12 to detoxify . We also know that methylated B vitamins play a role in our behavior (just ask my office staff before and after I give myself a methyl B12 shot). I think the issue is that our environment has become more toxic in these areas. We know a subset of autistic kids have extremely high levels of antibodies to certain vaccinations while they might not make any antibodies to other vaccinations. Obviously, if you don't get vaccinated, this is not going to cause a problem. Similarly, if you aren't getting dioxins from the environment, you don't need the glutathione levels in the liver that you do in our environment. Our job as practitioners is to identify those issues and provide the nutrients to correct it. We also have to identify those environmental toxins and remove them. Sounds simple, but it is an ongoing adventure to accomplish those two things. It is amazing what nutrition alone can accomplish. The perfect example of this was an experiment done with some white mice. In the research world, you can get mice that are so inbred that they are essentially identical twins of one another. So there is one such strain of mice called Agouti mice. An Agouti mouse is always white, fat, gets diabetes, and dies young of heart disease. They are studied to see what can be done to prevent these illnesses. When fat, white Agouti mice have babies, they are also fat and white and develop diabetes and heart disease. That is their genetic makeup. So, one brilliant researcher decided to see what would happen if the mother Agouti mouse was treated with good nutrients while she was pregnant. She gave the mice basic nutrients \u2014 omega 3 fatty acids, methylated B compounds, antioxidants vitamins and the like. When these mice gave birth, they had skinny , grey babies. It would be like two morbidly obese white people giving birth to a skinny, Asian baby. That is the power of nutrition. Those nutrients completely altered the expression of those mice's genes. BZ: Can you give us some examples of the interplay of nutrition and autoimmune disorders, allergies, fatigue syndromes, detoxification? Dr. Neu: Autoimmune disorders, fatigue syndromes, and allergies are basically caused by the same thing: the immune system has forgotten who to go after and who to ignore. We call this ability immunotolerance. Early on, our immune system is supposed to identify what is \"self,\" so that it can go after anything that is \"non-self\" like a bacteria or virus. When we lose that immunotolerance, we started reacting to ourselves and we call it an autoimmune disorder. When we lose tolerance to environmental factors such as pollens or food, we call it an allergy. When we lose tolerance to the childhood viruses we all get and never get rid of (chicken pox, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr , etc.), we develop a fatigue syndrome. In all these issues, the immune system is spinning its wheel reacting to things it shouldn't. Recent research has determined that the immune system is controlled by the digestive tract and something called intestinal permeability . When we eat food, we are supposed to break down our proteins into tiny bits. When these bits are absorbed, they are too small for the immune system to recognize, and they do not cause a reaction. If those protein pieces are too big, they are not absorbed because the gaps between the cells in the intestine are too tight \"The difference between this type of testing [ELISA and MELISA] and the standard blood work we are used to is like the difference between a skull x-ray and an MRI scan: it provides far greater information and detail about a person's systems.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 28 Interview with Dr. James Neuenschwander Continued from page 27(low permeability). Those bigger protein pieces end up in the colon where they are used by the bacteria that live there. No immune irritation. If, however , something happens to open up those gaps (increased permeability), those larger pieces of protein can get into the blood stream. When they do, they irritate the immune system. Now every time you eat that food, you are setting off your immune function. Couple that with the wrong genetics, and you have one of these disorders. What increases intestinal permeability? Stress appears to be the biggest factor; but many other things can: food sensitivities, medications, infections, chemical agents, etc. So when we change a client's diet, or add good bacteria, or work to eliminate a medication, or improve their digestion, we are helping their immune system to calm down and eliminate the disorder . BZ: What are some examples of the mainstream allopathic world having followed the lead of the integrative medical approach, over the last decade? Dr. Neu: We are seeing far more interest in the value of nutrients. How many reports have you heard about vitamin D deficiency, and how important it is for our health? How about advertisements on television for fish oils? Even drug companies have jumped on board. Instead of investing one billion dollars in a new drug that might not work, they invest 100,000 dollars in a study that shows that their fish oil lowers triglycerides. You can look in any nutritional textbook and it will tell you the same thing; but because the drug company did the study on their fish oil and had the FDA sign off on it, they can claim that only their fish oil has been FDA approved to lower triglycerides. Then they make it available only by prescription and tell doctors how to use it. This is a model that both doctors and patients are used to. We will see more and more of this in the future. Current examples of supplements that are being promoted by the drug companies include fish oils, antioxidants for eye health, bioflavonoids for joint health, probiotic compounds to treat gut issues, and methylated folate compounds for depression and heart disease. BZ: Dr. Uma Desai, at Bio Energy, does E-Maps. What are they? Dr. Neu: E-MAP is our acronym for the Voll (it stands for energy mapping of acu-points). BZ: You said to me that some years ago, half of your patients came to you because they didn't like doctors, and the other half came because they weren't getting answers from their physicians. And that nowadays 80-90% come to you because they're not getting answers. Can you talk about this? Dr. Neu: The Internet has been a godsend. The more information that is out there, the more people will expect in their own health. You mean I don't have to suffer with these hot flashes? You mean there is something that might actually cure my allergies? You mean my autistic child is actually treatable? People look for answers and find places like Bio Energy. BZ: Please tell us some stories/anecdotes about the efficacy of an integrative approach when dealing with your patients. \"There's a switch \u2014 once you turn on that switch, you're well.\" Would you elaborate on that? Dr. Neu: We are designed to be well. Illness is an unnatural state. I compare illness to a rubber band on stretch. To get the rubber band back to its normal state does not require that you push it into that shape; you merely have to remove the thing that is keeping it on stretch. That is what we try to do. The switch I am speaking of is a master switch. People that have had miracle type cures of incurable conditions will report that when the miracle occurred, they knew in an instant that they were well. It may have taken their bodies months to reflect that wellness, but it occurred in an instant. I recall a story from a book on healing. The author was a physician who used Zen techniques to help people find their wellness. He spoke of a woman who came to one of his weekend courses \u2014 she was frail and had an obvious abdominal tumor. During the course of the weekend, something happened: she was visibly better. When he saw her later at one of his follow up classes, he asked her what had happened. She told him that she had had insulin dependent diabetes since she was an infant and had recently been diagnosed with an incurable liver cancer. While she was doing one of his Zen exercises, something happened inside her: she realized that, because of her illness, she had never chosen to live. In the moment, she flipped her switch and chose to live. Within six months, her tumor had disappeared; she looked healthy and had reduced her insulin. After one year, she fired her doctor because he kept insisting on another CT scan to look for the tumor that had disappeared. All because she found that switch. If we all knew where that switch was, I would have to find a new line of work. BZ: You like to talk about being a doctor in terms of being in a service profession. Can you elaborate on that for our readers? Dr. Neu: I am here as a consultant. I offer advice that I think will be helpful for my clients. That is what we are supposed to do as physicians. I feel that given enough information, people will make the right choices. My job is to get them that information. That is why we spend time with our patients. It is the only way we can serve their needs. BZ: You've moved your offices, from a quiet street over on Longshore near the Huron River, to a busy part of town, near Washtenaw and Platt. Why did you move? Do many of your patients come off of the highway, from other parts of southeastern Michigan? How are you finding the move so far? Dr. Neu: The move was necessitated by a need for a larger space that better reflected the spirit of Bio Energy. We moved into a larger space with more room for everything. We also created a space that was environmentally friendly for our clients as well as our world. It is difficult to promote detoxification and clean living while sitting in a carpeted room with incandescent lights and a heating system that routinely kicks out dust. All of that is gone. All of our flooring is green. Our paints and cabinetry are green. Our lighting is green. Most importantly, Bio Energy has a very relaxed, spa-like feel. I think this is much more in line with our practice. Many patients also like the location because of its proximity to major roads. Our old office was tucked away in the woods \u2014 nice for us, but not so easy to find. BZ: You're just down the block from the Parkway Center. There're lots of fine, integrative medical types over there \u2014 are you planning to interact with them at all, and if so, how? Dr. Neu: We haven't planned anything formal. We have always used Castle Remedies for our patient's homeopathic needs, and that will only improve. Many of our clients also see other practitioners in this area, so probably not much will change.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 29 Continued on page 30 \"It is amazing what nutrition alone can accomplish.\" \"There is greater acceptance that many of these nutrients have very real, pharmaceutical effects \u2014 even the drug companies are getting into the game.\"BZ: You have always offered certain diagnostic tools that were not generally offered by allopathic physicians. Now, your \"toolbox\" is even broader. Can you tell us about Dark Field Testing, about ELISA testing, about MELISA testing, and about the kinds of nutritional testing that you do at Bio Energy? Dr. Neu: Dark Field Testing is a way to evaluate someone's health status by looking at a living sample of blood. We take a drop of blood, put it on a slide, and look at it right away. We use a specific type of illumination that allows us to see living cells without killing them and staining them. The term \"dark field\" comes from the fact that the cells look bright against a dark background. This test allows us to determine multiple things about a person's health: signs of inflammation, free radical damage, gut toxicity, bacterial/viral/fungal infections, and the state of blood fats. ELISA testing uses a blood sample to search for antibodies against food. If these are elevated, it implies that a person has a sensitivity to that particular food. MELISA testing is a newer variation on the ELISA theme. Rather than looking for a particular antibody to something (like in an ELISA test), the MELISA test looks at how the immune system reacts to things. This is particularly of use when looking for reaction to environmental toxins such as metals. At any given level of metal toxicity, the person with the higher reactivity will have more problems. This can be used to pre-test sensitive patients, who are going to have some type of metal implant, to determine if they will have an adverse reaction to that implant. We also do very in-depth biochemical testing to look for imbalances in energy production, amino acid levels, vitamin activity, intracellular mineral balance, and intestinal bacterial balance. The difference between this type of testing and the standard blood work we are used to is like the difference between a skull x-ray and an MRI scan: it provides far greater information and detail about a person' s systems. BZ: \"What we're looking for is...function...function...function.\" You said that to me in a previous conversation. Can you elaborate on that? Dr. Neu: We spend a lot of time in medicine evaluating structure. Most of our standard imaging tests (such as x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, etc.) only tell us about our anatomy. It is great for recognizing fractures, tumors, or other physical anomalies. When I talk about function, I mean how an organ system works, not merely what it looks like. This is also true of blood levels\u2014they frequently have little to do with the total body function of that nutrient. If you want to know how much calcium is in a person's body, don't measure their blood calcium; measure their bone density, because this is where the majority of the body's calcium lies. In the same way, instead of ordering a B12 blood level, we measure what B12 does in the body. If we need B12 to go from A to B and our level of B12 is low, we will end up with too much A and not enough B. This is an example of functional testing. So many times, our symptoms are related to the function of an organ system, not the structure. I can't tell you the number of patients who have come here with \"normal\" workups only to discover that they have significant dysfunction in some important organ system. BZ: In what other ways are integrative physicians better able to diagnose and serve and treat patients than they were 15 years ago? Dr. Neu: There are a lot more labs that provide accurate testing that is not readily available at local labs. There is also a greater effort by these labs to include insurance billing as part of their services. Much of this testing used to be very expensive and labs would not bill insurance companies \u2014 this made it difficult for many people to afford these types of workups. This is much better. There is also greater acceptance that many of these nutrients have very real, pharmaceutical effects \u2014 even the drug companies are getting into the game. BZ: You mentioned customizing nutrients and customizing recommendations, to patients, in ways that were not previously possible. Say more. Dr. Neu: By doing the type of functional testing I discussed above, we can know ahead of time which specific nutrients a patient might need. Instead of using the \"shot gun\" method of using everything all at once, we can make sure that any nutrients we use are tailored to that patient. This is particularly true when we are talking about specialized diets for kids. There is little point in eliminating a food if a child has no reaction to it. Conversely, it becomes very important to eliminate that food if there is a significant immune response to it. BZ: You said that the situation for many integrative physicians was on uncertain terrain, and may get worse, particularly in terms of Medicare and insurance...is the deck stacked against them...how? Dr. Neu: The trend in Medicare is to standardize care to what is termed \"best practices.\" This is the one size fits all approach to medicine. These are well-intentioned protocols that attempt to make sure that everyone gets the best care. The trouble is that it leaves little wiggle room. Right now Medicare offers a bonus to physicians that achieve certain goals \u2014 making sure a certain percentage of their patients got the flu vaccine or that all of their patients with high cholesterol are on a statin drug; this, despite a significant amount of evidence that neither of these make a difference in death rates or life expectancy. Currently, the program offers bonuses for attaining these goals. As of 2014, they will start deducting payments for physicians who don't meet those goals. That will be catastrophic for a practice like mine where the vast majority of patients don't want either treatment. Of course, all this can change. BZ: I know that you're involved with some of the national organizations for integrative medical care. How does that sustain and stimulate you? Dr. Neu: I am very busy and do not have hours of time to do my own research. I belong to organizations that bring this research to meetings I attend. In three days, I can catch up on a year's worth of new data and bring it into my practice. It is also great to sit in a room with 500 other doctors who actually think similarly and believe in the things I do rather than being the oddball on the block. BZ: Are you training or mentoring younger physicians...if not, would you like to? Dr. Neu: We occasionally have medical students spend a day in the office. I also have had other physicians \"shadow\" me for a few days. I have not formally been involved in mentoring. I am definitely interested in this \u2014 particularly with medical students. That is one of the few times in our training that we receive information that is reasonably uninfluenced by drug companies \u2014 there is still a chance to offer a different way of looking at things and have it be seriously considered. By the time you are done with residence, you are so brainwashed in the mainstream mode of thinking that there is no room for any \"out of the box\" approaches. Even more importantly, I am interested in trying to figure out what is causing the epidemics of childhood syndromes such as autism, asthma, and autoimmune disorders. I would love to evaluate and monitor every child born in Michigan, along with their parents and siblings, from the time they are born until they are 18. Gather as much health information as possible to find possible causes including diet, toxin exposure, nutrients, vaccines, etc. The purpose would be to approach this problem from the point of view of gathering information rather than trying to prove a point. It would have to be done independent of any governmental or business entity to make it completely independent \u2014 we cannot have any sacred cows. We need to know the true causes so that we can make a difference. I would make this information open access and allow others to process the data to help us figure out this epidemic. We could do more for the health of our future by doing this than anything else. BZ: Who were your role models as a physician? And who are they now? And do you have heroes \u2014 people or teachers or healer/doctors you look up to and admire? Dr. Neu: My heroes have always been people that looked at a problem that many others had already examined, and were able to find simple answers because they thought outside the box. The perfect example is the two physicians who discovered that ulcers were caused by bacterial infections. They did this because they noted that almost all of their ulcer biopsies had these bacteria in them. They then demonstrated that ulcers could be healed by taking antibiotics. Others had noted these same bacteria previously , but no one made the connection, because, of course, everyone knew that ulcers were caused by stress and overproduction of acid by the stomach. Some of my heroes include Isaac Newton, who described laws of motion and gravity, which applied to all of physics until the discovery of atoms and subatomic particles many years later. He did this through observation of nature and by helping to invent calculus. Another is Albert Einstein, who transformed physics with his relativity theories. He did this by doing thought experiments \u2014 simply using his brain. There was no computer, no particle accelerator, no laboratory with bubbling test tubes \u2014 only his brain. Unfortunately, the field of medicine has very few of these types of people in it. We are so bound to convention that it is difficult to see beyond those conventions. We are taught medicine in the guru/disciple model. Our professors bestow the knowledge, and we are to accept it without question. We do what we do because our teachers did it the same way. Ultimately, this type of \"monkey see, monkey do\" teaching is what makes humans the dominant species on the planet, but it does not foster better solutions to our problems. BZ: What's the hardest thing for you, personally, in maintaining a healthy lifestyle? The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 30 Interview with Dr. James Neuenschwander Continued from page 29Dr. Neu: My most difficult thing is not getting stressed and having the discipline to maintain my exercise and diet routine. I also tend to get hyper-focused on the task of the day, frequently to the detriment of maintaining a balance in my life. BZ: What's the most satisfying aspect of your work? What's the least satisfying aspect of your work? Dr. Neu: The most satisfying aspect of my work is watching an autistic child, who is miserable and unable to speak, transform in to a normal child to the point where physicians don't believe the child was ever autistic. The least satisfying part of my job is dealing with my profession and looking at the huge barriers of money and process that keep a system going that does not work to improve our health. I bite my tongue and grind my teeth every time I overhear a parent complaining about their child's poor health, frequent infections, and the latest medication they have to be on for their behavior (at age 4). There is a better way, and the vast majority of people know nothing about it. I can only treat so many people \u2014 we need to change the whole system. That is a daunting task. BZ: You mentioned to me that you feel yourself to be the \"luckiest person around\"...why? Dr. Neu: I love what I do; I am successful at it; I am in love with my wife (after 12 years); I live on a lake where every warm day is like being on vacation; all my kids are healthy; and I have been blessed with a good enough brain to appreciate it all. Who wouldn't feel lucky? BZ: What books would you recommend to patients? Dr. Neu: The 22 (non-negotiable) Laws of Wellness: Take Your Health into Your Own Hands to Feel, Think, and Live Better Than You Ever Thought Possible by Greg Anderson, which is a brief primer on what it takes to be healthy, and Getting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples by Harville Hendrix, which is a great book on relationships. (Editor's note: both books are available at Crazy Wisdom.) BZ: Your wife, Tricia, is associated with Bio Energy. Please tell us about that. Dr. Neu: Trish came in at a time when the office was near to closing. We were not making it financially. She took over management, turned it around, and increased our income 40-50% \u2014 all during one of the worst recessions in history. Plus, she is one the few people who can get me to improve myself. BZ: How many kids do you have, and how old are they, where do they live, and what are they up to? Dr. Neu: I have three children \u2014 Amber, age 30, Andrew, age 26, and Adam, age 22. Amber is married and has my first grandchild \u2014 unfortunately she lives in California. She is aspiring to a career as a documentary filmmaker . Andrew also lives in California. He is striving to a career in acting. Adam is in his final semester at U-M. He will graduate this spring with a dual degree in English and Theater Arts. I also have three step kids \u2014 Brandon, an electrical engineer in southern Indiana, Bobby, who is finishing his IT degree at CMU, and Bethany (our baby), who is at her first semester at CMU. BZ: What do you love to do, for leisure, in Ann Arbor, in the winter? Dr. Neu: Sit at a good restaurant, have a martini, and dream of spring and summer. BZ: Thank you, Jim. ###\"I can only treat so many people \u2014 we need to change the whole system.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 31 M E N T I O N T H I S A D T O R E C E I V E 5 0 % O F F Y O U R F I R S T T R E A T M E N T ! 708 W .

I have personally benefited from her outstanding work for many years.\" -Dr. Jay Sandweiss, DO Ann Arbor Sustainable Health By Judy Stone, CN, MSW Pardon Me, Your Paradigm is Showing - The deception of evidence-based medicine I am a nutritionist and a few months ago I received a call from a physician about a client we have in common. He was curious about my treatment protocol for this person because the client no longer had the condition for which she had seen that doctor (and a few others). After more than a year of a variety of medical interventions which had not produced the desired result, the client discontinued the medical regimen and began nutritional work with me. The doctor told me he had never in his career seen or known this condition to be cured. As I began to describe my work with the client, I could feel what had been the doctor's initial enthusiasm and interest wane. He told me that although he could refer people to me, he couldn't support what I was doing. \"What does that mean?\" I asked, given that he just told me the client was free from a supposedly incurable condition. What's not to support? \"It's not evidence-based\" was the response. I frequently recommend lab tests to clients to help evaluate how the body is functioning (or dysfunctioning) so that I can offer appropriate nutritional guidance. Most of the time, the doctors, who are the gatekeepers of lab tests (if you want insurance coverage), reject any but the most commonplace of tests. Sometimes I even a write letter explaining my (evidence-based) justification for wanting a specific test. But it's not evidence known to the doctor, he or she is worried about cost containment, and many MD's take great umbrage that a client or their nutritionist would assume that they have a right or the knowledge to request medical tests. So, despite it not being, in my clinical judgment, in our mutual patient's best interest, the answer is usually no. For a client who wants to utilize non-traditional care as part of their health care, they are put in a very difficult position when their medical (or any other) practitioner is not open to working collaboratively with either the client, or other members of the client's chosen health care team. The client has to find a doctor who is sympathetic or at least open to a different point of view, but is often thwarted in that effort by insurance plans, and more importantly, by the sense of powerlessness that has been bred into the doctor-patient relationship. To me, the use of the evidence-based medicine (EBM) defense to reject or condemn the unfamiliar is crazy-making, and, unfortunately all too prevalent when I have to bridge to the medical world as either clinician or patient. Although evidence-based medicine originated in the 1980's to develop \"best practices\" and effective patient care, my experience is that the accusation \"it's not evidence-based\" is frequently a weapon used to protect turf. I doubt this is a conscious intent; I think it is something that is so endemic to the medical paradigm that the assumptions underlying it go unexamined. By not examining EBM's presumed authority, however, we often miss opportunities to move health care forward and we deny people access to potentially safe, effective, lower cost, high-quality care. Who wouldn't be for basing health care on protocols that we know are safe and effective? As both a clinician and a health care consumer, I always want to know about the evidence and risks of any intervention I'm considering. I decided to explore how evidence-based medicine - something that sounds like such a good thing - went so wrong. I began by doing research on the origin of the term \"evidence-based medicine.\" According to EBM pioneer and medical doctor, David Sackett, EBM combines three components: good external evidence (the study), clinical expertise and judgment, and thoughtful use of patient rights, predicaments, and preferences. Really? I was both surprised and relieved to read this definition. Because to hear how people talk about EBM, we all seem to have forgotten that clinical expertise and judgment and the thoughtful use of patient rights, predicaments and preferences are essential. It seems to me that we've all been lulled into group-think, that the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the be all and end all of EBM. How is it that the medical profession has abandoned its own definition of evidence-based medicine? I spoke with Rita Benn, PhD, the Director of Education for University of Michigan's Integrative Medicine and also an investigator for the research arm of the program. I was curious at what point \"clinical expertise and judgment\" carried enough weight to translate into a funded study. Dr. Benn explained to me that if a clinician had 50-200 cases of using a protocol to help a particular condition, they could try to find an academic researcher with an interest in that condition and try to interest him or her in doing a pilot study. That researcher would then look for funding for the study from the University, from National Institutes of Health, or from a private source. Here is where things take a twist. Typically, in my practice, and in many other holistically- or functionally- inclined practices, the same condition in 5 different people will have similar, but not the same, protocol; every body is individual. Different pathways gone awry can produce the same symptom, and part of the art and the science of healing is taking that uniqueness into account. So, I asked Dr. Benn how can we get to a pilot study when we don't have 50 identical protocols for the same condition? Her response revealed a major chasm between holistic and conventional medicine, \"It's a challenge because conventional medicine has taken the approach that one size fits all with a variation of dose.\" It becomes difficult to do a study for an approach to healing that doesn't seek to link one disease, one drug or even one herb - which is how most funding is set up. And, Dr. Benn explained, National Institutes of Health is organized into organ-specific units: cardiovascular, lung, kidney, etc. In my experience, unless you're talking about a broken leg, it is rare to have a condition that wouldn't involve multiple organs and systems. Because conventional medicine has divided your body into territories owned by particular specialties, getting funding for studies that consider you as a whole organism is not in today's EBM paradigm. My inquiry into why the Randomized Control Trial has become the king of evidence-based medicine led me to Barb Scholz, a practitioner and instructor of Energy Healing. \"Every choice or action produces data and evidence,\" says Scholz. \"To throw away data from small sample sets because it hasn't been studied as a Randomized Control Trial is to throw away the leading edge. If we're good scientists we don't throw away data.\" Scholz's experience includes math, engineering, and medical instrumentation software design and I know her to have a keen ability to work with both sides of her brain, straddling both the intuitive and rational. This is an attribute I believe is sadly lacking in medical science. Scholz and I talked about the defensive parry - \"where's the evidence?\" - often used in response to less conventional healing approaches. \"We're fully willing to run experiments on our whole society - cell phones, 24/7 daylight, electromagnetic radiation. We don't wait for the evidence because we're already invested in going ahead. So we have a green light on certain things and red lights on others. We use 'where's the evidence?' as a protective mechanism rather than a way to do good science,\" says Scholz. \"In most studies, researchers are content with relatively short study times - 6 months, a year, maybe two,\" Scholz goes on, \"but how about generational?\" Often adverse effects show up in places we weren't even looking, or in time frames that far exceed what regulatory bodies consider adequate. One major problem with relying on the RCT as the ultimate verification of truth in the world of medicine, healing, or anything else, is the reality that any study is limited by the assumptions it makes. For example, the assumption that 6 months or a year is long enough to verify the negative effects of a drug has been proven time and time again to be false, yet we act as if it were true. Another is that there will always be evidence we don't have a reasonable way to gather, or because of our particular bias, don't believe is important to gather. \"We think science is based on universal evidence,\" says Scholz, \"but it's based on a specific set of assumptions.\" So although the EBM accusation is often hurled in the direction of non-traditional practices, those who hide behind the EBM defense would do well to examine the limitations and biases of their own evidence, and open to the possibility that perhaps they just haven't had the curiosity or taken time to look at other evidence that exists. In my own field of nutrition, this wielding of EBM to discount the holistic perspective plays out in the American Dietetic Association's position that only RD's, among all nutritionists, are science-based and should be considered the nutrition experts (in fact, they have actively tried to legislate this to be the case). Recently, a colleague of mine was inquiring into a university program in Dietetics. She asked how much holistic or integrative nutrition content she would get if she were to enroll in this particular university's program. The answer? \"We're not holistic, we're evidence-based.\" Say what? When did evidence-based become the opposite of holistic? Good external evidence, clinical expertise and judgment, and thoughtful use of patient rights, predicaments, and preferences are the textbook definition of EBM. Holistic or conventional, how do you think your practitioners are doing? ### (Judy Stone can be reached at 734-994-5549 or at: cfninA2@gmail.com.

How is it that the medical profession has abandoned its own definition of evidence-based medicine?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 33 Interviewed by Karl Pohrt Photography by Susan Ayer (Donald Lopez, one of the nation's leading scholars of Buddhism, teaches at the University of Michigan. He is the Arthur E. Link Distinguished University Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies, and currently serves as chair of the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures and chair of the Michigan Society of Fellows. He is the author of many books, most recently The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography , published by Princeton University Press. He will talk about his new book at a Crazy Wisdom Salon on the evening of Thursday, May 12th. I recently interviewed Professor Lopez about The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography at his home on the northeast side of Ann Arbor. He is gracious, curious, quick to laugh, and obviously deeply engaged with the world of Buddhism.) Karl Pohrt: Your biography of The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an amazing story, beautifully told and darkly amusing. Your book makes it very clear that The Tibetan Book of the Dead does not have the religious and cultural authority it claims. You say that The Tibetan Book of the Dead is not really Tibetan, it is not really a book, and it is not really about death. Donald Lopez: What we call The Tibetan Book of the Dead , a work that was published in 1927, is really the product of Walter Evans-Wentz, its editor. It's not Tibetan in the sense that most of what you read in the book, including the prefaces and forwards and his copious footnotes, are in many cases quite unrelated to Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhist practice. Evans-Wentz was able to acquire a Tibetan text while he was visiting Darjeeling in 1919. He couldn't read Tibetan, so he took it to the local English teacher at the Maharaja's Boys School in Gangtok, Sikkim, and he had him translate various chapters out of this much larger work. It is selections, in some ways random selections, from a much larger Tibetan text. And so the book that we have does not correspond to the book as it exists in Tibet. And it's not really about death. It is much more about rebirth and how one might use the process of death and rebirth and what is called the \"intermediate state\" to transform death into enlightenment. In Tibetan Buddhism and some other forms of Buddhism, there is the idea of an intermediate state\u2014the Bardo realm\u2014a time between death and rebirth that can last from one instant up to 49 days. This is a liminal period in which many things can happen, and if you know what you're doing during that state, you can ideally become a Buddha or at least have a good rebirth. If things go badly, you have a bad rebirth. So the Tibetan book that Evans-Wentz had translated is really about the state between death and rebirth, its opportunities and its dangers. It's not about death in the more conventional sense of the term. Karl Pohrt: My first encounter with The Tibetan Book of the Dead was in the late 1960s when I saw a stack of copies in a bookshop on State Street. I noticed that it was published by Oxford University Press, one of the oldest and most prestigious academic presses in the English-speaking world. The Oxford imprint carries a certain cache, and I assumed it was legitimate. When I finished your book I was reminded of Dostoyevsky's remark that Don Quixote was the saddest book he'd ever read. Cervantes says Don Quixote' s \"brain dried up\" because he believed everything he read. The lesson is that whatever the reputation a text has, we should always read it critically . Is The Tibetan Book of the Dead a fraud? Donald Lopez: It certainly was not meant as a fraud. When we use the word fraud we're usually thinking about some sort of intentional deceit. I think that Evans-Wentz was quite well intentioned, but the work that he presented was ultimately one that was in many ways quite at odds with what we now know about Tibetan Buddhist practice and literature. You have to remember that this was a time when it was very difficult for Europeans or Americans to go into Tibet. Evans-Wentz never went himself. He was just in the borderlands, in Sikkim and North India. Very few Tibetan texts had made their way out and very few people could read Tibetan. So I think we have to cut him a little slack based on what was available to him, but he also had a very distinct agenda with which he undertook this project. He was a Theosophist. Karl Pohrt: Of course, does it matter whether or not it's a fraud? All sacred texts take on a life of their own, however spurious their origins. The Lotus Sutra, which claims to present teachings of the Buddha toward the end of his life, appeared five hundred years after the death of the Buddha. And New Testament scholars generally agree that the earliest of the synoptic gospels\u2014Mark\u2014was written sometime after 70 AD at the earliest. The other gospels came later, even though they read like they were written by contemporaries of Jesus. My grandfather memorized The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , a poem which claims to be a translation of verses composed by Omar Khayyaam, a medieval Persian poet. The poem by Edward FitzGerald, a Victorian poet, is not noted for its fidelity to the original, but I don't think my grandfather cared a Karl Pohrt Interviews Buddhist Scholar Donald Lopez about his New Book, The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography \"It's not really about death. [The Tibetan Book of the Dead ] is much more about rebirth and how one might use the process of death and rebirth and what is called the \"intermediate state\" to transform death into enlightenment.\"\"I think that Evans-Wentz was quite well intentioned, but the work that he presented was ultimately one that was in many ways quite at odds with what we now know about Tibetan Buddhist practice and literature.\"Lopez will be speaking at Crazy Wisdom on Thursday, May 12thThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 34 whit about that. The poem spoke to him. This is what you call Reception History. Could you talk about that? Donald Lopez: What you say is exactly right. It is certainly true in the case of the Buddha himself. We know that nothing the Buddha said was written down until some four hundred years after his death. If we're worried about figuring out what Jesus said from something that was written forty years after his crucifixion\u2014now multiply that by ten. However, those books are what we have. Those are the books that have been canonized and that have become the basis for the religion. There are certain things that are unrecoverable. We cannot recover exactly what it was that Jesus taught and exactly what it was that the Buddha taught. But I think we are bound to try as hard as we can and to establish the limits of what we can know and what we can't know. In the case of The Tibetan Book of the Dead , we now know a lot about where this Tibetan text came from. So you're right. It really is like The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. To a certain extent it is something that has taken on a life of its own, and it's very important to know that life story well. The book I've written is a history of The Tibetan Book of the Dead , the book Evans- Wentz produced and published in 1927. I think that ideally one can know the history well, one can understand as much as it is possible to know about the process by which it was constructed, and still find inspiration there. I don't see the critical or historical approach and the religious or spiritual approach as necessarily being antithetical. Your mention of Omar Khayyam reminds me of Borges' essay \"The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald.\" Borges ponders the miracle of an Englishman translating a selection of five hundred quatrains by a Persian astronomer of the thirteenth century and producing one of the most popular works of Victorian literature. According to Borges, the case calls for \"conjecture of a metaphysical nature,\" and he wonders whether Omar may have been reincarnated in England or whether the spirit of Omar possessed FitzGerald around 1857. Karl Pohrt: Who vetted the manuscript at Oxford? Donald Lopez: Walter Evans-Wentz's real name was Walter Wentz\u2014Walt Wentz from Trenton, New Jersey. He got his B.A. at Stanford and then went to England for further study at Oxford. While he was there he saw that many upper class British had hyphenated names and so he took his mother 's maiden name and became Walter Evans-Wentz.Again, we need to acknowledge that there was relatively little available on Tibet back then, yet the fascination with Tibet was almost as strong as it is today. So when he came forward with this translation\u2014and the translation itself is quite good\u2014I assume that Oxford was happy to publish it. And given how many copies it has sold, they're undoubtedly still very happy. Karl Pohrt: The Tibetan Book of the Dead gained traction in America at that moment when the taboos surrounding death began to give way. Everyone is anxious to know what happens after death, but The Tibetan Book of the Dead is still a fairly exotic explanation. Donald Lopez: I think The Tibetan Book of the Dead has had several lives and has died and been reborn several times. As we know from the various editions and the new prefaces that were added, it has found an audience in each generation. The 60s was really the time\u2014as you recall\u2014when there was an explosion of interest in Asian religions. Part of that was because of the Vietnam War, part of that was just a sense we had that there was something profoundly corrupt about Western culture in all its manifestations, and the idea, which has turned out to be a romantic one, that some sort of alternative could be found in \"the East\" or \"the Orient\" as we used to call it, this vague undifferentiated area that we used to talk about. There were the \"Eastern Religions\" and we somehow imagined that Hinduism and Buddhism and Daoism and Confucianism and Shintoism were all of a piece. So there was a kind of naivet\u00e9 at that time, a naivet\u00e9 which in retrospect is rather poignant. At that same time there was this whole explosion of work on death and how one dies and there was the Hospice Movement. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross wrote On Death and Dying and Raymond Moody wrote Life After Life. In the midst of all that, this old 1927 book came back and was picked up by Timothy Leary and the Beatles; it was ancient wisdom, perennial wisdom to be tapped. Karl Pohrt: You couple the story of Joseph Smith's discovery of the sacred plates buried in upstate New York with the discovery of sacred texts supposedly hidden in Tibet by the tantric master Padmasambhava in a way that is wonderfully respectful of both religious traditions. You do this without challenging the truth claims of either the Mormons or the Tibetans. Donald Lopez: In Tibetan Buddhism there is a genre of literature called terma, which literally means \"treasure.\" The idea is that the great tantric master Padmasambhava came to Tibet in the late 700s and he couldn't stay very long, and he had various things that he knew the Tibetans would need in the future. As the story goes, he dictated these scriptures in a kind of coded script and buried them all over the country\u2014in mountains and rocks and at the bottom of lakes and inside pillars. Those texts began to be discovered some centuries later and were even discovered into the twentieth century . They have become one of the most important genres of Tibetan literature over the centuries. The Tibetan work that became The Tibetan Book of the Dead was such a text, buried in the eighth century and unearthed in the fourteenth century. Of course, scholars have to look at these buried \"treasure texts\" with a great deal of skepticism because they're not written in Tibetan. They're written in a language that only the person who discovers them can read and that person translates them into Tibetan so that others can read them. This is a controversial point in the field of Tibetan Studies because from one perspective\u2014to use your term\u2014they look a lot like frauds. It looks like someone trying to gain spiritual authority for himself by saying look what I just found. Nonetheless, they have become part of the canon. We have a structurally similar case of the discovery of sacred scriptures when Joseph Smith unearths the tablets of The Book of Mormon in upstate New York. To get back to the issue of how one can be both a critical scholar and also a religious person\u2014I was very struck and moved by the story of Smith because everything he did occurred not on the other side of the world, but in upstate New York. This is not a place we would consider exotic. And it occurred not in the 700s, but in the early 1800s. Karl Pohrt Talks to Professor Donald Lopez Continued from page 33 Karl Pohrt (the founder and long-time owner of Shaman Drum Bookshop) and Professor Donald Lopez discussing his new book, The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography. There will be a Crazy Wisdom Salon entitled An Evening with Buddhist Scholar Donald Lopez on Thursday, May 12th at 7 pm --- Lopez will be discussing his book and engaging with the audience on Buddhist topics. \"I don't see the critical or historical approach and the religious or spiritual approach as necessarily being antithetical.\" \"I think The Tibetan Book of the Dead has had several lives and has died and been reborn several times.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 35 It happened, in other words, in the light of history. American historians and Mormon scholars know a lot about everything that Smith did. We have letters and all sorts of pamphlets and papers\u2014all the kinds of documents that we don't have in the case of The Tibetan Book of the Dead . That places a different onus of credibility and authority on The Book of Mormon. It has been said that Mormonism or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the most American of all religions, and one reason it is so American is because it sanctified American soil. Smith dug down into the dirt of upstate New York and he found a sacred book. And the Tibetans did a rather similar thing. They couldn't go to India anymore. Buddhism had essentially disappeared there. So how do you find new scriptures? You dig them up. In 2007, I gave some lectures in Puerto Rico, where Buddhism is becoming popular. Two Nyingma Lamas had been there to give some teachings. My hosts said, \"They told us that Padmasambhava came to Puerto Rico and left some texts in the mountains.\" Karl Pohrt: From our vantage point, it is easy to dismiss Evans-Wentz, who was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and never learned the Tibetan language, or Lama Govinda, who was born Ernst Hoffman in Germany, or Madame Blavatsky, a Russian medium who started the Theosophical Society as\u2014at best\u2014romantic amateurs who misrepresented and twisted Hinduism and Buddhism to fit their own agendas. But is this too harsh a judgment? Maybe the window through which we observe others is always cloudy. Evans-Wentz, Govinda, and Blavatsky were also early western pioneers in the encounter with Asian religious traditions. Donald Lopez: I agree entirely. I've often tried to talk about the importance, especially, of Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society. In the late 1800s, India and Asia were being overrun by Christian missionaries who were telling the Buddhists that their religion was idolatry and superstition. Madame Blavatsky, a Russian medium, and her friend Colonel Olcott, an American Civil War veteran, sailed to Sri Lanka to defend the Buddhists against the British and they went to India to defend the Hindus against the British. There's something quite heroic about them. They believed that there is a single mystical tradition from which all religions spring, an idea that continues to this day. And so the fact that they were trying to see Hinduism and Buddhism through that lens is not surprising in the least. Returning to this theme of the light of history, we know a great deal about these people and therefore it's very easy to see their faults. It's like the first time you see high definition television. Do you really want to look into the pores of your favorite actors? \"It's probably the case that every great religion began as a cult or as somebody calling it a cult and calling its founder a fraud. We know this is the case with Jesus, Mohammed, and the Buddha from their own scriptures. The question is: Why did these cults turn into world religions?\" It's probably the case that every great religion began as a cult or as somebody calling it a cult and calling its founder a fraud. We know this is the case with Jesus, Mohammed, and the Buddha from their own scriptures. The question is: Why did these cults turn into world religions? Why did these \"frauds\" turn into founders and saints? I've always found the study of this process fascinating. Most of the so-called frauds and cults fall by the wayside\u2014they become heresies. But others survive, and it's often for more worldly reasons than because the truth they have is better than the truth someone else has. Karl Pohrt: And finally, what do you make of the late Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa's strange comment, which you quote, that the animal realm is characterized by the absence of a sense of humor? My cat has a fine sense of humor unless he's hungry or he thinks my grandchildren are teasing him. Donald Lopez: My dear departed cat Benny was one of the funniest sentient beings I've ever met in my life. I miss him for his sense of humor above all. ### (The interviewer, Karl Pohrt, was the founder and long-time owner of Shaman Drum Bookshop, an Ann Arbor literary institution for 29 years.)

Ann Arborite Zena Zumeta has a national reputation both as a mediator and a trainer of mediators, and she sat down with staff writer, Mary Runser, to talk about the spiritual aspects of mediation, and its relationship to her long-time meditation practice.) \"While I was in law school in Ann Arbor, my mother was dying of cancer. So I was under a lot of pressure,\" Zena explained. \"I took a yoga class and, during one of the classes when I was in the corpse pose, I must have transcended. I came home glowing, and feeling very light and energetic.\" But she could never replicate that feeling again in yoga class. \"I went to my friends to ask whether that was what meditation did, and they said 'yes.' So I signed up immediately.\" Zena began studying Transcendental Meditation, which is the form she still practices today. \"Meditating gave me energy, inner peace, and expansion,\" Zena said. \"When I came out of law school in 1975, I was a labor negotiator and also did some community organizing. Both of those things made me pretty competitive and aggressive.\" She admits that, for awhile, being embroiled in that competitive and argumentative environment was enjoyable, but she learned that it was not a very productive approach for the people she represented. That approach was also not natural for her personality, though she didn't realize it right away. \"In fact, it was my husband who suggested that it might be helpful to have some integration with what I was trying to do internally \u2014 with meditating \u2014 and my work. It felt to him like I was schizophrenic.\" Zena didn't like herself as an aggressive advocate. \"I did eventually come to realize that, as I was changing on the inside [through meditating], I really did want that change on the outside as well.\" As often is the case with many of the best things in life, Zena found mediation by accident. In 198, she was working with the Institute of Gerontology , training others to advocate for elders and elder organizations. \"While I was there, I was asked to mediate between two faculty members. Because of my experience and background in labor organizing, they knew that I was familiar with negotiation. So I did it, and we were able to reach a settlement.\" While she was very comfortable being in the middle of conflict, Zena realized that she was more comfortable helping people to resolve their conflicts, rather than helping them to fight, or fighting for them. \"I came upon the realization that mediation was, in fact, the way to integrate the internal and the external, my spiritual growth and my work,\" Zena said. Ever since then, Zena has been mediating disputes between neighbors, family members, landlords and tenants, employers and employees, businesses and consumers, and schools and parents. She is a co-founder and past director of the Ann Arbor Mediation Center , and current president of Zena Zumeta Mediation Services . She also continues her work with labor-management cooperation as president of The Collaborative Workplace. Working with mediation has been spiritually enlightening for Zena. It's taught her many spiritual lessons and paralleled the things she was learning through meditating. \"One of the primary lessons that I learned through meditating and mediation is that you cannot be too attached to the outcome; it really is about the journey. In mediation we say, 'Trust the process,' and it's an exact parallel of [the saying], 'It's about the journey, rather than the destination.' \" Zena's goal is to elicit what the parties want out of the process. If they want an agreement, she'll help them achieve that goal. If their goal is to vent, or to just be heard, then she'll help them do that. \"Often they will change their minds along the way, and what they thought they wanted in the beginning may be very different from what they want in the end, or what they can achieve. It's necessary to be open to a change in direction as we go along.\" Zena has been in situations in which an involved party is adamant about what they want and is thoroughly unwilling to change their mind. The first question she asks in this situation is: Can they get what they want? \"Often, getting what you want only masks getting what you need. If people can get to a point where they understand that getting what they need is more important, that' s a great win for the process.\" The idea in any mediation situation is to be an instrument of peace. \"That's really the holiest of outcomes to be had in mediation,\" Zena said. With all its parallel lessons, mediation became like a mirror to Zena that reflected her own spiritual growth. \"I realized that anything I wanted to do as a person, any lessons I wanted to learn, any growth that I wanted to experience, I could do through mediation as well as meditating. And when I figured that out, it left me with a feeling of such freedom. [My work] really has become a reflection of where I am spiritually .\" Zena said that there are many commonalities between mediation and meditation. \"It's actually humorous to realize that there's only a one-letter difference between the two words, and they really are that closely related.\" \"Mediation\" even sounds like a more comfortable situation than \"conflict resolution\" or \"dispute resolution,\" more like allowing oneself to slip into a comfortable and warm sweater , rather than putting on a jacket that feels like steel wool. Another thing that Zena has learned through her work in mediation is that when all else fails, prayer works. \"There are many times when the parties might be at impasse and I don't have any ideas about where to go with the situation. I am always amazed by the things that can happen when, after trying everything I know , I finally hand a situation to God and allow Him to work it out.\" Resolving Conflicts, Creating Peace Zena Zumeta, co-founder of the Ann Arbor Mediation Center, mediates disputes between neighbors, family members, landlords and tenants, employers and employees, businesses and consumers, and schools and parents. She is also well-known in the field of mediation training through her company, the Mediation Training and Consultation Institute. \"I realized that...any lessons I wanted to learn, any growth that I wanted to experience, I could do through mediation as well as meditation. It's actually humorous to realize that there's only a one-letter difference between the two words, and they really are that closely related.\" The Spirituality of Mediation: A Conversation with Zena Zumeta Photo by Rachael Waring \"The honor, the privilege and the blessing of being able to do the work that I do,\" Zena said, \"is that it does support my soul and it supports the souls of the people with whom I work.\" She continued with tear-filled eyes, \"It's just amazing to be able to do this work.\" Zena is renowned in the field of mediation training. She teaches mediation and conflict resolution to lawyers, mental health professionals, managers and employees, and community members through her company, the Mediation Training & Consultation Institute . She and her staff travel throughout the country to offer mediation training programs. She especially enjoys introducing the mediation process to lawyers \"whose souls are so starved, and I see them open up. I still can' t believe I get to do this!\" Along the way, Zena has been a leader in state, regional, and national mediation organizations. Her work has been recognized with numerous state and national professional awards, including the Lifetime Achievement in Mediation Award from the Family Mediation Council-Michigan. In a time when we are so often forced to ignore our souls, or to fight for things that simply aren't right, Zena gets the opportunity to help others rediscover and revive their souls. \"There are a lot of seekers who find through mediation a way to bring back the universal, the whole and the soul,\" she said. \"And to be able to make a living by helping people accomplish this has been a gift. Really, it was a gift to even find it.\" ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 37 \"One of the primary lessons that I learned through meditating and mediation is that you cannot be too attached to the outcome; it really is about the journey.

Although it has been evolving since the early 20th century, its formal inception occurred in 1991 when Jeffrey Bland, PhD, founded the Institute of Functional Medicine (IFM). Functional medicine is also closely associated with naturopathic medicine \u2014 since Dr. Bland is one of the co-founders of Bastyr University, one of the three colleges of naturopathic medicine in this country.Functional medicine deals with the prevention and treatment of the underlying causes of chronic disease by addressing core clinical imbalances, to restore each patient's functionality and health. When functional medicine works really well, the only change for the patient is a change of diet. Many times the body has the capacity to remain in balance once well-being is restored. Functional medicine is a complement to allopathic medicine, not an alternative or replacement. In common with holistic medical systems such as traditional Chinese medicine, functional medicine recognizes the interconnections between the mind, body, and spirit. The principles of functional medicine include a belief in biochemical individuality (the importance of individual variations in metabolic function) and a focus on patient-centered treatment, which emphasizes \"patient care\" rather than \"disease care.\" Also, functional medicine defines health as \"positive vitality\" \u2014 not just the absence of disease. Finally, it recognizes the homeodynamic nature of health and disease, in which the body constantly undergoes physiologic and metabolic processes. Functional medicine is often described as the crossroads where nutrition and genetics meet. As such, it does not view genetics as destiny, but instead recognizes that genes must be activated and can be deactivated. This occurs when harmful chemicals are taken into the body with food or by exposure to the environment. One can see the power of this insight in the assertion by the IFM that 97% of all human cancers are preventable.

I had a type of tendonitis called \"trigger finger,\" which causes one's fingers to become locked if one grips anything too tightly. Conventional medicine's treatment of trigger finger is surgical. I would have been open to that, except I was told that the surgery would have to be repeated every three years. I was doubtful that the surgery would be successful more than once or twice. With the help of the Internet and finding functional medicine through the IFM, I found a better solution to my problem. With the analysis provided by functional medicine, I found out that I am gluten sensitive, and that this was the reason behind my trigger finger. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. By the time a diagnosis was made, I also had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia-like symptoms. All of my symptoms are now gone, and stay away as long as I don't eat gluten. I learned functional medicine \"the hard way\" by dealing with my illnesses, but I later also benefited from the many educational opportunities that the IFM provides practitioners. Many of the members of the IFM have similar personal experiences that bring them to functional medicine. Functional medicine examines the core clinical imbalances that underlie various disease conditions, of which food allergies are just one example. Other precursors to disease include imbalances of hormones or neurotransmitters, oxidation reduction, immune system imbalances, inflammation, and digestive, absorptive, and microbiological imbalances. Improving these imbalances - in the patient's environmental inputs and in the body's fundamental physiological processes - is the path to restoring health. Functional medicine focuses on functionality at many levels, rather than a single treatment for a single diagnosis. Functional medicine also uses the patient' s story as a key tool for integrating diagnosis, signs, symptoms, and clinical imbalances into a comprehensive approach to improve health and functionality. However, my patients are of the four-legged variety. As far as I know, I am the only veterinarian applying the IFM paradigm to the treatment of animals. I decided to try it on animals after it was so helpful to me. All practitioners are presented with patients they cannot seem to help. I was in hope that functional medicine would be useful for those poor creatures that seemed beyond help. With a little tweaking, functional medicine has worked wonderfully on pets. I still see some patients that do not respond to treatment, but not nearly as many as before. Utilizing functional medicine in my practice has been an exciting and invigorating experience. Were it not for functional medicine, I would be retired by now! Many of my patients come to me with a history of being on antibiotics and/or steroids for years. One of my favorite patients is good example of the power of functional medicine to unravel complex chronic illness. Gracie is a five-year -old Doberman who was suffering from severe itching, dermatitis, and hair loss when I first saw her. She had been on antibiotics for four of her five years. Every time an attempt was made to discontinue antibiotics, the itching and dermatitis would return. Analysis of organics acids in Gracie's urine pointed to an imbalance of intestinal bacteria. A comprehensive stool analysis revealed that she had a small intestinal overgrowth of lactobacillus, partially due to the probiotics she was being given. Discontinuing the probiotics and suppressing the overgrowth \u2014 with botanicals, not antibiotics \u2014 along with nutritional support, has completely resolved Gracie' s dermatitis. She recently appeared in an ad in Hot Rod magazine with her shiny, healthy coat.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 40 Continued from page 39 \"As far as I know, I am the only veterinarian applying the Institute of Functional Medicine paradigm to the treatment of animals...With a little tweaking, functional medicine has worked wonderfully on pets.\"Functional Medicine Resolves Chronic Conditions in Pets. ....... In addition to skin disease and allergies, many veterinary patients come to me with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Functional medicine gives one the perspective and tools to sort out classic \"abdominal mysteries\" \u2014 be they pancreatitis, hepatitis, or simply vomiting and/or diarrhea. Many other diseases are connected to GI tract dysfunction in less obvious ways. Abby, a 12-year-old Labrador, came to me two years ago because of recurrent bladder infections caused by E. coli bacteria. Antibiotics provided only temporary relief. The underlying cause of Abby's bladder issues was a condition called \"leaky gut.\" Her small intestine had become \"leaky\" because of food hypersensitivities, which allowed bacteria to translocate to her bladder. Restoring normal GI tract function, along with support for her bladder, has resolved all of Abby's leaks. Another common disease with a connection to the GI tract is feline asthma. Marley is a 12-year-old domestic shorthair who was taking several hundred dollars of drugs every month for asthma when I first saw her. Resolving her food allergies and restoring a normal balance of GI microflora has enabled Marley to lead a drug-free life. Sometimes disease will be caused by dietary deficiencies. Tuko is a two-year-old Schnauzer who suffered a grand mal seizure. Tuko does not have epilepsy; rather, her seizure was associated with inadequate blood levels of several minerals and amino acids, in spite of being fed an excellent diet. It turns out that Tuko's requirement for these nutrients is much higher than most dogs. Biochemical individuality is one of the fundamental tenets of functional medicine, so determining her special need for additional supplements was the key to her recovery . An emphasis on prevention is another pillar of functional medicine. Charlie is a Standard Poodle who was brought to me as a puppy. His owners' charge to me was to prevent Charlie from dying from cancer at a young age, as their previous two poodles had. (Actually, cancer is so common in all dogs and cats that standard poodles don't stand out in this regard. Present estimates are that 50% of pet dogs and cats get cancer.) When Charlie was three years old, we ran several laboratory tests that are unique to functional medicine. We were able to determine that he was developing imbalances in his colon that are associated with colon cancer. Hopefully, the supplements we prescribed will enable Charlie to dodge that bullet. Functional medicine allows for true prevention, rather than simply early detection. From a functional medicine perspective, chronic diseases remind me of the nursery rhyme \"How the Kingdom Was Lost.\" The kingdom was lost because of a missing horseshoe nail, which prevented the messenger from riding the horse, which prevented the king from being warned of an invading enemy, who took over the kingdom. Nobel Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling, one of the progenitors of functional medicine, is quoted as saying that \"all illness begins with a mineral deficiency.\" With functional medicine, we can detect that deficiency before the kingdom is lost. ### The clinic of John B.

With credit to Renaissance Woman Jeanne Adwani for coining the phrase \"Hair Healer,\" we invite you to soak up the wisdom of four hair healers, and then to read about 6 great places to find Green Salons and Green Hairstylists. The Hair Healers of Ann Arbor Photography by Rachael WaringCynthia Reedy, Grace Morand, Vicki Honeyman and Jeanne AdwaniThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 44 Jeanne Adwani, owner of Be Hair Now, has been a hair stylist for 22 years. She describes herself as \"a hair healer, writer, story teller, artist, thinker, metaphysician, and Kaizen Muse Creativity Coach.\" Jeanne is a collector who \"recycles\" the treasures she finds \u2014 many of which she has available for sale in her shop, along with the art of her two co-workers, Andrea McCuiston and Karin Lindstrom. Jeanne grew up in East Lansing and has lived and traveled extensively in the U.S., as well as living in London, England, for five years. She has been in Ann Arbor since 1985. The name of her salon was inspired by the seminal book, Be Here Now , by American spiritual teacher Ram Dass. She became a hair artist because \"it is creative and fun, giving me time to do my other artistic endeavors and connect more deeply with people in a one-on-one experience.\" Jeanne is also an established mixed-media craftswoman whose works have appeared at local galleries, and a Tarot reader and teacher. I am a hair healer, hair artist, hair dresser, beauty operator, cosmetologist. I am she-who-coifs-the-hairs-on-your-head, some of you for over twenty years. I cut you, color you, treat you with essential products that stimulate your scalp, give love to your hair, tweak your olfactory senses in lavender, spice, flowers, or mango banana. I do this so I can give your hair bounce, fullness, curl, smoothness, and a little somethin'-somethin' special. And in the finale, I arrange them, scramble them, tease them, smooth them, blow them, roll them, or let them air-dry on a sunny day. My goal is always, and in all ways, to have you feeling your best when you look in that mirror's reflection, leaving my salon with a hug and smile. That is one part of what I call my \"hair healing\": the making-pretty, and the feel-good part. Another essential experience of my hair-caring profession is that, during all of the above, we are chatting. There is an exchange of wisdom between us that gathers us at creation's portal and invites us in. It starts as soon as we greet. I sit you down in my purple chair, swivel you to the mirror's question, and we talk about what I will be doing for you today. I try to listen to your needs: your hair conflicts, what worked and what didn't from the last time we were together, and proceed accordingly. I let myself tune in to how you're feeling: happy, sad, melancholy, feisty, critical, indifferent, cranky, or whiney. The truth is...you want to tell me what's going on with your life beyond your hair-care issues. I want to hear it. I just have to ask. \"How are you doing? What's going on in your world?\" Sometimes the floodgates open and you give it to me raw and uncut. Sometimes, it' s a giggle and whisper on the quest for the perfect lover. Sometimes...it's years of every five-to-six weeks of getting together here, just friends catching up. Sometimes, you need to have me just make you laugh a little, or hear one of my historic, fanciful stories to distract you from your life. You know I have a story to kick-start our time together. I am she-who-knows-about your work crisis, your children's joys and struggles, your partnership, your grief, your workout regime, your culinary expertise, your trip to Peru. I know some of your deep secrets: of love, betrayal, desire, unworthiness, shame, fear. I know you in a way many don't, which I honor with my silence. I know all this stuff because this intimate setting of me, you, and hair, all the lathering and conditioning, snipping, clipping, slathering, fondling of follicle, somehow seduces personal stories out of you. Not to say that I'm not a clever woman and have a knack for that sort of seduction \u2014 I believe I do. You amaze me. I desire to dig a little deeper into your psyche, if you let me, so that we can uncover the reasons we're here and the why and wherefore of life on this planet. I learn more about myself because of the wonder of getting to know you. It is through relationship that I grow to become my highest self, my best self. I am honored with the opportunity for this to happen between us, and grateful for the trust you give me. I hold your stories as sacred information. You can count on me to embrace the truth of you and keep it safe. This is an essential part of what I call \"hair healing.\" It isn't just that I alter your appearance with a cut and style, then send you out into your world with a bit of \"feel-good\" coursing through your veins. It's also about the healing effect of giving yourself to nurturance. For a short time, it's All About You. You entrust yourself to me to care for you, listen to you, comfort you, laugh with you, cry with you, maybe get all politically riled up with you; so many things can and do happen in our time together. There is, in my opinion, a healing consequence of this for both of us. I get to serve and support you, I get your trust, I get to be creative, and I get your smile...I am rewarded for my services beyond what you pay me for our experience together. I am grateful every day for this opportunity we share. Thank you. Be sure to book your appointment a few weeks ahead, I don't want to miss our time together.

Jeanne Adwani, Be Hair Now Salon The truth is, you want to tell me what's going on with your life beyond your hair-care issues. And I want to hear it. I just have to ask. Cynthia Reedy has been a hair stylist since her early 20's, after attending Cosmetology School in San Diego, California. She grew up in the Detroit area and came to Ann Arbor almost 20 years ago. In February of this year she opened her own salon in Ann Arbor, called Studio 44 Hair Design. Prior to this, she worked at Identity Salon, and Campus Barbers before that. During that time, she took off 18 months from doing hair to work in Media Artist Relations for the Raven Gallery in Northville, promoting local folk musicians. What an honor it is to be asked to write about what has truly been an adventurous journey and career as a hair artist...and, as some would say , a \"hair healer.\" In my experience, there IS a gentle magic that occurs in the world of \"hair caring,\" where creativity and connection between hair stylist and client meet and mingle. As with any profession where touch is present, a unique and intimate energy exchange takes place. This has been a real bonus that I didn't expect upon entering into the field. I chose hair styling because it seemed fun. I wanted another skill under my belt while working towards my bachelor's degree. I had been working for the City Attorney's Office in San Diego and, although interesting, it was way too stressful. I took to all aspects of cosmetology very well, i.e., anatomy , chemistry, physics, psychology, and art, and found the field to be fascinating, fun, and flexible. I enjoyed the many hair competitions (winning a few) and hair shows I attended while living out in California - and still enjoy continuing education to this day! I'm thrilled by my career because I get to be myself, trust my intuition, and serve people creatively and professionally. Having that kind of freedom is very important to me. My intention and commitment along the way has been to create a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere in which to really hear people. Recently I expanded upon this idea and opened my own hair studio. I purposely selected a peaceful location on the seventh floor of a majestic, art deco-style building. The studio has huge windows facing south over the city and I marvel every day at the rising and setting sun, the shadows, and the constantly changing spiritual light...it inspires me and evokes even more creativity. Hair styling is like sculpture to me and ever so satisfying! I find it to be similar in approach to my other artistic interests, such as working in ceramic clay, silver clay, photography, and jewelry making. They all help to keep my creative eye alive. Hair styling is like \"art on demand\" and keeps me on my creative toes - the design, texture, and color possibilities are endless. When working with clients, we may co-create a new look together, or my client may say, \"Do whatever you want, I totally trust you.\" Either way, both bring me joy in seeing the finished results and true smiles of appreciation. Deeper than that, and past the physical transformation of hair, it is a wonderful experience when people feel relaxed enough to open up and share who they are: their dreams, joys, sorrows, and insights. It allows me to see multiple and diverse slices of life, which have revealed to me a profound depth in humanity. I am privileged to witness how beautiful people really are at their core, regardless of their creed or culture. It restores my faith daily . When I think about the amazing people I have met in almost two decades here in Ann Arbor, I feel very fortunate indeed. How interesting it has been to talk with people from all walks of life and locations around the world. W orking close to the University of Michigan has certainly exposed me to every sort of profession, personality, and nationality, and has brought a wonderful bouquet: philosophers, writers, scientists, artists, and so on. What a personal inspiration and education it has been. Cynthia Reedy, Studio 44 Hair Design As with any profession where touch is present, a unique and intimate energy exchange takes place. This has been a real bonus that I didn't expect when entering into the field. I acknowledge that having this exposure inspired me to actually finish my bachelor's of science degree in communications/fine arts (graduating from Eastern Michigan University in 2005). My areas of study were interpersonal communication, listening skills, assertiveness training, and organizational communication. For now, I use my degree with my work, by incorporating these skills and ideas with the people I meet and serve. Life is good and I feel honored by the people I've met along the way \u2014 their grace, wisdom, kindness, and support have added to the richness of my life. Going full circle, if I have contributed to my clients' lives in any way, then I am definitely better for it. Studio 44 Hair Design is located at 202 E. Washington, Suite 710, Ann Arbor.

My clients and I have weathered many of life's experiences...plus, I've both given AND received advice from my clients. Vicki Honeyman has been cutting hair for over 30 years, always in her own business. She came to Ann Arbor in 1970 when she transferred to the University of Michigan for her sophomore year, after growing up in Detroit and spending her freshman year at Oakland University. She received a bachelor of general studies degree with a film concentration from the University of Michigan, and then had several jobs around the state relating to film. She is well-known in southeastern Michigan for having been the director of the esteemed Ann Arbor Film Festival for 15 years. She is also known for jitterbug (50's rock and roll) dancing, which she and Jim Kruz taught for many years around Ann Arbor, as well as performing together in public. \"Hair healer\": What a huge responsibility! Given the task to look at myself and my work in that light, I have to say that, first of all, I am not a \"hair stylist.\" I've always offered straight-forward, \"wash and wear\" haircuts, which means I do not \"style\" hair. I don't wash or blow dry, use a curling iron, or give perms or color treatments. I encourage my clients to stop using blow dryers and brushes, so they can get their hair in good natural condition AND gain a sense of freedom from spending more time than necessary on their hair.I became licensed to cut hair professionally in 1980, and then I worked with Raven and Kish inside the Saguaro Plants store for five years. I loved being inside that magical environment! There were cats, rabbits, a huge aviary full of finches, reptiles, and lots of green plants that produced lots of oxygen \u2014 it was a very healthy and very fun place to work. When Saguaro closed in 1985, I opened Vicki's Wash & Wear Haircuts on E. Ann St. (in the original Crazy Wisdom space!). It had different energy from Saguaro, but was a fun, 50's-decor environment with lots of light, and the antithesis of a hair salon ambience. Like Saguaro, it was an alternative place to get a haircut, a place that did not look or smell like a hair salon. My clients know me to be outgoing and outspoken. I appreciate \u2014 and look forward to \u2014 the intelligent conversations we have, often about politics and literature. We share not only book titles and film and music recommendations but, more importantly, our life stories. I still have clients from over 25 years ago, as far back as my Saguaro Plants days. The depth of the client/haircutter relationship is not one to be taken lightly . We have a huge responsibility, we hair people! Not only must we do good work on each and every client, we have to be good \u2014 and hopefully objective \u2014 listeners. We want our clients to like us and to love the way we've made them look and feel about themselves! I'm fortunate to have developed strong lifetime friendships with some of my clients, some of whom have become friends I see outside of my shop. Others have become my friends at work, like one client who comes in every two weeks, without fail, hoping upon hope that I will finally tell her I've met my perfect match! I have developed an intimacy with those long-term clients that is unlike other relationships. My clients and I have weathered many of life's experiences \u2014 we have watched each other mature, get sick, experience losses and deaths, celebrated pivotal birthdays. We've laughed together and we've cried together. I've learned about their families, empathized with them about their job losses, divorces, and breakups, but also shared their joys and good news....plus, I've both given AND received advice from my clients. In 2003, ten months after I left my position as director of the Ann Arbor Film Festival, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I spent the next year-and-a-half undergoing treatment. My clients were extremely upset and concerned about my recovery. At the time of my diagnosis and treatment, Grace Morand was cutting hair in the back room of my shop. I was most fortunate that she was able to take over my clientele for the time that I was unable to work. Some of my clients became my BC (breast cancer) sisters, guiding me through treatment that they also experienced with their own bout of breast cancer. Many brought me food. Many donated money. Unable to work because the treatment made me so ill, at one point my friends held a weekend-long rummage sale to raise money for me. The Ann Arbor News was extremely helpful in bringing the community together to assist me. I am still humbled by the level of support and love that came my way. I've been cancer-free for the past 7-1/2 years. I am grateful to be one of the lucky ones who got through the barbaric treatment, but I can also say it was life-changing because of how supportive our Ann Arbor community was of me. It was just several months before the diagnosis that I decided to fill the empty space where the Festival office had been, in the back room of my haircutting shop, with items to sell \u2014 and thus my gallery/gift shop, Heavenly Metal, was born. Now my hair clients AND my store customers have blended together. New relationships and new stories have been developed. I can honestly say that, at 60 years old, I love my work and I relish going into my shop every day! The space I've created is so lovely \u2014 and so are my clients!

Raw Food /Yoga Retreat s with Michigan 's Favorite Raw Lif estyle Expert The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 47 Grace Morand, Salon Vertigo Grace Morand grew up in Detroit and attended Marygrove College there. She came to Ann Arbor in 1976 when she transferred to the University of Michigan, where she studied English and drama. Grace got into hair styling when her friend, actress and former hair stylist Sandy Storrer, encouraged her to go to beauty school \u2014 because, Sandy said, doing hair is \"creative, satisfying, good money, and the scheduling makes it really flexible for artists.\" So in 1985, Grace became a hair stylist and also joined the acclaimed singing trio, The Chenille Sisters. She eventually took a 16-year hiatus from doing hair to tour full-time with the Chenilles. Grace has been a stylist at Salon Vertigo for five years and has also worked at Vicki's Wash and Wear Haircuts. The Chenilles continue to record CDs and perform concerts locally and around the country. The thing I have loved about being a \"hair healer\" is getting to know my clients. I feel like I'm family to most of them. Some of my clients spend more time with me in a given year than they do with extended family members. I hear people's secrets and I maintain strict stylist-client confidentiality. I know their dreams, their family stories, their pet stories and lots and lots about their lives. The talking and laughing and bonding that we do at each appointment are part of the package for both of us. We grow close and I end up loving my clients. I also hear deathbed, divorce, addiction, and family crisis stories. There is a trust that I feel honored to have won from people who share these intimate and sometimes painful moments. The sharing, both joyful and sad, is healing for my clients and me. I feel privileged to be a part of their lives. My favorite stories from clients are the ones about them falling in love. It' s amazing to work with someone who gives you monthly installments about a blooming relationship. I get a wonderful, vicarious thrill from it! I have one woman who just got engaged and I've been listening to her story since the moment she met her husband-to-be. I just did a bride's hair on her wedding day and it was delightful to be a part of that joy. It's all about love. Everything \u2014 even doing people's hair \u2014 is all about love. We can offer loving energy to each other in every interaction we have. I also understand how much our hair is a part of our self-image and that when we don't like our hair, or even just are having a day where we think our hair looks good or bad, it really affects us. I can help people with that. That's pretty powerful! When my clients come to me, I try to give them a space and a period of time where they can just be \u2014 they can just feel however they feel, and be OK. But we also play in our salon. I love that. Sometimes I wear a tiara. Sometimes we have little parties right while we're working. Each of my co-workers is a little off-center, a little eccentric, and our salon has a very comfortable vibe. I've had clients say they could just hang around all day! One of the things that I have been amused by for years now is the way that my clients describe how their hair looks, or how they want it not to look. One woman thought she looked like Davey Jones from The Monkees and wanted me to fix that. Another complained that she had \"Elvis on the top and Colonel Sanders on the sides.\" I assured her, when I was done, that both Elvis and the Colonel had left the building! I've had to fix someone's hair who got it cut elsewhere and thought she ended up looking like the mom from \"The Brady Bunch\" television show. She actually did. I asked one of my young clients how she'd like her hair, and she replied that, when she skips, she wants it to be \"bouncy.\" A five-year old girl once came to see me with her Mom and was very proud that she was going to tell me exactly what she wanted. They had made a deal that if she could brush her own hair, she could decide how she wanted it. So she told me that she didn't want a big haircut, just to cut the \"scrips.\" I told her that I didn't know what \"scrips\" were. She said, \"You know how when you have a spiral notebook and you can rip out a page with a straight edge, but you leave all those curly bits of paper? Those curly parts are scrips. That's how much I want you to cut off.\" I was so impressed that a child who is too young to even understand measurements could give me such a precise image of an amount! I told her I understood exactly what she wanted, but I had never heard the word before. She said that was because she had made it up. My all-time favorite was the woman who said, \"Please don't make me look like a Republican.\" The funniest thing of all is that, somehow, I am able to translate these instructions into a hairstyle that pleases them! Seeing people on such a regular basis is a real slice of life. I know their ups and downs and I watch them grow and change. It's pretty fascinating. What we're doing with their hair is just the icing on the cake. Salon Vertigo is located at 212 S. 4th Ave., Ann Arbor, 734-930-6656. It's all about love.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 48 Story and Photos by Sarah Rigg Making products and businesses more eco-friendly has become a popular movement across the U.S. in the last decade or so, but the beauty industry has been slower than others to adopt \"green\" practices, \u2014 perhaps because chemical services have, historically, been so central to the hair styling and cosmetic business. Still, if you want to go to a green salon or hair stylist, then southeast Michigan in general \u2014 and Washtenaw County specifically \u2014 are great places to find them. In interviewing salon owners and stylists who are making an effort to \"go green,\" what I heard over and over again was that it's not enough to read the label on a beauty product. Seeing \"organic\" or \"natural\" on the package isn't enough to guarantee you're using a green product \u2014 you must check the list of ingredients carefully as well. The same could be said about stylists and salons. Many businesses these days advertise themselves as \"organic\" or \"eco-friendly,\" but, when it comes to hair and beauty services, exactly what those terms mean can vary greatly from salon to salon. Locally, some salons are using mostly traditional products and techniques, but they are \"going green\" by making their buildings more energy-efficient, reducing paper waste, and increasing recycling efforts. Other salons focus on using products with more organic ingredients and less harsh chemicals. Some salons promote using less of the hair care products or offer no chemical services at all. Here is a representative sample of various salons and their philosophies. Identity Salon & Spa 326 W. Liberty, Ann Arbor 734-929-5378 www.wix.com/identitysalon/identityaa Anna Daigle, a stylist at Identity Salon & Spa, calls herself a \"hair stylist with an interest in, and knowledge of, 'green' beauty solutions.\" \"My interest in natural beauty care began when I worked as a sales rep for Equal Exchange, a fair trade coffee company,\" Daigle said. \"I sold our products to natural food stores and eventually became aware that natural cosmetics exist for the same reasons that natural and organic food exists: human and environmental health and ethics.\"When she's not at the salon, Daigle is pursuing an MBA at Eastern Michigan University and said she hopes, one day, to go into sales and marketing for a natural beauty care company. \"I need to feel good about what I'm selling and feel I'm selling something that's benefiting society to some degree,\" Daigle said. Identity Salon does not bill itself as a green salon, but Daigle' s sympathies lie in that direction. The salon carries Redken products as its primary hair care line, but they also carry Isvara Organics, Daigle said. Daigle is interested in organic products both for environmental and health reasons. \"Personal health ties directly into environmental health,\" Daigle said, adding that she's concerned about the cumulative effect of harsh chemicals in and on the body. \"Anything you put on your skin or rub into your scalp potentially has cumulative effects,\" she said. \"There's evidence that suggests some ingredients (in traditional hair care products) are strong allergens or even carcinogenic. I realized there were healthy alternatives to skin and hair care.\" Daigle said her goal is not to preach to clients about these alternatives, but to educate them so they can make informed decisions about hair care and beauty products. \"For example, if a woman comes in to get her hair colored, I will explain how demi-permanent hair color is gentler than permanent color. Additionally, I always tell my clients about Organic Bliss, a local store that offers all kinds of products for the eco-friendly lifestyle.\" Daigle said her personal philosophy is \"beauty in balance with nature.\"When they're at home, Daigle said clients can make their hair care routines more eco-friendly by using shampoos manufactured without parabens, sulfates, and sodium. \"Sulfates\" and \"sodium\" are actually two dif ferent names for the same problematic ingredient: sodium lauryl sulfate. Both that ingredient and parabens are harsh and can cause irritation at high concentrations, especially in people with sensitive skin. Also, parabens can be hormone disrupters and are toxic and irritating. \"If you're not ready to make the jump, alternate your conventional shampoo with your sulfate- and paraben-free alternative. More salon-quality brands are offering safer alternatives, so ask your stylist.\" ____________________ Be Hair Now 202 Miller Road, Ann Arbor 734-260-0629 www.behairnow.com Jeanne Adwani, owner of Be Hair Now, says that her efforts to be green are a work in progress. \"I'm not as green as I want to be or could be,\" Adwani said. \"However, I don't do permanent waves, and I try to be mindful of usage of all products in the salon. Less toxic is always better.\"Eco-Friendly Hair Salons Great Places to Find a Green Salon or Hair Stylist Anna Daigle, a stylist at Identity Salon, said her goal is not to preach to clients about [green product] alternatives, but to educate them so they can make informed decisions about hair care and beauty products. \"Sodium lauryl sulfate...and parabens are harsh and can cause irritation at high concentrations, especially in people with sensitive skin. Also, parabens can be hormone disrupters and are toxic and irritating.\" \u2014 Anna Daigle The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 49 Adwani said that living in Ann Arbor, she has to be conscious of these issues. \"Having a salon in a place like Ann Arbor, where people ask questions about what goes in, on, and around their environment, instills a certain kind of consciousness about those things for me,\" she said. \"I investigate what products I use and try my hardest to get as 'green' as I can. I do use hair color, and I can't get away from having certain (ingredients) in hair color to make it work.\" Adwani said she uses a no-ammonia color, so that neither she nor her clients have to inhale the fumes. She also carries products that use essential oils for their scents or include natural ingredients like organic aloe vera or bee propolis. Adwani added that she reads labels to make sure the products she uses regularly are free of the most toxic and damaging chemicals. \"Saying something is 'organic' does not make the entire composition of a product 'organic.' There's lots of reading between the lines,\" Adwani said. She guaranteed, however, that all the salon's products are \"free of animal experimentation.\" Adwani also credits two other stylists who work out of her salon with developing their own green measures. \"Karin [Lindstrom] doesn't put hair color directly on the scalp. Andrea [McCuiston] uses paper for laying in her highlights. We all try to be mindful.\" Adwani said that it has been harder to make her salon - once a 1920s gas station \u2014 a green building. \"It's not at all energy efficient,\" she said. \"A lot of my energy went into finding the best ways I could make this old building efficient without spending a lot of money.\" She said she did a lot of research about lighting, for instance, and 90 percent of the lighting in the salon is from energy-efficient LED bulbs. Also, she has made improvements to the heating and cooling system.\"We also try to clean with products that are not toxic,\" Adwani said. She's also conscious of the three R's of sustainability: reducing, reusing, and recycling. \"I have a space in my salon to resell 'collectables',\" she said. \"So this little shop within my little shop helps me a bit financially and supports my treasure-hunting skills - it's another way to recycle.\" Adwani said her overall philosophy is \"to be mindful.\"\"I try to be mindful of my impact on family, friends, work, the environment, my health, and the well-being of others,\" she said. \"I have learned that asking questions is the best way for me to find answers that work for me and the best way to support others in finding their own answers that work for them,\" she said. In the future, Adwani said she wants to implement a process that would allow clients to come in and refill their products rather than having to purchase small bottles over and over again. \"I hope to carry my products in bulk,\" she said. \"This should bring all our costs down and be more environmentally friendly.\" Adwani suggests that clients can make their home hair care routines more green by recycling their bottles and reading labels. ____________________ Serendipity Salon 322 S. Ashley, Ann Arbor 734-213-5945 www.a2serendipity.com Renay McMullan, owner of Serendipity Salon, said she definitely considers herself eco-friendly, from the way her building was rehabbed to her no-shampoo philosophy. She said the building on South Ashley that houses the salon was shut for many years and, when she decided to rehab it, she used the Habitat for Humanity ReStore and the ReUse Center to purchase her countertops, sinks, desk, and coffee-serving station. She decorated using low-VOC (low-fume) paint, uses organic cleaning products to maintain the salon, and puts clipped hair outside for the birds to use as nesting material. She said her salon is able to use almost entirely organic and natural materials for skin and hair care, because she doesn't focus on commercial product lines. For instance, Serendipity's esthetician (skin care therapist) uses fresh fruits and vegetables on clients' skin. For instance, she might peel and grind a papaya to use as a face mask, or use a sugar scrub as an exfoliant, rather than using a bottled product. \"Saying something is 'organic' does not make the entire composition of a product 'organic.' There's lots of reading between the lines,\" says Jeanne Adwani, owner of Be Hair Now. Renay McMullan, owner of Serendipity Salon, said more people would have better hair if they thought of it as a beautiful, delicate fabric and treated it more gently. \"You wouldn't take something like silk and use Tide and then throw it in the dryer.\" \"Curly girls are very product-knowledgeable, usually. They come to me because I'm committed to their curl. I won't straighten it or iron it. I tell them: straighten your mind, not your hair!\" \u2014 Renay McMullan Continued from page 50Additionally, McMullan espouses a no-shampoo philosophy. \"I am committed to not using shampoo, and I'm committed for reasons beyond the ingredients.\" She said that many people don't realize that conditioners do a perfectly good job of cleansing hair. McMullan seeks out hair products that are sulfate- and sodium-free, and said more people would have better hair if they thought of it as a beautiful, delicate fabric and treated it more gently. \"You wouldn't take something like silk and use Tide and then throw it in the dryer,\" she said. \"Hair is a delicate substance, and I encourage my clients to keep their hair care routine as natural as they can. If your hair is healthy, everyone thinks it's beautiful, no matter what length it is.\" McMullan said one of her specialties is catering to women with naturally curly hair. \"Curly girls are very product-knowledgeable, usually,\" she said. \"They come to me because I'm committed to their curl. I won't straighten it or iron it. I tell them: straighten your mind, not your hair!\" Another thing that sets Serendipity apart is McMullan's dog, Iggy \u2014 a rescue dog who was badly abused before coming to live with her\u2014 who serves as a \"greeter\" at the salon. She also allows and even encourages clients to bring their own pooches into the salon. She said her natural approach \"works well in Ann Arbor.\"\"A woman once said I was the Birkenstock of hairdressers, and I couldn't have gotten a higher compliment,\" McMullan said. ____________________ Salon Vertigo 212 S. 4th Ave., Ann Arbor 734-930-6656 www.salonvertigo.com For Grace Morand, a stylist at Salon Vertigo, offering more eco-friendly products and services is just a way to give clients more choices. \"We're offering an option \u2014 that's our philosophy,\" Morand said.Morand said Salon Vertigo was already doing eco-friendly things when she started to work there, and she felt the \"fit was good.\" \"One thing I really like about the salon is the incredible ventilation system. Anything that's stinky goes away fast, which I appreciate. Also, they are involved in the Waste Knot program, and they are all about recycling. In that sense, they're very green,\" Morand said.Waste Knot is a program of the Washtenaw County Division of Public Works that recognizes Washtenaw County businesses, schools, and nonprofits that show leadership in waste reduction and energy conservation. Morand said she is also careful in her choice of products. \"I feel like, for my health and the health of clients, it's nice to use lower-impact products with less toxicity,\" Morand said. The salon offers several lines of organic or less-toxic beauty products, including a vegan nail care line and eco-friendly hair coloring products. Morand, who is also a vocalist with local music group The Chenille Sisters, said she got into hair dressing because she enjoys doing creative work; however, she didn't start thinking about the harsh chemicals in traditional salon products until she started getting sick a lot. \"I started reading about the impact of environmental toxins, and when I cut back my exposure to colors and perms, I felt better,\" Morand said. \"So I felt, okay, there's something to this for me.\" Morand said she liked less exposure to toxins but didn't want to give up hair color and other standard salon services altogether, so she experimented on herself. \"I was continuing to color my own hair and looking for natural alternatives,\" she said. As she found what worked for her, she'd mention it to clients as well. She said many of her clients want to live and eat clean, but they also feel stressed about going gray. \"If they don't want to go gray, it's nice to have a (less toxic) alternative,\" she said. \"And I test everything on myself and friends first.\" To make clients' home hair care routines more eco-friendly, Morand recommends starting with something simple: just use less of each product. \"With shampoo and styling products, people use too much,\" she said. \"With a lot of styling products, they glop it on their heads when they could get by with a little dot the size of a chocolate chip. I tell them that, with the organic and less-toxic products, they'll pay a little bit more but you can use a whole lot less.\" She also advises women wash their hair less often. \"Most people don't need to wash every day.\" Morand said she tries not to be \"rigid\" in her avoidance of harsh chemicals. She does use more earth-friendly cleaning products and make organic choices when she can, but, for instance, if there's a sewer leak in her home, she's going to clean it with bleach. Similarly, she said she's not willing to sacrifice salon quality just so she can say she's using greener products.

What 'wash and wear haircut' means is that I cut people's hair to do what it does inherently,\" said Vicki Honeyman, owner of Vicki's Wash and Wear Haircuts ...While she doesn't specifically market herself as green, people who are concerned about toxins tend to find her through recommendations from friends and family. \"No matter how 'hippy granola' someone is, they don't want to pay salon prices and not have their gray covered.\" \u2014 Grace Morand Vicki's Wash and Wear Haircuts 207 E. Ann St., Ann Arbor 734-663-4247http://heavenlymetal.com/about/ Vicki Honeyman's no-chemical approach to hair styling is one of the most radical approaches of all the stylists I talked to, and yet she is hesitant to label herself a \"green\" stylist. \"It's just what I've always done,\" she said. \"I didn't choose to not wash people's hair as a statement about the environment \u2014 that's just the way I work.\" Honeyman said she grew up cutting her brothers' hair and later cut friends' hair in college. Her academic training was in film, and she had several jobs around the state relating to film - including running the Ann Arbor Film Festival out of the space in the front of her salon where she now sells gift items, called Heavenly Metal \u2014 but word always got out that she also gave great haircuts. She finally went to beauty school so she could become licensed, but said she never had any intention of doing chemical services. \"I might have had to wrap a perm once in beauty school, but I managed mostly to avoid it. I just had to prove I could do it when I took the state exam,\" she said. \"I don't do any chemical services, and I don't wash or blow dry ,\" she said. \"What 'wash and wear haircut' means is that I cut people's hair to do what it does inherently. I don't try to make it do something it won't do. And I don't wash people's hair because I like to see what their hair is doing; if it's wet, I can't see the curl or lack of curl. I chose not to do chemical services when I first went into business because I didn't want to be around those chemicals. And my clients are people who don't wish to be around anyone else having that done or around those odors.\" Honeyman said she never worried about whether her philosophy would bring her business or not. \"I've always been very simple about hair cutting. That's what my clientele want. I never really worried about whether the business would be a go,\" she said. \"Not everybody wants to go to a salon where there are chemical smells and the sounds of hairdryers and loud Top 40s music.\" Instead, Honeyman said she aims to create a pleasant and down-to-earth environment for her clients, an atmosphere that's \"chemical-free, with good music and good company.\" Honeyman said that while she doesn't specifically market herself as green, people who are concerned about toxins tend to find her through recommendations from friends and family. \"I certainly get people who come in who are chemically sensitive and hear about me through word of mouth,\" she said. Honeyman said she knows \"almost immediately\" how she is going to cut someone's hair when they walk in. She asks them about their lifestyle, if they have a job where they need to look very professional and polished or if they can get away with a wilder look, but she can immediately picture what would look best on a client from the texture of the hair and the shape of the head. For Honeyman, being green is not what she takes most pride in.\"Most people come to me because they've seen a haircut I've done or they've heard someone talking about me,\" she said. \"People hear about me because they hear I do good haircuts.\" ____________________ When products can't be found [for Douglas J Aveda salons] that are \"green\" or made out of recycled materials, they try to...get green in other ways. For instance, their line of hairsprays is made in a facility that is 100-percent powered by wind generators.Douglas J eXchange Aveda Salon 500 E. Liberty St., Ann Arbor 734-222-5416 www.douglasj.com The Douglas J Aveda salons around Michigan, including the Douglas J eXchange in Ann Arbor, are all independent and family-run but are \"under the Aveda umbrella,\" according to Peter Eichler, event and promotion coordinator for Douglas J. \"We're very concerned about the environment,\" Eichler said. \"There's a strong initiative within Aveda corporate \u2014 they pride themselves on using materials that are eighty- to ninety-percent post-consumer materials.\" Eichler said that when products can't be found that are \"green\" or made out of recycled materials, they try to \"think outside the box\" and get green in other ways. For instance, their line of hairsprays are made in a facility that is 100-percent powered by wind generators, a more environmentally friendly way of generating power. He said the Douglas J salons use \"plant- and mineral-based products, and we pride ourselves on using all-natural materials in our products.\" For instance, in the facial care line, the salicylic acid used to exfoliate is derived from wintergreen, Eichler said. Additionally, Eichler said that the Douglas J salons and beauty schools have a tradition of giving back to the community. They hold fundraisers and make donations toward juvenile diabetes and breast cancer research, and they hold an Earth Month campaign each year. Recently, the focus has been on the Great Lakes and water concerns. Eichler said that, in 2010, eight locations raised almost $40,000 to benefit the Alliance for the Great Lakes. This year, the salons are hoping to put on an eco-friendly fashion show, \"Catwalk for Water,\" an idea generated by Douglas J employees in Michigan. Other eco-friendly measures include using energy-efficient appliances and lighting, and using less paper. For instance, prospective beauty school students are directed to online resources rather than being sent packets of printed information. Sarah Heath, salon director for the Douglas J eXchange Salon in Ann Arbor, said she was trained at a Douglas J school and \"fell in love with the way they took care of their communities, as well as the guests that were walking through the door.\" \"Our salon carries all Aveda hair, skin care, and make-up products. Our salon uses all energy-efficient light bulbs as well as recycles pretty much everything that can be recycled. We even give our guests the opportunity to bring in bottle caps from home, and we recycle them as well,\" Heath said. To make their home hair care routines more eco-friendly, Heath said that guests should use less product, because the paraben-free Aveda products are highly concentrated. She also suggests that guests \"commit to washing their hair every other day or when needed, which helps to cut down on energy and water usage.\" ###\"I never really worried about whether the business would be a go.

I've included it here in my book reviews for families because of how well-used it has been in my own kitchen for the past year! My son has a wheat sensitivity, which has made buying traditional snack foods and baking difficult. What used to be an easy snack of a bagel or pretzels became off-limits for us, until a friend of mine who is challenged with the same issues recommended Judy Sauer's book. This simple spiral-bound book has become a mainstay for us! Judy uses brown rice flour in most of her recipes, instead of the standard potato starch, tapioca starch, and other \"filler\" flours often used in gluten-free cookbooks. Her more than 70 recipes are diverse are delicious, and many are sugar-free. I've tried at least half of them, and even my extended family has loved them - without guessing they are wheat-free. My family's favorites include Corn Bread, Sugar-Topped Oat Muffins, Cinnamon Scones, and Herbed Rice Cakes Bites.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 53 By Lisa Inoue, LMSW It's not so easy to remain wedded to the highest parenting standards when your first-grader has just crushed the feelings of his best friend. While picking up my son from daycare, I witnessed him disparage the artwork on a holiday card that his best friend had diligently created just for him. \"Shabby\" was the word that he used. I was floored \u2014 and my first instinct was to insist that my unfeeling son grovel at the feet of his friend for forgiveness! Not to mention, seeing the expression of pain and disbelief in the other child's face made me really question myself as a parent. The critical self-doubt and judgments came fast and furious. Had I raised this ungrateful art critic? Where had I gone wrong in instilling empathy into my six-year-old son? I, a therapist who prides myself on helping children feel safe and understood, have raised a son who tramples on the feelings of little children who are trying to please him! Okay, okay. So, in the car, I took some deep breaths and tried to slow down the internal onslaught of anger and criticism. I tried to remember what I coach parents to do all the time in my \"Mindful Parenting\" group: Be compassionate and accepting of your own feelings. After all, I can't help my son manage his reactions when I'm still all up in arms. What needs compassion and acceptance? Oh yeah - my feelings of disappointment that my kid has just done something that makes ME feel like I'm a bad parent. Ah ha, so this is really about me! I'm really feeling a sense of shame that my child has behaved in a way that runs so counter to my own moral values. So that helps some, although I still don't like what he did. Why DID he do that? Now I'm starting to get curious, because I know he's normally not out to traumatize others. It's a lot easier for me to become inquisitive about his motivations (and to be more realistic about his capabilities) once I can recognize my own feelings about messing up as a parent - and get beyond them. Does this sound familiar? Few parents avoid the disappointment that, at some point, our child isn't kind, smart, pretty, or athletic enough. Or maybe the disappointment is even more severe, i.e., you've got a kid who' s stealing, getting high, failing classes, or getting into fights. Parenting in these instances can feel worse than disappointing - it can feel like sheer drudgery and hopelessness. So how does a mindful parenting stance help, when the problems are so big it feels like there's no chance they'll ever get any better? Mindful parenting isn't a set of prescribed approaches to misbehavior and conflict. Rather, it's an approach to help parents develop their ability to be more aware of what's happening inside of themselves \u2014 their emotional reactions that can get in the way of responding effectively. Using a mindful approach to parenting challenges us to see clearly, with nonjudgmental awareness, whatever is kicking our butts in the present moment: the \"full catastrophe,\" as mindfulness meditation expert Jon Kabat-Zinn might say . Whether it's as simple as your child hurting someone else's feelings or as complicated as your teenager threatening to run away, being consciously aware of your own emotions needs to happen first. Only then does it become possible to listen calmly and respond constructively. Otherwise, we merely get swept away in the ensuing chaos of our thoughts, feelings, emotions, and memories, which then affect our equally emotionally bombarded child. It's also helpful to realize the connection to older wounds that your emotions may bring up with the buttons that are getting pushed. The anger drew my attention first; however, shame was really at the core of it \u2014 i.e., feeling like a bad parent = being a bad person. This reminded me of my old family-of-origin issues, such as feeling at fault when others are upset. By using meditation and other mindfulness methods, parents can more easily see through the repetitive conflicts they have with their children. This assists parents in hearing and understanding their children with greater clarity , allowing for more skillful responses to solving problems. Applied mindfulness methods that I have used and recommend include: Deep listening (meditative listening, listening with full attention), walking meditation, taking mindful moments throughout the day, and attuned observation of your child during relaxed moments. The nonjudgmental part of mindfulness is tricky for most people. W e all have a hard time acknowledging that our emotional responses are merely information, not truths about who we are as people and parents. I didn't want to think that my son was a \"mean\" kid (and the corollary that I was a \"bad\" parent). Once I was able to recognize what I felt and that it was okay to feel that way, then I was finally able to make sense of the situation. Then I was able to compassionately help my son understand his own responses to his friend \u2014 and how to repair the relationship after messing up. As it turns out, my son's critique of the other child's card came from his obsession with space exploration and rockets \u2014 the subject of the artwork on the card. It really bothered him that someone drew a rocket that wasn't quite accurate. Once I was able to empathize with him, I could explain how someone might feel if their work was criticized in this way. I know that my son \"got\" this, because he was very worried that this friend would not play with him the next day, and he wrote her a card with an apology in it. Because he was so nervous about how she would receive his apology , I took him to school the next day and helped him give her the card. All was well after that. Once our own emotions have been attended to, we can usually be more empathic and openly curious in response to our kids. Not that cultivating empathy and curiosity will prevent all difficulty, but it creates the possibility of reconnecting with our children and helping them to make sense of the emotional hurricane happening inside them. In essence, our ability to clearly see and understand our children is based on having access to a calm place within us first, which can be accessed through compassionate, nonjudgmental responses to ourselves. Given that my son is only six, I'm sure I'll have plenty of opportunities to practice! ### Lisa Inoue, LMSW, co-facilitates a Mindful Parenting group with Robert Martin, MS, LMSW on Saturdays at Ann Arbor Consultation Services.

Crazy Wisdom Journal readers are probably familiar with Linda Diane Feldt. Not only is she well known in the area as an herbalist, teacher , author, and massage/polarity/cranio-sacral therapist, she is also president of the People's Food Co-op. What people may not be aware of is her exceptional work involving mothers and infants. Feldt believes that new mothers, and parents in general, deserve all the help and support possible. Her approach is preventive; she has seen great value in \"early and appropriate gentle intervention in a delivery or newborn issue.\" There is energy in birth, she says, which we must be sensitive to. \"A birth should be honored as a sacred, unprecedented experience that is both natural and normal.\" One of the ways in which Feldt can be useful in a birth is with cranio-sacral therapy. Feldt studied with John Upledger, who developed a standardized research method for making such assessments. Often, Feldt notes, babies who are experiencing difficulties breastfeeding are experiencing treatable issues. Sometimes a child will not \"latch on\" because of tension or trauma to the membranes of the skull during birth. \"Mild trauma might not be perceptible,\" she notes, and so to alleviate the problem, Feldt performs cranio-sacral therapy (CST). Cranio-sacral therapy works by relaxing and re-synchronizing the cerebrospinal fluid and its motion in the membrane system. A newborn CST session can minimize or eliminate the repercussions of difficult births, such as a c-section or long labor, and help restore good health to well babies, according to CSTdoula.com. The therapist monitors the cranio-sacral rhythm with her hands. She corrects sources of pain and dysfunction with subtle manipulation techniques. These procedures do not hurt, but Feldt says she can see the results immediately . \"When the baby is put back to the breast, mothers notice the dif ference.\" It is a one-time intervention, correcting the problem and allowing the bonding process to continue. Feldt has attended almost 200 births in the Ann Arbor area. She provides support for both mother and child. She sees her role as doing body work and physical support. She also works with labor progression problems. \"W e don't try to manipulate the baby into changing position,\" she says, but with subtle suggestions help the child decide that turning to a more positive birth position is the right thing to do. Feldt has been a part of most aspects of the birthing process: assisting during labor and delivery, teaching infant massage, and helping women with questions of diet and herbs, both before and after birth. Feldt's accomplishments are manifold and quite varied. Her teaching activities span nearly three decades and currently include: serving as a health teacher at the Rudolf Steiner High School of Ann Arbor and as an adjunct instructor in Pharmacy at University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, teaching monthly herbal classes for The People's Food Co-op, and offering classes and workshops through the Ann Arbor Center for Holistic Health and Traditional Wisdom, to name a few. Feldt is also the author of three books, Massage: Learning to Give and Receive , Dying Again: Thirteen Years of Writing and Waiting , and Spinach and Beyond: Loving Life and Dark Green Leafy Vegetables.For much more information on her classes, biography, philosophy and private practice, please see Feldt's website at www.holisticwisdom.org.Breastfeeding a new infant is a healthy, practical, and rewarding experience that creates a strong bond between mother and child . Some new mothers, however, do not have that option, because of health problems either of the mother or of the child, as in the case of an ill or high-risk child. Sometimes even bottle-feeding is not a solution because of formula intolerance. However, there are in the United States eleven programs, called milk banks, affiliated with the Human Milk Bank Association of North America, where stored breast milk is available for purchase. These banks are supplied in part by milk depots, places where women who express extra milk can bring that milk for collection, storage, and later use by others. The Breastfeeding Clinic of Ann Arbor (BFCAA) provides such a collection place. Established in 2005 by BFCAA Director Barbara Robertson, the milk depot screens potential donors, organizes milk collection, and sends collected milk to Bronson Hospital in Kalamazoo, where the only milk bank in Michigan is located. Expressed milk is pasteurized and cultures are taken to screen for bacteria. Milk remains frozen until needed. In the absence of mother's own milk, donor milk offers many benefits, including optimal nutrition, easy digestability, and immunological protection against disease. Human milk can also protect immature tissue, promote healing of tissue damaged by infection, and promote maturation, particularly in the gastro-intestinal tract. Crazy Wisdom Kids in the CommunityNew, Fun, and Just Plain Cool Linda Feldt, who has been a pillar of the holistic community in Ann Arbor for 3 decades, is less well- known for her exceptional work with births, infants, and new moms. Her cranio-sacral therapy sessions with newborns can minimize or eliminate the repercussions of difficult births, such as c-section or long labor, and help restore good health to well babies. The Breastfeeding Clinic of Ann Arbor (BFCAA) was established in 2005 by Barbara Robertson. \"I am an educator and a communicator,\" Robertson says, \"helping moms feel cared for.\" She notes that sometimes she functions like a detective, helping mothers find solutions to common nursing problems such as latching on, sore nipples, or milk slow to come in... Photo by Amy HogaThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 55 Standards for being a milk donor are strict. Those interested must be disease free, drug free (including free of prescribed medications and vitamins), be non-smokers, and live a healthy lifestyle. Donors are asked to submit to a blood test and go through an interviewing process. Banked milk is not only for infants, but is also used by some cancer patients fighting nausea and by organ donor recipients. Milk is only available through prescription, and it is expensive, says Robertson: $4 an ounce or more. Unfortunately, it is not necessarily covered by health insurance. Breastfeeding, for various reasons, is a good choice for the optimal health of a growing baby. At least six months of nursing is recommended for new infants, says Robertson. The American Association of Pediatricians suggests 12 months is even better, and the World Health organization advocates breastfeeding one's child for two years. Besides the health benefits for the child, benefits accrue for mothers as well. According to Robertson, women with six to seven years of breastfeeding (multiple children) can see a decrease in certain cancers, including breast cancer. Nursing can also help with gestational diabetes. Of course, there are social and emotional benefits for both mom and baby: breastfeeding helps shape parenting responses and create a loving bond between mother and child. Robertson adds that mothers \"have to stay tuned in to their children; they have to pay attention, if they are to be successful.\" Robertson has in place at the BFCAA classes and products that support women in this experience. She teaches classes for parents, runs support groups, trains professionals, and is in private practice as a board-certified lactation consultant. \"I am an educator and a communicator,\" Robertson says, \"helping moms feel cared for.\" She notes that sometimes she functions like a detective, helping mothers find solutions to common nursing problems such as latching on, sore nipples, or milk slow to come in.

Traverwood Library in northeast Ann Arbor will be the scene on June 28 of a special Gari Stein class for grandparents and young ones called Rock-A-Bye Grandbaby. Gari Stein is an educator, speaker, and performer who is known and loved by Ann Arbor toddlers and their parents for her acclaimed \"Music for Little Folks\" classes. This one-time-only class, for one hour beginning at 2 p.m., is for grandparents, parents, and children from infants to preschoolers. The purpose of the class is to introduce families to the wonderful experience of making music together. Participants will learn simple activities to engage their little ones: dancing with scarves to Mozart, shaking maracas, singing songs for daily routines, and rocking to lullabies. Stein, whose \"Music for Little Folks\" classes for babies, toddlers, and small children have been a mainstay of the Ann Arbor kids' scene for 20 years, says this class is a wonderful way to \"enhance your bond with your grandchild and create life-long memories, while experiencing the joy of making music together.\" She notes that babies are \"born seemingly pre-wired for music, and [they] learn through movement.\" \"speaks what can't be expressed,\" she adds. \"It soothes the mind, provides rest, and heals the heart, while it flows through the body, mind, and soul.\" Stein herself is an educator with over 30 years of experience in the field of Early Childhood Education. She travels to conduct workshops around the country and takes her classes into day care programs and preschools, as well as running a community music program. She is the author of the book The More We Get Together: Nurturing Relationships Through Music, Play Books, and Art. One of Stein's goals is to help adults find their singing voices and dancing feet as they incorporate music into children's programs. She notes, \"Music brings joy to young children. It enhances their sense of self, positively af fects their behavior, and strengthens their comfort in social settings.\" In her classes, children are exposed to many styles of music, from classical to cajun to Broadway. Music stimulates the brain and helps facilitate learning, she says. \"It enriches all areas of development \u2014 physical, social, emotional, cognitive, aesthetic, linguistic, and spiritual. It decreases stress, increases energy, and brings people together.\" Stein can be reached at 734-741-1510 or interested persons can view her website at www.little-folks-music.com.What's In Your Cart? is an innovative health education program for children and their families that serves to answer the proverbial question, \"What's for dinner?\" (and breakfast, lunch or snack). The program, tailored to groups or individuals, takes the guesswork out of figuring out how to eat healthily by introducing children to reading food labels, understanding the healthy food pyramid guidelines, and finding a way through the decision-making process that goes on when one pushes the cart around the grocery store. What's In Your Cart? was developed three years ago out of the private practice of Stacy Goldberg, graduate of the University of Michigan School of Nursing with a master's in administration from the UM School of Public Health. Goldberg was looking for an opportunity to take the educational process out of the clinical setting, and she worked out an arrangement with Plum Market stores in West Bloomfield and Bloomfield. She is seeking to expand into the Ann Arbor area. It works like this: Children and their parents are given store tours that provide the context for a discussion of nutrition. On a typical tour, Goldberg begins with a survey of eating habits to gather information on how the children currently eat. Then, with dietary analysis in hand, Goldberg takes the clients around the store, helping them make good food choices out of the available products. In designing her tours, Goldberg keeps at the forefront the criteria from Plum Market's lifestyle enrichment program, called the Functional Five \u2014 Wellness, Nutrient Density, Caloric Integrity, Taste, and Sustainability. Tours can be structured around food allergies or intolerances as well, so that people coping with eating challenges can gain more insight into managing their diets. In addition, tours can be adjusted to fit any age group. Goldberg serves community and service groups as well, such as scouting troops and school classes. The typical tour lasts one to one-and-a-half hours, and ranges in price from $150 per hour for private tours ($300 with added nutritional analysis) to $25 per person for group tours. Goldberg notes that her advice works from mainstream principles and then is tailored as needed to fit the requirements of other kinds of diets, including vegan, vegetarian, or raw food preferences.

Continued on page 56The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 56 On a recent tour with a Girl Scout troop in West Bloomfield, for example, children shared a healthy snack, discussed the food pyramid, explored various fruits and vegetables, and learned how to \"eat the rainbow\" (select nutritious foods with a wide variety of colors). \"We give children and their parents a method and a plan to follow in the store, instead of wandering the aisles confused by the many choices,\" says Goldberg. In addition to grocery tours at Plum Market for What's In Your Cart?, Goldberg consults both nationally and internationally for food companies, restaurants, bakeries, or anyone wanting nutritional analysis or recipe modifications.

According to Tom Egan, executive director of the Sanctuary, activities will be geared to offer children \"an opportunity for deeper connection with nature, to others, and to themselves.\" In this extraordinary natural area, children are invited to slow down and experience the rhythm of the surroundings, which include prairies, hayfields, woods, and a wetland. At the same time, there will be opportunity for creative engagement with, and reflection on, children's relationship to wind, plants, and animals. The setting provides a pace for families to enjoy each other, while also nurturing a sense of connection to the Earth. Grass Lake Sanctuary was founded in 2007 by a group of interested people who worked to ensure this unique piece of natural land was preserved. The land was purchased from the late Dr. Clark Spike, a retired chemistry professor at Eastern Michigan University who had spent 38 years sculpting the landscape according to the way it \"spoke to him\" on his daily walks through the property. Part of the Sanctuary's vision is to offer retreat space, medical after-care, and healthy living programs where people can reestablish balance and connection within their personal and natural worlds. The goal is to establish a \"culture of wellness\" via an environment that demonstrates the practicality of sustainable living. Onsite there is an outdoor kitchen, a tree house, an indoor gathering area, nut trees, an organic garden, a fruit orchard, a pond, and a boardwalk. More information, including a map of the Sanctuary, can be found by going to www.grasslakesanctuary.org. You can reach Sanctuary offices by calling 734-726-0290. You can also read the interview with Tom Egan about the Grass Lake Sanctuary that appeared in the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal in our September- December 2009 issue at: http://www.crazywisdom.net/issue43pdf/generations.pdf Camp JUMP-IN, located in the town of Hamburg, just 15 minutes north of Ann Arbor, is offering an individualized, intensive therapy day camp for children with learning disabilities and sensory processing disorders. The camp will run from July 18 to July 29 from 9 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday. Children must be at least four years of age and accompanied by a parent. Teens and young adults will also find this camp fun and beneficial.The camp will provide individualized therapy in a natural setting. The focus of the program is enhancing individual foundation and functional skills. Participants will be utilizing dynamic equipment such as the trampoline and zipline, swimming, and participating in fine-motor and visual-motor activities. Additional offerings include body work, brain gym, and opportunities for social interaction. Campers do require an evaluation prior to camp. It is recommended that campers begin a home program beforehand, so that they can receive the maximum benefit from the camp. According to Jacquelin Kilburn, camp director and owner of JUMP-IN Professional Services, the participation of parents is important. The camp also functions as a parent training experience, as well as a support system and source for networking. Parents can learn to utilize camp techniques at home to facilitate their children's development, as well as have opportunities to meet other parents facing similar issues. Camp JUMP-IN has a ratio of two or three students to one professional. The camp can accommodate eight campers. Experienced occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech therapists work at the camp. Student volunteers looking to gain practical knowledge in their field of study can also work with the program to assist campers. All of this takes place on two-and-a-half acres of rolling land with trees and soothing natural spaces located at 10400 Hamburg Road. For swimming, campers go to the Whitmore Lake High School pool. Kilburn, an occupational therapist for 40 years, with 20 years in private practice, was for six years the pediatric therapy supervisor at Mott' s Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. She says that her private practice, JUMP-IN Professional Services, is \"most rewarding...[to see] people start functioning better both academically and in their motor skills.\" Some insurance plans do cover costs for the private program. In her private practice, Kilburn works with adults as well as children in a variety of therapeutic modalities, including: Kineseotaping, which involves the use of a sticky form of Ace bandage-type tape, used to support the lymphatic system; the Wilbarger Protocol, involving a calm and soothing brushing technique, done with a specially designed brush; therapeutic listening, involving music specially formatted and played over headphones; cranio-sacral therapy; and sensory processing, among others. Recently, Kilburn hired a physical therapist to work specifically on sports performance. Using a technique called the interactive metronome, the therapist works with athletes to improve their physical abilities. A computer is used to synchronize head and foot movement to an auditory input. Kilburn notes that improvements in timing, rhythm, and response time can be shown. Athletes from fields as diverse as dance, soccer, and baseball can all benefit. This technique also facilitates improvements in academic skills, speech and language, and focus.

With names like \"Radiant Life\" and \"Sacred Breath,\" the flower essence combination sprays of Merri Walters' Great Lakes Sacred Essences entice one to try them, even without a first sniff! The sprays, part of a group of flower essence sprays and tinctures available through the company, are gifts lovingly handcrafted with intuitive guidance by Merri Walters and her husband, Robin Grossheusch. Made in Michigan, along the Great Lakes Coast and at sacred sites throughout the United States and Canada, the essences bring \"the powerful subtle healing qualities of nature\" to bottled form. On a recent rainy, early-March day, Walters sat in her softly lit office while her cat calmly slept, and explained the process by which the essences come to be and how she began to do this work. Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Camp JUMP-IN, located in the town of Hamburg, just 15 minutes north of Ann Arbor, is offering an individualized, intensive therapy day camp for children with learning disabilities and sensory processing disorders.Continued from page 55 In this extraordinary natural area [Grass Lake Sanctuary], children are invited to slow down and experience the rhythm of the surroundings, which include prairies, hayfields, woods, and a wetland.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 57 Walters had been using other people's essences in her work as a holistic health practitioner. She also says, \"raising eight children, I would have gone crazy if I did not have essences to help me through the challenges of everyday life. I never intended to make my own essences, but the spirit kept saying 'yes.' I kept resisting and then I had a few experiences, which I consider to be initiations. I was asked to make an essence at a waterfall. Then, Robin and I made a few on Lake Superior. I felt I had fulfilled this spiritual request.\" Then, one early autumn day in her Ann Arbor garden, Walters felt the spirit again, urging her to make essences from her flowers. Walters kept a cherry tree in the yard that had been dead for a year, and yet she looked up to see that it was in bloom \u2014 in mid-September. Walters kept photos of the miraculous, off-season blooms that graced the tree. And, that was not all; the crabapple tree was also blossoming, apples and blooms together. And there continued, over the next few years, to be more flower appearances \u2014 strawberry, and the time when Walters and her son Luke found thyme blossoming under five inches of snow. \"When I saw the cherry blossoms, I pushed aside all reservations,\" said Walters. She knew she would honor this calling. Walters sees the essences working in a way that speaks to each of us in the language of the primal or soul. The essences can't make one change, she notes, but they give that moment when one has a choice. \"When one takes the essence, she bypasses the analytical part of the brain and holds the problem so that it no longer produces tension. We feel a bit of peace, or react differently,\" she explains. The physical making of the essences is a spiritual calling, says W alters, which has taken her and her family on some very interesting travels. Their destinations are spirit-guided. As it says in Sacred Essence literature, \"The energetic life force of a flower, a gem, a special place, a body of water, or celestial event becomes vibrationally encoded for healing.\" When at a location, the Great Lakes Sacred Essences crew always asks permission from the flowers and from the land before taking materials and making an essence. Great Lakes Sacred Essences are made with a base of prayer-intoned spring water. The preservative in the tinctures is organic brandy, 20% alcohol by weight. Part of the process of making an essence includes Walters recording on paper what the essence is about. These descriptions accompany each essence, as one can see on their website. For example, the essence of Lake Superior Rock \"brings balance to busyness\" and is good for \"helping meet the challenges of doing so much and having to constantly reorient.\" The product is accompanied by a prose description, which says in part: These rocks hold the colors of purity...Endless calm,True color caught in form. The rainbows off the lake, the Northern lights,The Sun, the blue sky...Solid so we can hold a wave. The essence will help round your edges, And push you gently to the shoreTo rest and glimmer in the warmth of the Sun...Helps the heart to open,To release stored radianceAnd open the ancient memory of perfection in form.\"...Raising eight children, I would have gone crazy if I did not have essences to help me through the challenges of everyday life. I never intended to make my own essences, but the spirit kept saying 'yes'.\" --- Merri W alters of Great Lakes Sacred Essences Essences are available locally at Falling Water Books and Collectables, Indigo Forest: Circle of Life Natural Store, Head to Toe Therapy, and the Rudolf Steiner School Store, as well as at the website, www.sacredessences.com.

They are the authors of a new book, Emotional Muscle: Strong Parents, Strong Children . They were instrumental in the founding of the Allen Creek Pre-School, which is a laboratory for integrating psychoanalytic insight with early childhood education. The Novicks first moved to Ann Arbor 34 years ago. Jack Novick had been raised in Montreal. Kelly Novick, the daughter of legendary Hollywood actor , Gene Kelly, was raised in California and around the world. They are the parents of Rebecca, Ben and Anna, all of whom went to Ann Arbor public schools and graduated from the University of Michigan. The three are now adults, living in Berkeley, London and New York City, respectively. The Novicks have four grandchildren. Kerry Kelly Novick received degrees in Comparative Literature from the University of California at Berkeley and Psychology from University College, London. Kerry is a past President of the international Association for Child Psychoanalysis. Jack Novick received a degree in Literature and Mathematics from McGill University, his MA in Experimental Psychology from the New School for Social Research, and his PhD in Clinical Psychology from New York University. The Novicks met in London in the 1960's, where they both trained as child psychoanalysts with Anna Freud. Jack went on to do adult training at the British Psycho-Analytic Institute and Kerry at the New York Freudian Society. Long associated with the University of Michigan Medical School, they are both in clinical practice with families, children, adolescents, and adults in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Bill Zirinsky: Your new book, Emotional Muscle, is your fourth book. What were your previous books?Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: Our previous books were Fearful Symmetry: The Development and Treatment of Sadomasochism (1996, paperback 2007), Working With Parents Makes Therapy Work (2005, paperback 2011), and Good Goodbyes: Knowing How to End in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy (2006). These were all professional books, also translated into German, Italian and Finnish. Bill Zirinsky: I had never seen the phrase \"emotional muscle\" before, and I love it. Did you develop the phrase, or had it been in use within an element of the psychoanalytic community or within the child development community? Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: We invented it. We saw that parents and teachers were asking something of children that takes effort, work, persistence. This is similar to what people are doing when they learn a physical skill, mastering a sport, trade or instrument. So it came to us that people need emotional muscles, too, to be sturdy and fit to face life' s challenges and master the steps in development. It's not such a new basic idea, since these qualities have been called by many names in many cultures, like character, virtues and so forth. BZ: What motivated you to write this particular book? Please tell us what led up to your wanting to write this book about nurturing the development of emotional muscles in the early childhood years.Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: We are psychoanalysts - Freud's profound insight was that little children have complex minds, that their behavior has meaning. We know that early experience can have a significant impact on the rest of a person's life, for good or ill. This knowledge ebbs and flows in people's awareness at different times, with our society currently ignoring the needs of voiceless children. So part of the motivation for the book was to give voice to the potentiality of parent-child (and teacher-child) interactions and relationships. Work at the various schools in the Alliance for Psychoanalytic Schools (about 14 members, including Allen Creek, across the US and internationally) has had a dramatic impact on the lives of families. W e \"Our greatest challenge is to get the word out about the importance of a thoughtful preschool experience as an investment for the rest of one's life.\" Questions for Psychoanalysts Kerry Kelly Novick and Jack Novick about their New Book, Emotional Muscle - Strong Parents, Strong ChildrenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 59 wanted to find a way to convey what was actually being done, what created that impact. We needed a language to describe, in practical terms, concepts like \"attunement,\" or \"ego strength,\" etc. In the book we don't only talk about the development of emotional muscle in children, we also try to describe it in all parents, regardless of background. No one is trained to be a parent, whether they went to Harvard or dropped out of high school. It's like being asked to go play in the Super Bowl without being trained to know about first downs or what it's like to be exhausted after being tackled repeatedly. So everyone needs help to learn what is important and what isn't; how to think about the job; how to set priorities, and, most importantly, how to find satisfaction and pleasure in the job. BZ: Can you give our readers an overview of the book's content, including a brief synopsis of emotional muscle as it pertains to babies, one-year-olds, two-year-olds, three-year-olds, and five-year-olds? Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: We believe that young children are capable of much more than they are given credit for - but the best way to foster growth is by building what we call emotional muscle through thoughtful parenting, not by the harsh treatment many advice books (like Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother , for instance) describe. Our book takes parents through the first five years of their child's life, offering opportunities for emotional muscle-building at every stage. For example: \u00b7 Babies learn trust and adaptability; \u00b7 One-year-olds develop empathy; \u00b7 At age two, they learn resilience and mastery; \u00b7 For three-year-olds, it' s about persistence; \u00b7 By age four , they're ready to develop internal controls and realistic standards; \u00b7 And at five, at last, it' s time for cooperation and competence. Each chapter describes the characteristics and challenges of that age group as well as the emotional muscles that parents can work on to guide their children, with examples drawn from our highly successful preschool. As one mom of two school-age kids told us after reading the book, \"I have gotten so much help and a sense of competence in my parenting this week!\" More detail is available at www.buildemotionalmuscle.com. BZ: Will you give our readers a sense of what the Allen Creek Preschool is, and what your role at Allen has been? And some history of the school? Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: Allen Creek Preschool has a super- informative website at www.allencreek.org.We were part of the group of 12 psychoanalysts, educators and businesses who each put in $50 to found the non-profit Allen Creek Preschool in 1994. Kerry was the first President of the Board and Child Development Director, as well as being the Parent-Infant and Parent-Toddler teacher for many years. Jack was on the Board and was head of the Program Evaluation committee. We both worked until a couple of years ago as Family Consultants, meeting with teachers and parents regularly to track the children's development and help parents form a supportive community. Now we serve as grandparents to the school, available to help when needed for development. We attend staff meetings and do inservices for teachers and community talks on \"Thoughtful Parenting.\" A unique feature of Allen Creek among preschools is its extensive scholarship program. This was part of the mission from the beginning, based on our knowledge that everyone gains from participation in a diverse community. In these hard times, the scholarship program is more important than ever in making the school available to families. But it's also harder to raise money; the school is lucky to have generous donors who have stepped up, for instance at the annual scholarship fundraiser, Dining For Kids (or D4K), every year in May. BZ: Over your years of working with Allen Creek Preschool, what are you most proud of? And what has been most challenging? Kerry Novick and Jack Novick: We are most proud of the families willing to engage in the work of becoming thoughtful parents. The effort bears fruit - our first graduates are now halfway through high school. Everyone remarks on their particular kindness, social maturity, inclusiveness, creativity and focus. Our greatest challenge is to get the word out about the importance of a thoughtful preschool experience as an investment for the rest of one' s life. Hence, the book and the effort to keep the price affordable, so that people can learn the ideas that have been developed at Allen Creek and other schools. BZ: My wife and I have a delightful three-year-old daughter, Grace, and the parts of your book about the life and inner world of a three-year-old hit the mark. Could you just as well have continued on, and written about An Evening with the Novicks The Novicks will be speaking about their new book, and engaging with the audience, at a Crazy Wisdom Salon on Thursday, May 5th at 7pm.\"We both feel we have a greater appreciation of how hard parents work and how deeply they want to do a good job.\" Continued on page 60Jack Novick Kerry Kelly Novickemotional muscle for older school-age kids and for adolescents and for college-age young adults? (If so, I wish you would, as we have a seven-year-old daughter, too...and they're both going to get older, inevitably.) The Novicks: The basic ideas in the book apply to all ages, since we all revisit the same issue throughout our lives. Some have directly visible application to older ages, like setting realistic limits. We are working on a sequel, to extend the age range to school kids and teenagers. And, working in a university town especially, we think there is important work to be accomplished by older adolescents and their parents to transform their relationship into one between adults. BZ: Kerry, you've been writing a terrific parenting column for annarbor.com. Do you come by writing an advice column for parents with natural ease, as it would appear, or do you have to work hard to craft those skillfully calibrated answers? Kerry Novick: The column is work and I love doing it, as it helps me understand what's important to people and clarify my own ideas. For me, it's a living experience of some of the ideas in the book about the interaction of work and pleasure. When a 3-year-old puts three blocks on top of each other, she may feel like she's built the Taj Mahal and feel terrific. But she hasn't really built the Taj Mahal. A parent's appreciation of what she has actually accomplished will validate her good feelings realistically . So I appreciate your kind words about my column in annarbor.com, which can also be found in the blog section of www.buildemotionalmuscle.com. Jack and I both come from family backgrounds where work was a given and the satisfactions of work were visible and explicit. His parents ran a corner store, open long hours and serving the needs of the neighborhood. My parents were both dancers, who worked constantly to maintain their bodies and their skills. Jack and I both watched and helped our parents, feeling involved in their achievements. One of the things we talk about in the book is the importance of parents sharing their good feelings about their work with their children - it's an incentive to grow up. BZ: It seems to me that the questions being posed to you, by Ann Arbor area readers of the annarbor.com column, have a depth and authenticity way beyond the average \"Dear Abby\" types of questions. Would you agree with that, and would you comment on that? Kerry Novick: I think parents really care about what they are doing. Perhaps the anonymity of a column allows for greater openness. I try not to choose to answer more superficial questions and select those that speak to more general and important issues. Maybe because parents know I'm a psychoanalyst they go to a deeper place. BZ: In the book, you wrote, \"When there are hard or complex factors in a child's or parent's past - like medical illness, deprivation, abuse, adoption, or upheavals from war, emigration, or natural disasters - each phase of the child's development challenges parents anew to rework and redefine the meaning of the issue. In situations like this, where deep, perhaps unconscious, forces are at work in the personality, we can see the limits of the concept of emotional muscle.\" How so? Where's the friction between the concept of emotional muscle and the unconscious, complex factors? The Novicks: It's not so much a question of \"friction\" as one of level. Suppose someone makes a New Year's resolution to start an exercise program, stop smoking, and lose weight. He does it for two weeks and then stops. And then he does it again the next year and the year after. By that time it will be clear that he needs help to continue his program and/or to address some underlying obstacle to doing what he actually wants to accomplish. With a child, a parent may be asking too much or the issue may have too many underlying meanings to be dealt with on one level. Emotional muscle can help parents and teachers engage with problems and see how far they can get. Often they can go much further than they thought was possible. But, it can also help them recognize when they need extra help. The idea of needing to go over things repeatedly stems from a dif ference between adults and children. Adults often master something pretty fully and move on. Children, on the other hand, because big issues or events take on new meanings with each phase of growth, normally need to work them through all over again, processing the issue at the new level, before integrating it and moving on to the next. BZ: How do you foster a sense of gratitude in small children, for the daily gifts of health and family love? The Novicks: Here we think you are talking about values, conveying what's important to you to your children. First one has to live one's values, appreciating those daily gifts and articulating the joy they bring. Too many parents come home from work and complain about their stressful day . You don't have to deny the hard parts, but it's important first to find something to recount that felt good, satisfying, productive, and how pleasurable that is. Kids need us to set an example. We can also teach these things explicitly, by noticing out loud and not just inside when the sun feels so good on our faces, when the pie looks a yummy brown and so forth. To do this, however, families actually have to spend time together - there has to be a context for conveying these important lessons. That means family meals, activities and sometimes choices among pastimes or events for both adults and children. BZ: How are the Ann Arbor area parents of 2011 different from the Ann Arbor area parents of ten or twenty years ago? Are their concerns different? The Novicks: Each era brings its own challenges. We nowadays don't have to cope with the Great Depression as our grandparents or great-grandparents did. Rather than think of it comparatively, however, we look at what the hard things and the advantages of the present are. Given that most families currently have two working parents, a major challenge is how to keep love alive while apart, how to keep each other in mind. There are lots of ways parents and caregivers can support that crucial emotional muscle. BZ: And how do you each think your own perspective has changed, as you've gotten older and wiser, and become grandparents, as it pertains to helping parents and their small children navigate their family lives?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 60 \"Our book is an effort to encompass the parental experience of finding support, finding pleasure, feeling good about the work they are putting in.\"\"One of the things we talk about in the book is the importance of parents sharing their good feelings about their work with their children - it's an incentive to grow up.\" Continued from page 59 The Novicks: We both feel we have a greater appreciation of how hard parents work and how deeply they want to do a good job. A unique aspect we wanted to stress in the book is the growth of parents through the experience of doing the job. Most parenting books tell parents what they should do to their children. Our book is an effort to encompass the parental experience of finding support, finding pleasure, feeling good about the work they are putting in. BZ: Can you each describe your professional lives currently? I see that you travel and lead workshops and give talks, and that you will be doing some events for your new book in San Francisco and San Diego and New York. Are you each still seeing patients in private practice? Are you still deeply involved with Allen Creek Preschool? The Novicks: We are both still in private practice with children, adolescents, adults and families in Ann Arbor, and we are very involved in teaching here in town at the two psychoanalytic training organizations, the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute and the Michigan Psychoanalytic Council. We travel to see our children and grandchildren and to teach at many other centers nationally and internationally. A nice thing about the modern world is that we can keep continuity in our work (keeping people in mind) by using Skype or phone to talk to our patients and students. We are both former chairs of MPI's child analytic training, and continue to supervise at the UM Department of Psychiatry. With Allen Creek, Kerry still leads their Parent-Child Resource Play Center at Peace Neighborhood Center, and we both offer inservices for teachers, attend staff meetings, and give talks for the community on \"thoughtful parenting.\" BZ: Jack, what has been most satisfying to you about your professional life and work? Jack Novick: We both love that our work is never boring; we're always learning and feeling pleasure in increasing skill and competence. Even if we can't swim as far as when we were younger, emotional muscle increases with age and practice. BZ: Kerry, what has been most satisfying to you about your professional life and work? Kerry Novick: I find it deeply satisfying to see someone grow, to feel I've helped them find a way to use their strengths, skills and experience in new ways. We never leave the past fully behind, since it's part of us and we can't rewrite history, but it can take on new and more constructive meanings. It's an honor to be part of that process. I also find satisfaction in the internal consistency of my values in personal, professional, community and political life, even when that's difficult. BZ: Jack, our next issue is published in the spring. Tell us what you love about Ann Arbor in the spring? Jack Novick: I love the magnolia tree in our front yard, which we planted on our son's fourth birthday - now it's enormous. All year, the sunshine pours into my south-facing office window. I think Michigan is the sunniest state, and we can even canoe in our town's own river when the ice melts. BZ: And, you, Kerry, what do you love to do in Ann Arbor in the spring?Kerry Novick: I love the days getting longer and the first time I can go barefoot in the grass. We have lots of birds nesting around our house and I watch the cardinals, the woodpeckers, the mourning doves and the turkey vultures with fascination. BZ: Thank you both. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 61 \"We never leave the past fully behind, since it's part of us and we can't rewrite history, but it can take on new and more constructive meanings.\" 202 E.

Melisa recently moved to Chelsea with her husband and two kids after living in Ann Arbor for 20 years. She grew up in Cleveland, but considers this home. She has over 15 years of clinical experience with children, adolescents, adults, and families in the areas of substance abuse, family violence, and perinatal mood disorders.) Briefly, what does it mean to be a psychotherapist for the childbearing years, and how did you find your way to this specialized and interesting area of practice? Being a psychotherapist for the childbearing years means that I support women who are struggling with challenges related to childbearing, whether that's depression or anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum, overcoming traumatic birth experiences, coming to terms with an adoption or abortion, miscarriage or stillbirth, or parenting guidance. Prior to starting my private practice, I worked in the substance abuse and family violence fields. Recovery for addicts and perpetrators of violence is best done in a group setting, so I knew I'd have to change my focus to one-on-one counseling. Becoming a mother was such a transformative and positive experience for me that I wanted to help women who were struggling during this important time. Being a mother can be such a large part of a woman's identity that it influences how they feel about themselves, and the relationship between a mother and child has a profound impact on how a child grows and develops. You were involved with BirthWorks for a time. What is that?BirthWorks is a method of childbirth education whose main tenet is that birthing is instinctual and that, if given privacy, love and support, a woman can give birth without intervention in most cases. It promotes a sense of trust in a woman's body and the birth process. Birth can be an empowering or disempowering experience, which can affect how a woman feels about herself and her relationship with her baby. BirthWorks helps women to have an empowering birth experience regardless of birth location. The two-year training was intensive and comprehensive and was the equivalent of a master's degree. Even though I no longer teach BirthW orks classes, I maintain my certification. How new was the field of \"psychotherapy for the childbearing years\" when you began? What were the challenges in that? When I began my private practice about ten years ago, I read all the books there were on the subject of postpartum depression: all two of them. This meant that I was essentially self-taught. My clients have been some of my greatest teachers. You mentioned to me that \"postpartum depression\" is actually an umbrella term. Please explain. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that occurs anytime during the first year after giving birth, but the symptoms can present in different ways. I had one client say to me, \"I thought postpartum depression meant that you felt depressed after birth, but it's so much worse than that.\" Most women have more anxiety symptoms than depressive symptoms, which can be confusing, since we call it Postpartum Depression. In addition, PPD can have features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or Panic Disorder, can include thoughts of suicide or running away, and, in rare cases, psychotic symptoms. How does postpartum depression intermingle with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in working with women after childbirth? In about 5-10% of cases, PPD is really a manifestation of PTSD, as a result of a traumatic birth experience or a re-triggering of symptoms due to past sexual assault or other trauma. Women can feel traumatized by their birth experience if they perceived that their life or their baby's life was in danger, or if they had more interventions than they were expecting, or more than they wanted. I'm trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), an evidenced-based and very ef fective treatment for trauma.Supporting Women through their Childbearing Years ~ Is your focus usually short-, medium- or long-term in your work with clients? My goal is to help women feel better as quickly as possible. With PPD, that can be as quickly as six sessions. A woman often discovers, though, that there were some conditions that predisposed her to PPD. If she is interested, we continue our work to reduce her risk factors to prevent future incidences of depression or anxiety . A few problems require long-term work, and I do work with clients long-term when necessary. You mentioned that there are numerous factors that are possible components in postpartum depression. Please elaborate. Research has narrowed the predisposing factors for PPD to 16! There are biological factors, psychological factors, relationship factors, and life stress factors, which all combine in unique ways in each woman with PPD. The interesting thing is that, of all 16 factors, only one has predictive value: a woman who experiences depression or anxiety during pregnancy is more likely to have postpartum depression. I've seen women with all the predisposing factors not get PPD, and I've seen women with no predisposing factors get PPD. A vast majority of women with PPD have had no previous diagnosis. Can you talk about the meaning of motherhood in our society, and other cultural factors? How does that affect women in general, and the women you see in your practice? Mothers are held to such a high standard in our society. We all get messages about what it means to be a mother, and most of them are unconscious. I call these expectations the \"myths of motherhood.\" Myths like: \"Mothers should know how to care for infants and children.\" \"Mothers shouldn't need any help.\" \"Mothers should love being mothers and be totally fulfilled by motherhood.\" \"Mothers should be self-sacrificing.\" Women are subjected to conflicting messages: You should stay home with your baby/ you should go back to work; you should breastfeed/formula is easier; you should sleep with your baby/it's dangerous to sleep with your baby. How do I balance meeting my baby's needs with my needs? How do those cultural factors, related to the meaning of motherhood, set up women for the experience of anxiety and depression during the childbearing years? I think these unrealistic expectations affect the well-being of all mothers but, for women with PPD, they can be the source of feelings of overwhelm, incompetence, \"Becoming a mother was such a transformative and positive experience for me that I wanted to help women who were struggling during this important time.\" \"I read all the books there were on the subject of postpartum depression: all two of them. This meant that I was essentially self-taught. My clients have been some of my greatest teachers.\"\"Most women [with postpartum depression] have more anxiety symptoms than depressive symptoms...\"Melisa Schuster An Interview with Melisa SchusterThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 63 and shame. Women with PPD feel enormous guilt and shame for the symptoms they are experiencing; they often feel they can't tell anyone for fear of being thought a \"bad mother.\" We often don't talk to each other about how hard mothering is, so we feel alone and isolated. What kinds of differences do you see when working with mothers of different ages in facing the challenges of mothering? And how do these issues cut across socio-economic lines? I find that teen mothers and older mothers tend to have the most difficult time. Teen mothers because they haven't had the chance to finish growing up themselves and may not have adequate support. Older mothers because they have had so much of their identities evolve from a sense of accomplishment, and taking care of a baby requires a lot of repetitive tasks (i.e. diapering, feeding, soothing); there's just not a big sense of accomplishment in that. The rewards of motherhood are very long-term. I once did focus group discussions with mothers of varying cultures and economic backgrounds. While mothers living in poverty certainly have more challenges, the \"myths of motherhood\" seem to affect all women, regardless of socio-economic status or the culture they were born into. When the mother is experiencing postpartum depression, what are some of the challenges for their husbands and partners? PPD affects the whole family. Men can feel scared, worried, or overwhelmed by their partner's symptoms. Partners often have added responsibilities for household tasks or childcare in addition to supporting the partner with PPD. Partners often don't know what to do or say to help; it can be very difficult. I often work with couples to help them understand PPD, what the road to recovery looks like, and how to mend the relationship after it's gone through such a stressful time. You mentioned to me that dads can sometimes have postpartum depression. Please explain. I've seen dads also experience depression after the birth of a child. Sometimes they feel overwhelmed by the financial responsibility; sometimes the birth of a baby triggers feelings about their own fathers or absence of a father . But interestingly, epidemiological research has shown that men are not more predisposed to depression/anxiety during the childbearing years; women are. You also work with childbearing losses related to miscarriages, childbirth traumas, abortions, and adoptions. You indicated to me that friends and family have different capacities for handling the grief that a woman might feel about her childbearing loss, and that's where a therapist can help. Please give us a feel for that work. I think of therapy as \"holding the space\" or creating safety for examining thoughts and behaviors, expressing feelings, creating meaning and making changes. Grief is not pathological and most people can heal from a loss without therapy . Most of the time, healing comes when a woman is able to tell her story and express her feelings, helping her to make sense of her experience. But it's difficult to witness others' intense feelings. And family and friends may be experiencing their own feelings about the loss. So even the most supportive family or friends might have a difficult time being present for the woman's feelings. Other times, a woman may get stuck in the grief process. These are times when therapy can be helpful. You commented to me that depression and anxiety create a barrier between a mom and her baby or child, and yet much of the literature focuses on how that affects the baby or child. Can you expand on that? When a mother is depressed or anxious, she can be preoccupied with her symptoms. Research has shown that babies of depressed mothers are more fussy , smile less, and are less playful, which can impact learning and growth. I think this is important information, because it helps us understand why we need to treat postpartum depression. But this information also increases the burden mothers feel. I want to treat postpartum depression because I think it's important for mothers to feel good about themselves, to enjoy their role, and because their mental health supports the well-being of the whole family. You have said that we don't like to think there is such a thing as medical trauma, but that it exists. Can you talk about that? Medical treatment is designed to cure illness and disease, and doctors don't intend to cause pain, but sometimes medical procedures can cause trauma and make people feel scared and out of control. Depending on the person and the medical procedure, a person can be traumatized by the medical experience. I think that, in general, we don't recognize this and the trauma goes untreated. In the case of a cesarean section, for example, women are often told, \"You should be grateful you have a healthy baby,\" and their traumatic experience gets ignored or dismissed. I have worked with women who are pregnant and are terrified of the upcoming birth, because of a previous traumatic birth experience. What do you love most about your work with women in their childbearing years? I love being a part of women's healing: watching them come into themselves as mothers, feeling competent and happy in that role.Recommended Resources for the Childbearing Years (Some of the books listed below are available at Crazy Wisdom, or can be ordered for you.)

Occasionally, I get frustrated when the systems that we've set up to help people don't work well; for instance, when a woman needs hospitalization but can't access it due to lack of insurance. What are the gifts for you in working with so much sadness and loss, grief and disappointment? I feel very honored when women trust me enough to share their innermost thoughts and feelings, even when they are afraid to say them out loud. I appreciate the inner strength and resources women bring to their healing. It's very gratifying to witness clients moving through these feelings to the peace they find on the other side. You've created two CDs for the general public. What are they about and why did you make them? I found myself teaching my clients relaxation skills and using visualizations to strengthen their coping resources. Strengthening these coping resources can have dramatic effects on clients' mood and functioning and how they feel about themselves. At first, I made audio tapes of very poor quality using a hand-held tape recorder for each client. I decided a couple years ago to go into the studio to make high-quality recordings. The CDs would be appropriate for anyone, but especially someone who has suf fered a trauma, or is on an emotional healing or spiritual journey. My CDs The Light Within: Meditations for Peace and The Light Within: Meditations for Inner Strength are available on my website (www.melisaschuster.com). ### (Melisa Schuster can be reached at 734-302-0033. Her website is: www.melisaschuster.com)\"Birth can be an empowering or disempowering experience, which can affect how a woman feels about herself and her relationship with her baby.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 64 By Shaqe Kalaj In one of my art classes, a teen student mindlessly scribbled on a piece of paper, saying, \"That's art.\" I looked at her directly and said, \"No it's not. You just drew a line; you didn't put any of you into it.\" I still remember the look of surprise in her face. As a teaching artist working with youth, my greatest satisfaction is opening the doors of what's possible for them by asking the question, \"What is art?\" This is one of the most probing questions inherent in contemporary arts. By applying it to teens and \"tweens\" who are asking themselves, \"Who am I?\" - I'm trying to offer them a very potent and transformative experience. As a working artist, I define myself as \"content-based\": my message determines the medium and the style I use to create my initial intention. Who I am, as an artist, is the foundation on which I build my teaching. I enjoy working with people of all ages, with and without disabilities. But teens and pre-teens hold a special fascination for me. Children, as they grow, move from an imaginative phase to a more concrete existence in our culture. My task is to prolong the imaginative stage in order to make the concrete stage more vivid and alive. I've used many techniques in this process; below I'll share two examples. Currently, I teach adult and young people's art classes at Art & Ideas (a contemporary gallery and studio in Plymouth, Michigan). I've been working with several pre-teens in exploring imaginative landscapes. As I was leading the students, I didn't specifically tell them to draw an imaginative landscape, since I don't think directness brings out their imagination. Instead, I gave them yarn and string and had them trace it on the paper in a haphazard way. Then the students had to visualize what kind of landscape could be depicted by what was now on their paper. It's in this process that they break conceptions of what a landscape is \"supposed to be\" \u2014 instead, coming up with a surprise that they would not necessarily have conceived of initially. As they began to paint, they brought out what naturally started to develop for them, gradually making the landscape look more concrete. My approach with teens differs from pre-teens in that \"the concrete\" is more important in the teens' stage of development, as well as in their personal preferences. So my approach interweaves conceptual ideas to lead them into an imaginative process, where they don't get stuck in literal thinking. This can create breakthroughs in the creative process. For example, I was working with some teens in an after-school program in Detroit, where I had the students paint portraits of historical Detroit figures. In this instance, I wanted to engage their conceptual thinking. First, I showed them a photograph of a Detroit hero unknown to them, explaining the person's history. I even read them a monologue of what he might have been thinking before he died. It was only at this point that the students became highly engaged, and painting a portrait of this hero then became a heroic experience! (T o learn more about this project, please visit: http://voicethread.com/share/1154784/ ) It's fascinating for me to work with young people. There's so much freshness in them. But there's also so many clich\u00e9s that the students share in their language \u2014 and in their artwork \u2014 that need to be explored and viewed from dif ferent perspectives. I believe that art can be the means for opening up a perspective that's inquisitive and alive. And I think our approach to teaching young people needs to draw this out of them and set a basis of how art and perception can be something that they can carry with them throughout their lives.

Camp is designed to improve motor skills, sensory processing, social skills, and self-care skills in children with special needs. Camp is challenging while it is fun. Programs are tailored to meet individual needs. Camp has a ratio of two staff per child. Imagine how we can focus on improving each child's specific needs! It has been our experience that in these two weeks campers will make progress typically obtained in six months of standard therapy. Campers' activities involve the use of dynamic equipment, gross motor activities, social interaction, brain gym, language, body work, and swimming. A parent is expected to stay at camp with their child and participate in activities. Parent activities may include picture taking, set-up or clean-up of an activity, and monitoring the child's arousal level. No siblings are allowed at camp. Campers new to JUMP-IN need an evaluation from a licensed therapist or JUMP-IN. A screening evaluation at JUMP-IN prior to camp is necessary. By scheduling your evaluation early, you can begin your home program to improve the function of the nervous system to ensure that your child receives the maximum benefits from camp. We look forward to having you join us. Dates: July 18-July 29; 9am-12pm.

This helps us to understand how and where disharmonies arise in our bodies. Thousands of years of human observation are the basis for the Five-Element The- ory. The theory is also holistic, whereby either the whole body can be read or just one area can be treated, such as the hara, feet, or ears. Shiatsu uses few Western preconceptions or labels, which can offer clients a fresh perspective on their health concerns. Sensei Ohashi emphasizes that the shiatsu practitioner is not \"healing\" or fixing, but is instead in partnership with the receiver of the treatment. I like this view , because it emphasizes the clients' participation in their healing. This is also why I teach Zen Shiatsu exercises and do-it-yourself Shiatsu workshops, to put simple tools for health back into the hands of individuals, friends, and family . As with many skills, 20 percent of the knowledge is worth 80 percent of the benefit.Ann Arbor is blessed with many great body workers, and no one modality fits everyone. Shiatsu is a good fit for me. I feel like I'm playing, not working. It blends well with my life as a member of the residential community at the Flaming Jewel Dharma Center, a Vajrayana Buddhist community in Ann Arbor. Shiatsu is a sort of meditation in action. ### Cynthia Conklin' s classes are listed in the Acupressure/Shiatsu section on page 76.Cynthia Conklin' s shiatsu studio, Eastern Sun Shiatsu, can be reached at www.easternsunshiatsu.com or 734-417-9714.By Cynthia Conklin Shiatsu is a Japanese body-healing therapy that works with ancient Chinese medi - cal understanding. It is Japan's systemization and refinement of ancient Chinese healing principles. The word itself means simply \"finger pressure.\" When I moved to Ann Arbor 31 years ago to work with communities on alternative energy and natural resource preservation, I had never heard of shiatsu. I first en-countered the therapy when I met Sensei [teacher] Kazuko Kuratomi. My response to her work when I experienced it was profound and transformative. I started \"feel - ing into the world\" from the center of my belly (hara) \u2014 it is an open, spacious, yet grounded sense of being. Alternative health and healing became my hobby in the early 80s, while I worked around the country for 17 years on alternative energy and resource preservation. I became a partner in Resource Recycling Systems, Inc., of Ann Arbor, and also volunteered nationally to help develop a unified U.S. recycling policy . During this time, I trained in massage with Irene Gauthier (now of Irene's Myomas - sology Institute in Southfield), when she still worked out of her basement, and also studied Touch for Health. I sought out many wonderful local healers, including a brilliant and outrageous women's healing group, where we experimented with and on each other. After a bout with chemo and radiation therapies, however, I decided to make my longtime hobby a career. To that end, I began an excellent apprenticeship with local shiatsu teacher Frances Farmer. Then she sent me on to the Ohashiatsu School, headquartered in New York City, founded by Sensei Wataru Ohashi. Shiatsu moves within a system of meridians, or energy rivers, in the body. The meridians contain tsubos, or points: potent entryways into the healing currents of these rivers. In Kazuko Kuratomi's classes, we learned meridian locations without charts, which demanded that we feel them through our own bodies. She calls her work \"Shindo,\" which is Japanese for \"guidance from the heart.\" Sensei Kazuko says the force of gravity is synonymous with affection, which is how her work felt to me. Her method is based on the work of Shizuto Masunaga, the great Japanese shiatsu teacher and psychologist, whose work I've come to admire. When I was ready to start my own practice in late 2000, Jay Sandweiss, D.O., invited me to establish it on the second floor of his Fourth Avenue office building in downtown Ann Arbor. Dr. Jay has been generous in his support of my practice, Eastern Sun Shiatsu, referring clients and supporting improvements to beautify my practice space. During my treatments, the client wears loose clothing and lies on a futon on the floor. I hold, stretch, sedate, and nourish the meridians and tsubos. Energy begins to circulate to ease pain, relieve tension, and promote relaxation. Movement is fluid, natural, relaxed, and continuous. Shiatsu brings harmony to the life energy within the body. It is both practical and metaphysical (beyond the physical). Shiatsu treatments and exercises not only cor - rect problems, but also prevent imbalances from manifesting in the first place. Most of the people who come to me are looking to rid themselves of excess tension in the neck, shoulders, and back\u2014the bane of modern life. Shiatsu works wonders for these everyday issues. People leave my sessions feeling open and relaxed. Shiatsu is also beneficial in treating the symptoms of many common diseases. Consistent work with AIDS and cancer survivors, for example, helps them build much-needed vitality. The treatments can also be life-transforming: one client, who suffered with advanced ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's Disease), was deeply moved because he could actually \"feel\" ener gy flowing in his body. I love shiatsu for its depth, especially its use of the Chinese Five-Element Theory, in which it is not necessary to name or classify diseases. Instead, shiatsu focuses on the five elements of water, wood, fire, earth, and metal, which are the flavors of ki (life force energy). These elements are an elaboration of yin and yang, which com-pose all of relative nature. Each element corresponds to a specific season, sound, 'Feeling into the World' with Shiatsu \"Shiatsu is also beneficial in treating the symptoms of many common diseases. Consistent work with AIDS and cancer survivors, for example, helps them build much-needed vitality.\" \"Shiatsu uses few Western preconceptions or labels, which can offer clients a fresh perspective on their health concerns...[Shiatsu uses] the Chinese Five-Element Theory, in which it is not necessary to name or classify diseases. \"Cynthia Conklin's shiatsu studio, Eastern Sun Shiatsu, is located in downtown Ann Arbor.

Zena Zumeta Mediation Services 330 East Liberty, Suite 3A, Ann Arbor 48104 734.663.1155 www.zenazumetamediation.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August Page 92 According to Ayurvedic principles, people fall into three types based on their individual mind-body constitution, or \" dosha \": vata, pitta and kapha. doshas are determined by an individual's habits and proclivities, ranging from body structure to emotional responses. Understanding the constitutional type enables us to personalize lifestyle, food, and yogic practices to the individual's doshic requirements. Ayurvedic treatment occurs with two levels relative to the doshas. The first level is general lifestyle management. This deals with living in harmony with our constitution and environment, not only to prevent disease but also to utilize our full energy potential. It is not enough merely to prolong our lives, but to have sustained life force to do the things we wish for. We must consider what we are using our energy for and why. The second level is treatment of diseases and health complaints, ranging from common health aliments to life-threatening illnesses. Treatment includes herbs, nutrition, hygiene, exercise, detoxification and purification procedures (panchakarma), rejuvenating therapies, mantras, yoga, breath control (pranayam), meditation, astrology, prayer, rituals, and spiritual counseling - all for healing the entire being. Poor health seldom has a simple or single cause. Some factors will respond to dietary changes, while others are beyond individual control. We cannot always control or change the environment for our health and happiness. Instead, we learn to improve ourselves and our own internal resources. Ayurveda provides us with the knowledge and methods to facilitate this process. I am passionate about Ayurveda because it is a preventive science and because of its natural, holistic approach. Ayurveda doesn't just treat an organ, it treats the entire person. If someone comes to me with liver disease, I look at everything in the person's life \u2014 their body type, digestion, elimination, emotional status \u2014 to see what the imbalances are. Even a few changes in a person's lifestyle can make a big difference, and I feel rewarded by that. Ayurveda embraces all health care disciplines and weaves them into an integrated and customized plan for each individual. As part of my medical training in Ayurveda, I also studied many elements of allopathic (traditional Western) medicine, such as modern physiology, pathology, and pharmacology. In fact, it is necessary to understand the other types of treatments a person may have had, or are undergoing, to know how Ayurveda fits into their current situation. Ayurveda blends easily with other medical traditions. For instance, Ayurvedic medicine can complement allopathic therapies like chemotherapy for cancer, by lessening its side effects. It also can aid the treatment of chronic diseases while the patient is taking allopathic medications for the condition. Like Ashtanga yoga, Ayurveda has eight limbs too \u2014 called \"Ashtanga Ayurveda\" \u2014 that deal with disease management through medication and surgeries : Internal Medicine, Surgery, ENT and Ophthalmology, Pediatrics, Toxicology, Psychology, Science of Rejuvenation and Science of Aphrodisiacs. Ayurveda is called \"the mother of all healing,\" as it cares for us the same way a mother cares for her child. It rejects nothing that is beneficial for life. I feel very blessed to be an Ayurvedic healer, and especially while living in a community where it will make a big difference in changing perspectives towards health. May your journey through life bring you truth and bliss. ### (Dr. Beena Vesikar, M.D. (Ayurvedic medicine), CMT, nutritional consultant, is a founder of Beayurvedic Wellness Center located in Farmington. The Center offers wellness consultation, Ayurvedic therapies, panchakarma, and Ayurvedic products and workshops. For more information, contact- 248-631-7271 or visit www.beayurvedic.com) By Dr. Beena Vesikar Human beings today face unprecedented challenges due to exponential technological and social changes. Many people feel disconnected from the greater traditions that have provided guidance and nourishment to human beings for thousands of years. This causes psycho-physical imbalances, resulting in ill health. It is clear that we need to develop new strategies if we are to survive and thrive as individuals. Ayurveda is a holistic, person-centered medical system, which has its roots in ancient India. It is one of the oldest and most complete natural healing systems on our planet. \"Ayurveda\" is a Sanskrit word that comes from two words: \"Ayu,\" which means life \u2014 from birth to death, from the natural form of the body to immortal spirit \u2014 and \"Veda,\" the books of knowledge originating in ancient India, which offer us a wealth of practical knowledge on how to live a healthy and meaningful life. \"Ayurveda,\" in simple terms, means \"Knowledge of Life.\" I grew up in India, where the Ayurvedic tradition was a part of my family's life. I saw how my mother made dietary changes every season and added spices and dietary supplements to our meals to overcome seasonal allergies and common health aliments. So Ayurveda was my topic of interest as I earned my bachelor's degree in Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (B.A.M.&S.) and my medical degree in Ayurveda-Internal Medicine, both from the University of Pune in Pune, India. For most of the West, medical treatment begins when we fall ill. It is a response to disease; it aims to fix something already broken. At this stage, radical and invasive methods like drugs or surgery may be required, which have many unwanted side effects. But a higher level of healing is to eliminate disease before it manifests, for which invasive methods like drugs or surgery are seldom necessary. I value Ayurveda because it is a preventive medical system, in which pharmacies and hospitals become periphery, not primary. To reach this level of health, we must consider the effects of our lifestyle, environment, work, and psychological condition on our health and life in total. We must cut off the unhealthy factors in our daily lives that make us vulnerable to disease. Ayurveda ~ The Mother of All Healing \"For most of the West, medical treatment begins when we fall ill.

For more info, be in touch with bill@ crazywisdom.net When I die, I want my body to be cared for by those who knew and loved me. I don't want my body to be left alone, stored in an unfamil-iar facility, and handled by strangers. And when someone I love dies, I want to be involved in caring for his or her body. I want to be at home with them and be able to sit with them in familiar surroundings where I don't have to worry about what time it is or how to get there or what to wear. In that setting I think I will best be able to be in touch with my feelings, begin to accept the death and deal with the sorrow. But what about the body? Is it okay to be around it? Is it legal to have it at home? Won't it be unclean or dangerous, or scary, or weird? Our ideas about caring for the dead have been so shaped and influenced by recently developed funeral industry practices that we don't know how to do it ourselves or even that it's possible or beneficial to be in-volved. We have separated ourselves from thinking about death, caring for death and being around death. In the last few generations we have lost the art of caring for our own dead. It used to be that when someone died, a friend or relative, or perhaps the local midwife, came to the home where the person died. They helped wash and dress the body and lay it out in the front parlor (that's how funeral 'parlors' got their name). Friends and relatives would visit, spend time with the family , pay their respects, say good-bye and then process to the local cemetery for burial, usually within a day or two. What has changed? Death still comes to all of us. People still mourn and feel loss. People still desire to gather together and comfort each other and help each other. But only occasionally do we choose to see or be with the body of our loved one. It has become the norm for someone else to care for the body . If we choose to see the body, it is only after it has been chemically and cosmetically enhanced, in an expensive box and in an unfamiliar place. We are led to believe that avoiding being around the dead will spare us pain and discomfort. I believe just the opposite: Caring for our own dead helps us face the reality of what has happened and say good-bye. I would like you to know that you can choose to care for your own loved one at home in the hours and days immediately after his or her pass-ing. If they have died at home, you can keep them at home. If they have died in a care facility, you can have them brought home. You can choose to wash and dress the body. You can choose where to place the body (on a bed or sofa) and to adorn the body with favorite items of clothing, beauty or meaning. You can choose if and when to have visitors. Prayers or songs or chants can be said or sung (or not), and people can gather in comfort, taking as much time as they need. It is legal to do this. It is safe and simple. It is healthy and helpful. Only our lack of awareness of the alternative to conventional practices and our communal loss of the art of caring for our dead prevent us from considering this loving and caring option. Seeing the body and helping to care for it can help one come to grips with the reality of death. Being personally involved in the care of the body is a beautiful expression of love and honor. Having the body of a loved one in a natural state and in a familiar place is comforting and nurturing. I have seen how it helps one begin to mourn and heal. There's help for you to do this. A Home Funeral Guide is a person who is specially trained in leading you through this process in a way that is meaningful for you and for your circle of support. The guide will meet with you ahead of time to help you plan, and is available at the time of death to support you in the process of caring for your loved one at home. She will help you create a safe and sacred space. It is possible to do this by yourself, but because it can be an overwhelming emotional time, it is a great comfort to have someone else pave the way. Caring for your own dead at home is what's known as a \"home funeral.\" Plan ahead to choose a home funeral, not a funeral home. Here are answers to some of the most common questions about home funerals: It is legal for the family to care for their own dead. The body does not need to go to a funeral establishment. Embalming is very rarely required by law. The body is cooled with small amounts of dry ice. A licensed funeral director is required to sign the death certificate and supervise final transport to the crematory or cemetery, but not to be present in the home. If the person has not died at home, funeral home staff must transport the body from the care facility to the home. ### Merilynne Rush, Home Funeral Guide, is a nurse and midwife, with 25 years professional experience, who educates and consults about natural death care op-tions, including home funeral and green burial.

Over time, my life became less of a search for answers and more of answers coming to me. Over the past five years, I have been attending events at the Center for Integrative Well-Being in Plym-outh, owned by Deb Foggio, where I have been looking for a better understanding of why my life is the way it is, and ways to change it. Deb witnessed my journey of exploring and expanding my understanding of metaphys-ics and she suggested that I put together a \"Metaphysics 101\"-type class to teach at the Center. \"Metaphysics 101\" sounded academic, so I chose a lighter title: \"Life Is a Cafeteria. What's on the Menu?\" The class became part of the curriculum at the Center and it is taught on the third Monday of the month. First of all, what is metaphysics? \"Meta\" comes from a Greek root meaning \"beyond,\" and \"physics\" refers to the physical state of things. Therefore, metaphysics is about those things beyond the physical. That would infer that metaphysics cannot be seen, heard, touched or smelled. As some people move higher vibrationally, however, they can see, hear, touch and even smell the energy fields that are part of the metaphysical realm. So what is on this menu? What are the choices? Because we are all part of Univer- sal Consciousness, the answers to those questions are unlimited. There are ways to get guidance, such as meditation, psychic readings, palm reading, and tarot cards. There are alternative healing modalities like Reiki, craniosacral therapy , and sound healing, for example. There are those who swear by crystals, essential oils, incense, yoga, and on and on. For years, there was a sort of \"underworld\" where one could seek out these practices. Today, many of these practices are mainstream and some are even the basis for television programs. What causes someone to explore beyond the norm? You see unexplained coin- cidences happen. Your intuition is telling you that the Sunday sermon is missing something. You feel yourself drawn to beliefs and concepts outside your upbring-ing, your comfort zone. You feel physically out of balance and someone suggests you get some energy work. What causes someone to explore beyond the norm? You see unexplained coincidences happen. Your intuition is telling you that the Sunday sermon is missing something. You feel yourself drawn to beliefs and concepts outside your upbringing, your comfort zone. You feel physically out of balance and someone suggests you get some energy work...Life Is a Cafeteria. What's on the Menu? Some people become spiritual seekers because, somewhere on their life' s path, they pause and reflect about things in their lives. It may be a sudden life-chang - ing event or a series of incidents that causes them to look for answers. For others, this questioning is more subtle and takes place over time. We look at our lives and think, \"Gee, I've followed all the rules. Why is there still something missing?\" Or possibly, we start noticing things outside us. A co-worker mentions energy fields and chakras. A friend goes to a psychic. Someone says they are leaving a religion they have followed since birth to seek out peace and understanding, and we wonder what they are talking about. We see a Crazy Wisdom Journal in the break room and we glance at it and then put it down like a hot potato, making sure no one sees us with it \u2014 because we don't know what to think. People often are afraid to ask about all this, because they fear they may be dabbling in some-thing they've been taught was forbidden or strange, or because they don't know anything about it. There is also still a mainstream message that some of these practices are taboo and occult, or harmful and unproven. So when people are sensing that there is more to life than what they are experiencing, they need to have a safe place to go to ask questions, share feelings, and learn more about how metaphysics works in their lives \u2014 even if they don't know the term \"metaphysics.\" This is when we are ready for \"the cafeteria\" and the Universe says, \"The teacher comes when the student is ready.\" That is the Divine Order of the Universe. Divine Order just is; we don't make it happen. We can resist it, or we can be open and re-ceptive. When we are ready to move energetically to higher vibrations, to embrace metaphysical thinking, we do become more open. If this sounds like you, then \u2014 like me \u2014 you could be ready to learn, discern, and integrate more of yourself and find out how you fit into the Divine Order of all Life. This is when it's helpful to find a center or a class in which to talk about the mys- tery in a safe environment. The \"Life Is a Cafeteria\" class is a place for just that type of exploration. Every one of us is different and unique, so we all approach the buffet of life differ- ently. It doesn't matter what the approach is. So as we become more open to all of the possibilities, we can investigate places and people to expand us, like the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & Tea Room and the Center for Integrative Well-Being. As I go further on my journey, I'm learning that we are all from the same DNA of the One Source, whatever we choose to call It. However, it's our uniqueness that puts us on our very own path. So once we have acknowledged that we want more information about metaphysics, those opportunities to learn more about it will simply manifest all around us. Then we have to discern what resonates with us and allow Divine Order to give direction.

Recently, I noticed that not only is the media reporting on the events they usually cover, such as natural disasters and political upheavals, but they are also covering the resulting prayer gatherings and peace rallies. Likewise, with each unfolding situation, my email box fills with announcements of group meditations and prayers. I'm betting yours does, too. The invitations for most meditation events I receive include notes that the intention is to \"heal\" or \"bring peace\" to a person or situation on the planet. Other emails request me to \"send light and love\" or good thoughts, prayer and energy towards curing illness for someone or helping with a difficult family matter. Certainly I feel a sense of compassion for those who are suf fering. Yet the underlying intention of this sort of goal-oriented prayer has never felt accurate to me. This morning , as I was wrestling with how to address another round of these emails, I heard a sentence being formed out loud in my head : \"The more unencumbered by personal intentions your prayers are, the more effective they are.\" While I attributed the sentence to one of my guides, the idea was not new to me. Growing up as the eldest granddaughter of a minister, I heard again every Easter the Bible story of Jesus' overheard prayer \"...Not my will, but Thine, be done.\" As a mystically inclined seeker of the Divine, I know it from passages in the Bhagavad Gita , the Emissaries of Divine Light , and the teachings of Yogananda. And in the world of energy healing, I immediately recalled the ways in which several teachers have shared this same philosophy with me. Spiritual healer and teacher Ken Page points out that whenever we send energy, even \"love and light,\" we are opening ourselves to an energy exchange. Something will come back to us from the person or situation we are targeting with our prayers. I would add that the more our intention is to change a person or situation, the more the energy that comes back to us will also try to change us! Drunvalo Melchizedek, author and originator of the MerKaBa Meditation, points out that we live in a polarized world. In this world where there is both good and evil, right and wrong, we create both aspects of whatever we wish for, even though our intention is to create only one aspect. When our prayers are formed \"for the good\" by our mental capacity, an equal amount of our energy is also creating the opposite effect. I find that Newton's Third Law of Motion, \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,\" applies to how we pray. If we indeed pray for what would appear to be a \"good\" outcome to any situation, then we are also unconsciously putting an equal amount of energy into praying for a \"bad\" outcome. How can this be? My metaphysical answer is this: Because we live in a world that is based on Free Will, we as a group of souls decided to create polarity. On a practical level , this means that what appears to me as \"bad\" might actually be the catalyst for a much larger movement of Spiritual growth. A friend recently reminded me of how much we as humans do not know about the larger plans of God and Spirit. \"If prayers for peace had been answered in 1861, there would still be slavery in America.\" Likewise, if peace had been the result of prayers offered at the outset of World War II, Hitler may have ruled much of the western world. In our human form, we are not able to see the larger picture of events that are working themselves out. It is only natural for us to pray for that which makes one more comfortable, happier, and healthier. But our soul's journey is to explore how we, while in human form, create comfort and ease, generate joy and find balance in our physical bodies . While our personality would prefer to jump to the end of our soul' s learning process and enter into a life of perfect comfort, our soul wants to learn all that is possible while here in human form. And sometimes that includes the experience of discomfort in order to motivate useful changes in our lives. In a study done in the 1990s, hospitalized cardiac patients were prayed for in directed and non-directed prayer, and compared to a group that received no prayers. (This was a small study, probably funded as part of the Complimentary and Alternative Medicine Studies, and most likely related to a university hospital. If you know this exact study, please let me know as I have lost the original published article.) Unlike many similar studies which divided patients into only two groups, this particular study divided patients into three groups. The group that received no prayers did the least well in terms of their physical recovery . The second group received prayers of directed healing: \"Please heal the heart of _______,\" for example. The third group of patients received non-directed healing. \"May God's will be done in the life of ________.\" Not surprisingly the third group of patients had the highest recovery rate. In similar studies, Spindrift Research (www.spindriftresearch.org) showed that prayers for the healing of living beings such as mold, yeast, and soybeans helped them recover from injuries and grow significantly more than those same plants that did not receive prayer. In the study involving soybeans, one group of soybeans was oversaturated with water while another group was not given enough water. Both groups of the soybeans were set out to receive prayers. Most of those praying did not know whether the soybeans they were praying for were too dry or too wet. Some soybeans received directed prayers (\"God let the soybeans have more moisture in order to sprout well\") while other soybeans received non-directed prayer (\"May the soybeans receive whatever they need\"). As their report states: \"With non goal-directed prayer, the group of over-soaked beans gave off water and moved down toward normal, and the under-soaked beans took on water and moved up toward normal. The different needs [of the soybeans] were met ...When prayer had a goal, which amounted to telling the two sets of beans what to do, the results had no relationship to what the beans needed. \" The group of soybeans receiving goal-directed prayers remained either over saturated with water or too dry . The potential within the soybeans receiving non goal-directed prayer to bring themselves into balance was activated by the energy of the prayers. This same inner potential to achieve balance was not successfully accessed by those soybeans receiving directed or goal-oriented prayers. This is a strong lesson for all of us, whether or not we consider ourselves to be healers. Letting ourselves honor, especially during times of great need, the innate intelligence of God that lies within each person or situation allows the power of Spirit that is already present within each person or situation to shine more brightly. Telling God how to heal a person, bring peace to a situation or fix a perceived problem actually constricts the movement of Spirit, and thus the potential healing that God would desire to bring through that person or situation. I have no doubt that it is easier to pray for a soybean to follow its own inner intelligence than to find within ourselves a space of neutrality and compassion from which we can pray without a fixed goal for those we know or for painful world situations. This is perhaps one of the most difficult lessons we, as humans, have decided to learn. Healing and prayer are not about results. Healing and prayer happen when we allow our own compassionate heart to open and simply be with another's pain. In this way God is awakened from within, and Love is remembered. ### Ann Arbor's Norma Gentile, sound shaman, is an intuitive healer and channeler.
