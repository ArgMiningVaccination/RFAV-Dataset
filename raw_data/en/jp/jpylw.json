One of our Nurse Practitioners, Eileen Tague, NP-C, is now a Certified Healing Touch Practitioner. She has been studying Healing Touch for five years. She recently completed the requirements for certification through the non-profit organization Healing Beyond Borders' Healing Touch Certificate Program. She has been practicing techniques in the hospital setting for ICU, and surgical patients, as well as for friends and colleagues as part of her training. She is excited to bring Healing Touch to Ardmore Family Practice. WHAT IS HEALING TOUCH? Healing Touch is a relaxing, nurturing, heart-centered energy therapy that uses gentle, intentional touch that assists in balancing physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well- being. Classified by the National Institutes of Health as a biofield therapy and nursing intervention, Healing Touch may be used to address the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA-1) diagnosis of \"Imbalanced Energy Field.\" Healing Touch is a collection of standardized, noninvasive techniques that clear, energize, and balance the human and environmental energy fields. Healing Touch assists in creating a coherent and balanced energy field, supporting one's inherent ability to heal. It is safe for all ages and works in harmony with, is complementary to, and may be integrated with standard medical care. Research suggests Healing Touch is beneficial in calming anxiety and reducing symptoms of depression, decreasing pain, strengthening the immune system, enhancing recovery from surgery, complementing care for neck and spine problems, deepening spiritual connection, supporting cancer care, creating a sense of well-being, easing acute and chronic conditions, and supporting resiliency in health care providers. - HOW CAN HEALING TOUCH BENEFIT YOU? Reduction of stress - Improving anxiety and depression - Decreasing pain - Immune function - Enhancing recovery from surgery - Deepening spiritual connections - Supporting cancer care - Research continues to build the evidence base of positive outcomes in response to Healing Touch. However, it should be noted that individual experiences may vary. WHAT HAPPENS DURING A HEALING TOUCH SESSION? The first session involves a consultation in addition to the Healing Touch session. The provider will ask a series of questions about your physical, mental, and emotional situation, and will answer questions about Healing Touch. Then you lay fully clothed on a massage table while the provider gently places his or her hands slightly above or on the body. The session generally lasts 40 to 60 minutes, and people frequently report feeling deeply relaxed and peaceful during and after the session. Because there may be a cumulative effect of using Healing Touch over time, regular sessions are recommended. As Healing Touch is considered a Complementary Medicine, Most Insurance policies do not cover it. We will be providing Healing Touch on a fee basis. Initial visit will be approximately one and a half hours long, including intake discussion and session. Each subsequent visit will be between 45 minutes and 1 hour, depending on the needs of the patient. Fees: $90 per session, including initial intake visit.
