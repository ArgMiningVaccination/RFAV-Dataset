Leptospirosis is an infectious disease transmitted to humans from rats, causing jaundice and kidney damage. The usual expectancy of infection even with allopathic vaccination is a few thousand, with some deaths included. Usually the high cost of vaccination means that all but the most at risk (children, pregnant women, the elderly) are left unvaccinated. The cost of this limited vaccination is about US $3,000,000. In November 2007 three provinces of the eastern region of Cuba were affected by strong rainfall, causing floods of big areas and damage to sanitary and health systems. The risk of Leptospirosis infection was high, with about 2 million people exposed to potentially contaminated water. The Finlay Institute, part of the Ministry of Health in Cuba and a centre dedicated to the development of both conventional and homeopathic vaccines, prepared a Leptospira nosode 200 CH using four circulating strains and following international quality standards. A multi-disciplinary team travelled to the affected regions to conduct the massive administration of the nosode. Coordinated action with public health system infrastructures allowed the administration of a preventive treatment consisting of two doses (seven to nine days apart) of the nosode to about 2.4 million people (4.8 million doses). The coverage of the intervention rose to 95 per cent of the total population of the three provinces at risk. The cost of the programme has been estimated at US$200,000. The epidemiology surveillance after the intervention showed a dramatic decrease of morbidity two weeks after, and a reduction to zero of mortality in hospitalised patients. The number of confirmed Leptospirosis cases remains at low levels and below the levels normally expected according with the trends and rain regimens.
