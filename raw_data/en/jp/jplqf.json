To date, no cases have been confirmed in Georgia, but the outbreak is having an impact on the Emory community, notes Emory President Claire E. Sterk. \"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is a reminder of how connected we are as a global community and how deeply affected many of our colleagues and friends are by this ongoing public health crisis,\" Sterk says. \"Our hearts especially go out to the Chinese students, researchers and faculty among our community who are concerned for their families and friends back home.\" During a recent visit to the Emory Student Center, she says she heard comments about the outbreak from students, a post-doctoral researcher and an Emory faculty member. \"All spoke of their concerns, fears and empathy for the lives of people directly affected, particularly residents of China, who are facing the brunt of the crisis,\" Sterk notes.

All Emory community members and visitors are welcome on campus, leaders emphasize. \"Thankfully, as a university, we have so many resources to put toward this fight, at the health care and research levels,\" Sterk says. \"But we have equal resources at the human level, which is why, as a community, we will continue to support our Chinese students and all university colleagues who need our understanding, encouragement and assistance during these very difficult times.\" Sources of support Emory also offers support resources that are available to faculty, staff and students who would like help responding to various concerns affecting their well-being: [Counseling and Psychological Services](http://counseling.emory.edu/)(CAPS) provides individual, group and couples counseling; stress management classes; and community outreach to provide support for students on the Atlanta campus and assist them in negotiating emotional and interpersonal difficulties as they matriculate through Emory University. 404-727-7450.
