We provide compassionate care in more than 75 communities throughout California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. Adventist Health entities include: 20 hospitals with more than 2,700 beds More than 260 clinics (hospital-based, rural health and physician clinics) 15 home care agencies and seven hospice agencies Four joint-venture retirement centers Workforce of 32,900 includes more than 23,600 employees; 5,000 medical staff physicians; and 4,350 volunteers We owe much of our heritage and organizational success to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has long been a promoter of prevention and whole person care. Inspired by our belief in the loving and healing power of Jesus Christ, we aim to bring physical, mental and spiritual health and healing to our neighbors of all faiths. Every individual, regardless of his/her personal beliefs, is welcome in our facilities. We are also eager to partner with members of other faiths to enhance the health of the communities we serve. Our commitment to quality health care stems from our heritage, which dates back to 1866 when the first Seventh-day Adventist health care facility opened in Battle Creek, Michigan. There, dedicated pioneers promoted the \"radical\" concepts of proper nutrition, exercise and sanitation. Early on, the facility was devoted to prevention as well as healing. They called it a sanitarium, a place where patients \u2014and their families \u2014could learn to be well. More than a century later, the health care system sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church circles the globe with more than 170 hospitals and more than 500 clinics, nursing homes and dispensaries worldwide. And the same vision to treat the whole person \u2014mind, body and spirit \u2014continues to provide the foundation for our progressive approach to health care. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 4 Letter from the CEO Dear Friends and Colleagues, I personally know the pain of losing a loved one to cancer. It is a journey that stretches your heart and your resources past what you ever thought you could bear. In our communities of Simi Valley and Moorpark, cancer is the leading cause of death. This stark fact is more than a number on a page; it represents individual lives \u2014 husbands, mothers, friends, colleagues. Cancer robs our community and hurts us more than we can measure. Of all the cancers diagnosed in our county, lung cancer is responsible for the most deaths. In response to this data, Simi Valley Hospital is launching a lung cancer screening program this year, and we are looking forward to finding ways to offer screening to the people who need it the most. This initiative will join Simi Valle y Hospital's many other cancer -related efforts: Our nurse navigators help cancer patients make it through the emotional and often confusing journey of treatment and recovery\u2014 a service they provide to anyone, regardless of where the patient is receiving care. We host, fund and promote support groups that are free to all. We provide hospital-based palliative care to help our cancer patients cope with the serious and often difficult health issues that accompany their diagnosis. We offer free grief counseling and support. We host an annual Cancer Survivors Day. We provide education and health articles to raise awareness. We sponsor local nonprofit organizations that help our community when they need it most. Our Patient Financial Services team works with patients and their loved ones to understand their medical bills and answer any questions they have. In addition, Simi Valley Hospital is on its way to becoming an accredited cancer center, which will enable us to better serve members of our community who find themselves traveling the path of cancer treatment and recovery.

The care they need may be too far away, they may need a specialist who doesn't practice in this area, or th ey may be limited by their own physical circumstances. Simi Valley Hospital continually assesses the gaps and makes the resolution of these needs a fundamental part of our strategic planning. Our community needs more surgeons, more psychiatry, more wellness and prevention programs, and a variety of other services that can be difficult to get close to home. We are actively recruiting psychiatrists to our community, opening an urgent care center in Moorpark, and expanding our service lines to include more education, prevention and wellness activities. In addition, we are supporting a clinically integrated network, which offers a continuum of care that provides a better experience for patients and, ultimately, enhances their health and wellness. Diabetes and its complications are behind many of the medical issues we see at the hospital. For instance, it often contributes to heart disease, which is the second-leading cause of death in our community. The growth of diabetes in our community is staggering and leads to decades of poor health. People with diabetes can benefit from exercise, nutrition counseling, and help with breaking habits such as smoking and using recreational drugs and alcohol. Simi Valley Hospital is working with community nonprofits to offer real interventions that can address these areas of need. We are looking forward to reporting and sharing our success in these endeavors in the years ahead. Though we're just at the beginning of this journey toward providing more opportunities for wellness and prevention, we are deeply committed to investing in life-enhancing programs that will encourage kids to exercise and cook at home, and will help their parents make healthier choices. We are seeking opportunities to support community sports programs, as well as community events that center around exercise and family fun activities. Our goal in 2017 is to transform the way we fund our nonprofit partners by focusing on specific and measurable actions that will improve the health of our community. Perhaps our most serious and important community challenge is the continued growth in mental health and substance abuse issues. Our desire is to take the lead in helping our community get better at preventing these problems \u2014catching them before they have a chance to take root. By investing in education and programs in exercise and nutrition, we believe we can help some of those who would have otherwise been at risk to avoid that destructive path. We must invest in more resources for people who need counseling and psychiatric care. In addition to the two psychiatrists we are recruiting to the community this year, we are working on care plans for patients who come to us with mental health and/or substance abuse issues. It is vital that we work closely with our community partners to find solutions to address the current crisis and prevent future problems. I am honored to be the president and CEO of Simi Valley Hospital during this time of transition in health care delivery. My dream is for our hospital to be a partner and a beacon in our community, bringing hope and healing to the broken.

We recognize that health status is a product of multiple factors. To comprehensively address the needs of our community, we must take into account health behaviors and risks, the physical environment, the health system, and social determinant of health. Each component influences the next and through strategic and collective action improved health can be achieved. The Community Health Plan marks the second phase in a collaborative effort to systematically investigate and identify our community's most pressing needs. After a thorough review of health status in our community through the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), we identified areas that we could address through the use of our resources, expertise, and community partners. Through these actions and relationships, we aim to empower our community and fulfill our mission, \"to share God's love by providing physical, menta l and spiritual healing.\" Identified Community Needs The results of the CHNA guided the creation of this document and aided us in how we could best provide for our community and the most vulnerable among us. As a result, Simi Valley Hospital has adopted the following priority areas for our community health investments for 2017-2019: Access to health care Cancer Diabetes Mental health/substance abuse Additionally, we engage in a process of continuous quality improvement, whereby we ask the following questions for each priority area: Are our interventions making a difference in improving health outcomes? Are we providing the appropriate resources in the appropriate locations? What changes or collaborations within our system need to be made? How are we using technology to track our health improvements and provide relevant feedback at the local level? Do we have the resources as a region to elevate the population's health status? Building a healthy community requires multiple stakeholders working together with a common purpose. We invite you to explore how we intend to address health challenges in our community and partner to achieve change. More importantly though, we hope you imagine a healthier region and work with us to find solutions across a broad range of sectors to create communities we all want for ourselves and our families.COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 9 Together Inspired Community Profile How our community is defined Simi Valley Hospital is located at 2975 North Sycamore Drive, Simi Valley, CA 93065. The hospital service area includes the cities of Simi Valley and Moorpark in Ventura County. Inpatient hospital acute admission data indicate that the majority of admissions come from Simi Valley (zip codes 93063 and 93065) and Moorpark (zip code 93021). Demographics of the community The population of the Simi Valley Hospital service area is 165,367.

The county rate exceeds the Healthy People 2020 objective for high school graduation of 82.4%. Priority Areas Identified The identified significant health needs were prioritized with input from the community. The priority needs the hospital chose to address are: Access to health care - Health insurance coverage is considered a key component to accessing health care. The service area insurance rate is 88.9%. This is above the rate for the county (84.8%) and state (80.3%). In the Simi Valley Hospital service area, health insurance coverage ranges from a low of 88.5% of residents with insurance in Simi Valley (93065), to a high of 89.3% with insurance in Moorpark. In Ventura County, 52% of the population has employment-based health insurance and 11.7% are covered by Medi-Cal.

In Ventura County, 6.4% of adults had seriously considered suicide . Among adults, 35.3% of county adults had engaged in binge drinking in the past year. 7.1% of teens in Ventura County had tried marijuana, cocaine, sniffing glue, and other drugs . Information gaps Information gaps that impact the ability to assess health needs were identified. Some of the secondary data are not always collected on a regular basis, meaning that some data are several years old. Primary data collection and the prioritization process were also subject to limitations. Themes identified during interviews were likely subject to the experience of individuals selected to provide input. The final prioritized list of significant health needs is also subject to the affiliation and experience of the individuals who participated in the prioritization process. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 11 Together Inspired Community Health Needs Assessment Overview Link to final CHNA report The 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2016 and can be accessed at: https://www.adventisthealth.org/simi -valley -hospital/pages/about -us/community - benefits.aspx . Methodology for CHNA For the Community Health Needs Assessment secondary data were collected from a variety of local, county, and state sources to present community demographics, social and economic factors, health care access, birth characteristics, leading causes of death, chronic disease, mental health, health behaviors, substance abuse and preventive practices. These data are presented in the context of Ventura County and California State, framing the scope of an issue as it relates to the broader community. Targeted interviews were used to gather information and opinions from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital. Fifteen interviews were completed during June and July, 2016. Interviewees included individuals who are leaders and representatives of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations, or regional, state or local health or other departments or agencies that have current data or other information relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facility. The analysis of secondary and primary data yielded a preliminary list of significant health needs: Access to health care Cancer Cardiovascular disease Diabetes Mental health Overweight/obesity Preventive practices (screenings, vaccines) Substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, tobacco) The identified significant health needs were then prioritized with input from the community. The following criteria were used to prioritize the health needs: The perceived severity of a health issue or health factor/driver as it affects the health and lives of those in the community; The level of importance the hospital should place on addressing the issue. Mental health, access to care and substance abuse were ranked as the top three priority needs in the service area. The calculations of the community input resulted in the following prioritization of the significant health needs: Mental health Access to care Substance abuse COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 12 Together Inspired Preventive practices Cancer Diabetes Overweight and obesity Cardiovascular disease Community Voices Stakeholder interviewee input was obtained to prioritize the health needs. As noted, int erviewees included individuals who are leaders and representatives of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations, or health departments that have current data or other information relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facility. Input was obtained from Ventura County Health Care Agency officials. Each of the stakeholder interviewees was sent a link to an electronic survey (Survey Monkey) and were asked to rank each identified health need. The percentage of responses were noted as those that identified the need as having severe or very severe impact on the community, had worsened over time, and had a shortage or absence of resources available in the community. Not all survey respondents answered every question, therefore, the response percentages were calculated based on respondents only and not on the entire sample size.

The hospital cannot address all the health needs present in the community; therefore, it will concentrate on those health needs that can most effectively be addressed given the organization's areas of focus and expertise. Simi Valley Hospital will look for partnership opportunities that address needs not selected where it can appropriately contribute to addressing those needs, or where those needs align with current strategy and priorities. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 21 Together Inspired Making a difference: Eva luation of 2014 -2016 CHP Simi Valley Hospital developed and approved an Implementation Strategy to address significant health needs identified in the 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment. The Implementation Strategy addressed the following health needs through a commitment of community benefit programs and resources: access to care, cancer, cardiovascular disease, overweight and obesity, drugs/alcohol and mental health. To accomplish the Implementation Strategy, goals were established that indicated the expected changes in the health needs as a result of community programs and activities. Strategies to address the priority health needs were identified and impact measures tracked. The following section outlines the impact made on the selected significant health needs addressed in the 2014 -2016 Community Health Plan . Access to Care The hospital provided financial assistance through free and discounted care for health care services, consistent with Simi Valley Hospital's financial assistance policy. To address health care access issues, the hospital also offered information and enrollment assistance in low-cost insurance programs. The hospital continued to provide transportation support for those patients and families who may not be able to access needed care due to a lack of transportation. Simi Valley Hospital has had a long -standing partnership with the Free Clinic of Simi Valley. This partnership supported the provision of health care services to over 40,000 patient visits for residents in our community who are uninsured or underinsured. Through this partnership, hospital employees provided needed administrative and clinical training for the Free Clinic staff. Simi Valley also provided lab services, radiology service and mammograms for clinic patients. Additionally, the hospital compensated employees for one shift per year when they volunteered at the Free Clinic of Simi Valley. The hospital provided a cash donation to the Free Clinic of Simi Valley to update their Electronic Medical Records system. In 2013, Simi Valley Hospital provided emergency contact through Lifeline devices for low-income seniors in Simi Valley and Moorpark. The Lifeline Program provided a system of equipment and trained responders for people who fall or who cannot reach a phone during a health -related emergency. The program averaged 300 subscribers a month. In 2014, the hospital partnered with the Free Clinic of Simi Valley for a community health fair. Approximately 800 people participated in the fair, which promoted positive health and fitness practices, and activities for youth and adults. Simi Valley provided health education on heart health and strokes, administered 420 flu shots, 105 glucose screenings and 18 carotid artery screenings. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 22 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope In 2015, we completed Phase 1 of the Emergency Department expansion. The Emergency Pavilion encompasses 5,000 square feet of new ED space, bringing the number of patient beds from 10 to 22. This ED expansion increases access for the community to life-saving emergency care. In an effort to increase access to care, Simi Valley Hospital launched an outpatient Speech -Language Therapy program so that adults with acquired impairments in communication, cognition, voice and swallowing could access needed treatment without having to travel long distances for care. We partnered with the Simi Valley Senior Center to provide free blood glucos e scre enings. In an effort to reduce head injuries among teen athletes, we partnered with the Simi Valley Unified School District and a local Concussion Clinic to provide free baseline testing to all public high school athletes in Simi Valley. Cancer Simi Valley Hospital partnered with the Free Clinic of Simi Valley to provide 40 free mammograms to underserved women in the community. With support from the Rotary Club of Simi Sunrise, Simi Valley Hospital offered a Pampered in Pink event to increase awareness about breast cancer, celebrate survivors and remember loved ones who have lost their battle with cancer. Over the years, approximately 275 people attended the event, which included: Breast health education Nurse Navigator tours and information American Cancer Society informational booth Wellness Community informational booth Oncologists and radiologist available for questions The hospital provided cancer -related health education sessions and support groups. Screening, treatment and survivorship programs were made available to the public at no cost. Cardiovascular Disease As part of our Take Heart Simi Valley initiative, which is an ongoing effort to teach hands -only CPR to all of Simi Valley, Simi Valley Hospital has taught more than 2,100 people hands -only CPR throughout the community since 2013. We offered heart health education, support groups and cardiovascular screening, and presented heart health lectures, reaching more than 400 people. We continued our support of American Heart Association events. Simi Valley Hospital partnered with the American Heart Association on two events to raise awareness of heart disease in women. 75 women attended a heart healthy dinner and education event co-sponsored with the American Heart Association. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 23 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope We offered heart health education, support groups and cardiovascular screening, and started a Heart Attack Survivors Support group that is led by a heart attack survivor. Simi Valley Hospital is dedicated to battling heart disease by raising awareness through increased education. In honor of American Heart Month, Simi Valley Hospital sponsored activities to raise awareness about preventing heart disease and living a healthy life. Simi Valley Hospital partnered with the American Heart Association to provide a Go Red Girlfriends event on February 5, 2014. The event, attended by 55 women, included a free heart -healthy dinner, educational information about heart care for women, and a presentation by an interventional cardiologist. On September 10, 2015 Simi Valley Hospital once again partnered with the American Heart Association to provide a Girls Night Out event to encourage women to learn more about the role of heart disease in women's lives and steps women can take to prevent heart disease. The event, attended by 110 women, offered heart -healthy cooking demonstrations, massage, yoga, blood pressure screenings, heart health education, and hands -only CPR demonstrations. In 2015 we launched an extensive campaign to promote heart health and educate the community on the signs and symptoms of a heart attack. We partnered with a heart attack survivor to start a Heart Attack Support Group and utilized his story in our campaign. Through continued Hands -Only CPR demonstrations, we have increased the number of persons saved by bystander in our community. As a result, Ventura County has one of the highest survivor rates of bystander -witnessed heart failure in the country. Drug/Alcohol and Mental Health Simi Valley Hospital participated with community organizations to develop strategies to improve drug/alcohol and mental health services, including partnering with Community Coalition United for education offerings and mental health trainings. We increased access to care by developing inpatient hospital alcohol and drug detoxification services. The Hospital hosted Simi Valley High Schools \"Every Fifteen Minutes\" program to educate students about the dangers of alcohol and drug use. In partnership with the local school district, we continued to offer voluntary drug test for students. Also, in 2015 we provided two Mental Health First Aid Trainings for 40 community members. As a result of the growing issue of unused and unneeded medications becoming the target of theft, misuse and abuse, we partnered with the Simi Valley Police Department to educate the public on how to properly dispose of expired, unwanted, or unused prescription drugs and other medications from their homes and our community. The hospital offered a Prescription Drug Drop Box available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to safely dispose of unwanted or expired medications.

COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 35 Together Inspired Connecting Strategy and Community Health As hospitals move toward population health management, community health interventions are a key element in achieving the overall goals of reducing the overall cost of health care, improving th e health of the population, and improving access to affordable health services for the community both in outpatient and community settings. The key factor in improving quality and efficiency of the care hospitals provide is to include the larger community they serve as a part of their overall strategy. Health systems must now step outside of the traditional roles of hospitals to begin to address the social, economic, and environmental conditions that contribute to poor health in the communities we serve. Bold leadership is required from our administrators, health care providers, and governing boards to meet the pressing health challenges we face as a nation. These challenges include a paradigm shift in how hospitals and health systems are positioning them selves and their strategies for success in a new payment environment. This will impact everyone in a community and will require shared responsibility among all stakeholders. Population health is not just the overall health of a population but also includ es the distribution of health. Overall health could be quite high if the majority of the population is relatively healthy \u2014even though a minority of the population is much less healthy. Ideally such differences would be eliminated or at least substantially reduced. Community health can serve as a strategic platform to improve the health outcomes of a defined group of people, concentrating on three correlated stages: 1) The distribution of specific health statuses and outcomes within a population; 2) Factors that cause the present outcomes distribution; and 3) Interventions that may modify the factors to improve health outcomes. Improving population health requires effective initiatives to: 1) Increase the prevalence of evidence -based preventive health services and p reventive health behaviors, 2) Improve care quality and patient safety and 3) Advance care coordination across the health care continuum. Our mission as a health system is to share God's love by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing and we believe the best way to re -imagine our future business model with a major emphasis of community health is by working together with our communit y.

Adventist Health promotes effective, sustainable community benefit programming in support of our mission and tax -exempt status. DEFINITIONS 1. Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) : A CHNA is a dynamic and ongoing process that is undertaken to identify the health strengths and needs of the respective community of each Adventist Health hospital. The CHNA will include a two document process, the first being a detailed document h ighlighting the health related data within each hospital community and the second document (Community Health Plan or CHP) containing the identified health priorities and action plans aimed at improving the identified needs and health status of that communi ty. A CHNA relies on the collection and analysis of health data relevant to each hospital's community, the identification of priorities and resultant objectives and the development of measurable action steps that will enable the objectives to be measur ed and tracked over time. 2. Community Health Plan: The CHP is the second component of the CHNA and represents the response to the data collection process and identified priority areas. For each health need, the CHP must either: a) describe how the hospita l plans to meet the identified health need, or b) identify the health need as one the hospital does not intend to specifically address and provide an explanation as to why the hospital does not intend to address that health need. 3. Community Benefit: A comm unity benefit is a program, activity or other intervention that provides treatment or promotes health and healing as a response to identified community needs and meets at least one of these objectives: Improve access to health care services Enhance the he alth of the community Advance medical or health care knowledge Relieve or reduce the burden of government or other community efforts Community benefits include charity care and the unreimbursed costs of Medicaid and other means -tested government programs for the indigent, as well as health professions' education, research, community health improvement, subsidized health services and cas h and in -kind contributions for community benefit.
