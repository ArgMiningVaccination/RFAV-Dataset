What is diverticulitis? What are the symptoms and what are some of the naturopathic tips you can use to help you manage the symptoms of diverticulitis? Diverticula are small pockets, or out pouches that develop in weakened segments of the colon or the large intestine, usually in the sigmoid portion on the lower left side. Their presence in the large intestine is called diverticulosis and is rare before age 40. They become increasingly common with advancing age and by age 80, almost everyone has at least a few. Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches (diverticula) become inflamed or infected, and if left untreated, can lead to serious complications. A low-fiber diet made up of highly processed foods, along with chronic constipation, is believed to cause diverticulosis. Most people with diverticula never experienced symptoms. If the pouches fill with fecal material, however they become infected and inflamed, which can lead to intense pain and fever. Sometimes an inflamed pouch ruptures and spills infective material into the abdominal cavity, causing intense pain, a high fever, and a life-threatening infection (peritonitis); severe bleeding is also a serious risk. See your medical doctor as soon as possible if you develop abdominal pain, bloody stools and other symptoms of diverticulitis. During a flare- up, applying an ice pack to the painful area may bring relief; however, do not use a heating pad, which can worsen inflammation and may even cause a diverticulum to rupture. Mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with oral antibiotics and a liquid diet to give the colon a chance to heal. Symptoms usually abate in a few days; then a soft diet of simple bland, pureed foods can be started. Avoid raw fruits or vegetables, whole grains, berries with seeds, corn, hot spices, alcohol, and caffeine. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, may be needed to rule out appendicitis, colon cancer, and other disorders than can cause similar symptoms. An attack marked by severe pain, high fever, and possible intestinal bleeding usually requires hospitalization. Pain medication may be given to ease the pain, and intravenous antibiotics are administered to quell the infection. A ruptured diverticulum, severe bleeding, and fistulas (abnormal connections with other organs) may require surgery to remove the deceased segment of the colon. The naturopathic approach to diverticulitis includes a thorough assessment to identify what the root cause of the problem maybe and then doing the appropriate tests such as blood to identify any vitamin or mineral deficiencies, and food sensitivities or allergies that maybe affecting your digestive system.
