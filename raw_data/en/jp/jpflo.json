Following a healthy eating pattern throughout your lifetime can help reduce your risk of disease and improve your overall wellbeing. In this book, you will find strategies, tips and resources to help you and your family build a healthy eating pattern. A HEALTHY EATING PATTERN Includes These Foods Limits These Foods A variety of vegetables Fruits, especially whole fruits Whole grains Low-fat dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) A variety of proteins, such as seafood, lean meat and poultry (chicken, turkey), eggs, dairy, beans, peas, nuts and soy products Healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds Saturated fat, trans fats Sodium (salt) Red meat Processed meats with nitrates or nitrites Added sugars, including sugary beverages Alcoholic beverages Building a Healthy Plate. A good resource to help you find a healthy eating pattern and build a healthy plate is the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate and the MyPlate Plan. The MyPlate Plan creates a personalized food plan for you based on your age, sex, height, weight and physical activity level. Visit www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan for more information and to get your MyPlate Plan. NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 3Plant-Based Eating. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommends that at least two-thirds of the food on your plate should be plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans. Plant-based eating decreases risk of disease. Plant-based eating also adds phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals and fibers that may be difficult to get in good amounts if you are eating a typical Western diet of 50 percent animal protein (meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy). Plant foods are also often lower in calories than animal products, so eating plant foods helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Use the following tips to make the change to plant-based eating. Plan your meals around plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains, instead of meat or animal products. Choose a colorful variety of vegetables and fruits to get the most nutrients. Aim to fill at least two-thirds of your plate with plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans. Keep animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy) to one-third or less of your plate. When eating animal proteins, opt for seafood, poultry or low-fat dairy. Limit red meat to no more than 12 to 18 cooked ounces a week. Avoid processed meats, such as hot dogs, bacon and sausage. Instead of always choosing animal proteins, try adding more plant proteins\u2014 beans, legumes, nuts and seeds\u2014 to your meals. Try swapping animal proteins for plant proteins at one or two meals a day. Make gradual changes. Do not make sudden changes to your diet, especially if you have digestive issues or food sensitivities. A sudden increase in the amount of plant fibers in your meals can contribute to digestive issues. You may have to modify your approach. Work plant-based foods into your daily food choices gradually. The important thing is that you are eating more plants. Nutrients. \"Nutrients\" are the substances in food that provide nourishment and support growth and healthy bodily functions. Nutrients can be divided into macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are nutrients that your body needs in large amounts and that provide the body with energy (calories). Protein, carbohydrates and fat are macronutrients. Micronutrients are nutrients the body needs in smaller amounts to support growth and healthy bodily functions. Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. The best way to get all the nutrients your body needs is by eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains and healthy fats.4 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgNUTRIENT BENEFITS FOOD SOURCES Carbohydrates Carbohydrates, \"carbs,\" provide the body with energy for physical activity. Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, dairy products. Fat Healthy fats provide energy, help the body absorb and transport vitamins, and protect organs.Vegetable oils, fatty fish, avocado, olives, seeds and nuts contain healthy fats. Trans fat increases the risk of heart disease. Avoid trans fat when possible. Cakes, cookies, chips, fried foods, creamer and margarine often contain trans fat. Protein Protein acts as a \"builder.\" The body uses protein to build and repair tissues and to make hormones and enzymes that promote the body's daily functions. This supports a healthy immune system.Meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, beans, nuts, seeds, soy and fortified* cereals You can also add protein to your meals and beverages with a protein powder or nutrition supplement drink, if needed. Ask members of your healthcare team for a recommendation.

While the body does need a small amount of sodium, most people in the United States get much more sodium than the body needs. Processed foods tend to have a large amount of sodium. Too much sodium can increase the risk of heart disease. ** Due to cancer or cancer treatment, some patients experience low-sodium levels (hyponatremia). Symptoms can include nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness. If untreated, hyponatremia can lead to serious complications. Talk to your healthcare team about your risk for low-sodium levels. 6 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgNUTRIENT BENEFITS FOOD SOURCES Vitamin A Supports eye health, the immune system, reproduction, growth and healthy organ function Salmon, leafy greens, sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, squash, cantaloupe, apricots, mangos, dairy, organ meats (eg, liver) and fortified cereals Vitamin B6 Supports metabolism, the chemical reactions that convert food to energy in the bodyPoultry, fish, organ meats (eg, liver), potatoes, fruits (other than citrus), milk and some whole grains Vitamin B12Supports healthy blood and nerve cells and helps make genetic material (DNA) in cells Fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk and fortified foods, such as some cereals Vitamin C Supports the immune system, wound healing, and improves iron absorption Citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit), tomato juice, broccoli, peppers, cantaloupe and strawberries Vitamin D Helps the body absorb calcium for strong bones and supports nerve and immune functionFortified products, such as dairy, orange juice, egg yolks and cereals.

For more on vitamins and minerals, visit the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements at www.ods.od.nih.gov/factsheet to view detailed factsheets about many vitamins, minerals, herbs and more. Portion Size. At restaurants and at home, big plates with large amounts of food have become common. Often, what a person views as a single portion is actually multiple servings. This is called \"portion distortion.\" A serving size is a standardized, measured amount of food, such as the amount used for Nutrition Facts labels (see Understanding the \"Nutrition Facts\" Label for more information on page 14). A portion size is the amount you choose to eat. It can be either more or less than a serving size. Learning to distinguish serving size from portion size helps correct portion distortion. Know the size of your bowls, cups and plates. Measure how much your bowls, glasses, cups and plates hold. o Example: Pour your breakfast cereal into your regular bowl. Then, pour it into a measuring cup. How many cups of cereal do you eat when you use this bowl? According to the Nutrition Facts label of your cereal, how much is one serving? Use smaller plates for your food so you do not feel under-served or tempted to fill up a larger plate with extra servings. When eating at home, make your plate in the kitchen and do not have serving bowls at the table with you. It is tempting to eat more when food is within reach. Restaurant portions are often more than a single serving. Ask for a to-go box before you start to eat. Put half of your food in the box, put it away, and then finish the smaller portion that's left on your plate. This can help you avoid overeating.Q. Do I need to take supplements? A. Choose a variety of whole foods as your first source of vitamins and other nutrients. This is the best way to get the nutrients your body needs. You may not need supplements. If you do need them, your doctor or a registered dietitian can advise you on which supplements to take. Ask your doctor before taking any supplements, vitamins, or herbs, as they may interact with medications you are taking. DIETITIAN TIP8 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org The chart on page 9 explains the serving sizes of common foods. Use the visual cues in this chart to \"eyeball\" your portions so you know how many servings you are actually eating. You can also check the Nutrition Facts label to learn the serving size of a food. Visit www.pearlpoint.org/portion for more information about portion control. Hydration. The \"8 X 8\" rule is a good place to start. Aim to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of caffeine-free fluid a day. Your fluid needs can change based on your health and activity level. Ask your healthcare provider for a specific daily fluid goal. Follow these tips to stay hydrated. Drink fluids throughout the day instead of waiting to drink when you feel thirsty. Keep a cup or bottle of water in sight at all times to remind you to drink. If you do not like plain water, try sparkling water, flavored water, adding berries or slices of lemon, cucumbers or lime, or mixing water with a splash of 100% fruit juice. Food contains some fluid as well, but only fluids that are liquid at room temperature, such as soups or popsicles, count toward your hydration goal.

Children develop eating habits early in life and carry these habits into adulthood. All children can learn how to make good food choices. You can use the following strategies to teach your children healthy eating habits: Be a role model. Let your child see you eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins. Introduce foods again, again and again. If your child does not like a food the first time you serve it, try again. Children may need to try a food many times before they enjoy it. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests it may take up to 15 tries before a child accepts a new food. However, do not force your child to eat. Many people have foods they do not enjoy. Encourage a colorful plate. Children often gravitate toward high-carbohydrate, starchy or bland foods, such as chicken nuggets, macaroni, fried potatoes and bread. Teach your child to eat a rainbow of foods\u2014not just brown or tan ones. Eating a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables is a good way to get many different healthy nutrients. NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 11 Add \"secret\" extra vegetables to dishes your child already enjoys to increase intake. For example, add chopped mushrooms, zucchini or carrots to spaghetti. Make fruits and vegetables available. Leave whole fruits like apples or bananas out for your child. Keep cut up fruits and veggies in the fridge. If healthy snacks are readily available, it is more likely your child will eat them. Avoid buying packaged, processed snacks (such as cookies, chips and candy). If they are available, your child may eat them and ignore other healthier options. Avoid using food as a reward. Foods used as rewards are typically candy or other desserts. These items often have little nutritional value and may take the place of other foods with more nutritional value, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and proteins. Use stickers or verbal praise to reward your child instead. Visit www.pearlpoint.org/ChildhoodNutrition for more information about childhood nutrition. Weight Management. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Benefits of maintaining a healthy weight or healthy body size include: Decreased risk of disease Increased energy and wellbeing Improved strength and mobility More restful sleep Every person is unique. Talk to your healthcare team to determine a healthy weight goal for you. Your healthcare team will take into account your medical history, lifestyle, and health goals to determine your healthy weight. If you need either to lose or gain weight to reach your healthy weight, talk to a registered dietitian. Try to find a dietitian with whom you can speak on Q. Are all weight-loss diets safe and effective? A. Weight-loss diets marketed on TV and social media are often fad diets. Fad diets do not work, especially not over the long term. Some fad diets can even be dangerous if they are very restrictive or eliminate entire food groups. This is especially true if you have other health conditions or if you are receiving cancer treatment. Talk to your healthcare team or a registered dietitian before making big changes to your diet. Additionally, do not take any pills or supplements for weight loss without talking to your healthcare team. Most of these pills do not work and could interfere with other medications. DIETITIAN TIP12 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orga regular basis. Use the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) locator at www.eatright.org/find-an-expert to find a registered dietitian in your area. You can also ask your primary care provider or health insurance provider for a referral. A registered dietitian can help create a plan that is right for your needs so you can reach and maintain your weight goal in a safe and healthy way. Do not expect or even try to change your entire lifestyle overnight. Gradual changes are the best way to achieve and maintain results over the long term. Visit www.pearlpoint.org/WeightManagement for more information about reaching and maintaining your goal weight. Alcohol. Heavy drinking and/or binge drinking increases your risk for liver disease, pancreatitis, certain cancers, cognitive (thinking) changes, and alcohol abuse disorders. If you do choose to drink, limit consumption to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men and only if you are an adult of legal drinking age. \"One drink\" is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Mouth Care. The mouth is the first stop for turning food into fuel. Here are some things you can do to maintain a healthy mouth and strong teeth. Brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste two to three times a day. Gently floss teeth daily. Note for Persons Receiving Cancer Treatment For cancer patients, treatment, medications and side effects may make it difficult to eat enough food to stay well-nourished. Attempting to lose weight is not usually recommended if you are a cancer patient in active treatment. It may be hard for your body to get the nutrition it needs with the added burden of a restrictive, weight-loss diet. If you are concerned about your weight, talk to members of your healthcare team or a registered dietitian before making changes to your lifestyle and food choices. PearlPoint Nutrition Services\u00ae, a program of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), offers free nutrition consultations to cancer patients and caregivers by phone and email. Visit www.LLS.org/consult to schedule.NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 13 o If you are receiving cancer treatment, ask your oncology healthcare team if it is okay to floss. If your platelet count is low, flossing may increase the risk of bleeding. If your white blood cell count is low, flossing may increase the risk of infection. Visit your dentist for a checkup and cleaning at least once a year. o If you are a cancer patient in treatment, talk to your oncology healthcare team before visiting the dentist or having dental work done. You may need to take special precautions or postpone your dental work. Do not use tobacco products. Visit www.smokefree.gov for more information and to get help to quit. Keep your mouth moist. If medication causes dry mouth, talk to your doctor about ways to manage dry mouth, such as drinking fluids, chewing sugarless gum or using a saliva substitute. Exercise. Exercise offers other health benefits in addition to helping you reach and maintain a healthy weight. Regular exercise promotes good cardiovascular (heart) health and emotional wellbeing, too. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week. This time can be broken up over several days. Physical activity includes walking, jogging, swimming, biking, playing sports, etc. Include strength training and stretching, along with aerobic exercise, to build muscle and increase flexibility. For additional health benefits, AICR also recommends avoiding extended periods of inactivity (eg, watching TV or sitting at a computer). Break up your day by getting up and walking around for at least a few minutes every hour. Try setting a reminder on your phone or computer calendar. Q. What are probiotics? A. Probiotics aid in digestion and support immunity. Probiotics are the good bacteria like those naturally found in your gut or intestinal tract. Food sources of probiotics include yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso soup, sour pickles, tempeh, and milk with probiotics (buttermilk and sweet acidophilus). In some cases, your body may need more probiotics than you can get from food. Ask your doctor or registered dietitian if a probiotic supplement would be beneficial for you. However, your doctor may advise you to avoid probiotic foods and supplements if you are immunosuppressed. DIETITIAN TIP14 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgTalk to your healthcare team before beginning any exercise plan. You may need to work up to a goal of 150 minutes per week or set a goal that has been adjusted to meet your needs. If you have mobility issues, ask for a referral to a physical therapist. For more information, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Healthy Behaviors . Understanding the \"Nutrition Facts\" Label The Nutrition Facts label, found on all packaged foods, follows guidelines set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The label gives you information about the contents of the food in the package which can help you make good food choices. SERVING SIZE CALORIES AIM TO CONSUME 100% DAILY VALUE (OR MORE) OF THESE NUTRIENTSAIM TO LIMIT THESE NUTRIENTS www.fda.gov November 2019 Calories 230Amount per servingServing size 2/3 cup (55g)8 servings per container % Daily Value* Total Fat 8g Saturated Fat 1g Trans Fat 0g Cholesterol 0mg Sodium 160mg Total Carbohydrate 37g Dietary Fiber 4g Total The (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.*Vitamin D 2mcg Calcium www.fda.gov October 2019(For educational purposes only. These labels do not meet the labeling requirements described in 21 CFR 101.9.) NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 15Serving Size. The top of the Nutrition Facts label tells you the serving size and the number of servings in the container or package. The serving size is not a recommendation of how much you should eat or drink. It is a standardized measurement to make it easier to compare foods. If you are keeping track of your calories or nutrient intake, make sure to take into account the amount of the food you actually eat. People often eat more than the specified single-serving size at one time. For example, if a serving is one cup but you eat two cups, you need to double the amounts listed on the label to accurately measure what you ate. You may find it helpful to measure your food to keep track of the number of servings you eat. On some food products, the Nutrition Facts label may have two columns. One column shows information for a single serving. The other column shows information for the entire package. Calories. The next information on the nutrition label is the amount of calories per serving. A calorie is a measurement of energy. Calorie information can help you manage your weight if you need to gain, lose, or maintain your body weight. The Nutrition Facts label is based on a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet. Your calorie needs may be either more or less than 2,000 calories. People undergoing cancer treatment may need to consume more calories to give their body the energy it needs to recover from treatment. The amount of calories a person needs each day depends on a lot of factors including: Sex Age Physical activity level Nutritional needs Whether the person aims to lose, maintain, or gain weight Ask your doctor or a registered dietitian for a daily calorie goal based on your needs. Calories are not the only important information on the Nutrition Facts label. Even though many people consume more calories than they need, they still do not get the recommended amounts of important nutrients. A food that is low in calories but also low in nutrients may not be a good food choice. A food that is high in calories may be a good food choice if it is also high in the nutrients your body needs.16 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgNutrients and % Daily Value (DV). Based on a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet, the % Daily Value tells you the percentage of the recommended daily intake for each nutrient. For example, a food with 5% of the Daily Value of fiber provides 5% of the total fiber that a person consuming 2,000 calories a day should eat each day. The amount you need of a specific nutrient may be either more or less than the recommended Daily Value. Ask your doctor or a registered dietitian for guidance. Even if your nutritional needs are different from those shown on the Nutrition Facts label, you can still use the % Daily Value to determine whether a serving of a food is high or low in a nutrient. A low % Daily Value is 5% or less. Choose foods that are low in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. Aim to eat less than 100% of the Daily Value for these nutrients each day. A high % Daily Value is 20% or more. Choose foods that are high in dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium. Aim to eat 100% of the Daily Value or more of these nutrients each day. Nutrients Without % Daily Values. The % Daily Values are not listed on the label for trans fat and total sugars because there are no recommendations for the amount to eat per day. Aim to keep your intake of trans fats as low as possible. Trans fats are linked to increased risk of heart disease. Examples of foods that may contain trans fats includes baked goods, chips, fried foods, creamer, and margarine. Aim to keep your daily intake of added sugar below 25 grams for women and below 37 grams for men. \"Added sugars\" are sugars added during preparation or processing, or are packaged as such (eg, table sugar). Examples of foods that contain added sugar include syrups and honey, sugar-sweetened Q. Does sugar cause cancer? A. Sugar does not directly cause cancer, nor does it specifically \"feed\" cancer cells or cause cancer to grow. Sugar feeds all cells in the body. It is not possible to \"starve\" cancer by not eating sugar. Although sugar does not \"feed\" cancer, it is still a good idea to limit sugar, especially added sugar, in your meals, as it provides little nutritional value and may take the place of more nutritious foods. DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK l 17beverages, candy, cookies, pies, dairy desserts, milk products, and sugar-sweetened cereals. For protein, a listed % Daily Value is only required if the food claims to be high in protein. How much protein do you need each day? Divide your ideal weight by 2 to determine the minimum grams of protein your body needs daily. Cancer patients in active treatment may need to increase their protein intake. Ask your doctor or a registered dietitian for a recommendation. Meal Planning Eating in a healthy way may seem difficult. Busy schedules and tight budgets may make it difficult to make good food choices. However, by meal planning, you can create healthy and balanced meals that are easy to prepare and budget-friendly. Follow these tips for meal planning. Plan Ahead. As you plan your menu for the week, write down any groceries you will need to prepare each meal so you will only have to go to the grocery store once, and also so you won't buy foods you don't need. Shop Your Own Pantry. Do not forget about the foods you already have at home. Do not let food go to waste by letting it expire before you use it. Check the expiration date and use the foods you already have at home in your meal plan. Keep It Simple. You do not need to prepare a four-course meal for every dinner. In fact, you may not even need to cook at all. Visit www.pearlpoint.org/MealAndSnackIdeas for easy-to-make meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with minimal cooking required.Q. Should I consider juicing? A. Juicing (using a juicer or a blender) extracts the juice from fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are a good source for a variety of vitamins, antioxidants and other nutrients. Juicing can be a good way to help you add more fruits and vegetables to your menus. However, juicing alone cannot give your body everything it needs. By removing the pulp and skin from fruits and vegetables, juicing also removes the healthy fiber. If you are consuming an \"all juice\" diet, you are also missing out on other important food groups. Remember: Juicing is a great way to add fruits or vegetables to your meals, but you should not rely on juicing to meet all of your nutritional needs. When juicing, wash all produce well and clean your juicer or blender after each use. DIETITIAN TIP18 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org Remember Leftovers. Think about what food you will have left over after preparing a meal. Can you use that food for your next meal? For example, if you have roasted chicken for dinner, you could use the leftover chicken to make chicken soup or a sliced chicken sandwich for lunch the next day. This saves you money and time preparing food. Note\u2014leftovers can be safely stored in a sealed container in a refrigerator for about 2 to 4 days. See Leftovers on page 31 for more information. Use the Meal Planning Worksheet on page 36 and see the sample Grocery List on page 38 to get organized.

Use the following tips to help stock your pantry, refrigerator and freezer with nutritious foods: Shop with a List. Make copies of a standardized grocery list, which includes perishables, such as milk and bread. Add to it each week. Check your pantry, fridge and freezer to make sure you do not already have these items. Organize the list by the layout of your store so you can go through the store once without backtracking. 20 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org Add any new items you need to accommodate special dietary needs or guidelines provided by your healthcare team. See the sample Grocery List on page 38. Shop Safely. To keep your foods fresh and to reduce the risk of foodborne illness (see Food Safety and Risk of Foodborne Illness on page 22 for more information), follow these guidelines: Keep cold foods cold. When buying refrigerated or frozen foods, take steps to keep the foods at a safe temperature until you are able to put them in your own refrigerator or freezer. o Shop when the temperature outside is cooler (earlier in the day, for example). o Bring a cooler for cold foods. o Choose room temperature items first. Pick out cold and frozen foods right before you pay. Check the \"sell by\" or \"use by\" date on products. Do not buy products with damaged packages or dented cans. Keep fruits and vegetables away from raw meat, poultry and seafood in your cart and bags. Wash reusable grocery bags regularly by wiping them down with disinfecting wipes. Shop Frugally. Use the following strategies to find discounts and ways to save money: Use coupons. Look online and in the newspaper for coupons. Check to see if your grocery store offers a loyalty program or coupons through a mobile app. Some brand-name specialty products can be expensive, so visit the product's website for coupons or contact the manufacturer. Q. What does \"organic\" mean? A. For the word \"organic\" to be on a label, the product must meet certain United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved guidelines. Organic produce has been grown without the use of most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic meat comes from animals that are raised in living conditions that accommodate their natural behaviors, fed organic food, and not given antibiotics or hormones. Keep in mind there is no definitive research that says organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. Eating a variety of plant- based foods, whether organic or conventional, is what's important. Organic foods can also be more expensive. If you prefer organic foods, you may be able to find budget-friendly organic foods at farmers' markets. Finding a source for local fruits and vegetables means your produce is picked at peak freshness and only travels a short distance to market. DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK l 21 Ask customer service for a rain check if an item on sale is sold out. Some stores will allow you to purchase the item at the sale price once it is back in stock, even if the promotion has ended. Check the top and bottom shelves in your grocery store. Typically more expensive items tend to be on the middle shelves at eye level. Compare these items with products on the top and bottom shelves. Buy generic to save money. Compare ingredients and the Nutrition Facts label to find similar products at a lower cost. Shop for seasonal fruits and vegetables. Seasonal produce provides great nutrition and taste and is typically more budget-friendly than foods that are not in season. Visit www.seasonalfoodguide.org for more information and to learn when foods are in season in your area. For food assistance resources, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Food Assistance: Resources and Tips . Shop in New Ways. There are ways to get your groceries without a typical trip to the grocery store. Try these other ways to shop. Many grocery stores now offer pickup and/or delivery services. For pickup services, you send a list to the store ahead of time. A store employee then puts together your grocery order. Once your groceries are ready, you go to the store, and an employee loads them into your car. Some grocery stores and online retailers can deliver food to your home for an extra fee. Ask if your grocery store offers nutrition services. Some stores offer complimentary nutrition services, such as consultations with a dietitian, supermarket tours and cooking classes.

Food Safety and Risk of Foodborne Illness What Is Foodborne Illness? Foodborne illness (food poisoning) is any illness that results from eating contaminated food. Foodborne illness is most commonly caused by bacteria and viruses. The signs and symptoms of foodborne illness range from mild to severe and can include upset stomach, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Who Is at Risk for Foodborne Illness? Anyone can get a foodborne illness, but some groups of people are more likely than others to become seriously ill. Persons who are at an increased risk for foodborne illness include Children younger than 5 years old Adults aged 65 and older Pregnant women People whose immune systems are weakened due to illness or medical treatment (cancer patients, for example) What Should You Do if You Suspect You or a Loved One Has a Foodborne Illness? Contact your primary care provider (PCP), or if the person who is ill is a cancer patient, contact the oncology healthcare team. Mark any recently eaten food or beverages as \"do not eat.\" Keep the containers in the fridge in case the healthcare team wants to test any of the potentially contaminated foods. If you experience vomiting or diarrhea, be sure to drink plenty of clear liquids (water, ginger ale, sports drinks, or electrolyte replacement drinks) to replace lost fluids and stay well-hydrated. Do not take any anti-nausea or anti-diarrheal medications without checking with your healthcare provider.NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 23How Can I Protect Myself and My Family From Foodborne Illness? Practicing good food safety is the best way to decrease the risk of foodborne illness. The four main steps of food safety are illustrated below. When preparing, eating and storing food, always follow these food safety guidelines. Wash your hands well, both before and after handling food. Wash hands with running water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Do not forget to scrub fingernails and the backs of your hands too. Disinfect food preparation surfaces both before and after cooking. Use an antibacterial kitchen cleaner and paper towels or bleach wipes. Wash or replace dish towels and sponges frequently. Keep raw and cooked foods separate. Do not reuse any utensils, cutting boards, plates or dishes once they have been touched by raw meat or eggs. Utensils, cutting boards, plates, and dishes that have been used for preparing raw meats or eggs should be washed in hot, soapy water. Wash fruits and vegetables before peeling, cutting or eating them. Rinse produce under running water and rub gently to remove any dirt. (There is no need to use soap or a special wash.) Remove and throw away the outermost leaves of produce such as lettuce and cabbage. Thaw foods safely. Do not thaw food at room temperature. Thaw in the refrigerator, under cold water or in the microwave. Once thawed in the refrigerator, ground meat, poultry and seafood should be cooked within 1-2 days. Red meat cuts should be cooked within 3-5 days. Food thawed under cold water or in the microwave should be cooked immediately.CLEAN WASH YOUR HANDS AND SURFACES OFTEN.SEPARATE DON'T CROSS- CONTAMINATE.COOK TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE.CHILL REFRIGERATE PROMPTLY.

People who are not at high risk for food poisoning usually do not need to avoid these foods, but it is good to be aware of them. Persons who are at an increased risk for foodborne illness (cancer patients, for example) may be advised by their healthcare team to avoid these foods. High-risk foods include: Raw seafood dishes, such as sushi, sashimi or ceviche Runny eggs Unpasteurized beverages, such as unpasteurized juice or raw milk Soft mold-ripened and blue-veined cheeses, such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola and blue, or other soft, unpasteurized cheeses o You may be able to find pasteurized versions of these cheeses. Check the label. Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts Frozen drinks, soft-serve ice cream, or frozen yogurt from bulk machines Ask the healthcare team for additional food safety guidelines if either you or a loved one is immunosuppressed. For nutrition information for cancer patients receiving treatment, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Food and Nutrition Facts. Food Allergies. A food allergy is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical condition caused by the immune system overreacting to a typically harmless food. 26 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgFood allergy reactions can range from mild to severe. Food allergies may either start in childhood or later in adulthood. It is important that food allergies be confirmed by an allergist, a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. After a food allergy diagnosis, it is vital to work with your healthcare team to learn how to protect yourself and manage the allergy. Visit Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) at www.foodallergy.org for more information. Cooking Healthier Meals Cooking at home can help you save money and eat in healthier ways. The following are a few tips to keep in mind when cooking at home. NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 27Choose Healthier Cooking Methods. Prepare food by baking, slow-cooking, grilling, or broiling to limit fat. Avoid fried and greasy foods. Remember that not all fats are created equal. Your body needs fat. Choose healthy fats, such as olive oil/canola oil, avocados, nuts and seeds. Pick Plant-Based Options. Swap out meat and other animal products for plant-based proteins. For example, Try sliced tofu in place of chicken. Use chopped mushrooms or cooked lentils in place of ground meat. Black beans, jackfruit and chickpeas are also good replacements for meat in a variety of dishes such as burgers and chili. Jackfruit can also be a substitute for shredded meat. Try to build your meals around fruits, vegetables and beans instead of meat. Stock Up on Pantry Staples. Some items you will need for many dishes. For example, seasonings, cooking oil, low-sodium broth, and whole-grain brown rice are staples. See the sample Grocery List on page 38 to build a well-stocked pantry. Check Spices. Taste your food before serving to see if you need to add more seasoning. Typically, seasonings in recipes are just suggestions, so you can adjust them to your tastes. Remember that you can always add more spice or salt, but you cannot take it out. Food Safety Warning\u2014Do not taste dishes containing meat, poultry, fish, or seafood until the food has reached a safe internal temperature. See chart on page 24.Q. How can I start cooking at home? A. If you have never cooked at home before, the idea can be intimidating. You may not know where to start. The internet offers many free videos with professional chefs and experienced home cooks who can walk you step-by-step through delicious recipes. Videos can be more helpful than a written recipe, especially for beginners. You can see what the food should look like at each step. You can pause and, when you need to, you can watch it again. Cook for Your Life teaches healthy cooking to people impacted by cancer. Visit www.cookforyourlife.org/ videos to watch and learn. If you are looking for a specific recipe, try searching YouTube. No matter what food you crave, there is likely a video to guide you. You can also ask family members or friends whose cooking you enjoy to teach you. DIETITIAN TIP28 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgSave Time. Cooking can be time-consuming, but everything does not need to be made from scratch. Here are a few ideas to save you time in the kitchen: Chop veggies for multiple meals at one time. Save chopped veggies in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Search online for one-pot recipes to save on cleanup time. Use premade sauces and dressings. Remember to check the labels for added sugar and sodium content and pick the healthiest option. Use frozen vegetable mixes as meal starters for dishes such as stir fries, soups or casseroles. Try microwavable brown rice for a quick and easy serving of whole grains. Use a cooked rotisserie chicken as a source of protein in several dishes. Manage Salt Content. Be aware of the salt content of your foods by reading the sodium content on the Nutrition Facts label. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day and an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults. When cooking, some of your ingredients may already contain salt, so you may not need to add more. Here are more ways to lower your sodium intake: Limit or avoid smoked or cured foods, such as sausage, bacon and hot dogs. When buying canned items, look for \"no salt added\" or \"low-sodium\" on the label. You can also rinse canned vegetables before cooking to remove added salt. Avoid flavored rice and noodles. Prepare plain rice and noodles and season them yourself. Avoid frozen vegetables that are pre-seasoned or have a sauce. Look for sodium-free seasoning mixes to try on meats and vegetables. Avoid processed foods and fast food which can be high in salt. Choose a Healthier Cooking Oil. The American Heart Association recommends choosing oils with less than 4 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon and no partially hydrogenated oils or trans fats. This includes the following budget- friendly oils: Canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean and sunflower oilNUTRITION HANDBOOK l 29Blends of these oils are often called \"vegetable oil.\" Other oils like avocado or sesame oil can be healthy options, but they may be higher in price. Cooking sprays made with these oils are also a good choice. Reduce Added Sugar. As a general rule, sugar in most recipes can be decreased by 25 percent without greatly affecting taste or texture. For most baked desserts, you can use 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of 1 cup of sugar. If making this swap, reduce the amount of other liquids used in the recipe. Some people use no-calorie sugar substitutes made with stevia (extracted from the leaves of the stevia plant) or artificial sweeteners as an alternative to added sugars. There is no clear evidence that links artificial sweeteners, which include sucralose (Splenda\u00ae), saccharine (Sweet'N Low\u00ae) and aspartame (Equal\u00ae), to cancer. The evidence is unclear whether artificial sweeteners support weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight. It is important to remember that sweeteners such as agave, brown rice syrup, coconut sugar, honey, maple syrup, and molasses all add calories, just like refined white sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Let Your Child Help Prepare Food. As age-appropriate, let your child help with grocery shopping, food preparation, and meal planning. For example, let younger children pick out the produce at the store. Let older children help stirring pots or measuring spices. Your child will learn these important life skills and gain a new appreciation for food. Picky eaters may even be more likely to try a new food if they help prepare it. Try New Recipes. You can find recipes in many ways. Ask family and friends for their favorite dishes. Check out cookbooks from your library. Search online; here are a few websites to start your search: PearlPoint Nutrition Services\u00ae: www.pearlpoint.org/recipes American Institute for www.aicr.org/cancer- prevention/recipes/ Cook for Your Life: www.cookforyourlife.org See the Sample Meal Plan starting on page 32 to see an example of a healthy menu. If you find a new recipe you enjoy, record it on one of the blank recipe cards included in this book.30 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgMealtimes Making healthy food choices is about more than just consuming food; it is also about enjoying food. Food brings people together so try to make mealtimes social and fun for you and your family. To make mealtimes more enjoyable, try the following tips: Sit down and eat with your friends and family. Make regularly scheduled mealtimes a family priority. Eat at the table instead of sitting on the couch or in separate rooms. Put away electronic devices (mobile phones and tablets). Turn off the TV. Eat without distractions so you can enjoy your food. Encourage pleasant conversation while you eat. Here are some fun questions to use as conversation starters. You can also make up your own. o What was the highlight of your day? o If you could have any superpower, what would you choose? NUTRITION HANDBOOK l 31 o What is the best meal you have ever eaten? o If you could travel anywhere, where would you go? Even if you are eating alone, eat without distractions and take time to savor each bite of food. Eating at Restaurants. Eating in a healthy way does not mean you cannot dine out and enjoy your favorite restaurants. Moderation is key. Here are few things to keep in mind when eating at restaurants. Check restaurant websites to look up the nutritional information of menu items beforehand. A little research before ordering can help you make healthy meal choices. Restaurant portions are often large. Pack half of your meal in a to-go box before you start eating to limit the portion size. Be adventurous; try restaurants that serve foods that you typically do not eat at home. Try the cuisine from another country or culture or order a vegetarian or vegan dish. You may find a new favorite dish that you can try to make at home. Leftovers Leftovers are a great way to save time and money and to cut down on food waste. When planning your meal in advance, remember to incorporate leftovers throughout the week. Follow these food safety guidelines for storing and reheating leftovers. Store Leftovers Safely. If you plan to make meals in advance or to use leftovers, make sure you store foods safely. Pack and refrigerate or freeze leftovers within 2 hours of cooking or sooner if possible. (Store foods within 1 hour if the temperature is above 90\u00b0F.) Eat or discard refrigerated leftovers within 2 to 4 days or frozen leftovers within 3 to 4 months. Frozen foods will stay safe for longer but they can lose moisture 32 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. organd flavor. If you are not sure whether something is safe to eat, remember, WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT . Label food containers (use a marker or pen) with a \"use by\" date if the packaging does not have an expiration date. Food in an opened package goes bad quicker than food in a sealed package. Visit www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts for more guidelines. Put foods with the soonest expiration date at the front of the fridge or shelves so that you are more likely to use them. Reheat Leftovers Safely. Just as when you prepare a meal the first time, you need to practice good food safety when reheating leftovers to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. You can reheat frozen leftovers without thawing; however, it will take longer to heat the food all the way through to a safe internal temperature. Do not thaw food at room temperature.
