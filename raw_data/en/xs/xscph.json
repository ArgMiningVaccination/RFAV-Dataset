Welcome to Our Community We are a consortium of educators, researchers and counselors exploring religious trauma, toxic theology, spiritual elitism and any spiritual beliefs that cause psychological harm, especially when coping with death, trauma and bereavement. We understand that spiritual thought exists on a spectrum, and extremism can be present on either end, from evangelical Christianity to New Age theology (or from Atheism to Zoroastrianism), and everywhere in between. While our focus is specifically on how religious beliefs and cultural ideologies influence one's relationship with death and grief, this is also a forum for anybody who is... - Spiritual but not religious (SBNR) - Exploring metaphysics - Atheist, non-believer, former believer, or never-believer. - Struggling to leave a high-demand religious structure - Questioning an inherited or chosen faith tradition - Recovering from religious trauma - A professional who works with religious trauma - Deconstructing childhood religious indoctrination Subscribers receive our monthly newsletter and a free digital copy of Terri Daniel's book, Grief and God: When Religion Does More Harm Than Healing Deconstructing Culture, Myth and Meaning Our mission is to create a safe space for unpacking religious beliefs and spiritual concepts that can be disempowering and harmful when facing loss and grief. By deconstructing religious doctrines that cause confusion and cognitive dissonance, we can build a philosophical framework with no absolutism, where guilt and shame are not used to manipulate believers, and where leaders don't claim certainty or spiritual authority.
