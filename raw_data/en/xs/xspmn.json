To Request an Action Plan to Address GERD/Reflux/Indigestion [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Why Do People Get Acid Indigestion/Reflux/GERD/Hiatal Hernias? I spend a lot of time working with my practice members and choose to take the time to talk with them about what is going on in their lives and what creates the stress response in their lives. Unlike most healthcare practitioners, I make sure to give them the time they need unlike the majority of offices which have perfected the 3 to 5 minute office visit. Without taking the time to understand a health concern, it makes it difficult, if not impossible to solve the concern. That is why I ask questions and listen to what my practice members have to say. And it is through their communication and the questions I ask that have helped me understand why a person develops Acid Indigestion/Reflux/GERD/Hiatal Hernias, etc. Follow along with this article and learn for yourself what is underlying your digestive concern. The Power of Your Gallbladder The Power Of Your Gallbladder Your digestion, ALL of it, is controlled and regulated by a tiny organ that sits under your liver. This tiny sack of an organ is called your [gallbladder](gall-bladder-condition.asp) and it is responsible for making ALL the decisions in your body. I'm sure many of you are thinking, \"No Dr. Rick, my brain is what makes my decisions, not my gall bladder.\" And for the masses, this is what they think. In an effort to not make people wrong, let me modify what I have seen to be true for over 30 years and say your gallbladder, in association with your brain, is what makes all the decisions in your body and it is the healthy balance between their communications that enables your digestive system to do its job properly. I hope you can agree with that statement. And if not, perhaps the information that follows will help you to conclude things in a new, more expanded way. After all, I am confident there are things we do not know or understand, the knowing and understanding of which could change everything. So if you will allow me the courtesy to expand your understanding, your health will appreciate it and so will your body. The Body/Mind Connection and Putting It Back Together The Body Mind Connection It has been shown that we are more than just a mind and body. And the two cannot be addressed independently if we would choose to solve the imbalances that exist between the two. Therefore, going to a Psychiatrist/Psychologist/Social Worker/Counselor to talk about your problems can have a beneficial effect for how you are feeling, AND it will not eliminate the physical manifestations of your health concerns. Likewise, having physical interventions and treatments designed to address the physical symptoms of a health concern is beneficial AND will not truly address the underlying mental/emotional causes of your health concerns. They must be addressed together if you truly want to get to the bottom of your concern. Both have merit, and you need both to work harmoniously to truly solve the imbalance. I having spent thousands of hours assisting my practice members to improved health outcomes for more than 27 years. I began doing this from the time I was in 3rd grade. Understanding what a person is going through is directly related to what they are manifesting in their physical body. Unfortunately, we do not have bodies that simply stop one thing and do the opposite merely by taking some pill, having a physical treatment or by talking about it until we are blue in the face. And as stated, we need to address the physical symptom yes, AND we must address the underlying negative emotional habit pattern that is creating and supporting the physical imbalance. Putting The Two Back Together So back to the underlying cause/mechanism for why we get the conditions related to digestive upset listed in the above title. If we look at the emotions associated with our different organs and glands, we come to appreciate what emotions are involved in the Stomach/Pancreas/Gall Bladder/Small Intestine area. And it is through this understanding that one can begin to appreciate how complex and yet, how simple we all are as far as our neurologic wiring. Our emotions are universal. How they impact our functions within the body are also somewhat universal. I say \"somewhat\" because not everyone has the same emotional reality as everyone else. And that is one reason why there are so many different medications to address the different symptoms of these imbalances. Everyone re-acts differently because everyone has been \"programmed\" and developed \"learned responses\" differently. To begin with an example: one mechanism for these digestive disturbances mentioned occurs if a person is experiencing the feeling of being \"vulnerable\" due to any of a number of different reasons, the vulnerability is going to manifest in an uneasy feeling in the belly, just below the ribcage. The vulnerability affects the small intestine which is counterbalanced by the heart. A back-up to the heart are the adrenal glands, the glands responsible for helping us manage our stress. The adrenal glands then become stimulated in response to the emotional stress, thus causing the heart to respond with an increase in beating, leading to the stomach feeling the emotion of \" [anxiety](anxiety.asp).\" Once the stomach feels anxiety, the gallbladder begins looking at what is going on and, if balanced, will make a decision that remedies the whole situation and harmony (the chief heart emotion) will be restored. When There Is No Resolution and What Results So What Happens If There Is No Resolution - If the gallbladder does not understand how to handle the situation, \"indecision\" sets in and the gallbladder must now handle the difficulty and anything associated with it. The longer the situation persists, the indecision will evolve to \"resentment\" for being given something the body/mind complex does not want and cannot handle. This can evolve into \"anger\" which will pull the liver into the equation. And the gallbladder still needs to handle the situation. It will begin to cause the body to remove the situation altogether by developing several different responses, each one a little more severe and different from the other, yet all along the same vein. - If the gallbladder is healthy and strong, it will override the initial vulnerability and the person will handle the situation in a balanced way. - If the gallbladder is a little less healthy but still strong, it will cause the evacuation of the contents of the stomach and the person will throw up. This will lead to a [hiatal hernia](Hiatal-Hernia.asp) and strong symptoms of GERD. - If the gallbladder has stress, is not working perfectly and cannot handle the situation fully, nausea and gas will develop. This may be the end of it, simply feeling nauseous for a bit and possibly needing to burp, with occasional GERD. Your Medical Doctor may suggest to have your gallbladder removed. This will only create larger problems, as your \"decision maker\" will no longer be involved with regulating your digestion. If this occurs after the development of the hiatal hernia, the GERD will be quite uncomfortable and you may feel heart related symptoms. Your Medical Doctor or hospital staff may conclude you are having a heart attack, except all the tests will come back negative and you will be sent home without resolution to your symptoms. - If the gallbladder is weaker still, the nauseous feeling may expand and the gas, looking to escape will lead to reflux, which is simply the attempt of the gallbladder to get the irritation out of the body. This is an indication the gallbladder is not strong enough to actually throw it all the way up and out. This is known as acid indigestion and [heartburn](heartburn.asp) causing one to mistakenly think their body has too much acid being produced and will mistakenly go get an antacid medication. This is usually an over-the-counter one first before eventually being prescribed a stronger medication to \"block the acid\" as prescribed by your Medical Doctor. The problem with this form of care is the treatment will eliminate the symptoms for sure. It will also help to create other health concerns like calcium absorption problems. The complications of that will eventually lead to [Heart Disease](heart-problems.asp), Immune System problems, Osteoporosis and Musculoskeletal pain, like [Fibromyalgia](fibromyalgia-fibrositis.asp) or [Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](cfschronicfatiguesyndrome.asp), just to name a few. So instead of simply masking the symptom with different antacids, it is important to address the underlying mechanism of dysfunction. Otherwise, you will be tied to the medication for the rest of your life and begin developing the other conditions mentioned as a complication to your original indigestion. - If the gallbladder is truly weak, assuming you still have your gallbladder, it will cause the system to remove the interference by turning the problem into various stages of liquid and, with the help of the kidneys and large intestine, the body will throw it out the other end in the form of diarrhea. This is the basis for the diagnosis of [Irritable Bowel Syndrome](irritable-bowel-syndrome.asp), [Colitis](colitis.asp) or any of the other different variations. I hope you can find your personal situation in the above example and can now appreciate the mechanism behind what your body is doing. Since all of us are creatures of habit, and since all of us are unconscious to what we think and feel 97 to 99 % of the time, it is our habit patterns of thoughts and feelings and how we re-act to our life circumstances that causes us to feel any of the associated emotions that will lead to the gallbladder stress response. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Dr. Huntoon's Perspective Dr. Huntoon's Perspective So What Do I Do Now? The wonderful thing about what I do in the office is to address all of this. I can and do address all of these relationships and I can and do help my practice member to get to the underlying cause of their emotional circumstances. In addition to helping them eliminate the gallbladder stress and all the unconscious roads that feed into it feeling the stress. Whether it is - the vulnerability of the small intestine, - the low self-esteem of the stomach or - the anxiety from the stomach/heart/adrenal relationships, strengthening your gallbladder and helping to support the maintenance of the gallbladder is paramount. Then, by helping to understand the emotional patterns the person's body takes when under stress, while helping them to eliminate the unconscious emotions, we an then develop a new, more harmonious pattern that allows for the person to truly address their concern. And with that comes the elimination of ALL the medication and the elimination of all the potential health consequences and side-effects from stopping the acid production within the stomach.
