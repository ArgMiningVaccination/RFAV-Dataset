It's an interesting topic and not easy to follow because of the veritable maze of more than twenty overlapping regulators and quangos which fail utterly to protect the public against health fraud. In fact they mostly promote health fraud. The paper is [now published](http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf), and here is a version with embedded links (and some small updates). We are witnessing an increasing commercialisation of medicine. It's really taken off since the passage of the Health and Social Security Bill into law. Not only does that mean having NHS hospitals run by private companies, but it means that \"any qualified provider\" can bid for just about any service. The problem lies, of course, in what you consider \"qualified\" to mean. Any qualified homeopath or herbalist will, no doubt, be eligible. University College London Hospital advertised for a spiritual healer. The \"person specification\" specified a \"quallfication\", but only HR people think that a paper qualification means that spiritual healing is anything but a delusion. The vocabulary of bait and switch First, a bit of vocabulary. Alternative medicine is a term that is used for medical treatments that don't work (or at least haven't been shown to work). If they worked, they'd be called \"medicine\". The anti-malarial, artemesinin, came originally from a Chinese herb, but once it had been purified and properly tested, it was no longer alternative. But the word alternative is not favoured by quacks. They prefer their nostrums to be described as \"complementary\" -it sounds more respectable. So CAM (complementary and alternative medicine became the politically-correct euphemism. Now it has gone a stage further, and the euphemism in vogue with quacks at the moment is \"integrated\" or \"integrative\" medicine. That means, very often, integrating things that don't work with things that do. But it sounds fashionable. In reality it is designed to confuse politicians who ask for, say, integrated services for old people. Put another way, the salespeople of quackery have become rather good at bait and switch. The wikepedia definition is as good as any. Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are \"baited\" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are \"switched\" to a costlier product. As applied to the alternative medicine industry, the bait is usually in the form of some nice touchy-feely stuff which barely mentions the mystical nonsense. But when you've bought into it you get the whole panoply of nonsense. Steven Novella has [written eloquently](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) about the use of bait and switch in the USA to sell chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine: \"The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives, the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that don't work or are at best untested and highly implausible.\". The \"College of Medicine\" provides a near-perfect example of bait and switch. It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health. The Prince's Foundation was a consistent purveyor of dangerous medical myths. When it collapsed in 2010 because of a financial scandal, a company was formed called \"The College for Integrated Health\". [A slide show](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), not meant for public consumption, said \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". But it seems that too many people have now tumbled to the idea that \"integrated\", in this context, means barmpottery. Within less than a month, the new institution was renamed \"The College of Medicine\". That might be a deceptive name, but it's a much better bait. That's why I described the College as a [fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). Not only did the directors, all of them quacks, devise a respectable sounding name, but they also succeeded in recruiting some respectable-sounding people to act as figureheads for the new organisation. The president of the College is Professor Sir Graham Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Names like his make the bait sound even more plausible. He claims not to believe that homeopathy works, but seems quite happy to have a homeopathic pharmacist, Christine Glover, on the [governing council of his college](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). At least half of the governing Council can safely be classified as quacks. So the bait is clear. What about the switch? The first thing to notice is that the whole outfit is skewed towards private medicine: see [ The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). The founder, and presumably the main provider of funds (they won't say how much) is the huge outsourcing company, Capita. This is company known in Private Eye as Crapita. Their inefficiency is legendary. They are the folks who messed up the NHS computer system and the courts computer system. After swallowing large amounts of taxpayers' money, they failed to deliver anything that worked. Their latest failure is the [court translation service](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract).. The president (Catto), the vice president (Harry Brunjes) and the CEO (Mark Ratnarajah) are all employees of Capita. The second thing to notice is that their conferences and courses are a bizarre mixture of real medicine and pure quackery. Their 2012 conference had some very good speakers, but then it had [ a \"herbal workshop\" with Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360) (see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lGhp0PNHVnc)) and David Peters (the man who tolerates [dowsing as a way to diagnose](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) which herb to give you). The other speaker was Dick Middleton, who represents the huge herbal company, Schwabe (I debated with him [on BBC Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3RZ6K0Ng0c&feature=player_embedded)), In fact the College's [Faculty of Self-care](/COM-Self-care.pdf) appears to resemble a marketing device for Schwabe. Why regulation isn't working, and can't work There are various levels of regulation. The \"highest\" level is the statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic. The General Chiropractic Council (GCC) has exactly the same legal status as the General Medical Council (GMC). This ludicrous state of affairs arose because nobody in John Major's government had enough scientific knowledge to realise that chiropractic, and some parts of osteopathy, are pure quackery, The problem is that organisations like the GCC function more to promote chiropractic than to regulate them. This became very obvious when the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) decided to sue Simon Singh for defamation, after he described some of their treatments as [\"bogus\", \"without a jot of evidence\"](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/good-day-in-court.html). In order to support Singh, several bloggers assessed the \"plethora of evidence\" which the BCA said could be used to justify their claims. When, 15 months later, the BCA produced its \"plethora\" it was shown within 24 hours that the evidence was pathetic. The demolition was summarised by lawyer, David Allen Green, in [The BCA's Worst Day](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html). In the wake of this, over 600 complaints were made to the GCC about unjustified claims made by chiropractors, thanks in large part to heroic work by two people, [Simon Perry](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/500-chiropractors-reported-to-trading.html) and [Allan Henness](http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Simon Perry's [Fishbarrel](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/fishbarrel-easy-way-to-report.html) (browser plugin) allows complaints to be made quickly and easily -try it). The majority of these complaints were rejected by the GCC, apparently on the grounds that chiropractors could not be blamed because the false claims had been endorsed by the GCC itself. My own complaint was based on phone calls to two chiropractors, [I was told](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) such nonsense as \"colic is down to, er um, faulty movement patterns in the spine\". But my complaint never reached the Conduct and Competence committee because it had been judged by a preliminary investigating committee that there was no case to answer. The impression one got from this (very costly) exercise was that the GCC was there to protect chiropractors, not to protect the public. The outcome was a disaster for chiropractors, wno emerged totally discredited. It was also a disaster for the GCC which was forced to admit that it hadn't properly advised chiropractors about what they could and couldn't claim. The recantation culminated in the [GCC declaring, in August 2010](http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf), that the mythical \"subluxation\" is a \"historical concept \" \"It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease.\". Subluxation was a product of the fevered imagination of the founder of the chiropractic cult, D.D. Palmer. It referred to an imaginary spinal lesion that he claimed to be the cause of most diseases. .Since 'subluxation' is the only thing that's distinguished chiropractic from any other sort of manipulation, the admission by the GCC that it does not exist, after a century of pretending that it does, is quite an admission. The President of the BCA himself [admitted in November 2011](http://chiropracticreport.com/portal/images/back_issues/No_%206%20-%20Nov%202011.pdf) \"The BCA sued Simon Singh personally for libel. In doing so, the BCA began one of the darkest periods in its history; one that was ultimately to cost it financially,\" As a result of all this, the deficiencies of chiropractic, and the deficiencies of its regulator were revealed, and advertisements for chiropractic are somewhat less misleading. But this change for the better was brought about entirely by the unpaid efforts of bloggers and a few journalists, and not at all by the official regulator, the GCC. which was part of the problem. not the solution. And it was certainly not helped by the organisation that is meant to regulate the GCC, the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which did nothing whatsoever to stop the farce. At the other end of the regulatory spectrum, voluntary self-regulation, is an even worse farce than the GCC. They all have grand sounding \"Codes of Practice\" which, in practice, the ignore totally. The Society of Homeopaths is just a joke. When homeopaths were caught out recommending [sugar pills for prevention of malaria](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2855), they did nothing (arguably such homicidal advice deserves a [jail sentence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661)). The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) is widely know in the blogosphere as Ofquack. I know about them from the inside, having [been a member of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) their Conduct and Competence Committee, It was set up with the help of a \u00a3900,000 grant from the Department of Health to the Prince of Wales, to oversee voluntary self-regulation. It fails utterly to do anything useful.. The CNHC code of practice, paragraph 15 , states \"Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated\". When [Simon Perry made a complaint](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html) to the CNHC about claims being made by a CNHC-registered reflexologist, the Investigating Committee upheld all 15 complaints. But it then went on to say that there was no case to answer because the unjustified claims were what the person had been taught, and were made in good faith. This is precisely the ludicrous situation which will occur again and again if reflexologists (and many other alternative therapies) are \"accredited\". The CNHC said, correctly, that the reflexologist had been taught things that were not true, but then did nothing whatsoever about it apart from toning down the advertisements a bit. They still register reflexologists who make outrageously false claims. Once again we see that no sensible regulation is possible for subjects that are pure make-believe. The first two examples deal (or rather, fail to deal) with regulation of outright quackery. But there are dozens of other quangos that sound a lot more respectable. European Food Standards Agency (EFSA). One of the common scams is to have have your favourite quack treatment classified as a food not as a medicine. The laws about what you can claim have been a lot laxer for foods. But the EFSA has done a pretty good job in stopping unjustified claims for health benefits from foods. Dozens of claims made by makers of probiotics have been banned. The food industry, needless to say, objects very strongly to be being forced to tell the truth. In my view, the ESFA has not gone far enough. They recently [issued a directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:FULL:EN:PDF) about claims that could legally be made. Some of these betray the previously high standards of the EFSA. For example you are allowed to say that \"Vitamin C contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue\" (as long as the product contains above a specified amount of Vitamin C. I'm not aware of any trials that show vitamin C has the slightest effect on tiredness or fatigue, Although these laws do not come into effect until December 2012, they have already been [invoked by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/6/Natures-Best-Health-Products-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_179089.aspx) has a reason not to uphold a complaint about a multivitamin pill which claimed that it \"Includes 8 nutrients that can contribute to the reduction in tiredness and fatigue\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This is almost the only organisation that has done a good job on false health claims. Their [Guidance on Health Therapies & Evidence](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/Guidance%20on%20Health%20Therapies%20and%20Evidence%20QA%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) says \"Whether you use the words 'treatment', 'treat' or 'cure', all are likely to be seen by members of the public as claims to alleviate effectively a condition or symptom. We would advise that they are not used\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" They are spot on. The ASA's [Guidance for Advertisers of Homeopathic Services](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/CAP/CAP/Guidance%20for%20Advertisers%20of%20Homeopathic%20Services%20September%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) is wonderful. \"In the simplest terms, you should avoid using efficacy claims, whether implied or direct,\" \"To date, the ASA has have not seen persuasive evidence to support claims that homeopathy can treat, cure or relieve specific conditions or symptoms.\" That seems to condemn the (mis) [labelling allowed by the MHRA](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) as breaking the rules.. Sadly, though, the ASA has no powers to enforce its decisions and [only too often they are ignored](http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/3rd%20Letter%20to%20Homeopathy%20Adv%203.ashx). The [Nightingale collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has produced an [excellent letter](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/images/stories/POS_advertising_of_homeopathic_products.pdf) that you can hand to any pharmacist who breaks the rules The ASA has also [judged against claims](http://nightingale-collaboration.org/news/111-working-within-the-qcranial-paradigmq.html) made by \"Craniosacral therapists\" (that's the lunatic fringe of osteopathy). They will presumably uphold complaints about [similar claims](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) made (I'm ashamed to say) by UCLH Hospitals. The private examination company Edexcel sets [exams in antiscientific subjects](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), so miseducating children. The teaching of quackery to 16 year-olds has been approved by a maze of quangos, none of which will take responsibility, or justify their actions. So far [ I've located no fewer than eight](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454) of them. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (OfQual), Edexcel, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), Skills for Health, Skills for Care, National Occupational Standards (NOS), private exam company VTCT and the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.. Asking any of these people why they approve of examinations in imaginary subjects meets with blank incomprehension. They fail totally to protect tha public from utter nonsense. The Department of Education has failed to do anything about the miseducation of children in quackery. In fact it has encouraged it by, for the first time, giving taxpayers' money to a Steiner (Waldorf) school (at Frome, in Somerset). Steiner schools are run by a secretive and cult-like body of people ( [read about it](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Steiner+Waldorf)). They teach about reincarnation, karma, gnomes, and all manner of nonsense, sometimes with unpleasant racial overtones. The [teachers are trained ](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/)in Steiner's Anthroposophy, so if your child gets ill at school they'll probably get homeopathic sugar pills. They might well get measles or mumps too, since Steiner people don't believe in vaccination. Incredibly, the University of Aberdeen came perilously close to appointing a [chair in anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261) This disaster was aborted [by bloggers](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/), and a last minute intervention [from journalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261). Neither the university's regulatory mechanisms. nor any others, seemed to realise that a chair in [mystical barmpottery](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) was a bad idea. Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading. It is the statutory duty of Trading Standards to enforce the Consumer Protection Regulations (2008) This European legislation is pretty good. it caused a lawyer to write \" [Has The UK Quietly Outlawed \"Alternative\" Medicine?\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) Unfortunately Trading Standards people have consistently refused to enforce these laws. The whole organisation is a mess. Its local office arrangement fails totally to deal with the age of the internet. The situation is so bad that a group of us decided to put them to the test. The results were published in the Medico-Legal Journal, Rose et al., 2012. [\"Spurious Claims for Health-care Products](http://www.dcscience.net/Rose-medico-legal-2012.pdf): An Experimental Approach to Evaluating Current UK Legislation and its Implementation\". They concluded \"EU directive 2005/29/EC is largely ineffective in preventing misleading health claims for consumer products in the UK\" Skills for Health is an enormous quango which produces HR style \"competences\" for everything under the son. They are mostly quite useless. But those concerned with alternative medicine are not just useless. [They are positively harmful.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215'#sfh) Totally barmy. There are competences and National Occupational Standards for every lunatic made-up therapy under the sun. When I phoned them to discover who'd written them, I learned that the had been drafted by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Magic Medicine. And when I joked by asking if they had a competence for talking to trees, I was told, perfectly seriously, \"You'd have to talk to LANTRA, the land-based organisation for that.\" That was in January 2008. A lot of correspondence with the head of Skills for Health got nowhere at all. She understood nothing and it hasn't improved a jot. This organisation costs a lot of taxpayers' money and it should have been consigned to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" (but of course there was no such bonfire in reality). It is a disgrace. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is supposed to ensure the quality of university courses. In fact it endorses courses in nonsense alternative medicine and so does more harm than good. The worst recent failure of the QAA was in the case of the University of Wales: see [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675). The university was making money by validating thousands of external degrees in everything from fundamentalist theology to Chinese Medicine. These validations were revealed as [utterly incompetent](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) by bloggers, and later by BBC Wales journalist Ciaran Jenkins (now working for Channel 4). The mainstream media eventually caught up with bloggers. In 2010, BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that [exposed the enormous degree validation scam](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) run by the University of Wales. The programme can be seen on YouTube ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)). The programme also exposed, incidentally, the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which did nothing until the scam was exposed by TV and blogs. Eventually the QAA sent nine people to Malaysia to investigate a dodgy college that had been revealed by the BBC. The trip cost \u00a391,000. It could have been done for nothing if anyone at the QAA knew how to use Google. The outcome was that the University of Wales stopped endorsing external courses, and it was soon shut down altogether (though bafflingly, its vice-chancellor, Marc Clement was promoted). The credit for this lies entirely with bloggers and the BBC. The QAA did nothing to help until the very last moment. Throughout this saga Universities UK (UUK), has maintained its usual total passivity. They have [done nothing whatsoever](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=42) about their members who give BSc degrees in anti-scientific subjects. (UUK used to known as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals). Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), soon to become the PSAHSC, Back now to the CHRE, the people who failed so signally to sort out the GCC. They are being reorganised. Their [consultation document](http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120416_-_standards_for_consultation_-_PDF.pdf) says \"The Health and Social Care Act 20122 confers a new function on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (the renamed Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence). From November 2012 we will set standards for organisations that hold voluntary registers for people working in health and social care occupations and we will accredit the register if they meet those standards. It will then be known as an 'Accredited Register'. \" They are trying to decide what the criteria should be for \"accreditation\" of a regulatory body. The [list of those interested](http://www.chre.org.uk/voluntaryregisters/421/) has some perfectly respectable organisations, like the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk/). It also contains a large number of crackpot organisations, like [Crystal and Healing International, as well as joke regulators like the CNHC](http://crystalandhealinginternational.co.uk). They already oversee the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is [due to take over Herbal medicine ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117)and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with predictably disastrous consequences. Two of the proposed criteria for \"accreditation\" appear to be directly contradictory. Para 2.5 makes the whole accreditation pointless from the point of view of patients 2.5 It will not be an endorsement of the therapeutic validity or effectiveness of any particular discipline or treatment. Since the only thing that matters to the patient is whether the therapy works (and is safe), accrediting of organisations that ignore this will merely give the appearance of official approval of crystal healing etc etc. This appears to contradict directly A.7 The organisation can demonstrate that there either is a sound knowledge base underpinning the profession or it is developing one and makes that explicit to the public. A \"sound knowledge base\", if it is to mean anything useful at all, means knowledge that the treatment is effective. If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean? It seems that the official mind has still not grasped the obvious fact that there can be no sensible regulation of subjects that are untrue nonsense. If it is nonsense, the only form of regulation that makes any sense is the law. Please fill in the consultation. My completed return [can be downloaded](CHRE-consultation.docx) as an example, if you wish. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should be a top level defender of truth. Its strapline is \"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" The MHRA did something (they won't tell me exactly what) about one of the [most cruel scams that I've ever encountered, Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/05/29/the-esperanza-scandal-office-of-trading-standards-useless-mhra-a-bit-better/), peddled for multiple sclerosis, at an outrageous price ( \u00a36,759 for 12 month's supply). Needless to say there was not a jot of evidence that it worked (and it wasn't actually homeopathic). Astoundingly, Trading Standards officers refused to do anything about it. The MHRA admit (when pushed really hard) that there is precious little evidence that any of the herbs work, and that homeopathy is nothing more than sugar pills. Their answer to that is to forget that bit about \"ensuring that medicines ... work\" Here's the MHRA's [Traditional Herbal Registration Certificate](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con134892.pdf) for devils claw tablets. The wording \"based on traditional use only\" has to be included because of European legislation. Shockingly, the MHRA have allowed them to relegate that to small print, with all the emphasis on the alleged indications. The pro-CAM agency NCCAM rates devil's claw as \"possibly effective\" or \"insufficient evidence\" for all these indications, but that doesn't matter because the MHRA requires no evidence whatsoever that the tablets do anything. They should, of course, added a statement to this effect to the label. They have failed in their duty to protect and inform the public by allowing this labelling. But it gets worse. Here is the MHRA's [homeopathic marketing authorisation for the homeopathic medicinal product Arnicare Arnica 30c pillules](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf) It is nothing short of surreal. | || | Since the pills contain nothing at all, they don't have the slightest effect on sprains, muscular aches or bruising. The wording on the label is exceedingly misleading. If you \"pregnant or breastfeeding\" there is no need to waste you doctor's time before swallowing a few sugar pills. \"Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one\". Since the pills contain nothing, it doesn't matter a damn. \"If you overdose . . \" it won't have the slightest effect because there is nothing in them And it gets worse. The MHRA-approved label specifies ACTIVE INGREDIENT. Each pillule contains 30c Arnica Montana No, they contain no arnica whatsoever. | || | It truly boggles the mind that men with dark suits and lots of letters after their names have sat for hours only to produce dishonest and misleading labels like these. When [this mislabeling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) was first allowed, it was condemned by [just about every scientific society](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30), but the MHRA did nothing.

Conclusions The regulation of alternative medicine in the UK is a farce. It is utterly ineffective in preventing deception of patients. Such improvements as have occurred have resulted from the activity of bloggers, and sometime the mainstream media. All the official regulators have, to varying extents, made things worse. The CHRE proposals promise to make matters still worse by offering \"accreditation\" to organisations that promote nonsensical quackery. None of the official regulators seem to be able to grasp the obvious fact that is impossible to have any sensible regulation of people who promote nonsensical untruths. One gets the impression that politicians are more concerned to protect the homeopathic (etc, etc) industry than they are to protect patients. Deception by advocates of alternative medicine harms patients. There are adequate laws that make such deception illegal, but they are not being enforced. The CHRE and its successor should restrict themselves to real medicine. The money that they spend on pseudo-regulation of quacks should be transferred to the MHRA or a reformed Trading Standards organisation so they can afford to investigate and prosecute breaches of the law. That is the only form of regulation that makes sense. Follow-up The shocking case of the continuing sale of \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, rubella, pertussis etc was highlighted in an [excellent TV programme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI) by BBC South West. The failure of the MHRA and the GPC do take any effective action is a yet another illustration of the failure of regulators to do their job. I have to agree with Andy Lewis when [he concludes](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html) \"Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator.\" On 23rd May 2008 a letter was sent to the vice-chancellor of the University of Westminster, Professor Geoffrey Petts | | | | Despite reminders, we were never afforded the courtesy of a reply to this, or any other letter. Professor Petts has, however, replied to a letters sent to him recently by the [Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/102-pseudo-science-by-degrees-a-response.html). He said \"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them. They are not teaching pseudo-science, as you claim,...\". Neither of thse claims is true.I know at least two members of the Life Sciences Faculty who are very worried. One has now left and one has retired. The rest are presumably too scared to speak out. It is most certainly not true to say they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". Both the vice-chancellor and the Dean of Life Sciences, Jane Lewis, have been made aware of what;s happening repeatedly over several years, I can think of no other way to put it but to say Professor Petts is lying. Tha is not a good thing for vice-chancellors to do. Much of what is taught at Westminster has now been revealed. This seems like a good moment to summarise what we know. Searching this blog for \"University of Westminster\" yields 39 hits. Of these, 11 show what's taught at Westminster, so I'll summarise them here for easy reference. March 26th, 2007 The day after \" [Science degrees without the Science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)\" appeared in Nature, the University of Westminster issued a statement (now vanished, [but see debate in THE](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208512\u00a7ioncode=26)). In my view, their statement provides the strongest grounds so far to believe that the BSc is inappropriate. Let's take a look at it. | | \"The BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Homeopathy is a fully validated degree that satisfies internal and external quality assurance standards.\" Since that time, the university has closed down the BSc in Homeopathy.

At that time there were five \"BSc\" degrees in homeopathy. A couple of weeks ago I checked the UCAS site for start in 2009, and found there was only one full \"BSc (hons)\" left and that was at Westminster University. Today I checked again and NOW THERE ARE NONE. A phone call to the University of Westminster tonight confirmed that they have suspended entry to their BSc (Hons) homeopathy degree.

So why, I wonder, did he say \"\"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them.\". He must know that this simply isn't true.

The lecturer underestimated the stupidiity of the Department of Health which [went ahead with statutory regulation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) despite being made aware of what was going on. The latest example to come to light is cited by Andy Lewis on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/foresight-preconception.html) \"There are some even odder characters too, such as [Roy Riggs B.Sc]who describes himself as a \"Holistic Geobiologist\" and is \"an \"professional Earth Energy dowser\".

His denial of the obvious fact that his university is teaching pseudo-science serves only to discredit further the University of Westminster and his own integrity. Follow-up 13 August 2011 I'm intrigued to notice that two days after posting this summary, googling \"Geoffrey Petts\" brings up this post as #3 on the first page. Actions have consequences. One wonders about the standards of peer review at the British Journal of General Practice. The June issue has a paper, \" [Acupuncture for 'frequent attenders' with medically unexplained symptoms: a randomised controlled trial (CACTUS study)](/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf)\". It has lots of numbers, but the result is very easy to see. Just look at their Figure. There is no need to wade through all the statistics; it's perfectly obvious at a glance that acupuncture has at best a tiny and erratic effect on any of the outcomes that were measured. But this is not what the paper said. On the contrary, the conclusions of the paper said | | Conclusion The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months. How on earth did the authors manage to reach a conclusion like that? The first thing to note is that many of the authors are people who make their living largely from sticking needles in people, or advocating alternative medicine. The authors are Charlotte Paterson, Rod S Taylor, Peter Griffiths, Nicky Britten, Sue Rugg, Jackie Bridges, Bruce McCallum and Gerad Kite, on behalf of the CACTUS study team. The senior author, [Gerad Kite MAc ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/5055611/Acupuncture-Guy-of-the-needles.html), is principal of the London Institute of Five-Element Acupuncture London. The first author, [Charlotte Paterson](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CACTUS+trial&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=paterson%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Charlotte%20Paterson%22%20acupuncture&cp=1&pf=p&sclient=psy&cr=countryUK|countryGB&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&biw=1027&bih=751&tbs=ctr:countryUK|countryGB&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Charlotte+Paterson%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28), is a well known advocate of acupuncture. as is [Nicky Britten](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Britten+acupuncture&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=britten%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Nicky%20Britten%22%20acupuncture&cp=15&pf=p&sclient=psy&client=firefox-a&hs=ZN0&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Nicky+Britten%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28&biw=1027&bih=751). The conflicts of interest are obvious, but nonetheless one should welcome a \"randomised controlled trial\" done by advocates of alternative medicine. In fact the results shown in the Figure are both interesting and useful. They show that acupuncture does not even produce any substantial placebo effect. It's the authors' conclusions that are bizarre and partisan. Peer review is indeed a broken process. That's really all that needs to be said, but for nerds, here are some more details. How was the trial done? The description \"randomised\" is fair enough, but there were no proper controls and the trial was not blinded. It was what has come to be called a \"pragmatic\" trial, which means a trial done without proper controls. They are, of course, much loved by alternative therapists because their therapies usually fail in proper trials. It's much easier to get an (apparently) positive result if you omit the controls. But the fascinating thing about this study is that, despite the deficiencies in design, the result is essentially negative. The authors themselves spell out the problems. \"Group allocation was known by trial researchers, practitioners, and patients\" So everybody (apart from the statistician) knew what treatment a patient was getting. This is an arrangement that is guaranteed to maximise bias and placebo effects. \"Patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive 12 sessions of acupuncture starting immediately (acupuncture group) or starting in 6 months' time (control group), with both groups continuing to receive usual care.\" So it is impossible to compare acupuncture and control groups at 12 months, contrary to what's stated in Conclusions. \"Twelve sessions, on average 60 minutes in length, were provided over a 6-month period at approximately weekly, then fortnightly and monthly intervals\" That sounds like a pretty expensive way of getting next to no effect. \"All aspects of treatment, including discussion and advice, were individualised as per normal five-element acupuncture practice. In this approach, the acupuncturist takes an in-depth account of the patient's current symptoms and medical history, as well as general health and lifestyle issues. The patient's condition is explained in terms of an imbalance in one of the five elements, which then causes an imbalance in the whole person. Based on this elemental diagnosis, appropriate points are used to rebalance this element and address not only the presenting conditions, but the person as a whole\". Does this mean that the patients were told a lot of mumbo jumbo about \"five elements\" (fire earth, metal, water, wood)? If so, anyone with any sense would probably have run a mile from the trial. \"Hypotheses directed at the effect of the needling component of acupuncture consultations require sham-acupuncture controls which while appropriate for formulaic needling for single well-defined conditions, have been shown to be problematic when dealing with multiple or complex conditions, because they interfere with the participative patient-therapist interaction on which the individualised treatment plan is developed. 37-39 Pragmatic trials, on the other hand, are appropriate for testing hypotheses that are directed at the effect of the complex intervention as a whole, while providing no information about the relative effect of different components.\" Put simply that means: we don't use sham acupuncture controls so we can't distinguish an effect of the needles from placebo effects, or get-better-anyway effects. \"Strengths and limitations: The 'black box' study design precludes assigning the benefits of this complex intervention to any one component of the acupuncture consultations, such as the needling or the amount of time spent with a healthcare professional.\" \"This design was chosen because, without a promise of accessing the acupuncture treatment, major practical and ethical problems with recruitment and retention of participants were anticipated. This is because these patients have very poor self-reported health (Table 3), have not been helped by conventional treatment, and are particularly desperate for alternative treatment options.\". It's interesting that the patients were \"desperate for alternative treatment\". Again it seems that every opportunity has been given to maximise non-specific placebo, and get-well-anyway effects. There is a lot of statistical analysis and, unsurprisingly, many of the differences don't reach statistical significance. Some do (just) but that is really quite irrelevant. Even if some of the differences are real (not a result of random variability), a glance at the figures shows that their size is trivial. My conclusions (1) This paper, though designed to be susceptible to almost every form of bias, shows staggeringly small effects. It is the best evidence I've ever seen that not only are needles ineffective, but that placebo effects, if they are there at all, are trivial in size and have no useful benefit to the patient in this case.. (2) The fact that this paper was published with conclusions that appear to contradict directly what the data show, is as good an illustration as any I've seen that peer review is utterly ineffective as a method of guaranteeing quality. Of course the editor should have spotted this. It appears that quality control failed on all fronts. Follow-up In the first four days of this post, it got over 10,000 hits (almost 6,000 unique visitors). Margaret McCartney has written about this too, in [The British Journal of General Practice does acupuncture badly](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=981).

I presume she didn't read the paper. The Daily Telegraph scarcely did better in [Acupuncture has significant impact on mystery illnesses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/8544735/Acupuncture-has-significant-impact-on-mystery-illnesses.html). The author if this, very sensibly, remains anonymous. Many \"medical information\" sites churn out the press release without engaging the brain, but most of the other newspapers appear, very sensibly, to have ignored ther hyped up press release. Among the worst was [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4129678&c=2), an online magazine for GPs. At least they've publish the comments that show their report was nonsense.

Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: \"To truly assess the efficacy of acupuncture a widespread double-blind test needs to be conducted over a series of years but to be honest it's the equivalent of mapping the DNA of pixies or conducting a geological study of Narnia.\" \" There is no truth whatsoever in the rumour being spread on Twitter that I'm Professor Brubaker. Euan Lawson, also known as Northern Doctor, has done another excellent job on the Paterson paper: [BJGP and acupuncture - tabloid medical journalism](http://northerndoctor.com/2011/06/02/bjgp-and-acupuncture-tabloid-medical-journalism/). Most tellingly, he reproduces [the press release](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/acupuncture_frequent_attenders.aspx) from the editor of the BJGP, Professor Roger Jones DM, FRCP, FRCGP, FMedSci. \"Although there are countless reports of the benefits of acupuncture for a range of medical problems, there have been very few well-conducted, randomised controlled trials. Charlotte Paterson's work considerably strengthens the evidence base for using acupuncture to help patients who are troubled by symptoms that we find difficult both to diagnose and to treat.\" Oooh dear. The journal may have a [new look](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/new_look_for_bjgp.aspx), but it would be better if the editor read the papers before writing press releases. Tabloid journalism seems an appropriate description. Andy Lewis at Quackometer, has written about this paper too, and put it into historical context. In [Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the-body.html). \"In 1800, John Haygarth warned doctors how we may succumb to belief in illusory cures. Some modern doctors have still not learnt that lesson\". It's sad that, in 2011, a medical journal should fall into a trap that was pointed out so clearly in 1800.

In the meantime we would encourage you to contribute to this debate throught the usual Journal channels Roger Jones Professor Roger Jones MA DM FRCP FRCGP FMedSci FHEA FRSA It is one thing to make a mistake, It is quite another thing to refuse to admit it. This reply seems to me to be quite disgraceful. 20 July 2011. The proper version of the story got wider publicity when Margaret McCartney wrote about it [in the BMJ](/McCartney-BMJ-on-BJGP.pdf). The first [rapid response](http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4606/reply#bmj_el_267995) to this article was a lengthy denial by the authors of the obvious conclusion to be drawn from the paper. They merely dig themselves deeper into a hole. The second response was much shorter (and more accurate). | | Thank you Dr McCartney Richard Watson, General Practitioner The fact that none of the authors of the paper or the editor of BJGP have bothered to try and defend themselves speaks volumes. Like many people I glanced at the report before throwing it away with an incredulous guffaw. You bothered to look into it and refute it - in a real journal. That last comment shows part of the problem with them publishing, and promoting, such drivel. It makes you wonder whether anything they publish is any good, and that should be a worry for all GPs. 30 July 2011. The [British Journal of General Practice](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcgp/bjgp/2011/00000061/00000589) has published nine letters that object to this study. Some of them concentrate on problems with the methods. others point out what I believe to be the main point, there us essentially no effect there to be explained. In the public interest, I am posting the responses here [ [download pdf file](/Bjgp-acupuncture-letter-july-2011.pdf)] Thers is also a response from the editor and from the authors. Both are unapologetic. It seems that the editor sees nothing wrong with the peer review process. I don't recall ever having come across such incompetence in a journal's editorial process. Here's all he has to say. | | The BJGP Editorial Board considered this correspondence recently. The Board endorsed the Journal's peer review process and did not consider that there was a case for retraction of the paper or for releasing the peer reviews. The Board did, however, think that the results of the study were highlighted by the Journal in an overly-positive manner. However,many of the criticisms published above are addressed by the authors themselves in the full paper. If you subscribe to the views of Paterson et al, you may want to [buy a T-shirt](http://controversy.wearscience.com/design/elements/) that has a revised version of the periodic table. 5 August 2011. A meeting with the editor of BJGP Yesterday I met a member of the editorial board of BJGP. We agreed that the data are fine and should not be retracted. It's the conclusions that should be retracted. I was also told that the referees' reports were \"bland\". In the circumstances that merely confirmed my feeling that the referees failed to do a good job. Today I met the editor, Roger Jones, himself. He was clearly upset by my comment and I have now changed it to refer to the whole editorial process rather than to him personally. I was told, much to my surprise, that the referees were not acupuncturists but \"statisticians\". That I find baffling. It soon became clear that my differences with Professor Jones turned on interpretations of statistics. It's true that there were a few comparisons that got below P = 0.05, but the smallest was P = 0.02. The warning signs are there in the Methods section: \"all statistical tests were .... deemed to be statistically significant if P < 0.05\". This is simply silly -perhaps they should have read [ Lectures on Biostatistics](http://www.dcscience.net/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf). Or for a more recent exposition, the [XKCD cartoon](http://flowingdata.com/2011/04/08/statistical-significance-on-xkcd/) in which it's proved that green jelly beans are linked to acne (P = 0.05). They make lots of comparisons but make no allowance for this in the statistics. Figure 2 alone contains 15 different comparisons: it's not surprising that a few come out \"significant\", even if you don't take into account the likelihood of systematic (non-random) errors when comparing final values with baseline values. Keen though I am on statistics, this is a case where I prefer the eyeball test. It's so obvious from the Figure that there's nothing worth talking about happening, it's a waste of time and money to torture the numbers to get \"significant\" differences. You have to be a slavish believer in P values to treat a result like that as anything but mildly suggestive. A glance at the Figure shows the effects, if there are any at all, are trivial. I still maintain that the results don't come within a million miles of justifying the authors' stated conclusion \"The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months.\" Therefore I still believe that a proper course would have been to issue a new and more accurate press release. A brief admission that the interpretation was \"overly-positive\", in a journal that the public can't see, simply isn't enough. I can't understand either, why the editorial board did not insist on this being done. If they had done so, it would have been temporarily embarrassing, certainly, but people make mistakes, and it would have blown over. By not making a proper correction to the public, the episode has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and the reputation oif the journal will suffer permanent harm. This paper is going to be cited for a long time, and not for the reasons the journal would wish. Misinformation, like that sent to the press, has serious real-life consequences. You can be sure that the paper as it still stands, will be cited by every acupuncturist who's trying to persuade the Department of Health that he's a \"qualified provider\". There was not much unanimity in the discussion up to this point, Things got better when we talked about what a GP should do when there are no effective options. Roger Jones seemed to think it was acceptable to refer them to an alternative practitioner if that patient wanted it. I maintained that it's unethical to explain to a patient how medicine works in terms of pre-scientific myths. I'd have love to have heard the \"informed consent\" during which \"The patient's condition is explained in terms of imbalance in the five elements which then causes an imbalance in the whole person\". If anyone had tried to explain my conditions in terms of my imbalance in my Wood, Water, Fire, Earth and Metal. I'd think they were nuts. The last author. Gerad Kite, runs a private clinic that sells acupuncture for all manner of conditions. You can find his view of science on his [web site](http://www.geradkite.com/content/content.php?pageID=7). It's condescending and insulting to talk to patients in these terms. It's the ultimate sort of paternalism. And paternalism is something that's supposed to be vanishing in medicine. I maintained that this was ethically unacceptable, and that led to a more amicable discussion about the possibility of more honest placebos. It was good of the editor to meet me in the circumstances. I don't cast doubt on the honesty of his opinions. I simply disagree with them, both at the statistical level and the ethical level. 30 March 2014 I only just noticed that one of the authors of the paper, Bruce McCallum (who worked as an acupuncturist at Kite's clinic) appeared in a 2007 Channel 4 News piece. I was a report on the pressure to save money by stopping NHS funding for [\"unproven and disproved treatments\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=135). McCallum said that scientific evidence was needed to show that acupuncture really worked. Clearly he failed, but to admit that would have affected his income. Watch the video (McCallum appears near the end). The long-awaited government decision concerning statutory regulation of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture came out today. [Get the Department of Health (DH) report [pdf]](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124338.pdf) It is not good news. They have opted for statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC). This is much what was recommended by the disgraceful [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo), about which I wrote a [commentary in the Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/columnists/article2047617.ece) (or [free version here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)), and [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://dcscience.net/?p=235). The DH report is merely an analysis of responses to the consultation, but the [MHRA says](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Medicinesregulatorynews/CON108795) \"The Health Professions Council (HPC) has now been asked to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines. The proposal is, following creation of this register, to make use of a derogation in European medicines legislation (Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC) that allows national arrangements to permit those designated as \"authorised healthcare professionals\" to commission unlicensed medicines to meet the special needs of their patients.\" The MHRA points out that this started 11 years ago with the publication of the [ House of Lords report (2000)](http://dcscience.net/?p=199). Both that report, and the government's response to it, set the following priorities. Both state clearly \"... we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order . . - (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? - (2) is the treatment safe? - (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment? The report of DH and the MHRA's response have ignored totally two of these three requirements. There is no consideration whatsoever of whether treatments work better than placebo (point one) and there is no consideration whatsoever of cost-effectiveness (point 3). These two important recommendations in the Houss of Lords report have simply been brushed under the carpet. Needless to say, herbalists are head over heels with joy at this sign of official endorsement (here is [one reaction](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=312229)) Here are my first reactions. The post will be updated soon. The DH report is, in a sense, democratic. They have simply counted the responses, for and against each proposal. They seem to be quite unaware that most of the responses come from High Street herbailsts whose main aim is to gain respectability. The response of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges counts as one vote, just the same as the owner of a Chinese medicine shop. This is not how health policy should be determined. Some intervention of the brain is needed, but that isn't apparent in the report. At present [the HPC regulates](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/) Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists, radiographers and speech & language therapists. I shudder to think what all these good people will think about being lumped together with people who practice evidence-free medicine (or, worse, forms of medicine where there is good evidence that they don't work). The vast majority of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture has no good evidence that it works, In the case of soem herbal medicines and acupuncture, there is good evidence that they don't work. Yet the HPC has, as [one of its criteria](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/), that aspiring to be regulated by them requires \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\" The Department of Health seems to have quietly forgotten about this criterion. It cannot possibly be met. The HPC has already expressed its willingness to go along with this two-faced approach (see [Health Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) ) Another mistake made by the Department of Health regards the value of \"training\". The report (page 11) says Would statutory regulation lessen the risk of harm? (Q2) Again, the vast majority of respondents thought it would. Reasons given were that statutory regulation would ensure that herbal practitioners and acupuncturists are carefully and thoroughly trained. That training is subject to accreditation, evaluation and periodic review by independent educational and training professionals, and disciplinary oversight by a regulating body. Incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners could be struck off the register and prevented from practising. Although it is pointed out to them in several responses, the Department of Health seems quite incapable of understanding a simple and obvious truth. Spending three years training people to learn things that are not true, safeguards nobody. On the contrary, it endangers the public. Training in nonsense is obviously a nonsense. At the end of the report is a list of organisations who responded, As expected, they are predominantly trade bodies that have a vested interest in allowing thinks to be sold freely regardless of whether they work or not. The first four are Alliance of Herbal Medicine Practitioners. European herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association (ETMPA), Association Chinese Medicine Practitioners (UK) (ACMP) and Acupuncture Society. And so on. More coming soon. Follow-up 16 February 2011. Later the same day, we see one reason why Michael Mcintyre, chair of the European Herbal Practitioners Association, got what he wanted to promote his trade. They had evidently hired a PR Agency, Cogitamus, to push their case. Now they are [ crowing about their victory](http://www.cogitamus.co.uk/?p=290). And of course his profits were not harmed by the free publicity that was given to his cause [ by the BBC](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2813), The pinheads in the Department of Health are more easily persuaded by a PR agency than by any number of people who know a lot more about it, and who have no profit motive. 17 February 2011. The herbal problem was front page news in the London free paper, the Metro: [Chinese medicine and herbal ban to see Britain defy EU laws](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/855767-chinese-medicine-and-herbal-ban-to-see-britain-defy-eu-laws) The Daily Telegraph covered the story: [Herbal medicine to be regulated, says Andrew Lansley](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8328791/Herbal-medicine-to-be-regulated-says-Andrew-Lansley.html). The comments featured some pretty mad rants from herbalists, to which I tried to reply. The Metro article elicited a fine bit of abuse from a Lynda Kane. I'm constantly amazed at the downright viciousness of cuddly holistic therapists when they get found out. I guess it is just another bad case of cognitive dissonance. I can't resist a few quotations. Sir, \"I have just come across your asinine comments quoted in the London Metro newspaper re the EU herbal medicine directive. For a supposed scientist your mis-informed, closed-minded, unsubstantiated bigotry leaves me speechless\" \"As a scientist myself, I abide by the virtues of open-minded neutrality and accepting the hypothesis until proven otherwise by null-hypothesis based research.\" \"How many of the innumerable studies on the efficacy of herbal medicine have you read? \" \"Perhaps in your 'day' professors could say whatever they liked and be listened to. That day is long gone, as you must know from the various law-suits you have been party to.\" I love the idea that statistics allow you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. This would be funny if it were not so sad (and rather painful). As always I replied politely and referred her to [NCCAM's Guide to Herbs](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), so she can check up on that plethora of evidence that she seems to think exists. This is Lynda Kane of [energyawareness.org](http://energyawareness.org/). I can recommend her web site, if you want some truly jaw-dropping woo. She'll sell you a \"White Jade Energy Egg - may provide up to 5 times as much protection from wifi and from other peoples' energies - costs \u00a347.00\". Hmm, sounds good. How does it work? Easy. \"The human energy or \"qi\" field is shaped like an egg. It is being attacked by many forms of natural and man-made environmental stress 24 hours a day.\" I guess that's OK according to Ms Kane's interpretation of statistics which allows you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. Anyone for Trading Standards or the ASA? 17 February 2011. The excellent Andy Lewis has posted on similar problems \" [How to Spot Bad Regulation of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/02/how-to-spot-bad-regulation-of-alternative-medicine.html)\" .20 July 2013 Nothing visible happened after this announcement. Until the government's resident medical loon, David Tredinnick MP forced [a debate on the matter](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0). His introduction to the debate was his usual make-believe. Sadly it made much of [an exhibit at the Royal Society ](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713)Summer Science exhibition -a bit of bait and swich by aromatherapists. After ploughing your way through pages of nonsense, you get to the interesting bit. At 10.38 am, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Dr Daniel Poulter, announced what was happening. It seems that there may, after all, have been some effect of all the [sensible submissions](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) which pointed out the impossibility of regulating nonsense. The question of regulation has, yet again, been postponed. \"To ensure that we take forward the matter effectively, we want to bring together experts and interested parties from all sides of the debate to form a working group that will gather evidence and consider all the viable options in more detail,\" One wonders who will be on this working group? If they don't choose the right people, it could be [as bad as the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713). It wasn't reassuring to read \" we want to set up a working group and to work with my hon. Friend [Tredinnick], and herbalists and others, to ensure that the legislation is fit for purpose.\" | | The Science Museum is a wonderful place. As a child it seemed magical. So all the more disappointing to find that it houses an exhibition that promotes quackery. The exhibition is uncritical and sometimes downright dangerous. It does not teach you anything about science, it teaches anti-science and uncritical thinking. It was not originally like this. Most of the objects in the exhibition were originally part of Henry Wellcome's Wellcome Museum of Medical History, based at 183 Euston Road. It was moved on permanent loan to the Science Museum in 1977 where it was known as The Wellcome Museum of the History of Medicine. | | > Recently the Wellcome-Trust sponsored exhibition was the subject of a blog post at [Purely a figment of your imagination](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/#comment-726), written by [Alex Davenport](http://twitter.com/#!/Alex_Davenport). That reminded me that last June I was sent a lot of pictures of the exhibition but never got round to finishing writing them up. Here, somewhat tardily, is some of what I got. It seems that the Wellcome Trust is not to blame, The free advertising for quacks was something added to the Wellcome collection by the Science Museum itself. At the time, I wrote to the Science Museum to find out what was going on. The response was very disappointing, merely bland PR stuff. I was told that the person responsible for the display was Lisa O'Sullivan, Senior Curator of Medicine, but she was on sabbatical, so no response from her. The clue to what went wrong came in a letter from Dr. Tim Boon, the Science Museum's Chief Curator. The letter was relayed via the Museum's Press Officer. A subsequent letter to Boon himself was not answered. \"Therefore, in addition to the overwhelming majority of the Upper Wellcome gallery that tells the story of the history of Western medicine since the rise of Civilisation up to the modern era, we devote a small section to these more anthropological concerns in our display called 'Living Medical Traditions'. Our message in this display is that these traditions are not 'alternative' systems in some parts of the world. Instead they are often the only choice of medical care to those communities. We do not make any claims for the validity of these traditions. For example, we include the use of acupuncture but do not say that acupuncture 'works'. \" Unfortunately this is really not true: the tone is very much that it does work. The reason is clear in the next paragraph. \"As with all Science Museum galleries independent experts were consulted when developing this gallery. In this instance advice was sought from leading academics in the history of non-western medical traditions as well as practitioners and users of these traditions. We maintained editorial control throughout.\" Aha they asked \"experts\", but of course it is always possible to find some 'expert' to advocate any view, however barmy. The only experts that were consulted, we are told, is historians and practitioners of anti-scientific medicine. No scientists. Clearly the Museum allowed the quacks to write their own script, with no supervision from anyone who understands the science, It is meant to be a Science Museum, not a museum of anthropology. The nonsense of quack medicine provides an excellent opportunity to explain simply how science tries to separate truth from falsehood. The Museum has not only missed that opportunity but it has actively promoted anti-science. The Museum declined to name these mystery experts, but one of them is revealed in the 2006 newsletter of the British Medical Acupuncture Society [ [download the newsletter](/BMAS-newsletter-summer-2006.pdf)]. An article by Jonathan Freedman shows the delight of acupuncturists. \"The BMAS were approached by the Museum last Summer and asked if any members would be able to contribute a case study about acupuncture to feature in the 'personal stories' section of the exhibition.\" \"I think the final product has worked extremely well and shows Western Medical Acupuncture in a positive light. A selection of needles is displayed along with the BMAS leaflet and my own practice acupuncture leaflet.\" In fact the Science Museum's good name is used by Freedman to advertise his private practice. Here is the free advertising in the Science Museum. Traditional Chinese Medicine There is plenty of this and it is totally uncritical. All it does is repeat the gobbledygook used by practitioners. In fact it was largely written by them. There are recorded commercials too. Listen to this one. [Advertising for cupping at the Asant\u00e9 Clinic](/scimus-tcm.mp3). In the recording, Dr Ke diagnoses an asthma patient as having mucus in the lungs -by looking at his tongue (no kidding) -and recommends [ cupping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping). He says \"We need to clear this mucus, or the phlegm, in the chest by using cupping, It's improving, sort of, the flow of the water, and flow out, in other words, suck out the badness from the body\" This, needless to say, is total rubbish. The recording took place at the [Asant\u00e9 Clinic](http://www.asante-academy.com/), on the Archway campus of the University of Middlesex. Ah yes, Middlesex. Take a look at ' [More quackedemia.

My own letters to the science museum produced precisely nothing, as is usually the case if you go through the \"proper channels\". [Alex Davenport's blog](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/),on the other hand, stung the Science Museum into a [public response](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/).

It seems a bit more pressure is needed to persuade the museum to change this particular exhibition into science, rather than its present anti-science. Follow-up 13 April 2011. Simon Singh arranged a meeting with the new director of the Science Museum, Ian Blatchford, and deputy director Heather Mayfield Our deputation consisted of Simon Singh, Alex Davenport, Marianne Baker and me. It was [Alex's blog](http://noodlemaz.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/science-wooseum/) on the science museum exhibit, and [my post on the museum ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4066)which followed it shortly, that caused the meeting. Alex had a [follow-up blog](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/) too. I hadn't realised that Simon had resigned as a trustee of the museum five years ago, in protest about the (dreadful) alternative medicine exhibit. I had various stonewalling responses to my attempts to pursue the matter out of the limelight, so eventually went public. After the blogs appeared, the Science Museum [published a response](http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/living-medical-traditions/) which was, sadly, entirely vacuous. We had an excellent discussion, during which Ian Blatchford said he regretted the official response and changes to the exhibit are promised. there is an account of the meeting [here](http://begsci.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/science-triumphs/). We were sent a revised version, which was improved, but not, we said improved enough. 10 May 2011.

Systems biology is all the rage, No surprise then, to see the University of Westminster [advertising a job](http://liv2.www.jobs.ac.uk/employer/university-of-westminster) for a systems biologist in the The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences. Well, no surprise there -until you read the small print.

LWA) The Department of Molecular and Applied Biosciences wishes to appoint a Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology. The post-holder will teach on the undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes within the School of Life Sciences, particularly in the areas of Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and/or statistics, establish their own and participate in ongoing research programmes and undertake external income generation activities. The candidate should have an active interest in bridging the gap between western life sciences and Chinese medicine using emerging systems biology approaches, specifically in metabolomics and proteomics with a goal of developing novel diagnostic technologies facilitating the creation of a personalised approach to medical care. They should therefore be willing to work closely with colleagues in the life sciences as well as with clinicians and clinical researchers from within the East Asian medical tradition. The post is available from 1st October 2010 or as soon as possible thereafter. The closing date for applications, together with a short statement on why you believe you are suitable for the position and a description of your research plans, is Monday 6th September 2010. Interviews are expected to be held later in September. Administrative contact (for queries only): Tayjal Tailor ( Reference Number: 50000360 Closing Date: Friday 3 September 2010 A note about systems biology Systems biology is about about how whole organs behave, as opposed to single cells or single molecules, It has to be the ultimate aim of biology. There is one case in which this has been done with some success, That is the modelling of the behaviour of the whole heart by Denis Noble and his colleagues in the Phyiology department (now gone) in Oxford. They adopted a bottom up approach. They measured the currents that flow though many sorts of ion channels in single cells from various parts of the heart, and how individual cells communicate with each other. Starting from this solid basis, together with a lot of computer power, they were able to model successfully a lot of phenomena that occur in the whole heart, but can't be investigated in single cells. For example their work cast light on abnormal heart rhythms like ventricular fibrillation, and on the effect of drugs on heart rhythm. This work was mostly done before the term 'systems biology\" thought of. It was called physiology. It is impressive work, and systems biology became a fashionable buzzword among research administrators and funding agencies. Despite the amount of money thrown at the problem, I'm not aware of any success that remotely approaches Noble's.. One reason for that is that people have not been willing to put in the groundwork. In the case of the heart, the models were built on -many years of basic research on the electrophysiology of single heart cells. People have tried to model from the top down, without doing the spade work first. There has developed a perception that computing power can compensate for lack of basic knowledge about things work. It can't. The usual aphorism applies: garbage in, garbage out. Here's an example, which eas noted in the [diary pages for 29 June, 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=237#sysbio). While in Edinbuurgh, to give a talk to the European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, I noticed a poster. It described an attempt to model on a computer the entire metabolic network of yeast. \"81 of the 662 intracellular concentrations were defined . . . The remainder were set to the median concentration of c. 0.2 mM.\" Ahem. We didn't know the concentrations so we just made them up so we could run the program. It's interesting that even people in the business seem to realise that even that it isn't living up to the hype. The [Fixing proteomics](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) web site shows why. Put another way, if you try to run before you can walk, you risk falling falling on your face. For these reasons, it seems to me that that most attempts at system biology have been disappointing (please correct me if I'm wrong) Systems biology for Chinese medicine If systems biology suffers from trying to run before it can walk in regular biology, where at least something is known about the functions of cells, how much more true that must be of Chinese medicine. In Chinese medicine almost all the treatments have never been tested properly in man. The odds are that most don't work at all, and some are very poisonous (not to mention the cruelty and destruction of endangered species that is involved in making some of their more bizarre medicines). The idea that you can explain it with systems biology, is ludicrous in the extreme. One can't imagine any vaguely competent biologist who'd want to touch a project as bizarre as this with a bargepole. Eastmedicine This advertisement stems presumably from [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) is the University of Westminster's research centre for East Asian Sciences and Traditions in Medicine. The proclaimed aims are to focus on \"understanding, development and evaluation of East Asian medicines as living traditions\". The director of EASTmedicine, [Volker Scheid](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/index.php), is a herbalist and acupuncturist and, as such, a firm believer in alternative medicine. When he isn't at the University he has a private practice, the [Traditional Acupuncture Centre](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/), in London. The website of his private practice makes some [astonishing claims](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org.uk/page1.html) \"Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of numerous conditions including headache, migraine, digestive problems, menstrual disorders, indeterminate aches and pains, asthma, hayfever, stress, tiredness, depression and anxiety. Also commonly treated are chronic conditions such as arthritis, back pain, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, eczema, sinusitis, high blood pressure and repetitive strain injuries.\" These claims simply cannot be justified by any worthwhile evidence. It will be interesting to see what Trading Standards make of them. Dr Scheid [describes himself](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/chinese-medicine-and-complementary-therapies/volker-scheid) as a \"scholar physician\". Physician seems a rather pretentious description for someone whose qualifications are [stated to be](http://www.byregion.net/chinese%20medicine/HealerPages/8/cp/.) PhD, MBAcC, FRCHM. But in similar vein he describes himself thus \"I am one of the West's leading experts on Chinese medical formulas and treatment strategies\". Although Scheid sells acupuncture treatments to patients, he seems ro be more anthropologist than medical. In a discussion of two acupuncture papers \"From the Perspective of the Anthropologist - Volker Scheid, London, UK From a perspective anchored in the cultural studies of science, technology and medicine my main interest in these papers is their status as cultural artifacts that provide access to the lifeworlds of a particular research community. If any, life-world debate and argument marks sites of contestation.\" [Forsch Komplement\u00e4rmed 2007;14:371-375] Scheid shows not the slightest interest in whether acupuncture works other than as a placebo. Since he is selling acupuncture, he presumably starts from the premise that it works. Volker Scheid has had a \u00a3205,000 Wellcome Trust for the History of Medicine Project Grant: 2009 2012; Treating the Liver: Towards a Transnational History of East Asian Medicine; There's nothing wrong with writing the history of long-outdated systems of medicine, though one could hardly imagine that the history would be very impartial, when it is written by a true believer. Another taste of his style can be found in his paper on [Globalising Chinese Medical Understandings of Menopause](http://www.volkerscheid.co.uk/downloads/EASTS_Menopaus_Article.pdf). There is lots of rather pretentious stuff about culture, but very little about what actually works, Towards the end of the paper we come to the usual feeble excuse. \" . . once traditional medicines allow themselves to be evaluated by biomedical research methods, the odds against receiving fair treatment are heavily stacked against them.\" The translation of that into plain English is something like 'when we test our treatments properly we find they don't work, so we blame the methods and carry on with selling them anyway'. Judging from its web site, [EASTmedicine](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) does not to do any serious clinical trials to test whether the treaments work in man, They just know that they do. But they are hoping to add some spurious scientific background to their dubious claims by hiring someone to do compuations that will cast no light whatsoever on the question that really matters, Do they work or not? The agenda is made clear by [the statement](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/research/research-groups/eastmedicine#Summary) EASTmedicine seeks to describe and analyse the dynamics of these transformations with a specific view of managing their integration into contemporary health care. So it is just yet another group of people pushing to have unproven and disproved treatments accepted by real medicine. The University of Westminster appears to be determined to make itself the laughing stock by persisting in promoting junk science at a time when most other universities have realise that the harm done to their reputations is not worth the income it generates, Plenty of it has been [revealed here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22). The vice-chancellor of Westminster, Prof Geoffrey Petts, made into the pages of Private Eye (see [Crystal balls. Professor Petts in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1153) when he announced that he wouldn't get rid of the junk, but would make it more 'scientific'. Well, credit where it's due, They have [dropped homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). see [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) For 2010 they still off [ten different \"BSc (Hons)\" degrees](http://courses.westminster.ac.uk/CourseSearch.aspx) in pre-scientific forms of medicine. It will take more than a bit od talk about systems biology to make anyone believe that these courses have anything to do with science. For example, look at some slides from their lectures on \"energy medicine\", the of Westminster. This time it's Naturopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) , or [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) The Dean of the School of the Life Sciences, [Jane Lewis](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/schools/science/staff/dean-of-the-school), is an entirely respectable marine biologist. She has had the thankless task of merging the real science with the alternative medicine in a single school. I phoned her to get a reaction \" outcome of merger of the school and trying to bring various parts of the school together\" \" \"things are much more rigorous than they were\". DC: \"Why don't you just phase it out?\" \"I'm not in a poition to do that. i move things forward as seems best -for the whole school I have to say\". We're retaining those bits thatI think have some good standing -I see NICE has approved the use of acupuncture for lower back pain and some other bits and pieces so I see acupuncture as something that does have some standing, andwe make sure it rigorously taught\" \"DCHave you looked at the stuff on naturopathy?\" \"Are amethysts emit high Yin energy still taught?\" \" i don't think so\". [It seems, as so often in this case, that the senior people don't really know what's being taught under their noses. Prof](http://www.fixingproteomics.org/) Lewis says she has not read about the [background to the (unusually) daft advice from NICE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593). Neither has she read [Barker Bausell's book](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell)on acupuncture research. If she had done any of these things,I suspect she would not have such a high opinion of it as appears to be the case. Bait and switch. Astonishingly there is a now a whole organisation devoted to the respectabalisation of Traditional Chinese Medicine [Good Practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine Research in the Post-genomic Era](http://www.gp-tcm.org/) It sounds nice and sciencey but, as usual, they are trying to run before they can walk. The first thing has to be to do good clinical trials to find out if there is anything there to be investigated. If, and only if, this is the case, would there be any case for fancy talk about \"proteomics\" and \"the post-genomic era\". I do hope that no funding agency would be fooled into parting with money on the basis of the present vacuous rhetoric. Professor Lewis said that I have I have quoted things like \" [amethysts emit high Yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" out of context. There is a simple solution to that. I have asked Westminster to make available the entire contents of the courses. Then we shall all be able to see the context of what their sudents are being taught. Follow up A brief report of this matter has appeared in [Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413176&c=1).

I'm not aware of anyhting quite like this from anywhere else. In any case, Westminster should be able to think for themselves. There is something very offensive about the idea that a 'bachelor of science' degree can be awarded by a university, as a prize for memorising gobbledygook. Once the contents of the 'degrees' has been exposed to public ridicule, many universities have stopped doing it. All (or nearly all) of these pseudo-degrees have closed at the [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), the [University Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485), [Robert Gordon the of Buckingham](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881), and even at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) (the worst offender), one course has closed (with rumours of more to follow). | | I've already written about the course in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the University of Salford ( One place that has yet to come under close scrutiny is | | Michael Driscoll, VC of Middlesex University. The buck stops with him. Their \"Complementary Health\" courses are as follows (April 2010). [Complementary Health Sciences (Ayurveda) Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/complementary_health_sciences_Ayurveda_bsc.aspx) [Herbal Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/traditional_chinese_medicine_bsc.aspx) and also two postgraduate courses I asked Middlesex University for samples of their teaching materials under the Freedom of Information Act, and, as usual, the request was refused. As usual, I then asked for the mandatory internal review of the decision, and this time, most unusually, the internal review did not confirm the initial refusal and I was sent a bundle of teaching materials about Chinese Herbal Medicine, It was not all I asked for, but it is quite enough to show the absurd ideas that are still being taught as part of bachelor of Science degree in a UK University. Not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people. The vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, [Professor Michael Driscoll](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx), is an economist, not a biologist. Surely you don't need to be a scientist to feel a bit suspicious when you read on the Middlesex web site about Traditional Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion including distribution of meridians-collaterals and location of acupoints; needling and moxibustion techniques; Have any of the members of [the Executive](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx) ever thought to ask about what goes on in these courses? Even if it is beyond an economist to see through the nonsense, surely it should be possible for Professor Margaret House, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic, whose interests lie in water quality, should be able to, though as Dean of the School of Health and Social Sciences she appears to sponsor the nonsense. And Professor Waqar Ahmad, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise, who has written a s book on Ethnicity, Health and Health Care, should surely be able to distinguish sense from nonsense in health care? In that respect, I'd have less confidence in Katie Bell, Chief Marketing Officer, who joined Middlesex University in 2009 following a career in brand marketing for Nestl\u00e9 UK and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Marketing people seldom have much regard for truth. Have any of the [University's Governors](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/governors/Biographies/index.aspx) ever asked what is going on in their name? It's true that none of the long list of distinguished-sounding governors is a scientist. Surely you don't need to be to question whether or not what follows can be described as 'science'. My guess is that none of these distinguished people has ever bothered to look at the dangerous nonsense that is being taught in their University. It is not in the nature of 'managers' to look far beyond ticked-boxes and profit, They should have done of course, but to make it easier for them, here is a small selection of the slides that I was sent (the copyright for them lies with the university: these few slides come under the heading ' 'fair quotation' and it is undoubtedly in the public interest to show them). Course CMH 1211 e Uhuh, my spleen qi is well and truly knotted already though when I learned physiology it was not thought that the spleen had much to do with emotions. Ah so at least the problem of heavy breathers is solved. But high temperature, abdominal pain and abnormal pulse can be signs of serious illness. If your only explanation for them is \"preponderant evil Qi\", you are a menace to public health. All these symptoms could be the result of a serious disease. It is not only antiquated nonsense to talk about them in terms of Yin, Yang and Qi. It endangers people, Course CMH 2212 Chinese materia medica. Some of the herbs are likely to contain active ingredients (indeed some are very dangerous). It would be quite possible to study the ingredients of these herbs and to investigate how they work in the light of what has been learned about physiology and pharmacology in the last 200 years. Pharmacology has a long history of doing that, But is seems to play no part in this course. Herbs are \"cold\" or \"hot\" and may \"check the exuberance of yang\". and so on, just preposterous, made-up nonsense from another era. If it were taught as cultural history, it might be interesting. But it is being taught as though it were true, and an appropriate way to treat sick people. Course CMH 3214 Would you trust your child to someone who'd been taught that \"causes of paediatric diseases are relatively simple\", and \"children are pure yang\"? Now some Chinese recipes Course CMH 3100 This may or may not taste good, but to recommend it for diabetes is seriously irresponsible. The programme specification for the \"BSc (Hons) Traditonal Chinese medicine\" can be [found here](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/Assets/BSc%20_Hons_%20Traditional%20Chinese%20Medicine%C2%A0%2018.pdf). [local copy [download](/mdx-tcm.pdf)] It is written with all the official trappings, just as though the degree was about science. It isn't. It is a danger to public health. I have asked the vice-chancellor, Michael Driscoll, to express his view of these comments Follow-up A rather unexpected comment from [a London acupuncturist](http://acupuncture.blog.co.uk/2010/04/12/dc-s-improbable-science-blog-dangerous-chinese-medicine-taught-at-university-8352795/). \"At least,I knew that Professor David Colquhoun is very skeptical about Chinese medicine. he comment Chinese medicine study\"not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people.\" \" \"But,I still like to read his blog as His article very is respectable. I think. Look this...\" The skeptic blog featured this post in its [weekly roundup](http://skeptic.org.uk/news/2010/2545). 27 May 2010. [Times Higher Education reported](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780) the decision of Middlesex University to close its philosophy department. This department seems to have a [remarkable reputation](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411482), not least for a post-1992 university. Three academics and four students have been suspended and gagged in classical bullying style. This has happened while they continue to teach dangerous rubbish like that described above. I left [a comment at Times Higher](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780), as follows. It is a reflection on the quality of university management that Middlesex has chosen to shut its philosophy department while continuing to run degrees in quackery. These courses not only offer an Hons BSc for memorising chunks of anti-scientific nonsense. They also pose a real danger to patients. See http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923 I can think of no better illustration than this of the crass nature of the judgements made by Middlesex's management. They are either ignorant of what constitutes science, or they are corrupt. I see no other possibilities. In either case they should not be running a university. I think Prof Michael Driscoll owes the world an explanation. It seems very reasonable to suggest that taxpayers have an interest in knowing what is taught in universities. The recent [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310) suggested that degrees should be mandatory in Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. So it seems natural to ask to see what is actually taught in these degrees, so one can judge whether it protects the public or endangers them. Since universities in the UK receive a great deal of public money, it's easy. Just request the material under the Freedom of Information Act. Well, uh, it isn't as simple as that. Every single application that I have made has been refused. After three years of trying, the Information Commissioner [eventually supported my appea](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364)l to see teaching materials from the Homeopathy \"BSc\" at the University of Central Lancashire. He ruled that every single objection (apart from one trivial one) offered by the universities was invalid. In particular, it was ruled that univerities were not \"commercial\" organisations for the purposes of the Act. So problem solved? Not a bit of it. I still haven't seen any of the materials from the original request because the University of Central Lancashire appealed against the decision and the case of [University of Central Lancashire v Information Commissioner](http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/Documents/PendingAppeals/CCU_15102009.pdf) is due to be heard on November 3rd, 4th and 5th in Manchester. I'm joined (as lawyers say) as a witness. Watch this space. UCLan is not the exception. It is the rule. I have sought under the Freedom of Information Act, teaching materials from UClan (homeopathy), University of Salford (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of Westminster (homeopathy, reflexology and nutritional therapy), University of West of England, University of Plymouth and University of East London, University of Wales (chiropractic and [nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259)), Robert Gordon University Aberdeen (homeopathy), Napier University Edinburgh (herbalism). In every single case, the request for teaching materials has been refused. And that includes the last three, which were submitted after the decision of the Information Commissioner. They will send things like course validation documents, but these are utterly uninformative box-ticking documents. They say nothing whatsoever about what is actually taught. The fact that I have been able to discover quite a lot about what's being taught owes nothing whatsoever to the Freedom of Information Act. It is due entirely to the many honest individuals who have sent me teaching materials, often anonymously. We should be grateful to them. Their principles are rather more impressive than those of their principals. Since this started about three years ago, two of the universities, [UCLan](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) and [Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), have shut down entry to all of their CAM courses. And [Westminster has shut two](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) of them, with more rumoured to be closing soon. They are to be congratulated for that, but is far from being the end of the matter. The Department of Health, and some of the Royal Colleges, have yet to catch up with the universities, The Pittolo report, which recommends making degrees compulsory, is being considered by the Department of Health. The consultation ends on November 2nd: if you haven't yet responded, please do so now ( [see how here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329), and [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2310)). A common excuse: the university does not possess teaching materials (yes, really) Several of the universities claim that they cannot send teaching materials, because they have no access to them. This happens when the university has accredited a course that is run by another, privately run, institution. The place that does the actual teaching, being private, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The ludicrous corollary of this excuse is that the university has accredited the course without checking on what is taught, and in some cases without even having seen a timetable. The University of Wales In fact the University of Wales doesn't run courses at all. Like the (near moribund) University of London, it acts as a [degree-awarding authority for a lot of Welsh Universities](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E5011). It also validates a lot of courses in non-university institutions, [34 or so of them in the UK](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7051&country=UNITED+KINGDOM), and others scattered round the world. Many of them are theological colleges. It does seem a bit odd that [St Petersburg Christian University, Russia, and ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=RUSSIA&inst=PETERS) [International Baptist Theological Seminary, Prague](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=CZECH%20REPUBLIC&inst=IBTS), should be accredited by the University of Wales. They also validate the [International Academy of Osteopathy, Ghent](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=BELGIUM&inst=IAO) 34 UK institutions include the [Scottish School of Herbal Medicine, the ](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=SS) [Northern College of Acupuncture](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=NC) and the [Mctimoney College of Chiropractic](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E7052&Country=UNITED%20KINGDOM&inst=MT). The case of the Nutritional Therapy course has been described already in [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). It emerged that the course was run by a grade 1 new-age fantasist. It is worth recapitulating [the follow up](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259#follow). What does the University of Wales say? So far, nothing. Last week I sent brief and polite emails to Professor Palastanga and to Professor Clement to try to discover whether it is true that the validation process had indeed missed the fact that the course organiser's writings had been described as \"preposterous, made-up, pseudoscientific nonsense\" in the Guardian. So far I have had no reply from the vice-chancellor, but on 26 October I did get an answer from Prof Palastanga. As regards the two people you asked questions about - J.Young - I personally am not familiar with her book and nobody on the validation panel raised any concerns about it. As for P.Holford similarly there were no concerns expressed about him or his work. In both cases we would have considered their CV's as presented in the documentation as part of the teaching team. In my experience of conducting degree validations at over 16 UK Universities this is the normal practice of a validation panel. I have to say this reply confirms my worst fears. Validation committees such as this one simply don't do their duty. They don't show the curiosity that is needed to discover the facts about the things that they are meant to be judging. How could they not have looked at the book by the very person that they are validating? After all that has been written about Patrick Holford, it is simply mind-boggling that the committee seems to have been quite unaware of any of it. It is yet another example of the harm done to science by an unthinking, box-ticking approach. Incidentally, Professor Nigel Palastanga has now been [made Pro Vice-Chancellor (Quality)](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E735) at the University of Wales and [publishes bulletins](http://www.wales.ac.uk/defaultpage.asp?page=E780) on quality control. Well well. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic was the subject of my next Freedom of Information request to the University of Wales. The reasons for that are, I guess, obvious. They sent me hundreds of pages of validation documents, Student Handbooks (approx 50 pages), BSc (Hons) Chiropractic Course Document. And so on. Reams of it. The documents mostly are in the range of 40 to 100 pages. Tons of paper, but none of it tells you anyhing whatsover of interest about what's being taught. They are a testament to the ability of universities to produce endless vacuous prose with very litlle content. They did give me enough information to ask for a sample of the teaching materials on particular topics. But I gor blank refusal, on the grounds that they didn't possess them. Only McTimoney had them. Their (unusually helpful) Freedom of Information officer replied thus. \"The University is entirely clear about the content of the course but the day to day timetabling of teaching sessions is a matter for the institution rather than the University and we do not require or possess timetable information. The Act does not oblige us to request the information but there is no reason you should not approach McTimoney directly on this.\" So the university doesn't know the timetable. It doesn't know what is taught in lectures, but it is \" entirely clear about the content of the course\". This response can be described only as truly pathetic. Either this is a laughably crude form of obstruction of my request, or perhaps, even more frighteningly, the university really believes that its endless box-ticking documents actually provide some useful control of quality. Perhaps the latter interpretation is more charitable. After all, the QAA, CHRE, UUK and every HR department share similar delusions about what constitutes quality. Perhaps it is just yet another consequence of having science run largely by people who have never done it and don't understand it. Validation is a business. The University of Wales validates no fewer than 11,675 courses altogether. Many of these are perfectly ordinary courses in universities in Wales, but they validate 594 courses at non-Welsh accredited institutions, an activity that earned them \u00a35,440,765 in the financial year 2007/8. There's nothing wrong with that if they did the job properly. In the two cases I've looked at, they haven't done the job properly. They have ticked boxes but they have not looked at what's being taught or who is teaching it. The University of Kingston The University of Kingston offers a [\"BSc (Hons)\" in acupuncture](http://www.kingston.ac.uk/acupuncturebsc/). In view of the fact that the [Pittilo group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235) has recommended degrees in acupuncture, there is enormous public interest in what is taught in such degrees, so I asked. They sent the usual boring validation documents and a couple of sample exam papers . The questions were very clinical, and quite beyond the training of acupuncturists. The validation was done by a panel of three, Dr Larry Roberts (Chair, Director of Academic Development, Kingston University), Mr Roger Hill (Accreditation Officer, British Acupuncture Accreditation Board) and Ms Celia Tudor-Evans (Acupuncturist, College of Traditional Acupuncture, Leamington Spa). So nobody with any scientific expertise, and not a word of criticism. | | Further to your recent request for information I am writing to advise that the University does not hold the following requested information: (1) Lecture handouts/notes and powerpoint presentations for the following sessions, mentioned in Template 3rd year weekend and weekday course v26Aug2009_LRE1.pdf (a) Skills 17: Representational systems + Colour & Sound ex. Tongue feedback 11 (b) Mental Disease + Epilepsy Pulse feedback 21 (c) 18 Auricular Acupuncture (d) Intro. to Guasha + practice Cupping, moxa practice Tongue feedback 14 (2) I cannot see where the students are taught about research methods and statistics. I would like to see Lecture handouts/notes and PowerPoint presentations for teaching in this area, but the 'timetables' that you sent don't make clear when or if it is taught. The BSc Acupuncture is delivered by a partner college, the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM), with Kingston University providing validation only. As such, the University does not hold copies of the teaching materials used on this course. In order to obtain copies of the teaching materials required you may wish to contact the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine directly. This completes the University's response to your information request. So again we see that Kingston has validated the course but has not seen a timetable, far less what is taught. My reply was thus | | Yes I am exceedingly unhappy about it. The university attaches its name to the course so it must obviously be able to get the material simply by asking for it (I'm surprised that the university should endorse a course without knowing what is taught on it, but that's another matter). I request formally that you obtain this material. If necessary please read this as a formal appeal. I await with interest. In every single case so far, the internal review has merely confirmed the initial refusal. It means a bit of a delay before the case goes to the Information Commisssioner's Office. Napier University Edinburgh Napier University runs a \" [BSc (Hons) Herbal medicine](http://www.courses.napier.ac.uk/U74301.htm?Nav=2)\". (brochure [here](http://www2.napier.ac.uk/newsnew/upload/foi/FHLS_CommHealth_HerbMed_15092004103945.pdf)). Since herbal medicine is a subject of the [Pittilo recommendations](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235), there is enormous public interest in what they teach. So I asked, under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002). They sent quite quickly validation and accreditation documents, some examination papers, timetables and lecture lists. The validation was the usual vacuous box-ticking stuff though it did reveal that the course \"made extensive use of techniques such as tongue and pulse diagnosis\", which are well known phoney diagnosis methods, about as much use as a pendulum (as used at Westminster University). As at Kingston University, the exam papers they chose to send were mostly \"pretend doctor\" stuff. One of them was Discuss the herbal practitioner's role in the management of IHD [ischaemic heart disease) How one would like to see what the students said, and, even more one would like to see the model answer. Amateurs who try to treat potentially serious conditions are a danger to the public. So then we got to the interesting bit, the request for actual teaching materials. | | I have looked at the material that you sent and I'd now like to make the following supplementary request (A) Lecture notes/handouts and powerpoint slides for the following small smaple HRB09102 Materia Medica 4 Materia (HRB09104) HRB09100 Materia Medica Herbal Practice BSc Herbal Medicine : Materia Medica HRB07102 Lastly, I can see nowhere in the timetable, lectures that deal with Research methods, clinical trial design and statistics. No prizes for guessing the result Total refusal to send any of them. To make matters worse, the main grounds for refusal were the very \"commercial interests\" which, after careful legal examination, the Information Commissioner (for England and Wales) had decided were invalid. They say too that \"The public interest in withholding the information is greater than the public interest in its release\".. It is hard to see how the public interest is served by concealing from the people who pay for the degrees what is taught on degrees that [Pittilo wants](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2329) to make compulsory. [ [Download the whole response](/Prof_Colquhoun_FOISA_Response_071009.pdf)] The matter is now under internal appeal ( [read the appeal](/napier-herbal-appeal.pdf)) and eventually we shall find out whether the Scottish Information Commissioner backs the judgement. Robert Gordon University Aberdeen This case has particular interest because the Vice-Chancellor of Robert Gordon University is [ Professor Michael Pittilo](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece), chair of the highly contentious steering group that recommended degress in CAM. Robert Gordon University (RGU) does not teach herbal medicine or acupuncture. But they do run [An Introduction to Homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/prospectus/modules/disp_moduleView.cfm?Descriptor=NU3786). All the degrees in homeopathy have closed. It is perhaps the daftest and most discredited of all the popular forms of [Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). But Professor Pittilo thinks it is an appropriate subject to teach in his university. So again I asked for information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. They sent me quite quckly a list of the powerpoint presentations used on the courses [ [download it](RGU_FOI_230709_1_Homeopathy_course_materials.pd)]. I asked for a small sample of the powerpoints. And again the university did not possess them! | | I should like to see only the following three powerpoint presentations in the first instance, please. Please can you let me know also who produced the powerpoints. (1) Evidence for homeopathy I note that you will have to request them but since they are being offered as part of a course offered by RGU, so RGU is responsible for their quality, I presume that this should cause no problem. The request was refused on much the same grounds as used by Napier University. As usual, the internal review just confirmed the initial proposal (but dropped the obviously ludicrous public interest defence). The internal review said \"it is mainly the quality of our courses (including course material) and teaching which has given us the position of \"the best modern university in Scotland\" I am bound to ask, if the university is so proud of its course material, why is it expending so much time and money to prevent anyone from seeing a small sample of it? My appeal has been sent to the Scottish Information Commissioner [ [download the appeal](/appeal-to-Scottish-info-commissioner-RGU.pdf)]. What are vice-chancellors thinking about? I find it very difficult to imagine what is going through the heads of vice-chancellors who run courses in mumbo-jumbo. Most of them don't believe a word of it (though Michael Pittilo might be an exception) yet they foist it on their students. How do they sleep at night? Recently the excellent Joe Collier wrote a nice BMJ blog which applauded the lack of respect for authority in today's students, [Joe Collier says good riddance to old-fashioned respect](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/10/05/joe-collier-says-good-riddance-to-old-fashioned-respect/). I couldn't resist leaving a comment. | | I couldn't agree more. There is nothing quite so unnerving as being addressed as \"Sir\". It is an advantage of age that you realise what second-rate people come to occupy very grand positions. Still odder since, if occasionally they are removed for incompetence, they usually move to an even grander position. I guess that when I was an undergraduate, I found vice-chancellors somewhat imposing. That is, by and large, not a view that survives closer acquaintance. Should teaching materials be open to the public? There is only one university in the world that has, as a matter of policy, made all of its teaching material open to the public, that is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I can recommend strongly course 18.06, a wonderful set of [lectures on Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/#features) by Gilbert Strang. (It is also a wonderful demonstration of why blackboards may be better than Powerpoint for subjects like this). Now they are on [YouTube too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c). A lot of other places have made small moves in the same direction, as discussed recently in Times Higher Education, [Get it Out in the Open](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408300&c=2). Now the OU is working with other British universities to help them develop and share open course materials. In June, at the celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the OU, Gordon Brown announced funding to establish the Support Centre for Open Resources in Education at the OU, as part of a \u00a37.8 million grant designed to enhance the university's national role. The funding follows a separate grant of \u00a35.7 million from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for universities across the sector to make thousands of hours of free learning materials available. Much material is available on the web, when individual teachers choose to place it there, but at the same time there is a move in the other direction. In particular, the widespread adoption of Moodle has resulted in a big decrease in openness. Usually you have to be registered on a course to see the material. Even other people in the university can't see it. I think that is a deplorable development (so, presumably, does HEFCE). Conclusion I was told by the Univerity of Kingston that \"The course is one which the University has validated and continues to be subject to the University's quality assurance procedures, such as internal subject reviews, annual monitoring and external examining\" The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that \"quality arrurance procedures\" work about as well in universities as they did in the case of [baby Peter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/baby-p/5313303/Baby-Peter-failed-by-NHS-staff-who-saw-him-35-times.html). No doubt they were introduced with worthy aims. But in practice they occupy vast amounts of time for armies of bureaucrats, and because the brain does not need to be engaged they end up endorsing utter nonsenes. The system is broken. Resistance is futile. You can see a lot of the stuff here It is hard to keep secrets in the internet age. Thanks to many wonderful people who have sent me material. you can see plenty of what is taught, despite the desperate attempts of vice-chancellors to conceal it. Try these links.

The whole document can be [downloaded here](/Pittilo_consultation-AvP.pdf). I have removed the name of the author. It is written by the person who has made some excellent contributions to this blog under the pseudonym \"Allo V Psycho\". The document is a model of clarity, and it ends with constructive suggestions for forms of regulation that will, unlike the Pittilo proposals, really protect patients Here is the summary. The full document explains each point in detail. | | Executive Summary Instead, safe regulation of alternative practitioners should be through: The first two recommendations for effective regulation are much the same as mine, but the the third one is interesting. The problem with the Cancer Act (1939), and with the Unfair Trading regulations, is that they are applied very erratically. They are the responsibility of local Trading Standards offices, who have, as a rule, neither the expertise nor the time to enforce them effectively. A Health Advertising Standards Authority could perhaps take over the role of enforcing existing laws. But it should be an authority with teeth. It should have the ability to prosecute. The existing Advertising Standards Authority produces, on the whole, excellent judgements but it is quite ineffective because it can do very little. A letter from an acupuncturist I had a remarkable letter recently from someone who actually practises acupuncture. Here are some extracts. | | \"I very much enjoy reading your Improbable Science blog. It's great to see good old-fashioned logic being applied incisively to the murk and spin that passes for government \"thinking\" these days.\" \"It's interesting that the British Acupuncture Council are in favour of statutory regulation. The reason is, as you have pointed out, that this will confer a respectability on them, and will be used as a lever to try to get NHS funding for acupuncture. Indeed, the BAcC's mission statement includes a line \"To contribute to the development of healthcare policy both now and in the future\", which is a huge joke when they clearly haven't got the remotest idea about the issues involved.\" \"Before anything is decided on statutory regulation, the British Acupuncture Council is trying to get a Royal Charter. If this is achieved, it will be seen as a significant boost to their respectability and, by implication, the validity of state-funded acupuncture. The argument will be that if Physios and O.T.s are Chartered and safe to work in the NHS, then why should Chartered Acupuncturists be treated differently? A postal vote of 2,700 BAcC members is under-way now and they are being urged to vote \"yes\". The fact that the Privy Council are even considering it, is surprising when the BAcC does not even meet the requirement that the institution should have a minimum of 5000 members ( \"Whatever the efficacy of acupuncture, I would hate to see scarce NHS resources spent on well-meaning, but frequently gormless acupuncturists when there's no money for the increasing costs of medical technology or proven life-saving pharmaceuticals.\" \"The fact that universities are handing out a science degree in acupuncture is a testament to how devalued tertiary education has become since my day. An acupuncture degree cannot be called \"scientific\" in any normal sense of the term. The truth is that most acupuncturists have a poor understanding of the form of TCM taught in P.R.China, and hang on to a confused grasp of oriental concepts mixed in with a bit of New Age philosophy and trendy nutritional/life-coach advice that you see trotted out by journalists in the women's weeklies. This casual eclectic approach is accompanied by a complete lack of intellectual rigour. My view is that acupuncturists might help people who have not been helped by NHS interventions, but, in my experience, it has very little to do with the application of a proven set of clinical principles (alternative or otherwise). Some patients experience remission of symptoms and I'm sure that is, in part, bound up with the psychosomatic effects of good listening, and non-judgemental kindness. In that respect, the woolly-minded thinking of most traditional acupuncturists doesn't really matter, they're relatively harmless and well-meaning, a bit like hair-dressers. But just because you trust your hairdresser, it doesn't mean hairdressers deserve the Privy Council's Royal Charter or that they need to be regulated by the government because their clients are somehow supposedly \"vulnerable\".\" Earlier postings on the Pittilo recommendations A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235) Article in The Times (blame subeditor for the horrid title) [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece) Some follow up on The Times piece [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251) The Health Professions Council breaks its own rules: the result is nonsense [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) Chinese medicine -acupuncture gobbledygook revealed [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950) Consultation opens on the Pittilo report: help top stop the Department of Health making a fool of itself [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients [http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) One month to stop the Department of Health endorsing quackery.

If you haven't responded yet, please do. It would be an enormous setback for reason and common sense if the government were to give a stamp of official approval to people who are often no more than snake-oil salesman. Today I emailed my submission to the Pittilo consultation to the Department of Health, at [HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk) The submission I sent the following documents, updated versions of those already posted earlier. - Submission to the Department of Health, for the consultation on the Pittilo report [ [download pdf](/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf)]. - What is taught in degrees in herbal and traditional Chinese medicine? [ [download pdf](/Pittilo-consultation-What-is-taught.pdf)] - $2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures [ [download pdf](/nccam-2-billion-spent-ABC-news.pdf)] - An example of dangerous (and probably illegal) claims that are routinely made by TCM practitioners [ [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/Chinesemedicine_cancer.pdf)]f I also completed their questionnaire, despite its deficiencies. In case it is any help to anyone, this is what I said: The questionnaire Q1: What evidence is there of harm to the public currently as a result of the activities of acupuncturists, herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners? What is its likelihood and severity? Harm No Harm Unsure Comment The major source of harm is the cruel deception involved in making false claims of benefit to desperate patients. This applies to all three. In the case of herbal and TCM there is danger from toxicity because herbal preparations are unstandardised so those that do contain an active ingredient are given in an unknown dose. This is irresponsible and dangerous (but would not be changed by the proposals for regulation). In addition TCM suffers from recurrent problems of contamination with heavy metals, prescription drugs and so on. Again this would not be the business of the proposed form of regulation. Q2: Would this harm be lessened by statutory regulation? If so, how? Yes No Unsure The proposed form of regulation would be no help at all. The HPC has already said that it is not concerned with whether or not the drug works, and, by implication, does not see itself as preventing false health claims (just as the GCC doesn't do this). False claims are the responsibility of Trading Standards who are meant to enforce the Consumer Protection Unfair Trading Regulations (May 2008), though they do not at present enforce them very effectively. Also Advertisng Standards. The proposed regulation would not help, and could easily hinder public safety as shown by the fact that the GCC has itself been referred to the Advertisng Standards Authority. The questions of toxicity and contamination are already the responsibility of Trading Standards and the MHRA. Regulation by the HPC would not help at all. The HPC is not competent to deal with such questions. Q3: What do you envisage would be the benefit to the public, to practitioners and to businesses, associated with introducing statutory regulation? Significant benefit Some benefit No benefit Unsure This question is badly formulated because the answer is different according to whether you are referring to the public, to practitioners or to businesses. The public would be endangered by the form of regulation that is proposed, as is shown very clearly by the documents that I have submitted separately. In the case of practitioners and businesses, there might be a small benefit, if the statutory regulation gave the impression that HM and TCM had government endorsement and must therefore be safe and effective. There is also one way that the regulation could harm practitioners and businesses. If the HPC received a very large number of complaints about false health claims, just as the GCC has done recently, not only would it cost a large amount of money to process the claims, but the attendant bad publicity could harm practitioners. It is quite likely that this would occur since false claims to benefit sick people are rife in the areas of acupuncture, HM and TCM. Q4: What do you envisage would be the regulatory burden and financial costs to the public, to practitioners, and to businesses, associated with introducing statutory regulation? Are these costs justified by the benefits and are they proportionate to the risks? If so, in what way? Justified Not Justified Unsure Certainly not justified. Given that I believe that the proposed form of regulation would endanger patients, no cost at all would be justified. But even if there were a marginal benefit, the cost would be quite unjustified. The number of practitioners involved is very large. It would involve a huge expansion of an existing quango, at a time when the government is trying to reduce the number of quangos. Furthermore, if the HPC were flooded with complaints about false health claims, as the GCC has been, the costs in legal fees could be enormous. Q5: If herbal and TCM practitioners are subject to statutory regulation, should the right to prepare and commission unlicensed herbal medicines be restricted to statutorily regulated practitioners? Yes No Unsure I don't think it would make much difference. The same (often false) ideas are shared by all HM people and that would continue to be the same with or without SR. Q6: If herbal and TCM practitioners are not statutorily regulated, how (if at all) should unlicensed herbal medicines prepared or commissioned by these practitioners be regulated? They could carry on as now, but the money that would have been spent on SR should instead be used to give the Office of Trading Standards and the MHRA the ability to exert closer scrutiny and to enforce more effectively laws that already exist. Present laws, if enforced, are quite enough to protect the public. Q7: What would be the effect on public, practitioners and businesses if, in order to comply with the requirements of European medicines legislation, practitioners were unable to supply manufactured unlicensed herbal medicines commissioned from a third party? Significant effect Some effect No effect Unsure European laws,especialliy in food area, are getting quite strict about the matters of efficacy. The proposed regulation, which ignores efficacy, could well be incompatible with European law, if not now, then soon. This would do no harm to legitimate business though it might affect adversely businesses which make false claims (and there are rather a lot of the latter). Q8: How might the risk of harm to the public be reduced other than by orthodox statutory regulation? For example by voluntary self-regulation underpinned by consumer protection legislation and by greater public awareness, by accreditation of voluntary registration bodies, or by a statutory or voluntary licensing regime? Voluntary self-regulation Accreditation of voluntary bodies Statutory or voluntary licensing Unsure I disagree with the premise, for reasons given in detail in separate documents. I believe that 'orthodox statutory regulation', if that means the Pittilo proposals, would increase, not decrease, the risk to the public. Strengthening the powers of Trading Standards, the MHRA and such consumer protection legislation would be far more effective in reducing risk to the public than the HPC could ever be. Greater public awareness of the weakness of the evidence for the efficacy of these treatments would obviously help too, but can't do the job on its own. Q10: What would you envisage would be the benefits to the public, to practitioners, and to businesses, for the alternatives to statutory regulation outlined at Question 8? It depends on which alternative you are referring to. The major benefit of enforcement of existing laws by Trading Standards and/or the MHRA would be (a) to protect the public from risk, (b) to protect the public from health fraud and (c) almost certainly lower cost to the tax payer. Q11: If you feel that not all three practitioner groups justify statutory regulation, which group(s) does/do not and please give your reasons why/why not? Acupuncture Herbal Medicine TCM Unsure None of them. The differences are marginal. In the case of acupuncture there has been far more good research than for HM or TCM. But the result of that research is to show that in most cases the effects are likely to be no more than those expected of a rather theatrical placebo. Furthermore the extent to which acupuncture has a bigger effect than no-acupuncture in a NON-BLIND comparison, is usually too small and transient to offer any clinical advantage (so it doesn't really matter whether the effect is placebo or not, it is too small to be useful). In the case of HM, and even more of TCM, there is simply not enough research to give much idea of their usefulness, with a small handful of exceptions. This leads to a conclusion that DH seems to have ignored in the past. It makes absolutely no sense to talk about \"properly trained practitioners\" without first deciding whether the treatments work or not. There can be no such thing as \"proper training\" in a discipline that offers no benefit over placebo. It is a major fault of the Pittilo recommendations that they (a) ignore this basic principle and (b) are very over-optimistic about the state of the evidence. Q12: Would it be helpful to the public for these practitioners to be regulated in a way which differentiates them from the regulatory regime for mainstream professions publicly perceived as having an evidence base of clinical effectiveness? If so, why? If not, why not? Yes No Unsure It might indeed be useful if regulation pointed out the very thin evidence base for HM and TCM but it would look rather silly. The public would say how can it be that the DH is granting statutory regulation to things that don't work? Q13: Given the Government's commitment to reducing the overall burden of unnecessary statutory regulation, can you suggest which areas of healthcare practice present sufficiently low risk so that they could be regulated in a different, less burdensome way or de-regulated, if a decision is made to statutorily regulate acupuncturists, herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners? Yes No Unsure As stated above, the.only form of regulation that is needed, and the only form that would protect the public, is through consumer protection regulations, most of which already exist (though they are enforced in a very inconsistent way). Most statutory regulation is objectionable, not on libertarian grounds, but because it doesn't achieve the desired ends (and is expensive). In this case of folk medicine, like HM and TCM, the effect would be exactly the opposite of that desired as shown in separate documents that I have submitted to the consultation. Q14: If there were to be statutory regulation, should the Health Professions Council (HPC) regulate all three professions? If not, which one(s) should the HPC not regulate? Yes No Unsure The HPC should regulate none of them. It has never before regulated any form of alternative medicine and it is ill-equipped to do so. Its statement that it doesn't matter that there is very little evidence that the treatments work poses a danger to patients (as well as being contrary to its own rules). Q15: If there were to be statutory regulation, should the Health Professions Council or the General Pharmaceutical Council/Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland regulate herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners? HPC GPC/PSNI Unsure Neither. The GPC is unlikely to care about whether the treatments work any more than the RPSGB did, or the GCC does now. The problems would be exactly the same whichever body did it. Q16: If neither, who should and why? As I have said repeatedly, it should be left to Trading Standards, the MHRA and other consumer protection regulation. Q17: a) Should acupuncture be subject to a different form of regulation from that for herbalism and traditional Chinese medicine? If so, what? Yes No Unsure b) Can acupuncture be adequately regulated through local means, for example through Health and Safety legislation, Trading Standards legislation and Local Authority licensing? Yes No Unsure (a) No -all should be treated the same. Acupuncture is part of TCM (b) Yes Q18. a) Should the titles acupuncturist, herbalist and [traditional] Chinese medicine practitioner be protected? b) If your answer is no which ones do you consider should not be legally protected? Yes No Unsure No. It makes no sense to protect titles until such time as it has been shown that the practitioners can make a useful contribution to medicine (above placebo effect). That does not deny that placebos may be useful at times. but if that is all they are doing, the title should be 'placebo practitioners'. Q19: Should a new model of regulation be tested where it is the functions of acupuncture, herbal medicine and TCM that are protected, rather than the titles of acupuncturist, herbalist or Chinese medicine practitioner? Yes No Unsure No. This makes absolutely no sense when there is so little knowledge about what is meant by the \" functions of acupuncture, herbal medicine and TCM\".Insofar as they don't work (better than placebo), there IS no function. Any attempt to define function when there is so little solid evidence (at least for HM and TCM) is doomed to failure. Q20: If statutory professional self-regulation is progressed, with a model of protection of title, do you agree with the proposals for \"grandparenting\" set out in the Pittilo report? Yes No Unsure No. I believe the Pittilo report should be ignored entirely. The whole process needs to be thought out again in a more rational way. Q22: Could practitioners demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and communicate effectively with regulators, the public and other healthcare professionals if they do not achieve the standard of English language competence normally required for UK registration? What additional costs would occur for both practitioners and regulatory authorities in this case? Yes No Unsure No. It is a serious problem, in TCM especially, that many High Street practitioners speak hardly any English at all. That adds severely to the already considerable risks. There would be no reliable way to convey what was expected of them. it would be absurd for the taxpayer to pay for them to learn English for the purposes of practising TCM (of course there might be the same case as for any other immigrant for teaching English on social grounds). Q23: What would the impact be on the public, practitioners and businesses (financial and regulatory burden) if practitioners unable to achieve an English language IELTS score of 6.5 or above are unable to register in the UK? Significant impact Some impact No impact Unsure The question is not relevant. The aim of regulation is to protect the public from risk (and it should be, but isn't, an aim to protect them from health fraud). It is not the job of regulation to promote businesses Q24: Are there any other matters you wish to draw to our attention? I have submitted three documents via [HRDListening@dh.gsi.gov.uk]. The first of these puts the case against the form of regulation proposed by Pittilo, far more fluently than is possible in a questionnaire. Another shows examples of what is actually taught in degrees in acupuncture, HM and TCM. They show very graphically the extent to which the Pittilo proposals would endanger the public, if they were to be implemented.. This post has been [translated into Belorussian](http://onlinepharmacycheck.com/~doc/cnmed-be).. Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up The much-delayed public [consultation on the Pittilo report](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_103567) has just opened. It is very important that as many people as possible respond to it. It's easy to say that the consultation is sham.

It is now over a year since the Report to Ministers from \"The Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK\" [ [download the report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf)]. The chair of the steering group was Professor R. Michael Pittilo, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The reason thet the report is so disastrously bad in its assessment of evidence is that it was written entirely by people with vested interests. The committee consisted of five acupuncturists, five herbalists and five representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (plus eleven observers). There was not a single scientist or statistician to help in the assessment of evidence. And it shows: The assessment of the evidence in the report was execrable. Every one of the committee members would have found themselves out of work if they had come to any conclusion other than that their treatment works, Disgracefully, these interests were not declared in the report, though they are not hard to find. The university of which the chair is vice-chancellor runs a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of the popular forms of alternative medicine. That tells you all you need to know about the critical faculties of Michael Pittilo. The two main recommendations of this Pittilo report are that - Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine should be subject to statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council - Entry to the register normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours Let's consider the virtue of these two recommendations. Regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC) breaks their own rules For a start, this should be ruled out by the HPC's own rules, which require \" [Practise based on evidence of efficacy](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/)\" as a condition for registration. Since there is practically no \"evidence of efficacy\", it follows that the HPC can't regulate acupuncture, herbal and Chinese medicine as Pittilo recommends. Or so you'd think. But the official mind seems to have an infinite capacity for doublespeak. The HPC published a report on 11 September 2008, [Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf). The report says 1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons. 2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions. 3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest. In other words, the [HPC simply decided to ignore its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284), Its excuse for doing so is that regulation would protect \"public safety\" . But it simply would not do that. It is ell known that some Chinese herbs are adulterated with dangerous substances, but laws against that already exist. Trading Standards are much more likely to take appropriate action than the HPC. The Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) already deals with the licensing of herbal medicines. and, despite the fact that it recently betrayed its trust by allowing them to be labelled in a misleading way, they are the people to do it, not the HPC. The [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) (page 11) says In future, it is hoped that more Government funding can be allocated to research into traditional/herbal medicines and acupuncture and that grants will become available to encourage practitioners to undertake postgraduate research work. So they are asking for more government money. In March 2007, the Chinese Government pledged to spend over $130 million over the next five years on research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. It is to be hoped that this money will be targeted effectively to evaluate TCM. It seems to have escaped the notice of Pittilo that roughly 100 percent of trials of Chinese medicine done in China come out positive. Elsewhere, very few come out positive,(see Vickers et al., 1998, Controlled Clinical Trials, 19, 159-166: [download reprint](/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf)) The Department of Health would be unwise to rely on Chinese research. Remember that modern acupuncture was not so much a product of ancient wisdom, but rather it stems from nationalist propaganda by Mao Tse-Tung, who needed a cheap way to keep the peasants quiet, though he was too sensible to use it himself. The [HPC report](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf) (page 5) cites these with the words \" . . . a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base.\" This sentence seems to assume that the outcomes of research will be to strengthen the evidence base. Thus far, precisely the opposite has been the case. The Pittilo group has apparently not noticed that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent a billion dollars on research in alternative medicine and failed to come up with a single effective treatment. There are better ways to spend money on health. See, for example [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031).An enornous amount of research has already been done and the outcomes have produced no good treatments, The proposed regulation would endanger the public, not protect it. The excuse given by the HPC for breaking its own rules is that it should do so to protect the public. Likewise [Ann Keen, Health Minister, said](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/News/Recentstories/DH_103585): \"Patient safety is paramount, whether people are accessing orthodox health service treatments or using alternative treatments\" So first we need to identify what dangers are posed by acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. - Acupuncture is fairly safe. Its biggest danger lies in the unjustified claims that are routinely made for what can be achieved by being impaled by needles. This poses a danger that people may use acupuncture in place of treatments that work - Herbal medicines are unstandardised, so even the very few that may work are dangerous to patients because the dose of active principle is unknown and varies from one batch to another. Taking a herbal medicine is a bit like swallowing a random number of tablets, False health claims pose a danger to patients too, when they cause patients to avoid treatments that work. - Traditional Chinese Medicine is probably the most dangerous. Like the other two, the medicines are unstandardised so the dose is never known. False health claims abound. And in addition to these dangers, many cases have been found of Chinese medicines being adulterated with poisonous substances or with conventional drugs. The form of regulation proposed by Pittilo would do little or nothing to protect the public from any of these dangers. The proposals accept the herbal and Chinese medicine as traditionally practised. Nothing would be done about one of the major dangers, [ the lack of standardisation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205). That is a problem that was solved by pharmacologists in the 1930s, when international standards were set for the biological activity of things like tincture of digitalis, and assays were devised so that different batches could be adjusted to the same potency. Now, 80 years later, it is being proposed by Pittilo that we should return to the standards of safety that existed at the beginning of the last century. That is a threat to public safety., but the proposed regulation would do nothing whatsoever to protect the public from this dangerous practice. On the contrary, it would give official government sanction to it. The other major danger is that patients are deceived by false health claims. This is dangerous (as well as dishonest) because it can cause patients to avoid treatments that work better, The internet abounds with claims that herbs can cure anything from diabetes to cancer. Many are doubtless illegal, but regulators like the HPC have traditionally ignored such claims: they are left to Trading Standards, Advertising Standards and the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) to deal with. The MHRA already also has responsibility for monitoring side effects. The HPC would not do this. The analogy with chiropractic and the GCC The foolishness of allowing statutory regulation for unproven treatments has recently been illustrated quite dramatically by the case of chiropractic. Chiropractors have had statutory regulation by the General Chiropractic Council, which was established by the Chiropractors Act of 1994. The [ British Chiropractic Association (BCA)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) recently decided to sue the science writer, Simon Singh, for defamation when he cast doubt on some of the claims made by chiropractors, in particular their claims to be able to cure colic and asthma in children. That led to close examination of the claims. In fact there is no reason to think that spinal manipulation w [orks for asthma](/ernst-chiro-asthma.pdf), or that it works [for colic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775). In fact there is quite good evidence that the claims are false. The result was that about 600 well-justified complaints have been lodged with the GCC (enough to bankrupt the GCC if the complaints are dealt with properly). The point of this story is that the statutory regulator had nothing whatsoever to prevent these false health claims being made. Two of the complaints concern practices run by the chair of the GCC. Worse, the GCC actually endorsed such claims. The statutory regulator saw its duty to defend chiropractic (apart from a handful of cases of sexual misdemeanours), not to protect the patient from false health claims. The respectability conferred by statutory regulation made false health claims easier and endangered the public. It would be a disaster if the same mistake were made again. On 11th December 2008 I got a letter form the HPC which said in our opinion a lack of evidence of efficacy would not impede our ability to set standards or deal with complaints we receive. The vast majority of cases we consider are related to conduct. But perhaps that is because they haven't tried \"regulating\" quacks before. Now that the public is far more conscious about health fraud than it used to be, one can predict confidently that the HPC would be similarly overwhelmed by a deluge of complaints about the unjustified health claims made by acupuncturists, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. There is no shortage of them to complain about. The education problem The Pittilo report recommends that the entry level for registration should be a bachelors degree with honours. At first sight it seems reasonable to ask that practitioners should be 'properly qualified', but when one looks at what is actually taught on these degrees it becomes clear that they endanger, rather than protect, the public, There are two very big problems with this recommendation. Firstly, you can't have a bachelors degree with honours until after you have decided whether or not there is anything useful to teach. If and when any of the subjects under consideration and shown to work to a useful extent, then it would be quite reasonable to establish degrees in them. Even the report does not pretend seriously that that stage has been reached. The proposal to set up degrees in subjects, at least some of which are quite likely to have no more than placebo value, is self-evidently nonsense, The time for degrees, and the time for government endorsement by statutory regulation, is after the therapies have been shown to work, not before. The absurdity of thinking that the public will be protected because a practitioner has a degree in, say, acupuncture, is shown with startling clarity by a [recently revealed examination paper](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950) in acupuncture' You can [download the entire exam paper](http://www.dcscience.net/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights from it. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Teaching of traditional Chinese medicine is just as bad. Here are two slides from a course run by the University of Westminster. The first 'explains' the mysterious and entirly mythical \"Qi\". So \"Qi\" means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism. This is meaningless nonsense. The second slide shows the real dangers posed by the way Chinese medicine is taught, The symptoms listed at the top could easily be a clue to serious illness, yat students are taught to treat them with ginger. Degrees like this endanger the public. There are more mind-boggling slides from lectures on [Chinese medicine and cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043): they show that what students are being taught is terrifyingly dangerous to patients. It is entirely unacceptable that students are being taught these ancient myths as though they were true, and being encouraged to treat sick people on their basis. The effect of the Pittilo recommendations would be to force new generations of students to have this sort of thing forced on them. In fact the course for which this exam was set has already closed its doors. That is the right thing to do. Here's another example. The course leader for \"BSc (Hons) Herbal Medicine\" at the [Graeme Tobyn BA](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/health/schools/school_of_nursing/divisions/graeme_tobyn_profile.php). But Tobyn is not only a herbalist but also an astrologer. In an [interview he said](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/tobyn.html) \"At the end I asked her if I could cast her horoscope. She threw up her hands and said, 'I knew this would happen if I came to an alternative practitioner.\" \"I think the ruler of the ascendant was applying to Uranus in the ninth house, which was very pertinent.\" This would be preposterous even in the life style section of a downmarket women's magazine, The Pittilo report wants to make degrees run my people like this compulsory. Luckily the Univerity of Central Lancashire is much more sensible and the [course is being closed.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) The matter is, in any case, being taken out of the hands of the government by the fact that universities are closing degrees in complementary medicine, including courses in some of those under discussion here, The [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) have recently announced the closure of all the degree programmes in complementary and alternative medicine. The largest provider of such degrees, the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) has already shut down two of them, and the rest are being assessed at the moment. It is likely that the rest will be closed in the future. The revelation that Westminster had been teaching its first year students that \" [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" and that students had been taught to [diagnose disease and choose treatments by means of a dowsing pendulum](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), showed very clearly the sort of utter nonsense that undergraduates were being forced to learn to get a 'bachelors degree with honours'. It stretches credulity to its limits to imagine that the public is protected by degrees like this. Precisely the opposite is true. The universities have recognised this, and shut the degrees. One exception is Professor Pittilo's own university which continues to run a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of all the popular types alternative medicine. A simpler, more effective and cheaper way to protect the public I must certainly agree with the minister that protection of the public is an important matter. Having established that the Pittllo recommendations are more likely to endanger the public than protect them, it is essential to suggest alternative proposals that would work better. Luckily, that is easy, because mechanisms already exist for dealing with the dangers that were listed above. The matter of adulteration, which is serious in traditional Chinese medicine, is a matter that is already the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards. The major problem of false claims being made for treatment is also the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards, which has a statutory duty to enforce the Unfair Trading Consumer Protection Regulations of May 2008. [These laws state, for example, that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) \"One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is \"falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations\" The monitoring of false claims, and of [side effects of treatments](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122525561/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0), is also the responsibility of the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Rather than setting up complicated, expensive and ineffective 'regulation' by the HPC, all that need to be done is to ensure that the MHRA and/or Trading Standards have the funds to enforce existing laws. At the moment, they are not being implemented effectively, so I'd recommend that responsibility for enforcing the law against false health claims be transferred entirely to the MHRA, which has much more expertise in such matters than Trading Standards This would be both cheaper and more effective than the present system in which the responsibility is divided between the two organisations in an unclear way. This proposal would protect the public against unsafe and adulterated treatments, and it would protect the public against false and fraudulent claims. That is what matters. It would do so more effectively, more cheaply and more honestly than the Pittilo recommendations. There would be no reduction in patient choice either, There is no proposal to ban acupuncture, herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine. All that is necessary is to ensure that they don't endanger the public. Since the root of the problem lies in the fact that the evidence for the effectiveness is very weak. the question of efficacy, and cost-benefit ratio, should be referred to NICE. This was recommended by the House of Lords Report (2000). It is recommended again by the Smallwood report (sponsored by the Prince of Wales Foundation). It is baffling that this has not been done already. It does not seem wise to spend large amounts of money on new research at the moment, in the light of the fact that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent over $1 billion on such research without finding a single useful treatment. The results of all this research has been to show that hardly any alternative treatment are effective. That cannot be ignored. Conclusion Recent events show that the halcyon days for alternative medicine are over. When the Pittilo report first appeared, it was greeted with derision in the media. For example, in The Times [Alice Miles wrote](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/alice_miles/article4159652.ece) \"This week came the publication of the Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK. Otherwise known as twaddle.\" In the Independent, [Dominic Lawson wrote](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-so-now-we-will-have-degrees-in-quackery-852858.html) So now we will have degrees in quackery. What, really, is the difference between acupuncture and psychic surgery? People will no doubt continue to use it and that is their right and their responsibility. But if the government were to accept the recommendations of the Pittilo report it would be seen, quite rightly, as being anti-scientific and of posing a danger to the public. Fortunately there is a better, and cheaper, way to protect the public. Follow-up Margaret McCartney's blog [in the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/healthblog/2009/08/05/the-force-and-consultation-on-the-pittilo-report-on-alternative-health-therapies/) puts rhw view of a GP with her usual sense, humour and incisiveness. \"This report would, if implemented, create lots more nonsense exam papers funded by a lot more public money - and would produce practitioners without the absolutely crucial skill of how to assess evidence and reject or use it appropriately\" The Times has covered the story (with some interesting comments) [Consultation on how to regulate complementary and alternative therapies](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article6737965.ece) Times Higher Education [UK-wide consultation on CAM regulation is launched](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=407695&c=2) Excellent response from Andy Lewis. The Sun has by far the best coverage up to now, Jane Symons writes \" [Regulating quacks helps them prey on gullible patients](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/2573544/Herbalists-seen-to-be-given-approval-will-help-them-prey-on-gullible-patients.html)\" Acupuncture has been in the news since, in a moment of madness, [NICE gave it some credence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593), Some people still seem to think that acupuncture is somehow more respectable than, say, homeopathy and crystal healing. If you think that, read [Barker Bausell's book](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell) ot [Trick or Treatment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh). It is now absolutely clear that 'real' acupuncture is indistinguishable from sham, whether the sham control uses retractable needles, or real needles in the 'wrong' places. There has been no clear demonstration of long-lived benefits in any condition, and it is likely that it is no more than a theatrical placebo. In particular, the indistinguishability of 'real' and sham [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945) shows, beyond reasonable doubt that all the stuff about \"energy flow in meridians\" is so much hokum. There is a small group of ' [medical acupuncturists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=351)' that believes that it is hokum. but who nonetheless maintain that acupuncture works, despite the evidence to the contrary. But most acupuncturists go for the wholesale gobbledygook. If you don't believe that, take a look at the exam paper that has come into my possession. It is this year's exam from the University of Salford. Salford has, very sensibly, now decided to stop all its degrees in alternative medicine, so don't hold this against the university too much. You can [download the entire exam paper](/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Oh really. Perhaps protons neutrons and electrons? OK I'd fail that one because the words have no obvious meaning at all. Perhaps an elementary textbook of embryology would help? How one would love to see a set of model answers for these questions. All this is ancient hokum being taugh to hapless students in the 21st century as though it were fact. The University of Salford has understood that and closed the course. All we need now is for NICE and the Department of Health to understand what it is that they are promoting. NICE neglected the cultural cost of their guidance When [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence](http://www.nice.org.uk/) (NICE) included an acupuncture option on their low back pain guidance, they quite forget that one effect of their decision would be to ensure that new generations of students would have their minds poisoned with intellectual junk like this. That is why NICE really must think again. .

Too many vested interests, not enough honesty](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593) Pittilo and statutory regulation Public consultation is due to open shortly on the [appalling repor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235)t of the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK (see also, [The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)) One of the recommendations is that acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine should have statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC), despite the fact that that would involve the [HPC breaking its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284). Another recommendation of Pittilo is that entry to the \"profession\" (his word, not mine) should be by means of honours degree only. So he wants to impose on students exams like this one in order to \"protect the public\"? The absurdity of that proposal should be obvious now. This exam paper will form part of my evidence to the consultation. And there is one other small problem. Universities are busy shutting down their degrees in alternative medicine, now that the ridiculousness of what is taught has been exposed. They have shut down entirely at the [ University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and at the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899), And even the [ University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) is working on closing them. All we need now is for the common sense and integrity that has been shown by these universities to spread to the Department of Health (and NICE).

[The eventual decision](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364) by the Information Commissioner rejected all the grounds that UClan had used to evade the Freedom of Information Act. UClan appealed against the judgement and I still haven't got the stuff but that hardly matters now, because the course in question [ shut its doors](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249).

For a start they asked me to give evidence to the review (something that no other university has done). They also asked Michael Eslea to give evidence. He is the UCLAN psychologist, whose magnificent open letter probably tipped the authorities into holding the review. Just in case it is useful to anyone, here is a copy of the written evidence that I sent [ [download pdf](/UCLAN_written_evidence-revised-131208.pdf)], | | Report of the Working Party on the Review of issues associated with Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine 1. Introduction As a consequence of concerns expressed by some colleagues within the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) Dr Malcolm McVicar, Vice Chancellor appointed a working party to review the issues associated with the University offering courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. MEMBERSHIP: Eileen Martin (Chair) Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of Faculty of Health and Social Care The report was the subject of a special meeting of UCLAN's Academic Board on 9th July 2009. The following resolutions were passed. | | Resolutions R1 That further minor revisions be made to the report prior to publication on the University's website; R2 That the University refrain from offering any practitioner-qualifying courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine until such disciplines have achieved statutory regulation status; R3 That the University consider offering a limited number of postgraduate research studentships (leading to Masters by Research of PhD) to suitably qualified UCLan students and staff in these disciplines. They should have interdisciplinary supervisory teams to facilitate development of a broad range of research skills and to contribute to the generation of knowledge in CAM; R4 That the University consider how more interdisciplinary teaching can be achieved, where appropriate, within both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to facilitate greater exposure to subject expertise and different paradigms. Resolutions 1, 3 and 4 say very little. Resolution 4 sounds thoroughly relativist. We are talking about medicine, about treating sick patients. There is only one \"paradigm\". That is to find treatments that are as effective and safe as possible. There aren't two sorts of medicine, regular and alternative. There is just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work. It's a good illustration of DC's rule number 2, \"never trust anyone who uses the word paradigm\". Resolution 2 is the really interesting one, because none if the topics, Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine, is subject to statutory regulation. If taken literally, resolution 2 means that all the UCLan courses in alternative medicine will close their doors. Bafflingly, this inevitable conclusion is not stated explicitly. At least resolution 2 means that homeopathy, already closed, will stay closed. It is never likely to get statutory regulation. For practical purposes, we can ignore for the moment the obvious fact that statutory regulation of nonsense subjects results only in nonsense. The only forms of alternative medicine that have got \"statutory regulation\" at the moment are chiropractic and osteopathy. The public has not been safeguarded by the General Chiropractic Council (GCC). The GCC, on the contrary, has endangered the public by allowing false health claims to be made with impunity. Perhaps the members of the review committee had not noticed that the Simon SIngh affair has resulted in almost 600 complaints being made to the GCC? The faith of the review in statutory regulation is clearly misplaced. The Pittilo report is critical for what happens next Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine are not subject to statutory regulation at present, so one would suppose that these degrees will close their doors too. However the infamous Pittilo report has proposed that they should become regulated by the Health Professions Council (HPC). The many problems of the Pittilo report have been documented here, in \" [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235)\". There was also a high-profile critique of the report [in The Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece) (and [on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)). The HPC has, as one of its criteria for regulation, \"evidence-based practice\". Disgracefully, the HPC has already shown its willingness to ignore its own rules and to act as statutory regulator for Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine. This rather disgraceful behaviour is documented in \"H [ealth Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284)\". The [UCLAN report](/uclan-CAM-report-15-July-09-final_publication.pdf) seems to assume that the recommendations of the Pittilo report will be accepted. But the long-awaited consultation has still not opened. We can be sure that when it does, the opposition to it will be very strong indeed. The report in full Here are a few comments on the report itself. Download [the full report](/uclan-CAM-report-15-July-09-final_publication.pdf) (as of July 15th). i have to say that when I visited Preston to [give evidence](/UCLAN_written_evidence-revised-131208.pdf), my views seem to be treated seriously, even sympathetically, so it was a great disappointment to see the outcome. So what's wrong? The major disaster is declared early in the report. Section 2, Context The debate is centred on a number of key themes which relate to:- 1. The quality of and/or absence of an evidence base to support claims of the efficacy and benefits of such treatments, linked to issues of public safety/protection and professional regulation. Sounds good. What matters about any sort of medicine is whether or not it works and whether it is safe. It therefore verges on the incredible that we read in section 4.1 \"conclusions from research into the efficacy of the various CAM's are outside the remit of this report.\" The whole point about CAM is that there is very little evidence that any of it works. So the review committee decided to ignore the most important problem of the lot. I can't see how any rational decision can be made without first deciding whether the treatment is better than placebo. That, surely, is the main question, and it was dodged. UCLAN has failed to grasp the nettle, just as the Department of Health has also consistently failed to do so. Section 4,1 Efficacy This section repeats the assertion, absurd to my mind, that it is possible to judge CAM courses while declining to assess whether they work or not. Section 4.2 Role of Universities in Society. There is universal agreement that critical thinking is crucial to the idea of a university, but the judgement of whether CAM teaches critical thinking is simply fudged. Again the report fails to grasp the nettle. \"Disagreements about critical thinking within CAMs arises because some will argue that such substantiation and assessment can occur within the discipline, whilst others will argue that the methodology for substantiation, that is evidence provision, is universal. As a result, the latter will demand that evidence is provided using methods from one field (e.g. randomised controlled trials) for use in another.\" Sadly, the report dodged the crucial judgement once again. The most obvious characteristic of every form of alternative medicine is their total lack of critical self-appraisal. It is very sad that the review committee could not bring itself to say so. Section 4.4 Nomenclature of degrees Recommendation The nomenclature of courses, leading to a professional as well as an academic award, should reflect the professional route; for example Bachelor with Honours in Complementary Medicine, B Comp. Med.(Hons) or B Acupuncture (Hons). This sounds to me like another truly pathetic fudge. What on earth is solved by changing the name of the degree? You'd still be teaching students the same load of gobbledygook and then letting them loose on sick people, whether you call it a Bachelor of Science, a Bachelor of Arts, or, as is recommended here, a Bachelor of nothing whatsoever. Well, I suppose there is a (doubtless unintended) irony in calling CAM degrees \"Bachelor of nothing whatsoever\". Section 4.4 Ethical, non-harm and economic considerations This section list a lot of reasons why teaching alternative medicine should be unethical. but nevertheless manages to conclude that \" . . . it is not unethical to offer courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine at a university.\" I find the logic by which this bizarre conclusion was reached quite impossible to follow. Like much of the rest of the report this conclusion seems to stem from a reluctance to grapple with the really important questions, like 'does it work or not?'. Despite this the recommendation is perhaps the most interesting of all. \"Recommendation The University refrains from offering any CAM courses until such disciplines have achieved statutory regulation status.\" This recommendation was accepted, and passed as a resolution at Academic Board. If it is implemented now, than there will be no more alternative medicine degrees next year at the University of Central Lancashire. If and when this happens, the University must be congratulated on its return to rational medicine. Follow-up Michael Eslea, UCLAN's hero in resisting nonsense from the inside, has [posted on this topic](http://punkpsychologist.blogspot.com/). 17 July 2009. It seemed odd that that no announcement was made about the future if the remaining CAM courses at UCLAN. So I asked deputy Vice-Chancellor Patrick McGhee for clarification. After a couple of days, I got this response. | | From: CTheobald@uclan.ac.uk To: d.colquhoun@ucl.ac.uk Hi David, I have been asked to respond to your question below on the running of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine at UCLan. It is correct to assume that UCLan will not be taking any new entrants onto these programmes until further notice. Best Wishes Chris Chris Theobald So the report may have been disappointing, but it has done the job. As several people have pointed out in comments, it would be asking too much to expect a university to say \"sorry we just noticed that we have been running junk-science courses for years\". But they have done the right thing anyway. |The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health ( | His attempts are often successful, but they are regarded by many people as being clearly unconstitutional. The FiH's [2009 AnnualConferen ce ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/) conference was held at The King's Fund, London 13 - 14 May 2009. It was, as always, an almost totally one-sided affair devoted to misrepresentation of evidence and the promotion of magic medicine. But according to the FiH, at least, it was [a great success](http://www.fih.org.uk/what_we_do/integrated_health_awards/integrated_health_awards_2008/success_of_our_2009.html). The opening speech by the Quacktitioner Royal [can be read here](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_for_the_prince_s_foundat_1928839521.html). It has already been [analysed by somebody who knows rather more about medicine than HRH](http://northerndoctor.com/2009/05/13/a-royal-fisking-prince-charles-on-integrated-health/). He concludes \"It is a shocking perversion of the real issues driven by one man; unelected, unqualified and utterly misguided\". We are promised some movie clips of the meeting. They might even make a nice UK equivalent of \" [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WF8ovmyfg)\". This post is intended to provide some background information about the speakers at the symposium. But let's start with what seems to me to be the real problem. The duplicitous use of the word \"integrated\" to mean two quite different things. The problem of euphemisms: spin and obfuscation One of the problems of meetings like this is the harm done by use of euphemisms. After looking at the programme, it becomes obvious that there is a rather ingenious bit of PR trickery going on. It confuses (purposely?) the many different definitions of the word \"integrative\" [. One definition of \"Integrative medicine](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139304.php)\" is this (my emphasis). \" . . . orienting the health care process to engage patients and caregivers in the full range of physical, psychological, social, preventive, and therapeutic factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health.\" That is a thoroughly admirable aim. And that, I imagine, is the sense in which several of the speakers (Marmot, Chantler etc) used the term. Of course the definition is rather too vague to be very helpful in practice, but nobody would dream of objecting to it. But another definition of the same term 'integrative medicine' is as a PR-friendly synonym for 'alternative medicine', and that is clearly the sense in which it is used by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH), as is immediately obvious from [ their web site](http://www.fih.org.uk/). The [guide to the main therapies ](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/guide_to_the_main.html)supports everything from homeopathy to chiropractic to naturopathy, in a totally uncritical way. Integrated service refers explicitly to integration of 'complementary' medicine, and that itself is largely a euphemism for alternative medicine. For example, the [FIH's guide to homeopathy](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/overview_of_the_main_complementary_therapies/homeopathy.html) says \"What is homeopathy commonly used for? Homeopathy is most often used to treat chronic conditions such as asthma; eczema; arthritis; fatigue disorders like ME; headache and menopausal problems; irritable bowel syndrome; Crohn's disease; allergies; repeated ear, nose, throat and chest infections or urine infections; depression and anxiety.\" But there is not a word about the evidence, and perhaps that isn't surprising because the evidence that it works in any of these conditions is essentially zero. The FIH document Complementary Health Care: A Guide for Patients appears to have vanished from the web after its inaccuracy received a very bad press, e.g. in [the Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article3760857.ece), and also [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=228). It is also interesting that the equally widely criticised Smallwood report (also sponsored by the Prince of Wales) seems to have vanished too). The programme for the meeting can be seen here, for [Day 1](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/programme.htm), and [Day 2 ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/day2.htm) Conference chair Dr Phil Hammond, GP, comedian and health service writer. Hammond asked the FIH if I could speak at the meeting to provide a bit of balance. Guess what? They didn't want balance. 09:30 Opening session Dr Michael Dixon OBE 09:30 Introduction: a new direction for The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and new opportunities in integrated health and care. Dr Michael Dixon, Medical Director, FIH Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. Latest news. The [Mid-Devon Star announces](http://www.middevonstar.co.uk/news/4198135.Homeopathy_comes_to_Cullompton/) yet more homeopathy in Dr Dixon's Cullompton practice. This time it comes in the form of a clinic run from the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. I guess they must be suffering from reduced commissioning like all the other homeopathic hospitals, but Dr Dixon seems to have come to their rescue. The connection seems to be with Bristol's homeopathic consultant, Dr Elizabeth A Thompson. On 11 December 2007 I wrote to Dr Thompson, thus | | In March 2006, a press release This was reported also on the BBC I'd be very grateful if you could let me know when results from this trial will become available. Yours sincerely David Colquhoun The reply, dated 11 December 2007, was unsympathetic | | I have just submitted the funders report today and we have set ourselves the deadline to publish two inter-related papers by March 1st 2007. Can I ask why you are asking and what authority you have to gain this information. I shall expect a reply to my questions, I answered this question politely on the same day but nevertheless my innocent enquiry drew forth a rather vitriolic complaint from Dr Thompson to the Provost of UCL (dated 14 December 2007). In this case, the Provost came up trumps. On 14 January 2008 he replied to Thompson: \"I have looked at the email that you copied to me, and I must say that it seems an entirely proper and reasonable request. It is not clear to me why Professor Colquhoun should require some special authority to make such direct enquiries\". Dr Thompson seems to be very sensitive. We have yet to see the results of her trial in which I'm still interested. Not surprisingly, Dr Dixon has had some severe criticism for his views, not least from the UK's foremost expert on the evidence for efficacy, Prof Edzard Ernst. Accounts of this can be found in [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4121964&c=2), and on [Andrew Lewis's blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/graceless-dr-michael-dixon-obe.html). Dixon is now (in)famous in the USA too. The excellent Yale neurologist, Steven Novella, has written an analysis of his views on Science Based Medicine. He describes Dr. Michael Dixon as \" [A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450)\" Peter Hain 09:40 Politics and people: can integrated health and care take centre stage in 2009/2010? Rt Hon Peter Hain MP It seems that Peter Hain was converted to alternative medicine when his first baby, Sam, was born with eczema. After (though possibly not because of) homeopathic treatment and a change in diet, the eczema got better. This caused Hain, while Northern Ireland Secretary to spend \u00a3200,000 of taxpayers' money to set up a totally uninformative customer satisfaction survey, which is being touted elsewhere in this meeting as though it were evidence (see below). I have written about this episode before: see [Peter Hain and Get Well UK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://dcscience.net/?p=33). I find it very sad that a hero of my youth (for his work in the anti-apartheid movement) should have sunk to promoting junk science, and even sadder that he does so at my expense. There has been a report on Hain's contribution in [Wales Online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/15/make-complementary-medicine-free-on-the-nhs-says-hain-91466-23628473/). 09:55 Why does the Health Service need a new perspective on health and healing? Sir Cyril Chantler, Chair, King's Fund, previous Dean, Guy's Hospital and Great Ormond Street Cyril Chantler is a distinguished medical administrator. He also likes to talk and we have discussed the quackery problem several times. He kindly sent me the slides that he used. Slide 18 says that in order to do some good we \"need to demonstrate that the treatment is clinically effective and cost effective for NHS use\". That's impeccable, but throughout the rest of the slides he talks of integrating with complementary\" therapies, the effectiveness of which is either already disproved or simply not known. I remain utterly baffled by the reluctance of some quite sensible people to grasp the nettle of deciding what works. Chantler fails to grasp the nettle, as does the Department of Health. Until they do so, I don't see how they can be taken seriously. 10.05 Panel discussion The Awards 10:20 Integrated Health Awards 2009 Introduction: a review of the short-listed applications 10:45 Presentations to the Award winners by the special guest speaker 11:00 Keynote address by special guest speaker Getting integrated Dr David Peters 12:00 Integration, long term disease and creating a sustainable NHS. Professor David Peters, Clinical Director and Professor of Integrated Healthcare, University of Westminster I first met David Peters after Nature ran my article, [Science Degrees without the Science. ](http://dcscience.net/?p=19).One of the many media follow-ups of that article was on Material World (BBC Radio 4). This [excellent science programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thematerialworld.shtml), presented by Quentin Cooper, had a discussion between me and David Peters ( [listen to the mp3 file).](http://dcscience.net/material-world-part2-220307.mp3) There was helpful intervention from Michael Marmot who had talked, in the first half of the programme, about his longitudinal population studies. Marmot stressed the need for proper testing. In the case of homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), that proper testing has largely been done. The tests were failed. The University of Westminster has, of course, gained [considerable notoriety](http://dcscience.net/?s=Westminster+university) as the university that runs more degree programmes in anti-scientific forms of medicine than any other. Their lecture on [vibrational medicine](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) teaches students that [amethysts \"emit high Yin energy so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbances at all levels of being\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=227#slides). So far their vice-chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, has declined to answer enquiries about whether he thinks such gobbledygook is appropriate for a BSc degree. But he did set up an internal enquiry into the future of their alternative activities. Sadly that enquiry seems to have come to the nonsensical conclusion that the problem can be solved by injection of good science into the courses, as [reported here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1191) and in [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/24/homeopathy-science). It seems obvious that if you inject good science into their BSc in homeopathy the subject will simply vanish in a puff of smoke. In 2007, the University of Westminster did respond to earlier criticism in [Times Higher Education](http://dcscience.net/thes-060407.pdf), but [their response](http://dcscience.net/?p=83) seemed to me to serve only to dig themselves deeper into a hole. Nevertheless, Westminster has now closed down its homeopathy degree (the last in the country to go) and there is intense internal discussion going on there. I have the impression that Dr Peters' job is in danger. The [revelation of more slides](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329) from their courses on homeopathy, naturopathy and Chinese herbal medicine shows that these courses are not only barmy, but also sometimes dangerous. Professor Chris Fowler 12:10 Educating tomorrow's integrated doctors. Professor Chris Fowler, Dean for Education, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry I first came across Dr Fowler when I noticed him being praised for his teaching of alternative medicine to students at Barts and the London Medical School on the web site of the Prince's Foundation. I wrote him a polite letter to ask if he really thought that the Prince of Wales was the right person to consult about the education of medical students. The response I got was, ahem, unsympathetic. But a little while later I noticed that two different Barts students had set up public blogs that criticised strongly the nonsense that was being inflicted on them. At that point, I felt it was necessary to support the students who, it seemed to me, knew more about medical education than Professor Fowler. It didn't take long to uncover the nonsense that was being inflicted on the students: [read about it here](http://dcscience.net/?p=555). There is a [follow-up to this story here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1143). Fortunately, Barts' Director of Research, and, I'm told, the Warden of Barts, appear to agree with my view of the harm that this sort of thing can do to the reputation of Barts, so things may change soon, Dame Donna Kinnair 12:30 Educating tomorrow's integrated nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, Director of Nursing, Southwark PCT As far as I can see, Donna Kinnair has no interest in alternative medicine. She is director of nursing at Southwark primary care trust and was an adviser to Lord Laming throughout his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. I suspect that her interest is in integrating child care services (they need it, judging by the recent death of 'Baby P'). Perhaps her presence shows the danger of using euphemisms like 'integrated medicine' when what you really mean is the introduction of unproven or disproved forms of medicine. Michael Dooley 12:40 Integrating the care of women: an example of the new paradigm. Michael Dooley, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist DC's rule 2. Never trust anyone who uses the word 'paradigm'. It is a sure-fire sign of pseudoscience. In this case, the 'new paradigm' seems to be the introduction of disproven treatment. Dooley is a gynaecologist and Medical Director of the [ Poundbury Clinic](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/). His clinic offers a [whole range of unproven](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/treatments.htm) and disproved treatments. These include acupuncture as an aid to conception in IVF. This is not recommended by the [ Cochrane review](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab006920.html), and one report suggests that it [hinders conception rather than helps](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/17/medicalresearch). 12.40 Discussion 13.00 - 14.00 Lunch and Exhibition 15.30 Tea Boo Armstrong and Get Well UK 16.00 Integrated services in action: The Northern Ireland experience: what has it shown us and what are its implications? Boo Armstrong of Get Well UK with a team from the NI study I expect that much will be made of this \"study\", which, of course, tells you absolutely nothing whatsoever about the effectiveness of the alternative treatments that were used in it. This does not appear to be the view of Boo Armstrong, On the basis of the \"study\", her [company's web site](http://www.getwelluk.com/) proclaims boldly \"Complementary Medicine Works Get Well UK ran the first government-backed complementary therapy project in the UK, from February 2007 to February 2008 This claim appears, prima facie, to breach the [Unfair Trading Regulations](http://dcscience.net/?p=790) of May 2008. The legality of the claim is, at the moment, being judged by a Trading Standards Officer. In any case, the \"study\" was not backed by the government as a whole, but just by Peter Hain's office. It is not even clear that it had ethical approval. The study consisted merely of asking people who had seen an alternative medicine practitioner whether they felt better or worse. There was no control group; no sort of comparison was made. It is surely obvious to the most naive person that a study like this cannot even tell you if the treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has any genuine effects of its own. To claim that it does so seems to be simply dishonest. There is no reason at all to think that the patients would not have got better anyway. It is not only Get Well UK who misrepresent the evidence. The [Prince's Foundation itself ](http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/sense_at_last.html)says \"Now a new, year long trial supported by the Northern Ireland health service has . . . demonstrated that integrating complementary and conventional medicine brings measurable benefits to patients' health.\" That is simply not true. It is either dishonest or stupid. Don't ask me which, I have no idea. This study is no more informative than the [infamous Spence (2005) 'study'](http://dcscience.net/?p=198) of the same type, which seems to be the only thing that homeopaths can produce to support their case. There is an excellent analysis of the Northern Ireland 'study' by Andy Lewis, [The Northern Ireland NHS Alternative Medicine 'Trial'](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/northern-ireland-nhs-alternative.html). He explains patiently, yet again, what constitutes evidence and why studies like this are useless. His analogy starts \" . . . the Apple Marketing Board approach the NHS and ask for \u00a3200,000 to do a study to show the truth behind the statement 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'. The Minister, being particularly fond of apples, agrees and the study begins.\" 16.30 Social enterprise and whole systems integrated care. Dee Kyne, Sandwell PCT and a GP.

Peter Mackereth, Clinical Lead, Supportive Services, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust I had some correspondence with Mackereth when the Times (7 Feb 2007) published a picture of the Prince of Wales inspecting an \"anti-MRSA aromatherapy inhaler\" in his department at the Christie. It turned out that the trial they were doing was not blind No result has been announced anyway, and on enquiry, I find that the trial has not even started yet. Surprising, then to find that the FIH is running the [First Clinical Aromatherapy Conference at the Christie Hospital](http://www.fih.org.uk/events/events_from_other_organisations/1st_clinical.html), What will there be to talk about? Much of what they do at the Christie is straightforward massage, but [they also promote](http://www.christie.nhs.uk/press/2007/070207.aspx) the nonsensical principles of \"reflexology\" and acupuncture. The former is untested. The latter [is disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945). Parallel Sessions Developing a PCT funded musculoskeletal service Dr Roy Welford, Glastonbury Health Centre [Roy Welford is a Fellow](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) of the Faculty of Homeopathy, and so promotes disproven therapies. The [Glastonbury practice](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) also advertises acupuncture ( [disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)), osteopathy and herbal medicine (largely untested so most of it consists of giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety). Making the best of herbal self-prescription in integrated practice: key remedies and principles. Simon Mills, Project Lead: Integrated Self Care in Family Practice, Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health, Devon Simon Mills is a herbalist who now [describes himself as a \"phytotherapist\"](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) (it sounds posher, but the evidence, or lack of it, is not changed by the fancy name). Mills likes to say things like \"there are herbs for heating and drying\", \"hot and cold\" remedies, and to use meaningless terms like [\"blood cleanser\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=16), but he appears to be immune to the need for good evidence that herbs work before you give them to sick people. [He says, at the end of a talk, ](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) \"The hot and the cold remain the trade secret of traditional medicine\". And this is the 21st Century. Practical ways in which complementary approaches can improve the treatment of cancer. Professor Jane Plant, Author of \"Your life in your hands\" and Chief Scientist, British Geological Society and Professor Karol Sikora, Medical Director, Cancer Partners UK Jane Plant is a geologist who, through her own unfortunate encounter with breast cancer, became obsessed with the idea that a dairy-free diet cured her. Sadly there is no good evidence for that idea, according to the [World Cancer Research Fund Report](http://dcscience.net/Marmot-Report.pdf), led by Professor Sir Michael Marmot. No doubt her book on the subject sells well, but it could be held that it is irresponsible to hold out false hopes to desperate people. She is a supporter of the very dubious [CancerActive](http://dcscience.net/?p=119) organisation (also supported by Michael Dixon OBE - [see above](#dixon)) as well as the notorious pill salesman, [Patrick Holford](http://holfordwatch.info/) (see also [here](#)). Karol Sikora, formerly an oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, is now [Dean of Medicine](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/) at the [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/) (the UK's only private university). He is also medical director at [CancerPartners UK](http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/), a private cancer company. He recently shot to fame when he [appeared in a commercial](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms) in the USA sponsored by \"Conservatives for Patients' Rights\", to pour scorn on the NHS, and to act as an advocate for the USA's present health system. A very curious performance. Very curious indeed. His attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. One was somewhat alarmed to see him sponsoring a course at what was, at first, called the British College of Integrated Medicine, and has now been renamed the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/) That grand title makes it sound like part of a university. It isn't. The alarm was as result of the alliance with Dr Rosy Daniel (who promotes an [untested herbal conconction, Carctol](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/20), for 'healing' cancer) and Dr Mark who has also [promoted the Qlink pendant](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html). The Qlink pendant is a simple [and obvious fraud](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. The first list of speakers on the proposed diploma in Integrated Medicine was an unholy alliance of outright quacks and commercial interests. It turned out that, although Karol Sikora is sponsoring the course, he knew nothing about the speakers. I did and when I pointed this out to Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, he immediately removed Rosy Daniel from directing the Diploma. At the moment the course is being revamped entirely by Andrew Miles. There is hope that he'll do a better job. It has not yet been validated by the University of Buckingham. Watch this space for developments. Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) that Professor Sikora has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy.

Jack Lord, Chief Executive Humana Europe It is worth noticing that [the advisory board](http://www.humana.co.uk/who/ouradvisoryboard.htm) of Humana Europe includes Micheal Dixon OBE, a well known advocate of alternative medicine ( [see above](#dixon)). [Humana Europe](http://www.humana.co.uk/approach/documents/4229CommissioningCycleLeaflet.pdf)is a private company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Inc., a health benefits company with 11 million members and 22,000 employees and headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky.

Integrated health in action How to make sense of the evidence on complementary approaches: what works? What might work? What doesn't work? Dr Hugh MacPherson, Senior Research Fellow in Health Sciences, York University and Dr Catherine Zollman, Bravewell Fellow [Hugh MacPherson](https://hsciweb.york.ac.uk/research/public/Staff.aspx?ID=926)'s main interest is in acupuncture and he publishes in alternative medicine journals. Since the recent analysis in the BMJ from the Nordic Cochrane Centre ( [Madsen et al., 2009](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)) it seems that acupuncture is finally dead. Even its placebo effect is too small to be useful. [Catherine Zollman](http://www.bravewell.org/transforming_healthcare/models_for_change/bravewell_fellowship/fellows_2010/zollman/) is a Bristol GP who is into homeopathy as well as acupuncture. She is closely connected with the Prince's Foundation via the Bravewell Fellowship. That fellowship is funded by the [Bravewell Collaboration](http://dcscience.net/?p=231#mack), which is run by Christie Mack, wife of John Mack ('Mack the Knife'), head of Morgan Stanley (amazingly, they still seem to have money). This is the group which, by sheer wealth, has persuaded so many otherwise respectable US universities to embrace every sort of quackery (see, for example, [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://dcscience.net/?p=231)) The funding of integrated services 14.15 How to get a PCT or practice- based commissioner to fund your integrated service.

Four pitchers lay out their stall for the commissioning dragons And at this stage there is no prize for guessing that all four are devoted to trying to get funds for discredited treatments - An acupuncture service for long-term pain. Mike Cummings Chair, Medical Acupuncture Association - Manipulation for the treatment of back pain Simon Fielding, Founder Chairman of the General Osteopathic Council - Nigel Clarke, Senior Partner, Learned Lion Partners Homeopathy for long term conditions - Peter Fisher, Director, Royal Homeopathic Hospital Sadly it is not stated who the dragons are. One hopes they will be more interested in evidence than the supplicants. Mike Cummings at least doesn't believe the nonsense about meridians and Qi. It's a pity he doesn't look at the real evidence though. You can read something about him and his journal at [BMJ Group promotes acupuncture: pure greed](http://dcscience.net/?p=351). Osteopathy sounds a bit more respectable than the others, but in fact it has never shaken off its [cult-like origins.](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html) Still many osteopaths make absurd claims to cure all sorts of diseases. Offshoots of osteopathy like 'cranial osteopathy' are obvious nonsense. There is no reason to think that osteopathy is any better than any other manipulative therapy and it is clear that all manipulative therapies should be grouped into one. Osteopathy and chiropractic provide the best ever examples of the folly of giving official government recognition to a branch of alternative medicine before the evidence is in. Learned Lion Partners is a new one on me. It seems it is part of [Madsen Gornall Ashe Chambers ('MGA Chambers')](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/AMWL/LL_fset.htm) \"a grouping of top level, independent specialists who provide a broad range of management consultancy advice to the marketing community\". It's a management consultant and marketing outfit. So don't expect too much when it comes to truth and evidence. The company web site says nothing about alternative medicine, but only that [Nigel Clarke](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/fsetpeople.htm) \". . . has very wide experience of public affairs issues and campaigns, having worked with clients in many sectors in Europe, North America and the Far East. He has particular expertise in financial, competition and healthcare issues. \" However, all is revealed when we see that he is a [Trustee of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/our_trustees.html) where his entry says \"Nigel Clarke is senior partner of Learned Lion Partners. He is a director of Vidapulse Ltd, Really Easy Ltd, Newscounter Ltd and Advanced Transport Systems Ltd. He has worked on the interfaces of public policy for 25 years. He has been chair of the General Osteopathic Council since May 2001, having been a lay member since it was formed. He is now a member of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence\" The [Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence](http://www.chre.org.uk/) is yet another quango that ticks boxes and fails absolutely to grasp the one important point, does it work?. I came across them [at the Westminster Forum](http://dcscience.net/?p=15#chre), and they seemed a pretty pathetic way to spend \u00a32m per year. Peter Fisher is the last supplicant to the Dragons. He is clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH), and Queen's homeopathic physician, It was through him that I got an active interest in quackery. The TV programme QED asked me to check the statistics in a paper of his that claimed that [homeopathy was good for fibrositis](http://dcscience.net/?p=201) (there was an elementary mistake and no evidence for an effect). Peter Fisher is also remarkable because he agreed with me that BSc degrees in homeopathy were not justified (on TV - [see the movie](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)). And [he condemned homeopaths](http://dcscience.net/?p=207) who were caught out recommending their sugar pills for malaria. To that extent Fisher represents the saner end of the homeopathic spectrum. Nevertheless he still maintains that sugar pills work and have effects of their own, and tries to [justify the 'memory of water'](http://dcscience.net/?p=282#hom) by making analogies with a memory stick or CD. This is so obviously silly that no more comment is needed. Given Fisher's sensible condemnation of the malaria fiasco, I was rather surprised to see that he appeared on the [programme of a conference](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/CAM/docs/CAMSTRAND%20programme%20Apr%2009%20final.pdf) at the University of Middlesex, talking about \"A Strategy To Research The Potential Of Homeopathy In Pandemic Flu\". The title of the conference was Developing Research Strategies in CAM. A colleague, after seeing the programme, thought it was more like \"a right tossers' ball\". Much of the homeopathy has now vanished from the RLHH as a result of greatly reduced commissioning by PCTs ( [read about it](http://www.zeusinfoservice.com/Health/Hospitalneedsyoursupport.html) in Fisher's own words). And the [last homeopathy degree in the UK has closed down](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329). It seems an odd moment for the FIH to be pushing it so hard.
