Russell Mason: Were you always interested in medicine? Ralph W. Moss:No. My great interest was in writing, and when I went to col- lege I mainly studied the humanities, especially classics and history. As an undergraduate , I attended Amherst Col- lege [Amherst, Massachu setts] transferred to York University [New York City]. I got my master' s and doctor- ate in classics from Stanford [Stanford, California]. What did interest me about medicine was its humanistic aspects. After receiving my doctorate, I taught ancient Greek at the University of Califor- nia, Irvine, including the writings of Hip- pocrates\u2014who had much to say about cancer. RM: Why were you interested in clas- sics? RWM:Classics comprises one of the very few areas in academia where you can study the whole of a society. It was challenging because, in addition to learning the subject matter, I had to learn ancient Greek and Latin. All that language work \u2014the mind-numbing exercises in composition and memoriza - tion\u2014 prepared me for understanding scientific language later. This remains part of what I do today: translating \" sci- ence-ese \" into standard English. So my background in the classical languages has been indispensable. RM: How did you get from classics to medicine? RWM:During Christmas, 1971, Presi- dent Nixon had declared \" war on can- cer.\" It was his \" Christmas present to the nation.\" The idea was to find a cure in time for the Bicentennial, July of 1976. Memoria l Sloan-K ettering Cancer Center [New York City], appointed a new administration to go along with the war on cancer. I knew about this, and when I heard that there was a job opening for a writer in the public affairs department, I decided to apply for it. I told them that, as a \" blank slate,\" I could provide a fresh view of the cancer war. And, with that, I beat out a lot of more experienced people for that job. Being hired by the public affairs department at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center turned out to be not only a terrific challenge, but an exciting new life. It was a foot in the door to be able to write about something meaningful. RM: What did you write about? RWM:I wrote a monthly article for a newslet ter that went out to all the staff members, contributors, and employees. I also wrote press releases and would rep- resent the Center with the media. My third responsibility was to write the research section of the Memorial Sloan-Ket- tering Annual Report. Sloan-Kettering was\u2014and probably still is \u2014the top can- cer research center in the country . Back then, I thought that there really was a \" cure\" for Cancer and that it would be discovered at Sloan-Kettering. On my first day at work, June 3, 1974, I learned that \u2014in addition to my official duties\u2014I also had another duty: to answer letters from the public about alter- native and complemen tary cancer treat- ments. At that time, Sloan-Ketterin g was conducting some tests on alternative ther- apies, including hydrazine sulfate and Essiac tea.*Many of the letters in the fold- er asked about laetrile,which is an extract made from apricot kernels. At that time, some people felt laetrile was a cure\u2014or a good treatment \u2014for cancer. 21Questioning Conventional O ncology An Interview with Cancer Activist Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D. In the high-stakes arena of alternative cancer therapies, Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D., from Brooklyn, New York, has few peers. An internationally acclaimed sci- ence writer, he has spent more than 20 years investigating and writing about cancer issues. His published findings have com- pellingly demanded that the allopathic medi- cal community recognize that many alternative treatments are safe and effective. Dr. Moss is a founding advisor to the National Institute of Health' s Office of Alternative Medicine and the Cancer Advi- sory Panel on Complementary and Alterna- tive Medicine. He is on the Advisory Editorial Board of the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query system. In 1997, he was chosen as scientific advisor to, and honorary member of, the German Society of Oncology \u2014 the first American so honored in more than 20 years. *The Original Essiac Company, Malahide, County Dublin, Ireland. Although the names laetrile, Laetrile,TMand amygdalin are often used interchangeably, they are not the same product. I was to write back and say: \" We' ve looked into this. . . .\" Or: \" I have passed your letter along to so-and-so. We' re always looking for new cures. . . .\" I didn' t want to say \" your idea is worth- less; forget it.\" I tried to let each inquirer down as nicely as I could. The kind of science we were doing at Sloan-Ketterin g was very sophisticated and I was convinced that the cure for can- cer would surely come from this very technologically advanced work. What could alternative medicine possibly have to do with that? However, one day, on a tour of the Institute' s Walker Laboratory in Rye, New York, I met and had lunch with a man named Kanematsu Sugiura [D.Sc.]. He was in his early 80s, and was a very impressive man \u2014an individual of tremend ous strength and integrity. He was one of the pioneers of chemotherapy and had worked at Sloan-Kettering since 1917. At the end of that interview \u2014 almost as an afterthought \u2014I asked: \" Well, Dr. Sugiura, what are you working on now?\" He replied: \" I am working on amygdalin.\" At first, I wasn' t quite sure what he was saying, but then the light bulb went off in my head, and I realized that he said amygdal in, which is another name for laetrile. I asked: \" Why would you research something that doesn' t work?\" And he replied: \" But it does.\" He told me that laetrile stopped the spread of cancer, the metastases, about 80 percent of the time. It was not a cure, and he regretted that it was not, but it was a \" good palliative drug.\"RM: Were you startled by Dr. Sugiu- ra' of Sloan-K ettering was that laetrile was useless. And yet, one of the outstand- ing cancer scientists in the world had shown that it did work to a certain degree. If you stop metastases 80 percent of the time, that is tremendously signifi- cant. I was confused by the increasingly negative statements of the leaders of Sloan-Ke ttering towards this substanc e. Eventually , I was instructed to lie about the outcome of our studies. It became a major cover-up. To be fair, Dr. Thomas, president of the Center, along with Drs. Good, Old, and Stock \u2014all important scientists [who are all M.D.s] \u2014went to Washington, D.C., in 1974, and again in 1975, to argue the case for laetrile and to urgently request per- mission to conduct clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administratio n [FDA] \u2014 at that time allied with the American Can- cer Society and the National Cancer Institute\u2014turned them down flat. The upshot was that if Sloan-Kettering was going to continue to receive government and foundation funding, it had better back off on the issue of laetrile, which it immediat ely did. It remains the official position of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center that its laetrile studies were negative. RM: What happened next? How did you get involved in the laetrile contro- versy that ensued? RWM:I held a press conference at the New York Hilton \u2014on my own\u2014and revealed what I knew about laetrile. I was fired from Sloan-Kettering the next day. RM: Were you angry? RWM:Yes, and hurt. . . .I was still clinging to a naive belief that the truth mattered. I was still in love with the field of oncology \u2014and now it seemed all over for me. I couldn' t find work, and none of my former colleagues would even talk to me. So, that is when I wrote my first book, The Cancer Industry.The impetus first came when I saw Dr. Stock in the hallway the day I was fired in November, 1977. On my way out I said: \" I' ve been fired!\" He said: \" I know, and good rid- dance!\" I didn' t know what to say. So I blurted out: \" You haven' t heard the last of me\u2014I am going to write a book about this!\" RM: So you decided to write an expos\u00e9 and vindicate yourself in the pro- cess? RWM:Right. However, my editors at Grove Press suggested that the book take a broader view, and encompass the whole field of alternati ve cancer therapies and prevention, and that is what I did. The book came out in 1980 [as The Cancer Syn- drome]and was very well received. During the late ' 70s, there were about seven or eight major alternative cancer treatments, and that was the scope of my study. By 1992, when I wrote Cancer Ther- apy,there were over a hundred different treatments. If I were to do an equivalent book today, I might need to include a thousand items. That' s how things have grown. Back then, all of the treatments approved for cancer by the FDA were patented treatmen ts, usually controlled by major pharmaceutical companies; and all the nonconventio nal treatments were nonpatentable natural methods, that were generally significantly less toxic than the conventio nal treatments. And that, for me, was\u2014and still is \u2014the key.22 ALTERNATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\u2014 FEBRUARY 2001 Dr. Sugiura said \" that laetrile stopped the spread of cancer , the metastases, about 80 percent of the time. \" See box entitled Books by Dr. Ralph Moss. The laws of economics \u2014the invisible hand of the marketplace \u2014will make sure that only patented items are approved, because that is where the big bucks are. So, if you' re looking for why alternative therapies\u2014such as hydrazine sulfate, vitamin C, and laetrile \u2014are relegated to the \" junk heap\" by allopathic medicine, it is because these substances cannot gener- ate megaprof its the way patented phar- maceuticals can. RM: Tell us about your next book, the one about the discoverer of vitamin C. RWM:I met the famous scientist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, [M.D., Ph.D.] He worked at Marine Biological Laboratories, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, until he died in 1986, and I wrote a book about him, Free Radical.He had won the Nobel Prize in 1937 for the discovery of vitamin C. Dr. Szent-Gy orgyi also discovered the basis of muscle physiology, actin, and myosin, and propose d the free-radical theory of cancer \u2014back in 1940! He was an undis- puted scientific genius. He taught me what scientific discovery was really about. It was not just about figures or statistics or test tubes, but imagina tion and play. RM: So, now you were essentia lly an author and wrote books. Continue your story. RWM:Yes. In the mid 1980s I wrote four or five books in as many years. It was during this time that the allopathic community got bolder and bolder. A kind of demoralization set in \u2014not just for me\u2014but for the movemen t for medical freedom of choice as a whole. During this time there was intense witch hunt against alternative cancer treatments. It culminat- ed in raids on the Dr. Lawrence Burton' s Immuno-A ugmentat ive Therapy clinic \u00b6 in Bahamas; and the Burzynski antineop laston institute ||in Houston, Texas. In response, however, patients started to protest and demanded a Congres sional investigation. In 1987, Congress asked the Office of Technology Assessment [OTA] to write a study of unconventional cancer treatments. When I read the draft report, I saw that alternative cancer treatments were condemne d out of hand and half-truths were patched together to justify the Office' s a priori conclusions. As a result, a move- ment\u2014to change the OTA report \u2014began and, in early 1990, a public hearing was held in Washington, D.C. I attended and spoke at it. It was a very contentious meet- ing, and the OTA had even called out riot police with Plexiglas shields to defend the Office' s members! It was ridiculous, but the tensions had reached the point of potential police violence, because clinics were being shut down and doctors were being thrown in jail. And, for what reason? For practicing alternative cancer therapies and for taking patients that might otherwise have been used for clinical trials \u2014sponsored by the major pharmaceutical companies! I was angry, and delivered an extreme- ly passionate speech. [The highlights can be read at www.ralp hmoss.co m]. In the end, it was a great day. Leader after lead- er in alternative cancer therapy got up and let the OTA have it. In the end, the OTA changed its report\u2014 it turned out to be acceptable \u2014and those of us in the alternative cancer field had scored a resounding victory. Then, in November of 1991, Senator Tom Harkin# created the Office of Alternative Medicine [OAM]. I was appointed to the Ad Hoc Advisory Board and later to the fully chartered Alternative Medicine Program Advisory Council. We were able to make recom- mendations to the United States govern- ment on the direction of research into alternative medicine. That was a tremendous turning point for alterna- tive medicin e, and for me persona lly. I still have Donna Shalala' s [former Sec- retary of Health and Human Services] letter on my wall!ALTERNATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\u2014 FEBRUARY 2001 23 \" If you' re looking for why alternative therapies are relegated to the ' junk heap' by allopathic medicine, it is because these substances cannot generate megaprofits the way patented pharmaceuticals can.\" \u00b6The late Lawrenc e Burton, M.D., served as director of the clinic. ||Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., is the director of the Burzynski Institute (referred to here as the \" antineoplaston institute\" ).#Democrat, Iowa.Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D., Brooklyn, New York. In its first year, 1992, the OAM was allocated $2.2 million. Now it is called the National Center for Complementary and Alternat ive Medicine (NCCAM) and its budget is approxim ately 76 million dol- lars. I was deeply involved in setting the direction of that office. I am proud to say that just a few months ago, the NCCAM gave a grant of $7.8 million dollars to establish a research center to study com- plementa ry and alternative medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School [Balti- more, Maryland]. Now think about the implications of this! Johns Hopkins now has a grant more than three times the original budget of OAM. Before we started, do you know what alternative medicine meant? Tijuana! No university or medical school would touch alternative medicine with a ten- foot pole. Look where we are today! Hospitals are lining up to do this type of treatment. There is even a Presidential Commission on alternative medicine, headed by my colleague, Jim Gordon.**It is likely that in the next few years every medical school will be teaching alterna- tive medicine. Once you' re taught in the medical schools, you' re in, and that' s the future. RM: It must be extremely gratifying for you. RWM:The change is so dramatic. I honestly never dreamed this would hap- pen. I thought alternative cancer treat- ments were a noble, but ultimatel y lost, cause. But I just kept working at it because it was the right thing to do, like chipping away at the Berlin Wall. It was during this time, around 1992, that I began to personally consult for can- cer patients. For many years, since my Sloan-Kettering days, I had made myself available to patients in an informal way. This evolved into a professional consulta- tion service. Over the course of 8 years, it has evolved into The Moss Reports. RM: What are the Moss Reports? RWM:They are detailed written reports, based on patients' specific diagnoses. At this moment, I have writ- ten nearly 200 diagnosi s-based reports. They are very extensive and cover many of the problems that patients con- front when they have cancer. My ulti- mate goal is to understa nd what works and what doesn' t work and to help patients make rational decisions \u2014 whether the treatment they choose is conventional, alternative, or some- where in the middle. RM: So, for a person with cancer, you provide useful information? RWM:Exactly. After patients have received their reports, they can follow up with faxed or e-mailed questions to me. I answer them personally, and a great deal of my time and effort is put into explain- ing the various treatment options \u2014both convent ional and nonconv entional \u2014to the patient. The service costs $297.00. There is only one charge and it provides a lifetime of service. In the mid-' 90s, I wrote Questioning Chemotherapy .It was an extremely con- troversial book because, among other things, it showed the economi c roots of chemotherapy, why it exists as a field, and how it functions within the overall economy. It also disputes the \" Grand Illu- sion\" of chemotherapy\u2014 that tumor shrinkages correlate with increased sur- vival. Unexpectedly, this book had a huge impact in Germany. Hans Nieper, [M.D.] the president of the German Society of Oncology, invited me to Germany to speak, and this led to my becomin g the first honorary member of the German Society of Oncology. Since 1997, I have had an intense relationship with German cancer doctors, and have coauthored studies with Josef Beuth, [M.D.], presi- dent of that society. In some ways, I have found an intellectu al home in Germany, as well as discovering a country where the kind of cancer medicine that I believe in is legal and widely practiced. We have no idea in the United States that what we call alternative medicine is fairly conven- tional medicine in most parts of the world. RM: Tell us how things are set up in Germany to protect consumers. RWM:The Germans have reasonable and sane protection from fraud. The laws in Germany foster medical pluralism \u2014 not medical dictatorship . So not only do the Germans have the freedom to try new 24 ALTERNATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\u2014 FEBRUARY 2001 \" I thought alternative cancer treatments were a noble, but ultimately lost, cause. \" **James S.

I ardently hope the United States will learn from their system, though we will need some key pieces of legislation passed in the Congress to change this. Then we can begin our education. Even if these laws are passed tomorrow, we would still be 25 years behind Germany. RM: What are some of the therapies that German oncologists are currently using that we don' t have available here? RWM:There are many. For example, hyperthermia. In the United States, there are a few courageous centers of hyperther- mia, such as the Valley Cancer Institute in Los Angeles. But the Germans can use whole-body hyperthermia, and it is widely practiced. They use various forms of fever therapy, similar to Coley' s toxins. Ironical- ly, this was discovered in the United States but is virtually unavailable here. Another therapy they use is mistletoe. We now, at long last, have one form of it that is legally available in the United States, and it is called Iscar [from the Weleda com- pany]. But the German doctors have access to dozens of mistletoe preparations. I have been to the Hiscia research facility in Switzerland and Weleda' s manufacturing plant, outside Stuttgart [Germany]. Their products are produced with exquisite care. RM: Is mistleto e an effective remedy for cancer? RWM:Dr. Beuth has shown that lectins isolated from mistletoe definitely have anti- cancer activity. So yes, it is an active anti- cancer agent, and a huge number of cancer patients in Germany receive some form of mistletoe treatment. RM: What else do they use besides mistletoe? RWM:They use herbs widely, includ- ing some innovative injectable forms. For diagnosis, in addition to the conventional methods, they use electroderma l screen- ing or acupuncture according to Voll [called EAV], a marriage of East and West. They have sophisticated forms of ther- mography, which measures heat emana- tions from the human body. This has become an extremely refined art. An entirely different kind of medicine has evolved in Europe about which allopathic medicine knows nothing. RM: Where do you plan to go from here? RWM:Well, I am still learning. I don' t think a day goes by that I am not confront- ed with some new cancer therapy. That is how quickly things are proliferating in this field. While I am curious about all new treatments, I made a decision a long time ago that I would only put my energy into those promising treatments that could ultimately result in scientific data and clinical trials.RM: Of the alternative protocols and therapies that you have personally inves- tigated, are there any you feel hold special promise? RWM:Well, there is no \" penicillin,\" so to speak. But I have always felt that the premise of William B. Coley [inventor of Coley' s toxins] holds great promise for can- cer patients. And, yes, I have seen remis- sions based on fever therapy and things similar to that, for example, heating the body\u2014hyperthermia. Heat is a great medicine, and does not usually injure the person. Basically, the cancer cells cannot survive heat very well. Normal cells will ALTERNATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\u2014 FEBRUARY 2001 25 \" An entirely different kind of medicine has evolved in Europe about which allopathic medicine knows nothing. \" Dr. Moss enjoys some antioxidants alone and with a very young friend. rebound and cancer tissue will not, so it' s an important and very promising area. As I' ve stated, mistletoe therapy is also very promising, as are some of the herbs, especially when used in conjunction with other treatments. I also think that antioxidants have a big role to play in cancer treatment. Thou- sands of scientific articles point to the power of antioxida nts. Yet most doctors are not taught about this in medical school. A good, powerful diet with high antioxidant values in the food can go a long way toward curing multiple ills, including premature aging. Instead of the government' s recommend ation of five portions of fruits and vegetables per day, I suggest seven to ten portions. To cancer patients, I recommend that they have fewer fruits and more vegetables, because an abundance of sugar \u2014even natural sug- ars\u2014might have an adverse affect. The foods with the highest antioxidants tend to be berries \u2014blueberr ies, blackberries, even grapes \u2014and the seeds contain antioxidants also. RM: Are useful in combi- nation with chemotherapy or radiation? RWM:Yes, even though there are howls of protests from the oncologists. In Antioxi- dants Against Cancer,I cite about 150 papers relating to the question of concur- rent use of antioxidants with chemothera- py or radiation. The vast majority show a positive interaction, and that is where the data point, towards synergy \u2014or a mutual- ly enhancing effect. In the research of Kedar Prasad, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, in Den- ver, Colorado, vitamin C by itself had no effect on cancer cells. But when vitamin C was added to radiation, the result was tremendous \u2014much greater than by radia- tion itself. So there is tremendous potential synergy between antioxidant therapy and standard oncologic care. RM: What are some other new possibil- ities for the treatment of cancer? RWM:Well, I strongly believe in immunology as well as the work of Nicholas James Gonzalez, [M.D.] of New York City. He has developed the so-called Kelley method of pancreatic enzymes, diet, and detoxification as a treatment for many kinds of cancer. This is being tested against pancreatic cancer in a clinical trial at Columb ia Univers ity [New York City], with a $1.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. Another promising treatment is PC SPES, an herbal mixture for prostate cancer developed by Sophie Chen, Ph.D., of the New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York. Dr. Chen took a traditional Chi- nese herbal formula and refined it into a powerful medicine for prostate cancer. PC SPES has been tentatively accepted as an experimenta l treatment within orthodox medicine. It is one of the first fruits of a new attitude toward alternative treat- ments\u2014 a more scientific presentation from the alternative side and a more receptive attitude from the allopathic side. Another Chinese-American researcher, Alexander Sun, [Ph.D.] devised a soup to treat his own mother who was suffering from lung cancer. She recovere d and he now markets the product as Sun Soup. He and colleagues at Mt. Sinai Hospital in The Bronx, New York, have published studies showing exciting results in lung cancer using this soup. It contains \u2014among other things \u2014shiitake mushrooms. For brain cancer, I have seen some really outstanding results with Dr. Burzynski' s antineoplast ons. However, the prejudice against \" Dr. B\" runs deep because of past antagonisms. It' s going to take some doing to get a fair trial of those treatments. I feel it is most promisin g for brain cancer and lymphoma, and we tell many of our clients about it. I' ve also been very excited about a treat- ment called MTH-68. This is a Newcastle disease virus vaccine develop ed by Dr. Laszlo [K.] Csatary [M.D.] director of the United Cancer Research Institute in Arlington, Virginia, and Eva Csatary, [an officer of the Institute]. It is a modification of a virus that is lethal to poultry, but non- pathogenic to humans. In 1999, the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association pub- lished an astonishingly favorable piece, by Dr. Csatary, about the complete remission of a brain cancer using this entirely non- conventional treatment modality.\u00b6\u00b6It was a first for the AMA. And yet, for 30 years, Dr. Csatary had tried to gain acceptance of this unique treatment, and endured vilifi- cation by his peers. Now, at last, he is published. RM: So, has your role been to provide information about the broad spectrum of different protocols? RWM:Yes, and to serve as a bridge between the allopathic and alternative communities. I like the rigor of convention- al medicine research; but I prefer the ideas\u2014the basic humanistic approach \u2014of alternative medicine. So I am trying to take the very promisi ng and less toxic treat- ments of alternative medicine and subject them to the kind of rigorous testing that will stand up to intense scrutiny. The true home of complemen tary and alternativ e medicine should be within the very best medical journals and among the best medi- cal thinkers in the world. n To order reprints of this article, write to or call: Karen Ballen, ALTERNATIVE &COMPLEMEN- TARY THERAPIES, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., 2 Madison Avenue, Larchmont, NY 10538-1962 , (914) 834-3100.26 ALTERNATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\u2014 FEBRUARY 2001 \" I like the rigor of conventional medicine resear ch; but I prefer the ideas of alternativ e medicine. \" \u00b6\u00b6Csatary, L.K., Bakacs, T.
