There are low vibrations, low aerodynamic noise, and low heating at high speeds. In transonic flight the drag is drastically reduced compared to existing airfoils which ensures very high fuel-efficiency at transonic and supersonic speeds. Moreover, the center of pressure remains close to the center of symmetry, meaning no jump of pitching moment, and insignificant roll and yaw moments. Also, there are no lift fluctuations, so in conclusion this will mean a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic flight!

While it was long assumed to be a Zoroastrian Fire Temple some Parsis back in the 19th century who visited the place doubted that and suggested that it could be a Hindu Temple. This association at first seems a bit far fetched due to its geographical implausibility (and the differences between Zoroastrianism as it was practiced during the Sassanian Empire and Zoroastrianism as it is practiced now in India). While the association with Hinduism isn't entirely made up, as it is clear that Hindu Merchants liked visiting the shrine as is evident by the inscription they left behind, the idea that it was founded as a Hindu Temple, or was only a Hindu Temple is rather far fetched. However the existence of a relatively even sided controversy has never dissuaded the Hindutva types from claiming that said controversy is settled in their favor and this case is no exception.

It is a trademarked organisation 'World Transformation Movement', and the first video after an interview they have is literally 'your block to the most wonderful of all gifts', which reads an awful lot like claims from psychoanalysis, which is of course always right because it already explains that people will reject it for unconscious reasons that psychoanalysis explains, and similar immunising strategies of pseudoscience.
