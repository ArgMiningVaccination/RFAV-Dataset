Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems Indiana Cancer Registrars Association Commission on Cancer, American College of Surgeons Anita Butz, CTR, Helping Hands, Indian apolis, Indiana Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 1 INTRODUCTION A. BACKGROUND In 1985, the General Assembly of the State of Indiana passed Public Law 174 -1985 establishing a cancer registry for the purpose of recording all cases of malignant disease that occur in Indiana residents and c ompiling necessary and appropriate information concerning those cases...in order to conduct epidemiologic surveys of cancer and to apply appropriate preventive and control measures.1 An advisory committee was established to assist the State Department of Health in creating such a registry. The committee developed the standards for establishing and maintaining the State Cancer Registry. They also helped develop a Policy and Procedure Manual and implemented training throughout the state. Hospitals, physi cians, dentists, and medical laboratories began reporting January 1, 1987. A 1988 amendment to the law allows the State Cancer Registry to release confidential information to another state's cancer registry if that state has entered into a reciprocal agre ement with the State Department of Health. The reciprocal agreement must state that information that identifies a patient will not be released to any other entity without the written consent of the patient.2 In 1991, IC 16 -4-9-3 was amended to allow the state to enter into reciprocal agreements with other states in order to exchange data between cancer registries. In a 1993 amendment, several laws were recodified. No substantial changes were made other than some minor wording changes, such as changing State Board of Health to State Department of Health. The current law is IC 16 -38-2. This manual has been revised from the edition released in 1995 to reflect current laws and standards. B. PURPOSE The intent of this manual is to serve as a reference for hospitals reporting cases of malignant disease to the State Cancer Registry. The procedures set out in the manual have been developed in accordance with IC -38-2 and 410 IAC 21 -1 (Appendix A). C. DEFINITIONS The terms must, shall, and is required are used throughout the manual to indicate what is mandatory and the only acceptable method under the law and rule. Should is used to reflect commonly accepted practices, yet allows effective alternatives to be used. May is used to indicate an alternative that is acceptable, but not necessarily preferred. D. REFERENCE MATERIALS This Policy and Procedure Manual serves as a reference which is offered free of change to reporting entities. For a complete list of required references and other resources, see C hapter 1. 1 IC 16 -4-9 (IC 16 -38-2 since 1993) 2 IC 16 -4-9-6 (IC -38-2-6 since 1993) 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 2 E. CONSULTATION Personnel of the State Cancer Registry are available by telephone and, in special circumstances, on site to provide consultation on all aspects of reporting. These include abstracting, organization and management, cancer regis try software education, and updates on cancer data management at the both the state and national level. The Indiana Cancer Registrars Association has graciously offered to serve as a source for consultation, utilizing the expertise of experienced cancer r egistrars across the state. F. OUTPUT The rule for implementing statewide reporting mandates that the State provide each reporting facility a comprehensive annual report which outlines the trends of malignant disease in Indiana. Hospitals, physicians, d entists, medical laboratories, and other persons may request and be provided with individualized special reports as state resources permit. G. QUALITY CONTROL The State Cancer Registry monitors data quality through a variety of activities that are descri bed in Chapter 7. The activities include careful monitoring of the number of cases submitted, visual review of abstracts for completeness and accuracy, and extensive electronic edits. Chapter 7 provides policies for clarification and modification of data . Continuing education and policy and procedure updates will focus on issues identified through quality control activities. In summary, the State Cancer Registry serves as the state's repository of cancer data and an important resource offering a wide sp ectrum of services to the hospitals, physicians, dentists, and medical laboratories reporting to the State. As a tax supported service to health care professionals and the public, feedback regarding improvements in State Cancer Registry policies and servi ces is welcomed.

Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 6 CHAPT ER 2: CASEFINDING & SETTING UP A REGISTRY A. OVERVIEW The accuracy of a statewide database is dependent on the timeliness and completeness of casefinding (the identification of reportable cancer cases) at the hospital level. A variety of casefinding me thods must be used since no single method can encompass all the possible medical resources used by cancer patients. B. REPORTABLE LIST A reportable list identifies diagnoses that will be included in the registry and those that are to be excluded. The ho spital's administration, cancer committee, and physicians; American college of Surgeons' Cancer Program Manual; and the State Policy and Procedure Manual should be consulted when developing the reportable list. Appendix B contains the State reportable lis t. All diagnoses on the list must be reported to the State Registry. The hospital cancer committee may decide to collect additional diagnoses not on the list, called Reportable -by-Agreement cases (e.g., squamous cell carcinomas of the skin ). These cas es do not need to be reported to the State Registry. C. METHODS OF CASEFINDI NG Definition Casefinding is a systematic method of identifying all reportable cancer cases. For a hospital, the cases include all patients diagnosed or treated in a hospital, b oth inpatient and outpatient, during the first course of therapy. Cases identified at autopsy must also be reported. Responsibility To assure consistency and completeness, casefinding should be the responsibility of one hospital department that has acces s to patients' medical records and the appropriate hospital reports and listings. For this reason, the function is most commonly performed in the medical record department. However, it may be performed elsewhere, such as pathology, radiation therapy, onc ology, or nursing department, provided there is ready access to the necessary records and a central place for record keeping. The person responsible for casefinding should have a knowledge of medical terminology, especially in the field of cancer diagnosi s and treatment. Interdepartmental communication and cooperation are essential for complete casefinding. Sources of Casefinding The following are potential sources of cancer patient identification. Other sources, not listed here, may be appropriate, dep ending on the administrative structure of the hospital. To ensure that all potential sources of case identification are addressed, facilities should use the health information data systems and/or billing systems to print lists of cancer -related diagnostic codes. Casefinding should not be limited to a review of pathology reports. As potential cases are identified, the patient's name and medical record number should be recorded for retrieval of the entire medical record. 1. Pathology and Cytology Departme nts Pathology reports, including reports with negative findings Bone marrow biopsies Histology reports Cytology reports Hematology reports Autopsy reports Pathology logs Pathology appointment registers Chapter 1 References Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 7 Most newly diagnosed cancer patients have a biopsy o r surgical procedure for which a pathology report is written identifying and classifying the excised specimen. All pathology reports, along with the clinical summary, should be read to identify cases. Cases in which only specimens were reviewed by the re porting hospital may never have a medical record. The coded final histologic diagnoses (in SNOMED) should be reviewed. Sometimes a programmer can prepare a list containing only malignancies. A negative pathology or cytology report may be a hidden source for finding certain cases. If an excisional biopsy was performed in a physician's office and the patient was later referred to the hospital for additional treatment, the pathology report may be negative if no further cancer was detected. The case should still be reported to the State Registry by the hospital because the patient was referred to the hospital for further diagnosis or treatment . Example #1: A physician diagnoses a melanoma and performs the excisional biopsy in the office. The patient is th en admitted to the hospital for a wide excision. The pathology report does not show any malignancy. Although the pathology report is negative, the case should be reported to the State Registry by the hospital because the patient was referred to the hospi tal for additional treatment. Example #2: A physician performs a lumpectomy for breast cancer in the office. The patient is later admitted to the hospital for a modified radical mastectomy. No residual tumor was noted on the pathology report. The hospi tal must report this case to the State Registry, even though the pathology report is negative. 2. Health Information Management Department (Medical Record Department) Inpatient records Outpatient records Disease or diagnostic index Computerized listings o f specific cancer -related ICD -9-CM codes Operation index Admitting lists Discharge lists Health information management department personnel may assist in case identification in a number of ways. A regular listing of all cancer cases may be helpful in cas efinding. Working with personnel responsible for assembly and analysis of records upon discharge may identify patients overlooked through other reviews. Coders could flag all medical records with malignant diagnoses for review by the Cancer Registrar. I f feasible, direct review of all medical records by the cancer registrar assures more complete casefinding. Appendix C lists the ICD -9-CM codes that should be reviewed for eligible cases. 3. Bill and Insurance Department (Patient Accounts) Print-outs lis ting cancer -related diagnostic codes Hospital and/or departmental billing systems use diagnostic codes for billing purposes. Computerized billing systems may be used to generate lists of cancer -related diagnostic codes. See Appendix C of this manual for a list of cancer -related codes. Cancer registrars should work with billing department personnel to assess the capabilities of the system and develop the parameters of the report. The process may involve the computer vendor. 4. Radiology Department Radiation therapy treatment summaries Radiation therapy new patient listings Radiation therapy log Radiation therapy schedule Radiation oncology records Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapte r 2 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 8 Nuclear medicine reports Nuclear medicine log Nuclear medicine schedule Diagnostic radiology reports Scans The radiation therapy department can be an important source of casefinding since many patients are treated solely as outpatients and may be missed by other casefinding methods. Radiology records should be made available to the person responsible for case finding, by either providing copies of the reports or permitting access to the radiation therapy department's patient records. A periodic review of the department's therapy log or schedule will serve as a quality control check and help ensure completeness of casefinding. 5. Outpatients/Clinics/ER Ambulatory/outpatient surgery records Day surgery logs Outpatient scheduling logs CPT codes on outpatient records Emergency room records/logs ENT (ear, nose, throat) clinic records Eye clinic records Skin (melano ma, others) clinic records Mycosis fungoides clinic records OB/GYN clinic records AIDS/Kaposi's sarcoma clinic records If outpatient records are not filed in the medical record department, arrangements should be made with the applicable departments and cl inics for access to the patient records at a mutually convenient time. 6. Cancer Conference/Tumor Board The cancer committee of a hospital is responsible for conducting cancer conferences (tumor boards) to provide consultative services to patients and to educate the medical staff. Attendance at these conferences or review of minutes may identify additional cancer patients. 7. Other Sources of Casefinding Operation/surgery log Operation/surgery schedule Oncology/Hematology records Chemotherapy logs Staff physician's office Preventing Duplicates All cancer patients who have been identified by any of the methods described above should be checked against cases in the suspense system (Chapter 2, section D) and the patient index (Chapter 2, section F). If a p atient's name is found in either of these places with the same primary cancer, the case has been identified previously and should not be added to the database. These patients may be readmissions for additional treatment, recurrence, progression of or pers istent disease, or follow -up. The information obtained through casefinding should be preserved and used to help complete the abstract (if the case was found in the suspense system) or to complete follow -up (if the case was found in the patient index), if applicable. Chapter 1 References Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 9 D. SUSPENSE SYSTEM Definition A suspense system is a file or a list of cancer cases that have been identified but have not yet been completely entered, abstracted, or accessioned into the registry. The file or list serves as a method for ke eping track of identified cancer patients until the abstracts are complete. Purpose The suspense system has two functions: To avoid duplicate case identification, and; To serve as a quality control check to assure that over a period of time, all identifie d cases have been abstracted. Organization For convenience in duplicate checking, the suspense system should be arranged alphabetically by month of case identification. Patient data should include: Patient name Date of diagnosis Medical record number Cancer primary site A paper abstract with the above information could be used as the suspense system, or an index card could be completed. The abstracts or cards should be filed alphabetically. If the patient index described in Section F. is maintained on cards, these cards could be partially completed and used in a suspense file. Once the case is fully abstracted, the card in the suspense file could be moved to the alphabetic patient index and the rest of the information completed. A suspense system can also be set up in the Rocky Mountain Cancer Data System (RMCDS) program. As much information as is initially known about the patient is entered (e.g., name, medical record number, admission date, etc.). In the Suspense field, code 1 is entered to indic ate the case is in suspense. Records with suspense code 1 are excluded when extensive edits are applied. When the full case is later abstracted, the suspense code 1 should be changed to zero (0) and the edits should be applied. A list can be printed at any time of all patients with suspense code 1 to ensure abstracting has been completed for all cases in the suspense file. E. ACCESSION REGISTER Definition The accession register is an annual, sequential listing of all reportable cases included in a hosp ital's cancer registry. It serves to identify, count, and evaluate the annual caseload. The register can be used to audit other registry files, monitor casefinding, assess the workload, and verify patient identification. Description The following items should be included in the accession register: 1. Accession number The first four digits of the accession number should specify the year that the patient was first seen at the reporting hospital for the diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer following the re gistry's reference date. The last five digits are a number each case is assigned in sequential order, beginning with 00001 at the start of each new calendar year. Detailed instructions on accession numbers can be found in Chapter 5. Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapte r 2 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 10 2. Sequence number Sequence numbers indicate the chronological order of the diagnoses of independent, primary malignancies or reportable benign tumors that occur over the patient's lifetime. Detailed instructions on sequence numbers can be found in chapter 5. 3. Patient name 4. Primary site 5. Date initial diagnosis (or date first seen at the reporting institution) 6. Class of case (optional; see item description in Chapter 5 for further information) A sample page follows, but the hospital should design their accession regis ter according to their own needs. Accn. Year & Number Seq. Name Primary Site Date of Diagnosis Class 201200001 00 01 Brown, John Q. prostate 01/02/ 2012 1 201200002 00 Smith, Susan lung 01/15/ 2012 0 199700150 02 Jones, Mary (patient's first primary was in 1997) breast 02/07/ 2012 1 201200003 00 Green, George pancreas 03/24/ 2012 2 201200001 02 Brown, John Q.

Patients admitted with new primaries and who had accession numbers assigned in a previous year will be listed but using the original number and therefore will not be counted in the current year's sequence of accession numbers. F. PATIENT INDEX Definition The patient index is a complete alphabetical file or list of all patients, living or dead, identified and reported by the hospital since the reference date (starting date for reporting). Before a patient is added to the registry, the patient index should be checked to see if the patient has already been accessioned. Chapter 1 References Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 11 Description The following data items must be included in the patient index: Name Date of birth Sex Medical record number Accession number Date of death Sequence number (for each primary site) Date of diagnosis (for each primary site) Laterality (for each primary site) Site (for each primary site) Histology (for each primary site) Below is a sample patient index entry, but the hospital should design their file according to their own needs. Name: DOB: should be only ONE entry or card per patient in the patient index. All independent primaries in the same patient are included on the same entry or ca rd. The index should be maintained in alphabetic order and be retained indefinitely. G. FILING Hospitals reporting by paper abstracts should keep the original abstract form and submit a copy of the abstract form to the State Cancer Registry (see Chapter 3). The most efficient filing system for hospitals reporting on paper abstracts is filing all cases in ascending numerical order by the first two digits of the primary site code. Example: All patients with cancer of the small intestine (C17._) are filed before all patients with cancer of the colon (C18._). Within each site, cases are separated by accession year. Within each accession year, cases are filed alphabetically. Casefinding & Setting Up a Registry Chapte r 2 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 12 Example: All patients with colon cancer in 1994 will be filed alphabetically behi nd all patients with colon cancer in 1993. The file of abstracts in site order could serve as a primary site index, making records more easily retrievable for studies. The original abstract, any copies of it, and associated documentation must be regarded as confidential medical records and their storage should comply with applicable hospital and state regulations for confidentiality and security of records. Abstracts should be retained indefinitely. Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 13 CHAPTER 3: REPORTING A. OVERVIEW This chapter expl ains the cases and types of diagnoses to be reported, who should submit abstracts, when abstracts should be submitted, and how they should be submitted. B. CASES TO REPORT TO T HE STATE REGISTRY 1. General Requirements All confirmed cases of reportable tu mors diagnosed and/or initially treated in Indiana must be reported to the State Cancer Registry, as specified in this section. Reportable diagnoses are listed in Appendix B. Confirmed cases include clinically diagnosed patients (not microscopically confi rmed) as well as microscopically confirmed diagnoses. If a recognized medical practitioner documents that a patient has cancer, the diagnosis is reportable. Terms that constitute a clinical diagnosis can be found in Chapter 4. Reportable cases include in patients and outpatients (including hospital -affiliated ambulatory care settings). 2. Required Cases a. In situ and frank malignancies - those with an International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3) fifth digit behavio r code of /2 or /3. These diagnoses appear on the Reportable List of Malignancies in Appendix B. Exceptions (Not Reportable): Preinvasive cervical neoplasia III) later; Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or later; Basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of ( site -C44.9 with histology codes 8000 -8110) diagnosed 01/01/2003 or b. If diagnosed before 01/01/2003, basal cell and squamous cell c arcinoma of C44.0 -C44.9 with histology codes 8000 -8110) that meets at least one of the following conditions at the time of diagnosis : (1) Primary tumor more than 5 centimeters in greatest dimension; (2) Primary tumor that has invaded deep extradermal structures such as cartilage, skeletal muscle, or bone; (3) Primary tumor with regional node metastases; (4) Primary tumor with metastasis to distant sites. c. Basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma ( ICD-O-3 histology codes 80 00-8110) that listed as 9421/1 in ICD-O-3, is required and should be reported as 9421/3. Reporting Chapter 3 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 14 e. The ICD-O-3 code for Carcinoid tumor, NOS, of appendix ( 8240/1) is obsolete in 2015. Carcinoid tumors of the appendix must be coded to 8240/3 and are required to be reported. f. All benign and borderline (be havior codes /0 and /1) intracranial and central nervous system tumors diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later. ( ICD-O-3 primary site codes C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 -C75.3.) g. Analytic cases (see Item 28 in Chapter 5 for further information on analytic and nonanaly tic cases). Analytic cases include the following: (1) All new malignancies diagnosed at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 00). (2) All malignancies initially diagnosed and treated at the reporting facility for all or part of the first course of treatment on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 10, 13, or 14). (3) All malignancies initially diagnosed in a staff physician's office on or after January 1, 1987 and treated at the reporting facility for all or part of the firs t course of treatment (class of case 11 or 12). (4) All malignancies initially treated at reporting facility for all or part of the first course of treatment on or after January 1, 1987 (class of case 20, 21, or 22). This includes patients who previously have been diagnosed with a cancer prior to January 1, 1987 and have a new primary malignancy diagnosed at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987. ( Only the new malignancy diagnosed on or after January 1, 1987 must be reported to the State Cancer Registry .) Do not report the malignancy diagnosed before January 1, 1987. h. Nonanalytic class of case 32 diagnosed on or after January 1, 1987. Class 32 includes cases first diagnosed elsewhere and all of the first course therapy elsewhere. The re porting facility diagnosed and/or treated the recurrence or progression of a malignancy diagnosed January 1, 1987 or later. i. Cases with diagnoses (for example, VIN III), required by the State, but not by CoC that are diagnosed and/or treated at the repo rting facility on or after January 1, 1987 (Nonanalytic class of case 34 or 36). j. Nonanalytic class of case 35 or 37 diagnosed on or after January 1, 1987. Class 35 or 37 includes cases first diagnosed and/or first course of therapy at the reporting facility before the registry's reference date. Class of case 35 or 37 would be applicable only for a registry with a reference date later than 1987. Example 1: Hospital A changed their reference date from 1987 to 1992. In 1993, a patient is admitted who w as diagnosed and treated for a melanoma at Hospital A in 1990 and has returned for a recurrence. The case is class 35 for the hospital and should be reported to the State Registry in 1993 if not previously reported when diagnosed. Example 2: Hospital A c hanged their reference date from 1987 to 1992. In 1993, a patient is admitted with a second primary. The first primary, treated at Hospital A in 1990, is class of case 37 for the hospital and should be reported to the State Registry in 1993 if not previo usly reported when diagnosed. k. Patients first diagnosed at autopsy (Nonanalytic class of case 38). l. Patients diagnosed and treated only in a staff physician's office (Nonanalytic class of case 40 or 41). Reportable by the hospital only if the hospit al collects class 40 and 41 cases. Otherwise, reportable by the physician's office. Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 15 m. The types of cases list below are reportable to the State Registry, though not reportable by CoC. Since documentation for these cases may be limited, report all infor mation available either in your usual format, by paper abstract, or by sending copies of pertinent medical record documentation. (1) Pathology -only cases (Nonanalytic class of case 43). (2) Patients seen in consultation to confirm a diagnosis or first co urse treatment plan (Nonanalytic class of case 30). This includes cases where a patient is seen only once at the reporting hospit al with an abnormal or positive appearing x -ray or scan, but the patient never returns for any work -up, confirmation of diagno sis, or treatment. Example : A patient comes to the institution for a second opinion. Staff physicians order diagnostic tests and support the original treatment plan. The patient returns to the other institution for treatment. C. CASES NOT REQUIRED 1. Cases with an International Classification of Diseases of Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3) fifth digit behavior code of /0 (benign) or /1 (uncertain or borderline), which are the codes for precancerous conditions or benign tumors. Exceptions (Repo rtable): Juvenile astrocytoma, listed as 9421/1 in ICD-O-3, is required and should be reported as 9421/3. All benign and borderline intracranial and central nervous system tumors diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later are reportable. ( ICD-O-3 primary site cod 8240/1 in ICD -O-3, is required effective 2015 and should be coded to 8240/3. 2. If diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later, all basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin ( ICD-O-3 site codes C44.0 -C44.9 If diagnosed before 01/01/2003, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin that are in situ or that are invasive and 5 centimeters or less in greatest dimension with no lymph node or distant metastasis. 3. Analytic cases (class of case codes 00 -22) who were first diagnosed or first treated at the reporting facility on or after January 1, 1987 and return to the facility for: a. A recurrence of that same primary; b. Subsequent treatment; c. Progr ession of recurrent disease (disease free period); or d. Continued or persistent disease (never disease free). Note: An abstract would have been submitted when the patient was first diagnosed or first treated. Once a case has been accessioned into a reg istry, it is not re-accessioned or reported if the patient returns to the hospital for that same primary. 4. Nonanalytic class of case 30 -33 diagnosed before January 1, 1987. Class 30 -33 includes cases first diagnosed elsewhere and all of the first cours e therapy elsewhere. If the reporting facility is treating the recurrence or progression of a malignancy diagnosed before January 1, 1987, the case should not be reported to the state. 5. Nonanalytic class of case 35 and 37 diagnosed before January 1, 19 87. Class 35 and 37 includes cases diagnosed and/or first course of therapy at the reporting facility before the registry's reference date. Patients with the following situations would be non -reportable class of case 35 and 37: Reporting Chapter 3 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 16 Patients first diagnosed before January 1, 1987 who: a. Received no treatment after being diagnosed; b. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 ; c. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 and subsequent treatment on or after January 1, 1987; d. Received first course of treatment before January 1, 1987 and had a recurrence of that same primary on or after January 1, 1987. 6. Patients who receive transient care to avoid interrupting a course of therapy started elsewhere (class of case 31). Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such patients who are Indiana residents have been reported by the other facility. Example 1: A patient is visiting relatives in the area. The oncology department at the reporting facility dispenses the schedule d chemotherapy. Example 2: Another institution sends a patient to the reporting facility because of equipment failure. The reporting facility administers the radiation therapy until the equipment is repaired. The patient returns to the original institut ion to complete therapy. 7. Patients with active cancer who are admitted for an unrelated medical condition. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported. Example: A patient with active prostate cancer enters the repor ting facility's cardiac care unit for cardiac care only. 8. Patients with a history of cancer who currently have no evidence of the disease. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported. 9. Patients admitted to a desig nated hospice unit or home care service. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been reported . 10. Patients admitted for terminal supportive care only. Please verify with the State Cancer Registry that such cases have been rep orted . 11. Class of case 49 (diagnosed by death certificate only). The State Cancer Registry will collect cancer data on these patients after all reasonable efforts to obtain information from a health care provider have failed. 12. Residents of a foreig n country. 13. Annual follow -up on all cases (optional reporting). 14. Hospitals may abstract cases that are not required by the State Registry, but are important for their own clinical, administrative, management, or marketing purposes. These patients often receive services and use the resources of the hospital (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, lab tests, etc.). These cases should not be reported to the State Registry. Examples include non - reportable localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin and class 35 or 37 cases diagnosed before 1987 . D. DATA ITEMS TO REPORT 1. Analytic Cases Required and optional data items to report to the State Registry for analytic cases are identified in Chapter 5 of this manual. The items are listed in a table of the State data set in Chapter 5 and are presented in the pages following the table with descriptions, codes, formats, definitions, rules, and instructions. Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 17 2. Reportable Nonanalytic Cases Since hospitals may have limited information about nonanalytic cases (report able if diagnosed after January 1, 1987), a minimal data set for these cases is presented in the table below . Apply the codes, definitions, and rules in chapter 5 for these items and record them in either the paper or a computerized abstract. If the info rmation for an item is not available, leave the item blank or code it according to the vendor's instructions for unknown. No. Item Notes 1. Reporting hospital ID number 2.

WHO SHO ULD SUBMIT REPORTS The hospital that first diagnoses a case in 1987 or later is responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. A hospital that performs part or all of the first course treatment for cases diagnosed in 1987 or later i s responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. A hospital that treats recurrence or progression of a malignancy first diagnosed elsewhere in 1987 or later and all of first course of treatment performed elsewhere is responsible for submitting an abstract to the State Cancer Registry. The staff physician's office is considered an extension of the hospital. Cases of patients who are diagnosed or treated in a staff physician's office and referred to the hospital for definitive therapy must be reported as though they were diagnosed at the hospital. If these patients were referred to another institution for their first course of treatment, then their cases need not be included. Patients diagnosed and treated only in a staff physician's office (class of case 40 or 41) are to be reported if such cases are collected by the hospital. If not reported by the hospital, these cases must be reported by the physicians' offices. When the distinction between a hospital -based department and a free -standing facility cannot readily be made (e.g., a radiation therapy group practice versus a hospital unit) the ownership of the medical record should be used to determine whether a case must be reported by the hospital. The owner of the medical record is responsible for reporting the case to the State Cancer Registry. . F. WHEN TO SUBMIT REPOR TS Facilities must complete and submit reports of confirmed cases of reportable tumors to the State Cancer Registry no later than six (6) months following the date the patient comes under the care of the reporting facility. Facilities should report on a schedule based on the size of their annual caseload. The minimum reporting requirements for each caseload range is provided in the table below. More frequent repor ting is encouraged so that the State database remains as current as possible for analytic purposes. REPORTING SCHEDULE Average Number of Cases Diagnosed per Year Minimum Frequency for Reporting to the State 1-59 Once per year 60-149 Quarterly 150-299 Every other month 300 Every month G. HOW TO SUBMIT REPORT S 1. Hospitals With Computerized Systems a. Hospitals with computerized registries should submit reports to the State Cancer Registry in an acceptable, machine -readable format (RMCDS format fo r hospitals using RMCDS Chapter 3 Reporting Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 19 software and NAACCR format for those using other systems) within the time frame described in this chapter. b. Make sure all cases abstracted since the previous submission are selected for each new submission. Selecting cases by a range of accession numbers will omit patients with an earlier accession number who have a new primary. Contact your software vendor for procedures to ensure all cases are reported to the State Cancer Registry . c. Submitting by FTP Program The preferred method for submitting data is to use the ISCR FTP Program that encrypts your data file and sends it to the ISCR through the Internet using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If your facility prohibits or limits the use of FTP, the program can also send the encrypted file as an e -mail attachment. The method meets government security requirements. Contact the State Cancer Registry to obtain procedures for submitting data by using the FTP Program. d. Submitting by Web Plus An alternate method is to use the Web Plus program that securely uploads your file through a browser. The method also meets government security requirements. Contact the State Cancer Registry to obtain procedures for submitting data by using Web Plus e. Submitting on Diskettes Effecti ve July 2009 the State Cancer Registry can no longer process data submitted on diskettes . f. Ensure that the contents of computerized abstracts are treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as the medical record. The abstracts are abbre viated medical records and should be treated as such. A full discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual . g. The hospital should keep a record of cases submitted to the State. The State Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of the date, number of disks, and number of cases received from each hospital. 2. Hospital Using Paper Forms a. Hospitals should submit reports to the State within the time frame described in this chapter, using the Hospital Abstract form designed and app roved by the State Cancer Registry. Computerized registries may use the form to submit reportable nonanalytic cases that are not abstracted into their registry systems . Forms may be obtained, free of charge, by calling or writing the State Cancer Registry . Marsha Lundy Office: (317) 233 -7158 Indiana State Cancer Registry Fax: 233 -7722 Indiana State Department of Health E-mail: mlundy@isdh.in.gov 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 b. Attach a copy of the pathology report to the abstract form. State Cancer Registry staff need the reports to substantiate the codes . c. When sending in more than one abstract for multiple tumors on a patient, do not staple abstracts on different tumors together, as they may be overlooked. Do staple copies of medical record documentation about the reported tumor to the applicable abstract. Reporting Chapter 3 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 20 d. The hospital should make a legible copy of the original abstract and mail the copy to the State Cancer Registry, keeping the original at the hospi tal. Illegible abstracts will be returned to the hospital . e. Ensure that abstracts are treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as the medical record. The abstracts are abbreviated medical records and should be treated as such. A fu ll discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual . f. The hospital should keep a record of abstracts mailed to the State Cancer Registry, noting the date and number submitted. The State Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of the number of abstracts and date received from each hospital. g. Envelopes containing copies of the abstracts should be carefully sealed and labeled CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION. The envelope should be clearly addressed: Indiana State Cancer Registry Indiana State Department of Health 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 3. Other Forms a. Correction and Follow -Up Form Chapter 6 of this manual describes a Correction and Follow -Up Form and instructions for completing it. Corrections or annual follow -up data on previously submitted Hospital Abstracts may be reported on this form. b. Correction Form for Multiple Patients Chapter 6 also describes a Correction Form for Multiple Patients and i nstructions for completing it . These forms may be obtained by calling or writing the State Cancer Registry. Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 21 CHAPTER 4: GENERAL DEFINITIONS FOR CODING A. INTRODUCTION The State Cancer Registry uses definitions published by national standard -setting organizations in order to ensure that its instructions and the data collected are consistent with those from other registries. The standard -setting organizations include the American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer (ACoS/CoC); the North American Association of Central Cancer R egistries (NAACCR); and the National Cancer Institute's SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program. B. GUIDELINES FOR INTER PRETATION OF TERMINO LOGY The overall priority for using information to determine tumor involvement is pathological, operative, then clinical findings. The medical practitioner may use ambiguous terms when describing a clinical diagnosis or extent of disease in relation to tumor invasion of an organ or structure, especially when there is no cytologic or histologic proo f of disease extension. When there are questions concerning terminology, consult with a physician or pathologist. The following lists should be used when the terminology is vague or ambiguous. Terms That Indicate Clinical Diagnosis or Tumor Involvement/ Extension adherent to apparent apparently appears to comparable with compatible with consistent with contiguous/continuous with encroaching upon extension - to, into, onto, or out onto favor(s) features of fixation (to another structure) fixed (involveme nt of other organ/tissue) impending perforation of 2 impinging upon 2 impose, imposing on 2 incipient invasion induration (for breast cases) infringe, infringing 2 into intrude invasion - to, into, onto, or out onto malignant appearing matted (for lymph no des only) most likely neoplasm (only for C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 - C75.3 diagnosed 01/01/04 and later) obliterate onto out onto overstep 2 presumed probable probably protruding into (unless encapsulated) suspect suspected suspicious (for) 1 to tumor (only for C70 .0-C72.9, C75.1 -C75.3 diagnosed 01/01/04 and later) violate typical of up to Example: A chest x -ray is consistent with a carcinoma of the right upper lobe. Final diagnosis is probable carcinoma of the right lung. The case should be abstracted and repor ted. 1 Exception: If a cytology specimen is reported as suspicious, do not interpret this as a diagnosis of cancer unless it is confirmed by a positive biopsy or a physician's clinical assessment. 2 These terms are considered involvement by the SEER Pr ogram and non -involvement by the Statistical Analysis and Quality Control Center at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA. Consult the attending physician regarding these terms.

This case should not be abstracted and reported Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 27 CHAPTER 5: CODING INSTRUCTIONS OVERVIEW An abstract is a summary of pertinent information about the patient, the cancer, the treatment, and outcome. A paper abstract for reporting such informat ion is available for facilities with non -computerized registries. An abstract is used to collect the following three categories of information: Patient and Hospital Identification This includes data items related primarily to demographic information abou t the patient and hospital - specific information. Cancer Identification This includes data items related primarily to information about the patient's tumor or cancer. Treatment Data This includes treatment data and follow -up information. Chapter 5 explai ns how to complete each item within the three categories. Rules and codes for recording the information are consistent with the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards (FORDS) to the extent possible and apply to both paper and computer abstracting unles s they conflict with an alternative software vendor's instructions. As with the FORDS , abstracters should use the rules and codes in this manual only for cases diagnosed January 1, 20 15 and later unless instructed otherwise. Chapter 3, Section C. lists t he types of cases to be reported on an abstract. WHEN TO ABSTRACT A C ANCER CASE 1. Cancer case information should be abstracted after complete work -up, cancer staging, and planned first course of treatment have been initiated. The first course of treatm ent is generally initiated within four months after the cancer is initially diagnosed. With the exception of early deaths, cases should not be abstracted less than four months after diagnosis. 2. Cases are due at the State Cancer Registry no later than six months following the date the patient comes under the care of the reporting facility. 3. Follow -up items are required and should be completed at the time the rest of the case is abstracted. Subsequent, annual follow -up information is optional, but may be reported if desired. See Chapter 6 for details on how to submit annual follow -up information at a later date. 4. There is no time limit for making revisions that give better information about the original diagnosis or stage. Data should be coded usi ng the most accurate information available for an up -to-date and factual database. Over time, information that was missing when the case was first abstracted may be added to the patient's medical record. Such additions may contain new information. The l atest or most complete information available should be used. Thus, it is acceptable to change the primary site, histology, and extent of disease (staging data) as information becomes more complete. Note: This does not mean that if the patient's disease progresses, you should change the original stage to a higher stage. Staging should reflect only information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progress ion, whichever is longer. However, if the original stage is later found to be incorrect, it would be appropriate to change the stage to the correct code. Coding Instructions Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 28 GENERAL ABSTRACTING INSTRUCTIONS AND DEF INITIONS 1. Each primary cancer should be abstracted only once by a facility. However, if a patient is diagnosed with more than one primary cancer, whether simultaneously or at different times, a separate abstract must be completed for each primary cancer. 2. Enter all information accurately. Entries on the pa per abstract should be printed legibly. 3. The following terms are used throughout this chapter to indicate type, justification, and length of data fields: Numeric: The field will accept numbers only. Alphabetic: The field will accept letters only. Alpha numeric: The field will accept either letters or numbers, but no special characters. Text: The field will accept any letter, number, symbol, or space. Left-Justified: Data are to be entered starting at the first space toward the left. Leave unused spaces blank unless otherwise instructed. Right -Justified: Data are to be entered so that the last character falls in the last space on the right in the field. Leave unused spaces blank or zero fill, as directed. Length: Length refers to the number of characters in each data field. 4.

The Facility ID number identifies the facility reporting the case. It also allows the State Registry to collect information from multiple facilities that have seen the same patient for the same tumor. In the State Cancer Registry database, up to ten different facility ID numbers can be recorded for each tumor. Each of the ten facilities can be listed with its admission date, accession year and number, medical record number, and class of c ase for that tumor. Instruction Referring to Appendix D, enter your 3 -digit facility ID number in this field. Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 37 Item Length: 10 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required NPI-REPORTING FACILITY Data item added for cases diagnosed 01/01/2007 or later, when available. Description This is a required 10 -character field that identifies the facility submitting the data in the record. NPI (National Provider Identifier) is a unique identification number for health care providers implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as part of the Health Insuran ce Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Rationale Each facility's NPI is unique. The number is essential to National Cancer Database (NCDB) for monitoring data submissions, ensuring the accuracy of data, and for identifying areas for speci al studies. Codes NPI numbers for Indiana facilities are provided in Appendix D of this manual. Instructions a. NPI-Reporting Facility is automatically coded by the software provider. b. NPI should be recorded as available for cases diagnosed during 200 7, and is required to be recorded for all cases diagnosed January 1, 2008. c. NPI may be blank for cases diagnosed on or before December 31, 2006.

Rationale This item is most useful for multi -staffed registries and can be used for quality control and management. Instructions a. Record the initials or assigned code of the individual who abstracted this case. If the initials are less than three characters, left justify and blank fill. b. Do not code the data entry person unless that person is also the abstractor. Instructions for RMCDS Facilities a. The initials will automatically be entered in each ab stract based on the identification used to log in. b. The initials automatically entered may be manually changed if a second abstracter completes a case in a session logged in by someone else. Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 39 Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required TYPE OF REPORTING SO URCE Data item revised for cases dia gnosed 01/01/2006 and later. Description This is a required 1 -character field for coding the source documents used to abstract the majority of information for the tumor being reported. The item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Rationale The code in this field can be used to explain why information for a tumor may be incomplete. For example, death certificate only cases have unknown values for many data items, so one may want exclude them from some anal yses. The field also is used to minotor the success of non -hospital case reporting and follow -back mechanisms. All population -based registries should have some death certificate -only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percenta ge can imply both shortcomings in casefinding and that follow -back to uncover missed hospital reports was not complete. Codes (effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/2006 and later) 1 Hospital inpatient; managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medic al records 2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital -affiliated or independent) 3 Laboratory only (hospital -affiliated or independent) 4 Physician's office/private medical practitioner (LMD) 5 Nursing/convalescent home/hospice 6 Autopsy only (diagnosed at autopsy) 7 Death certificate only 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers Notes : a. Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 (for cases di agnosed 01/01/2006 and later) and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. Facilities previously defined under code 1 have been split between codes 1, 2, and 8. b. Use the code that reflects the source documents used to abstract the ma jority of information for the tumor being reported. This may not be the source of original case finding. For example, if a case is identified through a pathology laboratory report review and all source documents used to abstract the case are from the phy sician's office, record code 4. Definitions a. Code 1 includes hospitals as well as specified managed health plans. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities), in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and available to the abstractor, are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients. Therefore, these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority. b. Code 2 includes (ra diation or medical) cancer treatment facilities, whether they are affiliated with a hospital or not. These sources usually have complete information on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. c. Code 3 is generally for use by independent pathology laboratories. If a hospital's pathology department has a report on a non -hospital case (with no inpatient or outpatient record) and no other information is available, code 3 should be used. For example, a hospital that finds a reportable case by reviewin g pathology reports should report the case as Reporting Source 3 if no other records or Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chap ter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 40 information were available. This might happen if an outside physician contracted to use the hospital's pathology laboratory facilities. d. Code 4 includes physician o ffices as well as independent, free -standing clinics with no hospital affiliation and that are not defined under Code 2. Examples of these may include surgery centers with no hospital affiliation and HMOs. e. Codes 6 and 7 are used only when investigatio n can find no clinical diagnosis of any kind while the patient was alive. f. Code 8 sources would include, but would not be limited to, hospital outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center sho uld be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia. If a physician's office calls itself a surgery center, but cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia , code as a physician office. Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 41 SUSPENSE CASE Description This is an optional 1 -character field in the RMCDS abstract screen to record a code that identifies an incomplete record (suspense, premalignant). Records identified as incomplete will be by passed when normal edits are applied. A suspense system can be created using this field by printing a suspense list of the incomplete cases. The paper Hospital Abstract does not include this field, since the suspense system for paper abstractors is creat ed by a separate filing of the abstracts or by using index cards. Facilities using other vendors' registry programs should follow the applicable vendor's instructions for suspense cases. Codes 1 Partial record (suspense, premalignant, incomplete) 0 Compl ete record Instructions a. Record a 1 in the suspense field for cases that have not been completely abstracted. b. When the record is completely abstracted, change the code and apply edits to the record. c. Refer to Chapter 2, Section D for requirement s related to suspense systems.

Left justify and leave unused space(s) at the right blank. Instructions a. In a hyphenated last name, record the hyph en (-) between the two surnames (last names). This might happen when a female marries and keeps her maiden name as part of her legal married name. Example: SMITH -WALBRIDGE b. Do not enter periods, apostrophes, blank spaces, punctuation, or other specia l characters (e.g., Jr, III) within the name. Example 1: OHARA (NOT O'HARA) Example 2: MCDONALD (NOT MC DONALD ) Example 3: STPIERRE (NOT ST. PIERRE OR SAINT PIERRE) Note: The FORDS allows blanks, spaces, and apostrophes in the last name field. Howev er, changing the name format at this point would compromise the linking or matching of new cases with cases previously entered in the registry. Therefore, it is advisable to continue following the old formatting rules. c. Update the field if a patient ma rries and takes the spouse's last name. If a patient changes his/her legal name, enter the patient's most current legal name and put previous last name in the field for maiden name. If a patient has more than one tumor, previous records with different la st names (AKA's) should be updated to show the most recent name change. The old name should be recorded in Maiden Name . Example: Jane White, who had a primary in 2009 , marries in 2010 and becomes Jane Black. In 2015 she has a second primary. Change the last name in the 2009 abstract from White to Black and record White in Maiden Name . Record the same names for the 2015 primary: Black (White in Maiden Name ). d.

It will provide a referral pattern report and allow analysis of cancer clusters or environmental studies. Address at diagnosis may be corrected, but never changed or updated. Changing this field would destroy its useful ness. Rules and Definitions: Use the following guidelines for all patient address data items. a. Record the patient's usual residence when the cancer was diagnosed. Normally a residence is the home named by the patient. Do not use a temporary address, such as a winter or vacation home. Legal status and citizenship are not factors in residency decisions. Rules of residency are identical to or comparable with rules used by the Census Bureau whenever possible. The registry can resolve residency question s by using the Census Bureau's definition: The place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time or the place the person considers to be his or her usual home. Vital statistics rules may differ from census rules. Do not record residence from the death certificate. Review each case carefully and apply the rules. b. Do not use current address. Record the address for the patient's home when he/she was diagnosed with cancer for both analytic and nonanalytic cases. If all or any part of the addres s is unknown, follow the instructions for unknowns under the applicable item heading in the following pages. c. Rules for persons without apparent residences: (1) Persons with More than One Residence (summer and winter homes): Use the address the patien t specifies if a usual residence is not apparent. (2) Persons with No Usual Residence (transients, homeless): Use the address of the place they were staying when the cancer was diagnosed. This could be a shelter or the diagnosing facility. (3) Persons Away at School : College students are residents of the school area. Boarding school children below college level are residents of their parents' home. (4) Persons in Institutions : The Census Bureau states, Persons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody are residents of the institution. This includes: Incarcerated persons Persons in nursing, convalescent, and rest homes Persons in homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically disabled, mentally retarded, or mentally ill Long -term residents of other hospitals, such as Veterans Administration (VA) or military hospitals (5) Persons in the Armed Forces and on Maritime Ships : Members of the armed forces are residents of the installation area. Use the stated address for military pe rsonnel and their family. Military personnel may use the installation address or the surrounding community's address. The Census Bureau has detailed residency rules for Naval personnel, Coast Guard, and maritime ships. Refer to Census Bureau publicatio ns for the detailed rules. Patient Address - Current The State Registry does not collect the patient's current address, although there are separate fields in the RMCDS program for recording it. For further coding instructions on current address, refer to the FORDS . Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chap ter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 48 PATIENT ADDRESS (NUM BER AND STREET) AT D IAGNOSIS Description This is a required 60-character field for the patient's house number and street address at the time of diagnosis. Enter the house number and street name or the rural mailing address. This may or may not be the patient's current address. If the patient has multiple tumors, the address may be different for each primary. See General Guidelines for Recording Patient Address at Diagnosis for detailed residency rules. Rationa le The address is a part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It indicates referral patterns and allows for analysis of cancer clusters or environmental studies. Instructions a. Record the number and street address of the patient's us ual residence when the cancer was diagnosed. Do not record a post office box number unless it is the only address available. b. Avoid using punctuation, except when necessary to convey the meaning. Limit punctuation to periods when the period carries me aning (e.g., 39.2 RD), slashes for fractional addresses (e.g., 101 1/2 MAIN ST), and hyphens when the hyphen carries meaning (e.g., 289 -01 MONTGOMERY AVE). Avoid using the pound sign (#) to designate address units whenever possible. If a pound sign is used, there must be a space between the pound sign and the secondary number. c. Do not update this data item if the patient's address changes. d. Use standard abbreviations recognized by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The USPS Postal Addressing Standards , Pub 28, November 2000 can be found on the Internet at http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm .

The code pinpoints residence at diagnosis within a geographic area smaller than the county of residence. Census tract is collected to meet the requirements of the Federal cancer regi stries grant. Rationale Census tract codes allow central registries to calculate incidence rates for geographical areas having population estimates. This field allows a central registry to add Year 2000 Census tract to cases diagnosed in previous years. Definition Census tract codes originate from the Bureau of the Census and are constructed using the patient's address. The boundaries of census tracts are established cooperatively by local committees and the Census Bureau. The corresponding population of the census tract area can be obtained from the Census Bureau. Codes are available from state health departments or the Bureau of the Census. Instructions a. The State Cancer Registry will code this item using computerized methods based on the patient' s address at diagnosis. If your facility already collects census tract, please contact the State Registry to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The field is described here for general informational purposes. b. When coding census tract, the decima l point is assumed to be between the fourth and fifth positions of the field. Zeros are added to fill all six positions. Example 1: Census tract 409.6 (0409.60) would be coded 040960. Example 2: Census tract 516.21 (0516.21) would be coded 051621.

Rationale This item is extremely important in ident ifying, linking, and matching multiple records on the same patient and in differentiating patients with similar names at the State Cancer Registry. Every effort should be made to obtain the correct number for each patient. Instructions a. Do not enter an y dashes, other punctuation, or any alphabetical letters. b. Do not record Social Security numbers that end with B or D. These letters signify that the number is the spouse's and indicate that the patient is receiving benefits under the spouse's number. Code as 999999999. c. You can assume the Medicare number is the Social Security number if it is prefixed with A or C. Do not enter the prefix A or C on the abstract as part of the Social Security number. Special Codes 999999999 The patient does not have a Social Security number or it is not available or unknown.

Rationale This data item is useful for patie nt identification. It is also useful when analyzing tumors according to age cohort. Codes Month Day Year 01 January 01 Use four -digit year (e.g., 1952) 02 February 02 blank = Year unknown 03 March 03 04 April ... 05 May ... 06 June 25 07 July 26 08 August ... 09 September 30 10 October 31 11 November blank = Day unknown 12 December blank Month unknown Instructions a. Record the patient's date of birth as documented in the patient record. Use the full four -digit year for year. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. b. For in utero diagnosis and treatment, record the actual date of birth. The date of birth will follow one or both dates for those events. c. If only the patient age is available, calculate the year of birth from age and the year of diagnosis and leave day and month of birth spaces blank. Example: The patient is 60 years old when admitted to the h ospital on June 15, 2001 and no birth date is given. Record _ _/_ _/1941 or 1941/_ _/_ _, depending on the date format your software uses. Leave the month and day spaces blank. d. If month is unknown, the day is coded unknown. If the year cannot be be determined, code day and month as unknown. e. If the date of birth cannot be determined at all, leave the date of birth field blank and record the reason in Date of Birth Flag .

Rationale As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, the date fl ag fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields. Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known (for example, birth date is unknown) Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of Birth item (NAACCR Item #240). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of Birth has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of Birth cannot be determined at all. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the tra ditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave unknown portions blank.) Date of Birth Flag Full date known *12/07/1953 or 1953/12/07 Blank Month & year known *12/_ _ * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD).

Record the patient's usual occupation (that is, the kind of work performed during most of the patient's working life before diagnosis of this tumor). This may be different from the occupa tion at the time of diagnosis. b. Do not record retired . Do not add , retired , to the usual occupation. (e.g., record registered nurse not retired registered nurse. ) c. Do not record disabled, unemployed, or institutionalized if the patient was ever employed. Record the longest -held occupation. d. If self -employed, specify the kind of work performed. (e.g., self -employed auto mechanic) e. If usual occupation is not available or is unknown, record the patient's current or most recent occupation or any known occupation. f. If the patient was a homemaker ( housewife/househusband ) and also worked outside the home during most of his/her adult life, record usual occupation outside the home. If the patient was a homemaker ( housewife/househusband ) and did not work outside the home for most of his/her adult life, record homemaker . g. If the patient is less than 14 years of age at the time of diagnosis, record child. h. If the patient was student at the time of diagnosis and had never held a job, record student. i. If the patient was not a student or homemaker and had never worked, record never worked as the usual occupation. j If no information related to the patient's occupation is available, record unknown . k.

Rationale Both occupation and business/industry are requ ired to accurately describe an individual's occupation. The item may be used to identify new work -related health hazards and to identify worksite -related groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial. It may also serve as an additional measure of socioeconomic status. Instructions a. Record the primary type of activity carried on by the business/industry where the patient was employed for the most number of years before diagnosis of this tumor. This may be different from th e company or industry of the patient's occupation at the time of diagnosis. b. Be sure to distinguish among manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service components of an industry that performs more than one of these components. c. If the primary activity carried on at the location where the patient worked is unknown, it may be sufficient to record the name of the company ( with city or town) for which the patient performed his/her usual occupation. d. If only current or most recent occupation ( rather than usual occupation ) is documented , record the patient's current or most recent business/industry. e. There should be an entry for Usual Industry if any occupation is reported. If Usual Occupation is homemaker, record own home in Usual Industry . If Usual Occupation is child, record child in Usual Industry . If Usual Occupation is military, record military in Usual Industry . If Usual Occupation is student, record the type of school (high school, college) in Usual Industr y. If Usual O ccupation is never worked, record none in Usual Industry .

Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording text about other primary tumors. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions a. Record site, histology, date of diagnosis, and sequence number for all other primary, malignant tumors from t he patient's history, or other primary tumors diagnosed simultaneously with or after the tumor being reported. Example: Right breast, infiltrating duct carcinoma, July 1980, 01 b. Follow the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules . c. If the pe rson does not have, or has not had, another primary, malignant tumor, record None. Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 75 DATE OF FIRST CONTAC T (INPATIENT OR OUTPATIENT ADMISSION DATE) Description This is a required 8 -character field for the date the patient was first seen at or first admitted to your hospital for this tumor after your reference date. Use whichever date is earlier. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program us es the traditional format. Codes Month Day Year 01 January 01 Use four -digit year (e.g., 20 15) 02 February 02 blank = Year unknown 03 March 03 04 April ... 05 May ... 06 June 25 07 July 26 08 August ... 09 September 30 10 October 31 11 November blank = Day unknown 12 December blank Month unknown Instructions a. Record the first (earliest) date the patient was seen at your facility as either an inpatient or outpatient for diagnosis and/or first course treatment of a reportable tumor. The date may be the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, x -ray, or laboratory text, or the dat a pathology specimen was collected at the facility. b. For analytic cases ( Class of Case 00-22), the Date of First Contact is the date the patient became analytic. For non -analytic cases, it is the date the patient first qualified for the Class of Case that causes the case to be abstracted. c. If the patient was first seen as an outpatient , enter the date the patient was first seen in the outpatient department for this prima ry tumor. For cases diagnosed by scans or x -rays on an outpatient basis at your hospital and then admitted to your hospital, record the date of the scan or x -ray. If patient returned for subsequent outpatient visits, use only the initial date. Example: A patient has an MRI of the brain on December 7, 201 4 for symptoms of severe headache and disorientation. The MRI findings are suspicious for astrocytoma. Surgery is performed on December 19, 201 4, removing all gross tumor. Date of First Contact is Dece mber 7, 201 4. d. For cases diagnosed in the staff physician's office and then referred to your hospital for first course of therapy, record the date the patient was physically irst seen at your hospital as an inpatient or outpatient. Example: A biopsy is performed in a staff physician's office on September 8, 201 4. The biopsy specimen is read at the reporting facility's pathology department as malignant melanoma. The patient presents to the reporting facility for wide re -excision on September 14, 201 4. Date of First Contact is September 14, 201 4. Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chap ter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 76 e. For cases diagnosed at another hospital, the date of first contact would be the date first seen at your hospital for treatment of this tumor, even if the patient was previously seen at your hospital as a consultation or for other reasons and no treatment was given for cancer. f. If the primary was diagnosed during a long-term hospitalization (those in nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, or VA hospitals), use the date of diagnosis as the date of first co ntact. Example: A patient has been an inpatient for several months at a Veterans Administration Hospital for an unrelated illness. After having been hospitalized for several months a new primary is discovered during a routine exam. Enter the date the di agnosis was made, rather than the date the patient was first admitted to the VA Hospital. g. If the cancer was not suspected while the patient was alive and hospitalized, but was an incidental finding on post mortem exam ( autopsy ), use the date of death a s the date of first contact. There must be no suspicion of cancer prior to autopsy. h. For cases diagnosed at your hospital prior to your reference (starting) date, record the first date seen for that malignancy after your reference date. i. For patholo gy-only cases, record the date on which the specimen was collected. j. If the date of first contact cannot be determined at all, leave the date of first contact field blank and record the reason in Date of First Contact Flag . See the Date of First Contac t Flag section for examples illustrating the relationships among these items. Coding Tip: The year in the Date of First Contact item should match the first four digits of your hospital accession number for most patients' first primary (unless patient w as admitted at the end of one year and not diagnosed until the next year). Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 77 DATE OF 1ST CONTACT FLAG Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of 1st Contact (NAACCR Item #580). This data item was added to Volume II Version 12 (effective January 2010). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fi elds were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields. Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (The date of 1st contact is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of 1st Contac t item (NAACCR Item #580). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of 1st Contact has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the 1st Contact cannot be determined at all. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software use s the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave unknown portions blank.) Date of First Contact Flag Full date known *01/08/201 5 or 201 5/01/08 Blank Month & year known *01/_ _/201 5 or 201 5/01/_ _ Blank Year _/_ _/201 * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The comput er will store either in the interoperable format. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 78 HOSPITAL ACCESSION N UMBER Description This is a required 9 -character field for the unique number assigned to each cancer patient seen at your hospital. The first 4 digits indicate a year (YYYY) an d the next 5 digits indicate a sequential number (#####) in which the cancer was first entered into the registry, so that the accession number is recorded as YYYY#####. Each new calendar year starts over again on January 1 with accession number 00001. Examples: 201200007; 20 1200014; 20 1200123; 20 1200537; 1500001. Instructions a. Assign accession numbers on a sequential basis, with the first four digits indicating the year the patient was first seen at your facility for the diagnosis and/or treatment o f cancer. The last five digits indicate the numerical order in which the registry entered the case for that calendar year. b. The first four digits of the accession number are based on the date the patient was first seen for the diagnosis and/or treatmen t of cancer at your hospital following your registry's reference date. The reference date, which always begins on January 1 of a given year, is the date the hospital first started their registry. Therefore, the first four digits of the accession number is never less than the registry's reference date unless the reference date is changed (see Exception below). Example: If you began reporting cancer cases to the State Cancer Registry when the requirement began on January 1, 1987 and continue to report on ly for state requirements, your reference date would be January 1, 1987. All cases in your registry should have an accession number of 1987_ _ _ _ _ or higher. Exception: If a patient is first accessioned into the registry, then the registry later change s its reference date and the patient is subsequently accessioned into the registry with a new primary, use the original accession number associated with the patient and code the sequence appropriately. Example: A patient is diagnosed by the hospital with prostate cancer in 1991 and assigned accession number 199100067. The registry later sets a new reference date of January 1, 1997. The same patient is admitted and diagnosed with lymphoma in 20 15. Use accession number 199100067 and sequence 02 for the ly mphoma case. c. Enter leading zeros for numbers less than five digits. Example: A patient is first admitted to your facility for treatment of cancer in 20 15. The first four digits of the accession number are 20 15. If the patient is the 25th patient to be accessioned (entered) in your registry in 20 15, the last five digits of the accession number would be 00025. The full accession number for this patient would be 20 1500025. d. Assign a unique accession number to each patient. A patient cannot have mor e than one accession number at your facility. Patients who contract a second or third primary cancer retain the same 9 -digit accession number for primaries. (The sequence number will distinguish between the various primaries.) Before assigning an access ion number to a patient, check your alphabetic index to see if the patient has ever been entered in your registry before. Do not assign a new accession number to a patient who already has another accession number. Item Length: 9 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 79 Example: John Smith was first seen and d iagnosed at your hospital in 1999 with a primary cancer of the prostate. He was assigned accession number 199900010 -00 (1999 is the year first accessioned, 00010 is the accession number, and 00 is the sequence number). In 20 15, he was diagnosed with a se cond primary cancer of the pancreas. The accession number for the pancreatic primary would be 199900010 -02. The patient will always keep his originally assigned accession number. Only the sequence number changes. The sequence number will distinguish th e two primaries. e. Each new patient added to the registry should be given the next highest number in sequential order (201500001, 20 1500002, 20 1500003, etc.). The order patients are assigned an accession number within a particular year does not matter. Accession numbers do not need to be kept in date order of diagnosis, admission, discharge, or abstracting. For example, a case first seen in September 20 15 (201500175) can have a lower accession number than a case first seen in July 20 15 (201500176). f. Do not skip over numbers to allow for earlier cases to be inserted later. Numeric gaps in accession numbers should occur only if a case is deleted from your database. Do not reuse the accession number for a different patient to avoid any chance of two c ases having the same accession number. g. The first four digits of the accession number are the year in which the patient was first seen at your hospital. If the patient's first primary was seen at another hospital and therefore was not recorded in your registry, enter the year the patient's earliest sequenced primary was diagnosed and/or treated at your facility. Example 1: Mary Jones was diagnosed with her first primary malignancy at Hospital A in 20 11. Hospital A gave her accession number 20 1100021 -00, since she was the 21st patient to be accessioned at Hospital A in 20 11. In 20 15, Mary Jones went to Hospital B with a second primary. Hospital B assigned her accession number 20 1500152 -02 since she was seen at hospital B for the first time in 20 15 and was the 152nd patient entered in their registry. Hospital A should change their sequence number from 20 1100021 -00 to 201100021 -01. Example 2: A new primary for a patient initially diagnosed and admitted in 20 13 was not identified by the tumor registrar until 20 15. The first four digits of the accession number would be 2013, based on the date of admission (date of first contact for this primary). It would not be 20 15, the year the primary was identified by the registrar. h. The first four digits of the accession number match the year recorded in Date of First Contact for the first accessioned primary (explained earlier in this chapter). Example 1: A patient who was first seen as an outpatient in 20 15 is the first patient to be entered into your registr y in 20 15. His accession number would be 20 1500001. Exception: If the patient was first seen at your facility at the end of one year but was not diagnosed until the beginning of the next year, his accession number should be the year he was diagnosed. Example 2: A patient first entered your hospital as an inpatient in December 20 14, but was not diagnosed until January 20 15. The first four digits of the accession number should be 2015, since the majority of the reports and service for this cancer would be provided in 2015. Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 80 HOSPITAL SEQUENCE NU MBER Description This is a required 2 -character field for the number that indicates the chronological order of this primary tumor in relation to other reportable, independent, malignant and non -malignant neopl asms diagnosed in the patient's lifetime. The sequence number reflects all of a patient's reportable tumors, not just those seen at your hospital. Rationale This data item is used to distinguish among cases having the same accession numbers, to select pa tients with only one malignant primary tumor for certain follow -up studies, and to analyze factors involved in the development of multiple tumors. Codes for Reportable Malignant or In Situ Primary Tumors: Code Definition 00 One malignant or in situ prima ry only in the patient's lifetime 01 First of two or more independent malignant or in situ primaries 02 Second of two or more independent malignant or in situ primaries 03 Third of three or more independent malignant or in situ primaries ... ... (actual se quence of this malignant or in situ primary) ... 35 Thirty -fifth of thirty -five independent malignant or in situ primaries 99 Unspecified malignant or in situ sequence number or unknown Note: When this field is left blank in the RMCDS program, the system defaults to code 00. Codes for Non -Malignant Tumors and Nonreportable Malignant or In Situ Tumors: Code Definition 60 Only one non -malignant primary 61 First of two or more independent non -malignant primaries 62 Second of two or more independent non -malignant primaries ... ... (Consecutive number of non -malignant primaries) 87 Twenty -seventh of twenty -seven independent non -malignant primaries 88 Unspecified number of neoplasms in this category Definitions a. Hospital sequence number : The code ind icating the sequencing of reportable neoplasms in the patient's lifetime, according to the information and rules of the hospital registry. b. Central sequence number : The code indicating the sequencing of reportable neoplasms in the patient's lifetime, a ccording to the information and rules of the central registry. c. Reportable -by-agreement tumors : Diagnoses not required by CoC but defined as reportable by the facility's cancer committee or the state registry. Such diagnoses may be benign, borderline, or malignant. Diagnoses required by the NPCR the Indiana State Cancer Registry, but not by CoC, include VIN III, VAIN III, and AIN. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 81 Example: The State Registry requires the hospital to report vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (VAIN III, 8077 /2). The cancer committee adds VAIN III to their reportable -by- agreement list and decides to accession and abstract these cases to comply with State requirements. d. The following table* illustrates the Indiana State Cancer Registry (ISCR) sequence numbe r series by type of neoplasm. Neoplasm ISCR Sequence (Numeric Series) Malignant (Behavior Code = 3) Includes AJCC T3, T4, or M1 Skin Squamous Cell and Basal Carcinomas diagnosed before 2003. 00-35 Juvenile Astrocytoma diagnosed 2001 and later (Report a s 9421/ 3.) 00-35 In Situ (Behavior Code = 2). Includes VIN III, VAIN III, AIN III. Includes Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed before 1996. 00-35 Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed 1996 -2002 98 Cervix CIS/CIN III diagnosed 2003 and later 60-87 PIN III 60-87 Bord erline/Benign Intracranial Skin Squamous Cell and later 60-87 *Adapted from NAACCR 2003 Implementation Workgroup Guidelines, January 2003. Instruction s a. Use codes 00 -35 and 99 for reportable invasive or in situ neoplasms. b. Use codes 60 -88 for non -malignant neoplasms and nonreportable invasive or in situ neoplasms. c. Use Code 00 only if the patient has a single invasive or in situ primary. If the patient develops a subsequent invasive or in situ primary tumor, change the code for the first tumor from 00 to 01, and number subsequent tumors sequentially. Example 1: Use code 00 for a patient with no history of previous cancer is diagnosed within sit u breast carcinoma January 13, 20 15. Example 2: Change the sequence to 01 for the January 13, 20 15 breast carcinoma when the patient is diagnosed with a subsequent skin melanoma on July 30, 20 15. Example 3: Assign sequence 02 to the skin melanoma diagnos ed on July 30, 20 15 following a breast carcinoma diagnosed on January 13, 20 15. Use sequence 00 if there is no information available to indicate the patient has been diagnosed with an earlier primary malignancy. Assume the tumor being reported is the fi rst. A history of surgery such as hysterectomy or colectomy should not be interpreted as evidence of an earlier malignancy without confirmation, since surgery is also performed to treat benign conditions. d. Use sequence 99 only when there is information that suggests the possibility of an earlier malignancy, but the medical record does not document a definite diagnosis. Example: A patient is diagnosed in the reporting hospital with cancer of the colon. The medical record contains the statement, The pa tient recently had a salivary gland tumor removed. The patient does not know if the lesion was malignant. The registry assigns sequence number 99 to the colon primary. The patient returns to the reporting facility a Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 82 year later for prostate cancer treat ment. The medical record states, The patient has a history of a malignant salivary gland tumor. Change the sequence number of the colon cancer from 99 to 02. Assign the sequence number 03 to the prostate cancer. e. If a patient has had a reportable t umor that the facility did not accession, it is accounted for in sequencing subsequent tumors. Example 1: Your hospital diagnoses a patient with colon cancer. The patient has a history of kidney cancer diagnosed and treated elsewhere. Assign sequence num ber 02 to the colon cancer. Example 2: A patient is diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985. Hospital A's reference date is 1987. In 20 15, this patient has a primary of the lung. Assign sequence number 02 to the lung cancer. f. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility learns later of an unaccessioned tumor that would affect the sequence. g. If two or more CoC required neoplasms are diagnosed at the same time, assign the lowest sequence number to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. Example 1: A patient enters your facility with simultaneous invasive carcinoma of the cervix and invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon. Assign sequence number 01 to the colon primary and sequ ence number 02 to the cervix primary. Example 2: A patient has simultaneous adenocarcinoma in situ in a colon polyp and squamous cell carcinoma in situ in a vocal cord polyp. Assign sequence numbers as you choose. Both primaries have similar prognoses. h. Use code 60 only if the patient has single non -malignant primary. If the patient develops a subsequent non -malignant primary tumor, change the code for the first tumor from 60 to 61, and assign codes to subsequent non -malignant tumors sequentially. i. The sequence codes for malignant/in situ and non -malignant cases are assigned independently. Assign sequence 60 to the first non -malignant tumor in a patient with a prior malignant or in situ primary with sequence number 00. Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 83 CLASS OF CASE Descri ption For a hospital registry, Class of Case divides cases into two groups. Analytic cases (codes 00 -22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment. Treatment and outcome reports may be limited to analytic cases. Nonanalytic cases (codes 30 -49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility's cancer program. Nonanalytic cases are grouped according to the reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted. Class of Case can b e used in conjunction with Type of Reporting Source [500]. Type of Reporting Source is designed to document the source of documents used to abstract the cancer being reported. Rationale Class of Case reflects the facility's role in managing the cancer, wh ether the cancer is required to be reported by CoC, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's Reference Date. Codes Analytic Classes of Case (Required by CoC to be abstracted by approved programs) 00 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facili ty AND all treatment or a decision not to treat was done elsewhere 10 Initial diagnosis at the reporting facility or in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part or all of first course treatment or a decision not to treat was at the repor ting facility, NOS 11 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility 12 Initial diagnosis in an office of a physician with admitting privileges AND all first cou rse treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility 13 Initial diagnosis AND part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility 14 Initial diagnosis AND all first course treatment or a decision not to treat was done at the reporting facility 20 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment was done at the reporting facility, NOS 21 Initial diagnosis elsewhere AND part of treatment was done at the reporting facility 22 Initial diagnosis elsewhe re AND all treatment was done at the reporting facility Classes of Case not required by CoC to be abstracted; required by Cancer Committee, state or regional registry, or other entity Patient appears in person at reporting facility 30 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AND reporting facility participated in diagnostic workup (for example, consult only, staging workup after initial diagnosis elsewhere) 31 Initial diagnosis and all first course treatment elsewhere AND reporting fac ility provided in -transit care 32 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AND patient presents at reporting facility with disease recurrence or persistence 33 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment provided elsewhere AND patient prese nts at reporting facility with disease history only 34 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) having initial diagnosis AND part or all of first course treatment by reporting facility 35 Case diagnosed before program's Reference Date, having initial diagnosis AND part or all of first course treatment by reporting facility 36 Type of case not required by CoC to be accessioned (for example, a benign colon tumor) having Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 84 initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment by reporting facility 37 Case diagnosed before program's Reference Date, having initial diagnosis elsewhere AND all or part of first course treatment by facility 38 Initial diagnosis established by autopsy at the reporting facilit y, cancer not suspected prior to death Patient does not appear in person at reporting facility 40 Diagnosis AND all first course treatment given at the same staff physician's office 41 Diagnosis and all first course treatment given in two or more differe nt offices of physicians with admitting privileges 42 Non-staff physician or non -CoC approved clinic or other facility, not part of reporting facility, accessioned by reporting facility for diagnosis and/or treatment by that entity (for example, hospital abstracts cases from an independent radiation facility 43 Pathology or other lab specimens only 49 Death certificate only 99 Case not required by CoC to be abstracted of unknown relationship to facility (not for use by CoC approved cancer programs for anal ytic cases.) Definitions a. Initial diagnosis : This refers to the first time a physician indicates that the patient has cancer. The initial diagnosis may be clinical or microscopic and it may be based on ambiguous terminology. b. Treatment : Treatment includes any first course activity coded as Surgical Procedure of Primary Site, Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery, Surgical Procedure/Other Site, Radiation Treatment, Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, Immunotherapy, Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedures , or Other Treatment . Palliative care (undertaken to reduce the patient's symptoms) involving surgery, systemic treatment, or radiation is also coded as treatment and qualifies the patient as analytic if given as part of planned first course treat ment. Decisions not to treat, whether initiated by the physician (contraindicating conditions) or by the patient (refusal), or decisions for active surveillance (watchful waiting) are also considred treatment for assigning Class of Case. c. Physicians with admitting privileges : Physician s who are not employed by the reporting facility but are under contract with it or have routine admitting privileges there. Instructions a. Assign the Class of Case code th at most precisely describes the patient's rel ationship to the facility. b. It is possible that information for coding Class of Case will change during the patient's first course of care. Change the Class of Case code accordingly if that occurs. If a patient has been accessioned into yo ur registry as an analytic case (codes 00 -22), do not reaccession or change the class of case code if the patient returns for a recurrence, subsequent treatment, or progression of disease involving the same primary. c. Assign code 00 only when it is known that the p atient went elsewhere for treatment. If it is not known that the patient actually went somewhere else, assign Class of Case code 10. d. Report all analytic cases ( codes 00 -22), to the State Cancer Registry. e. Report specified nonanalytic cases (codes 3 0, 32, 34 -38, 40 -41) that meet criteria described in Chapter 3 of this manual.

Data Type: Text ACoS: N/A State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Patient and Hospital Identification Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 88 CASEFINDING SOURCE *Required if available for cases diagnosed 01/01/2012 and later. Description This is a requi red 2 -character field for coding the source that first identified the tumor. For cases identified by a source other than reporting facilities (such as through death clearance or as a result of an audit), the codes reflect the type of source through which the tumor was first identified. Rationale This data item will help reporting facilities as well as regional and central registries in prioritizing their casefinding activities. It will identify reportable tumors that were first found through death clearanc e or sources other than traditional reporting facilities. It provides more detail than Type of Reporting Source. This data item cannot be used by itself as a data quality indicator. The timing of the casefinding processes (e.g., death linkage) varies fro m registry to registry, and the coded value of this variable is a function of that timing. Codes Case first identified at a reporting facility 10 Reporting hospital, NOS 20 Pathology department review (surgical pathology reports, autopsies, or cytology re ports) 21 Daily discharge review (daily screening of discharged patients' records in the medical record /health information department) 22 Disease index review (review of the medical record /health information department 's disease index ) 23 Radiation therapy department/center 24 Laboratory report s (other than pathology reports defined for code 20) 25 Outpatient chemotherapy 26 Diagnostic imaging/radiology , includ ing nuclear medicine (other t han radiation therapy, code 23 ) 27 Tumor board 28 Hospital rehabilita tion service or clinic 29 Other hospital source (including clinic, NOS or outpatient department, NOS) Case first identified by source other than a reportin g facility covered in the above codes (10-29) 30 Physician -initiated case 40 Consultation -only or pa thology -only report (not abstracted by reporting hospital) 50 Independent (non -hospital) pathology -laboratory report 60 Nursing home -initiated case 70 Coroner's office records review 75 Managed Care Organization (MCO) or insurance records 80 Death certific ate (case identified through death clearance) 85 Out-of-state case sharing 90 Other non -reporting hospital source 95 Quality control review (case initially identified through quality control activities such as casefinding audit of a regional or central reg istry) 99 Unknown Instructions 1. For State reporting, this item may be left blank for cases diagnosed before 2012. 2. Determine where the case was first identified and assign the appropriate code. If the case was first identified at a reporting facilit y (codes 10 -29), assign the code for the earliest source of identifying information (based on patient or specimen contact at the facility). Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Not Required State Registry: *Required Chapter 5 Patient and Hospital Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 89 At the regional or central level, if a hospital and a non -hospital source identified the case independently of each other, the code for the non -hospital source should be assigned. Codes 30 -95 have priority over codes 10 -29. 3. If a death certificate, independent pathology laboratory report, consultation -only report from a hospital, or other report was used to identify a case that was then abstracted from a different source, assign the code for the source that first identified the case, not the source from which it was subsequently abstracted. 4. If a regional or central registry identifies a case and asks a reporting facility to abstract it, assign the code that corresponds to the initial source, not the code that corresponds to the eventual reporting facility. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 90 DATE OF INITIAL DIAG NOSIS Description This is a required 8 -character field for the date this primary cancer was diagnosed by a recognized medical practitioner. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. Rationale The timing for staging and treatment of cancer begins with the date of initial diagnosis for cancer. Codes Month Day Year 01 January 01 Use four -digit year (e.g., 20 15) 02 February 02 blank = Year unknown 03 March 03 04 April ... 05 May ... 06 June 25 07 July 26 08 August ... 09 September 30 10 October 31 11 November blank = Day unknown 12 December blank Month unknown Definition This date refers to the date this cancer was diagnosed by any recognized medical practitioner. The first diagnosis is often clin ical and may never be histologically confirmed. Refer to the list of terms that represent a clinical diagnosis in Chapter 4. Do not change the date of diagnosis when a later biopsy or cytology provides confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Even if confi rmed later, the diagnosis date refers to the date of the first clinical diagnosis and not to the date of confirmation. The date of the first clinical diagnosis provides a more accurate picture of the true survival time from date of diagnosis to death when determining survival statistics. Example 1: A March 12, 201 5 mammogram reveals a mass in the upper -outer quadrant of a patient's right breast compatible with carcinoma. On March 20, 201 5, the patient has an excisional breast biopsy that confirms infiltr ating ductal carcinoma. Date of diagnosis is March 12, 201 5. Example 2: A physician notes a prostate nodule that is suspicious for cancer during a May 11, 201 5 physical examination. On June 15, 201 5, an ultrasound guided needle biopsy of the prostate provides histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma. Date of diagnosis is May 11, 201 5. Instructions a. If the physician says that in retrospect, the patient had cancer at an earlier date, use that earlier date as the date of diagnosis. When a tumor has be en diagnosed as benign and a later medical or pathologic review of previous slides or x -ray films changes this to a diagnosis of a malignancy, the original date of diagnosis is considered to be the date of the initial slide or film review. In other words, the date of diagnosis is backdated. Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 91 Example: A patient has a total abdominal hysterectomy for endometriosis in January 20 14. The patient is admitted with abdominal pain and distention in November 20 15. A laparoscopy with omental biopsy shows metastatic cystadenocarcinoma. Pathologists review the 20 14 hysterectomy specimen. They identify an area of cystadenocarcinoma in the left ovary. Date of diagnosis is January 20 14 (01/_ _/20 14). b. The date of the histology, cytology, or tissue exam should be us ed only if that is the first date the cancer was diagnosed or if the date of initial, clinical diagnosis is unknown and it is the earliest alternative confirmation. c. If the date of initial clinical diagnosis is unknown but the diagnosis has been confirm ed microscopically or through radiologic or other exam, use the date of the histology, cytology, tissue, or radiologic exam, whichever is earlier. In some cases, this may be a date prior to admission. d. Use the date of first cancer -directed therapy as t he date of diagnosis if the cancer -directed therapy was started prior to the definitive diagnosis of cancer. e. The date of death is the date of diagnosis for class of case code 38 (first diagnosed at autopsy) or 49 (death certificate only). f. Use the a ctual date of diagnosis for an in utero diagnosis, for cases diagnosed January 1, 2009 or later. g. For patients diagnosed prior to admission to your facility, record the date of diagnosis from the referring hospital, practitioner, or clinic, if known. I f the date is unknown, record the best estimate as described in paragraph h. below. h. If you do not know the exact date of diagnosis, estimate the date based on available information. Recording an approximate date is preferable to recording an unknown d ate. Every attempt should be made to enter the month and day, even if an estimate is necessary. If there is no basis for approximation, leave the month and day spaces blank. If the year diagnosis cannot be identified, it must be approximated. In that instance, the month and day are unkown. Leave the month and day spaces blank. i. If information is limited to a description, use the following: Descriptive Term Used Date Code Spring April The middle of the year July Fall October Winter Try to dete rmine if this means the beginning of the year (January) or the end of the year (December). Code as indicated. j. If the date of diagnosis cannot be determined at all, leave the date of diagnosis blank and record the reason in Date of Diagnosis Flag . See the Date of Diagnosis Flag section for examples illustrating the relationships among these items. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 92 DATE OF DIAGNOSIS FL AG Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of Diagnosis (NAACCR It em #390). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields. Codes 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (The date of diagnosis is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in the Date of Diagnosis item (NAACCR Item #390). Instructions a. Leave this item b lank if Date of Diagnosis has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of Diagnosis cannot be determined at all. c. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Desc ription Date (Leave unknown portions blank.) Date of Diagnosis Flag Full date known *01/08/201 5 or 201 5/01/08 Blank Month & year known *01/_ _/201 5 or 201 5/01/_ _ Blank Year _/_ _/201 12 * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The computer will store either in the interoperable format. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 93 PRIMARY SITE Description This is a required 4-character field for recording the topography (anatomic site) code that best describes the primary site of malignancy. Metastatic lesions are NEVER coded in this field. Review the entire medical record before ass igning this code. Instructions a. Enter the topography (anatomic site) code from the Topography section of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3)* that best describes the primary site of the tumor. The to pography code should first be located in the Alphabetic Index (pages 105 - 218). Then the specific topography should be located in the Topography - Numerical List section (pages 45 -65). The Alphabetic Index includes both topography and morphology terms. *Note: ICD-O-3 is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . b. Record the primary site as specifically as possible. For example, if the final diagnosis is cancer of the colon, re view other reports in the medical record (e.g., operative note, pathology report, radiology reports, and physician progress notes) to ascertain whether a more specific site within the colon can be identified. c, It is important that the primary site be co ded, rather than a metastatic site. The primary site is the location where the cancer first developed, or the site of origin of a tumor. A metastatic site is the location to which the cancer has spread, or metastasized, from the primary site. Ask your p hysician advisor to identify the primary site or the most definitive site code if the medical record does not contain that information. d. Use the subcategory 8 (C_ _.8) for single tumors that overlap the boundaries of two or more sub -sites and the point of origin is unknown. Example 1: Code overlapping lesion (C10.8) when a large tumor involves both the lateral wall of the oropharynx (C10.2) and the posterior wall of the oropharynx (C10.3) and the point of origin is not stated. Example 2: Code overlappi ng lesion of the bladder (C67.8) when one lesion involves the dome (C67.1) and the lateral wall (C67.2) and the point of origin is not stated. e. Use the subcategory 9 (C_ _.9) for multiple tumors that originate in one organ. Example 1: Code bladder, NOS (C67.9) when multiple lesions arise in both the trigone (C67.0) and lateral wall (C67.2). Example 2: Code lung, NOS (C34.9) when there are lesions in both the right middle lobe (C34.2) and the right lower lobe (C34.3) of lung. Example 3: Code breast, NO S (C50.9) when there are lesions in both the left lower -inner quadrant (C50.3) and the left lower -outer quadrant (C50.5) of a breast. f. If the specific site within an organ cannot be determined, code the primary site to the NOS (Not Otherwise Specified ) category of the organ, organ system, or region. Refer to codes C76.0 to C76.8 (Other and Ill -Defined Sites) before coding C80.9 (Unknown primary site). If an unknown site is later specifically identified, the primary site code should be changed to the correct one. Item Length: 4 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 94 Example: Your hospital clinically diagnoses a patient with carcinomatosis. The registry enters the case as an unknown primary (C80.9), carcinoma, NOS (8010/3), stage of disease unknown. Nine months later a paracentesis shows serous cystaden ocarcinoma. The physician states that the patient has an ovarian primary. Change the primary site to ovary (C56.9), histology to serous cystadenocarcinoma (8441/3), positive exfoliative cytology, no positive histology (2). g. Code leukemia, multiple myeloma, chronic myeloproliferative disorders, and myelodysplastic syndromes to bone marrow (C42.1), because blood cells originate in the bone marrow. Exception: Code myeloid sarcoma (9930/3) to the site of origin. (See ICD -O-3 page 26 for coding rules.) h. Lymphomas For lymphoma diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Database. Use the rules cited below only for lymphoma diagnosed before 2010. (1) Code lymphomas arising in lymphatic tissue or nodes to the site of origin. The lymphatic sites are lymph (lymphatic cells in non-lymphatic organs such as intestine or stomach) to the organ of origin (intestine C26.0, stomach C16.0 -C16.9). (3) Code to lymph nodes, NOS (C77.9) when: The site of origin is not identified for a lymphoma. A patient has diffuse lymphoma and a primar y site is unknown or not specified. A lymphoma mass is identified as retroperitoneal, inguinal, mediastinal, or mesentery, and no specific information is available to indicate what tissue is involved. Bone marrow metastases are present and the prim ary site of a lymphoma is unknown or not specified. (4) Code to lymph nodes, multiple regions (C77.8) when multiple lymph node chains are involved with disease. Do not code a specific lymph node chain from multiple lymph node chains, even if the specific chain was biopsied. (5) Code mycosis fungoides and cutaneous lymphomas to skin (C44._). (6) Carefully identify the origin of the tumor. Do not code the biopsy site or a metastatic site as the primary site. Lymphoma may be present in both an extralymph atic (extranodal) organ and one or more lymph node chain. Code the primary site as the extranodal organ or the lymph nodes, as directed by the managing physician or physician advisor. Note: For purposes of analysis: Analyze the lymphatic sites separately. i. Code Kaposi sarcoma to the site in which it arises. Code to skin (C44.9) if Kaposi sarcoma arises simultaneously in the skin and another site, and the primary site is not identified. Kaposi sarcoma is reported only once. j. Code to skin, NOS (C44.9) if a patient is diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and the primary site is not identified. Each occurrence of melanoma of the skin is a new/separate primary unless a phy sician says otherwise. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 95 k. If any of the following histologies appears with only an ill -defined site description (e.g., abdominal or arm), code it to the tissue in which such tumors arise rather than the ill -defined region (C76._) of the body, which co ntains multiple tissues. Histology ICD-O-3 Codes Code to C49._ Connective, Subcutaneous, and Other vessel tumors 9120 -9170 C49._ Connective, Subcutaneous, and Other Soft Tissues soft part sarcoma 9580 and Cartilage C49._ -8941 C07._ Other and Unspecified Major Salivary Glands l. Rule H on page 21 of ICD-O-3 discusses the topic of Site -Specific Morphology Terms. (1) If the patient record identifies a morphology term for which ICD-O-3 lists a specific to pography code in parentheses, use this code if no definite site is identified or if only a metastatic site is identified. Example: If the diagnosis hepatoma (8170/3) with no other statement about topography, code primary site as C22.0 (liver), since this morphology is always indicative of a primary malignancy in the liver. (2) Some morphology codes list a specific topography code (C_ _ . _) to designate the usual primary site of origin for a particular neoplasm. If the actual primary site is different fr om the topography code listed, use the appropriate topography code of the actual site of origin and ignore the topography code listed next to the morphology code. Example: If a patient has an infiltrating duct carcinoma of the pancreas (8500/3), code the primary as C25.9 (pancreas), even though infiltrating duct carcinoma has C50._ (breast) after it in the Alphabetic Index and the Morphology Numerical section of ICD- O-3, since breast is the usual site in which this histology arises. m. For further guide lines on coding primary site, refer to the Introduction in ICD-O-3 on pages 20 -21. When the record is not clear, the physician should be contacted to determine the most definitive code to be used. Rules for Determining Single vs. Multiple Sites For all solid malignant tumors diagnosed January 1, 2007 or later, use the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules . Use the rules cited below only for cases diagnosed before 2007. a. A difference in the third character of the ICD-O-3 topography code desi gnates a separate site, with the exceptions listed under paragraph b. below. Example: Separate sites and separate primaries: Lower gum (C0 3.1) Anterior floor of the mouth (C0 4.0) Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 96 b. The following table shows ICD-O-3 site groupings that are to be regard ed as one primary site when determining multiple primaries. These sites used to be in the same 3 -digit site code group in ICD-O-1, but have been put into different 3 -digit site groups in ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3. The groups are considered to be the same prima ry site in order to make valid historical comparisons between data collected under ICD-O-1 and data collected under ICD-O-2 and ICD -O-3. ICD-O-3 CODES SITE GROUPINGS C01 C02 Base of tongue Other and unspecified parts of tongue C05 C06 Palate Other and u nspecified parts of mouth C07 C08 Parotid gland biliary tract C30 C31 Nasal cavity Uterine adnexa C60 C63 Penis Other and unspecified C65 C66 C68 Kidney Renal C74 C75 Adrenal gland Other endocrine glands and related structures Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 97 Example 1: A patient is diagnosed at Hospital A with a malignant tumor of the lateral wall of the oropharynx (C10.2). The patient is then referred to Hospital B, where fu rther assessment reveals the tumor site of origin to be the tonsillar pillar (C09.1). When both of these cases are received at the State Registry, they will be consolidated into one cancer case, with tonsil (C09.1) being listed as the primary site. Examp le 2: A patient is diagnosed at Hospital A with a malignant tumor of the labia majora (C51.0). The patient is then referred to Hospital B, which reports the primary site as vagina (C52.9). To determine the primary site, review the pathology reports and c onsult with the attending physicians, surgeon, or registry advisor to identify the origin of the tumor. If there is a single lesion involving both sites and a site of origin cannot be determined, code to overlapping lesion of female genital organs (C57.8) . If the tumor involves separate lesions and the site of origin cannot be determined, code to female genital tract, NOS (C57.9). These codes are for neoplasms of female genital organs whose point of origin cannot be assigned to any one of the categories C51 through C57.7, C58. c. A single lesion (tumor) is one primary even if the lesion crosses site boundaries. Example: A patient has a large maxillary sinus tumor that extends into the sphenoid sinus. This is one primary: Maxillary sinus (C31.0). d. Sites may be anatomically separate and independent but are assigned to the same ICD-O-3 topography code. These should be considered sub -sites of the same organ and recorded as a single site. Example: Ulna (C40.0) and radius (C40.0) are treated as one site and one primary. e. A difference in the fourth character of the ICD-O-3 topography code designates a sub -site of the same organ and is considered one site, with the exceptions listed below. Example 1: Soft palate (C05. 1) and uvula (C05. 2) are treated as one site and one primary, either overlapping lesion of sub -sites of palate (C05.8) or palate, NOS (C05.9). Example 2: Trigone of the bladder (C67. 0) and lateral wall of the bladder (C67. 2) are treated as one site and one primary, either overlapping lesio n of sub -sites of the bladder (C67.8) or bladder, NOS (C67.9). Exception: A difference in the fourth character of the ICD-O-3 topography code designates a separate site only for the following site groups: Colon (see exception for polyps below) C18.0 C72.0 - C72.8, Behavior Code /0 or /1 and other parts of central nervous system Example: Separate sites and separate primaries: Sigm oid colon (C18. 7) Transverse colon (C18. 4) Note: A non -specific site code, such as C18.9 (colon, NOS), and a specific site code, such as C18.2 (ascending colon), generally would not be recorded as separate sites for a single patient. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 98 Exception: Colon Polyps (1) Simultaneous lesions of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma and polyps (adenoma or adenomatous polyp) in one segment of the colon are a single primary. Example 1: A physician detects two lesions in the same segment of the colon. The pathology identif ies the lesions as an adenocarcinoma (8140/3) and adenomatous polyp (8210/3) is an earlier stage of disease than a frank adenocarc inoma. Example 2: Both an adenocarcinoma (8140/3) and an (in situ or invasive) in a(n) adenomatous polyp (8210) or an adenocarcinoma in a (tubulo)villous adenoma (8261, 8263) arise simultaneously in the same segment of the colon or the rectum. Code as adenocarcinoma (8140/3). Example 3: Both a carcinoma (8010/3) and a carcinoma (in situ or invasive) in a(n) (adenomatous) polyp (8210) arise in the same segment of the colon within two months of diagnosis. Code as carci noma (8010/3). (2) Polyps may be present in more than one segment of the colon. If the diagnosis reads adenocarcinoma in multiple polyps, it is one primary, colon, NOS (C18.9). Familial polyposis is a genetic disease characterized by polyps that incr ease in numbers and may cover the mucosal surface of the colon. The benign disease usually develops into adenocarcinoma in adenomatous polyposis coli or adenocarcinoma in multiple adenomatous Patients the histologies adenocarcinoma in aden omatous coli (8220/3) and adenocarcinoma in multiple adenomatous polyps (8221/3) have a different disease process than those patients with frank adenocarcinomas of the colon or typical colon polyps. If multiple segments of the colon, or the c olon and rectosigmoid, or the colon, rectosigmoid and rectum are involved with adenocarcinoma in adenomatous polyposis coli or adenocarcinoma in multiple adenomatous polyps, it is a single primary. Code the primary site to colon, NOS (C18.9). f. Paired O rgan Sites Each side of a paired organ is considered a separate site unless a physician determines one side is metastatic from the other. Exception 1: The following are always single primaries: Simultaneous bilateral involvement of the ovaries with a si ngle histology Simultaneous bilateral retinoblastomas Simultaneous bilateral Wilms tumors (Diagnoses that occur at the same time or within two months of each other are considered simultaneous or synchronous.) Exception 2: Disregard laterality for dete rmination of single or multiple primaries for malignant (behavior or /2 or /3) tumors of the meninges (C70._); brain (C71._); and spinal cord, cranial nerves, and other parts of central nervous system (C72._). Coding Tip: The Primary Site code must be be tween 000 and 809. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 99 LATERALITY Description This is a required 1 -character field for recording a code that identifies the side of a paired organ or the side of the body on which the tumor originated. Laterality refers to the primary site only and sh ould be coded independently for each primary. Metastatic involvement is not coded. Codes 0 Not a paired organ or site; not applicable; unknown primary site 1 Right side is origin of primary 2 Left side is origin of primary 3 Only one side is involved; ri ght or left origin unspecified 4 Bilateral involvement, side of origin unknown; stated to be a single primary. Includes: Both ovaries involved simultaneously with a single histology Bilateral retinoblastomas Bilateral Wilms tumors 5 Paired site: midline tumor 9 Paired site, but no information on laterality Instructions a. If only one histologic type is reported and if both sides of a paired site are involved within two months of diagnosis, determine whether the patient had one or two independent primari es. Refer to the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules . (1) If there are two primaries, prepare two abstracts, recording the appropriate laterality and extent of disease for each. (2) If there is only one primary (originated on one side and m etastasized to the other), prepare a single abstract and code laterality according to the side where the primary originated. If it is not possible to determine the side where the primary originated, record laterality code 4 (bilateral involvement, lateral origin unknown). b. Record laterality for unknown primary site (C80.9) as 0 (not a paired organ or site). c. The following list identifies the paired organs or paired sites. For all sites that are not on the list, record laterality code 0 (not a paired organ; not applicable). The FORDS laterality rules permit coding non-paired sites as right or left but the State Registry does not support this. Use laterality code 1 - 9 only for the following sites, except as noted. The listing includes only major categories. Code laterality for all subheadings included in ICD-O-3 under these headings, unless specifically excluded. Exclusions should be coded as 0.

Use code 0 if the carina (a non -paired organ) is the primary site. e. Text Documentation Include laterality for applicable sites when recording the description of the primary site in the text area of the abstract. Staff at the State Cancer Registry will then know whether to override (bypass) an edit that identifies an inconsistency between site and laterality codes. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 102 DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMAT ION Description This is a required 1 -character fie ld for recording the best method of diagnostic confirmation of the cancer being reported at any time in the patient's history. It indicates whether at any time during the patient's disease course there was microscopic confirmation of the morphology of thi s cancer. Rationale This item is an indicator of the precision of diagnosis. The percentage of solid tumors that are clinically diagnosed only is an indication of whether casefinding procedures include sources outside of pathology reports. Complete case finding must include both clinically and pathologically confirmed cases. Codes and Definitions for Solid Tumors (all tumors except M9590 -9992) 1 Positive histology Histologic confirmation (tissue microscopically Positive cytology Cytologic confirmation (no tissue microscopically examined; fluid cells microscopically examined). 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Microscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if the cells were from histology or cytology. 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study A clinical diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests/marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for cancer. Examples include alpha -fetoprotein for liver cancer . Elevated PSA is not diagnostic of cancer. If the physician uses the PSA as a basis for diagnosing prostate cancer with no other work -up, record as code 5. 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation The tumor was visualized during a surgical or endoscopic procedure only with no tissu e resected for microscopic examination. 7 Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation The malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only. Diagnosed by radiology , including ultrasound, computed (axial) tomography (CT or CAT scans), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) The malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. Refer to ambiguous terminology in Chapter 4. 9 Unknown whe ther or not microscopically confirmed A statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no statement of how the cancer was diagnosed (usually nonanalytic). Instructions for Coding Solid Tumors (all tumors except M9590 -9992) a. The codes are in priority order, with code 1 having the highest priority. Always code the diagnostic method with the lower numeric value when the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed with multiple methods. Change this data item to the lower (higher priority) c ode if a more definitive method confirms the diagnosis at any time during the course of the disease. Example: A chest x -ray dated 02/01/20 15 diagnoses a probable lung cancer. The patient refuses a diagnostic work -up. The registry codes the diagnostic co nfirmation to radiography (code 7). The patient allows a lymph node biopsy on 04/12/20 15. The biopsy confirms small cell carcinoma. Change the diagnostic confirmation code to positive histology (code 1). Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 103 b. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy, dilatation and curettage (D & C), bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow aspiration (bone marrow FNA). c. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells. The cells may be recovered from peritonea l fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical and vaginal smears, or from paraffin -block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid. d. Assign code 4 when the case is reported as microscopically confirmed , but no information is provided about the method (histology, cytology). This may include cases where the medical record or physician states the histology type, but there is no path report in the record. e. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not me ntioned in preceding codes. A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplassms are diagnosed by tests of exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clinical presentation. f. If diagnosis was confirmed at another hospital, enter the code for how the other hospital confirmed the diagnosis, if known, unless further confirmation with a lower code occurred at your facility. (e.g., If th e other hospital performed a mammogram and your hospital performed a biopsy, code the biopsy.) If unknown, enter code 9. g. Some cytology specimens contain tissue. Some pathology/tissue specimens contain only cells or fluid aspiration. Read the report carefully to determine if the pathologist examined cells or tissue and code accordingly. Codes and Definitions for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms (M9590 -9992) ve confirmation (no tissue microscopically examined; fluid cells microscopically examined). 3 Positive histology plus Positive immunophenotyping and/or Positive genetic studies Histology is positive for cancer, and there are also positi ve immunophenotyping and/or genetic test results. For example, bone marrow examination i s positive for acute myeloid leukemia (9861/3). Genetic testing shows AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) (9871/3). 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Microscopic confirmation is all that is known. It is unknown if the cells were from histology or cytology. 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study A clinical diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests/marker studies that are clinically diagnostic f or cancer. 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation The tumor was visualized during a surgical or endoscopic procedure only with no tissue resected for microscopic examination. 7 Radiography and other imaging techniques without microscop ic confirmation The malignancy was reported by the physician from an imaging technique report only. 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) The malignancy was reported by the physician in the medical record. Refer to ambiguous terminology in Ch apter 4. 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed A statement of malignancy was reported in the medical record, but there is no statement of how the cancer was diagnosed (usually nonanalytic). Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 104 Instructions for Coding Hematopoietic and Lymphoi d Tumors (M9590 -9992) a. There is no priority hierarchy for coding Diagnostic Confirmation for hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors. Most commonly, the specific histologic type is diagnosed by immunophenotyping or genetic testing. See the Hematopoietic Data base (DB) for information on the definitive diagnostic confirmation for specific types of tumors. b. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on tissue specimens from biopsy, frozen section, surgery, autopsy or bone marrow specimens from aspi ration or biopsy. c. For leukemia only, assign code 1 when the diagnosis is based only on the complete blood count (CBC), white blood count (WBC) or peripheral blood smear. Do not use code 1 if the diagnosis was based on immunophenotyping or genetic test ing using tissue, bone marrow, or blood. d. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on cytologic examination of cells (rather than tissue) including but not limited to spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical or vaginal smears, or from paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal , pleural, or peritoneal fluid. These methods are rarely used for hematopoietic or lymphoid tumors. e. Assign code 3 when there are a histology positive for cancer and positive immunophenotyping and/or positive genetic testing results. Do not use code 3 for neoplasms diagnosed prior to January 1, 2010 f. Assign code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for that specific cancer, but no positive histologic confirmation. g. Assign code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on the surgeon's report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy or from gross autopsy findings without tissue or cytological findings. h. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding codes . A number of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplassms are diagnosed by tests of exclusion where the tests for the disease are equivocal and the physician makes a clinical diagnosis based on the information from the equivocal tests and the patient's clinical presentation. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 105 HISTOLOGY Description This is a required 4 -character field for recording histologic (cell) type. Instructions For all solid malignant tumors diagnosed January 1, 2007 or later, use the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules. For lymphoma diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Database. a. Enter the five -digit code from the Morphology Section of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition, 2000 ( ICD-O-3)* that best describes the histologic (cell) type and behavior of this primary. First locate the morphology cod e in the Alphabetic Index (pages 105 - 218). Then locate the specific morphology code in the Morphology of Neoplasms - Numerical List section (pages 69 - 104). Follow the coding rules outlined in ICD-O-3 on pages 20 - 40. *Note: ICD-O-3 is effective f or cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . b. In the Alphabetic Index, all morphology codes are identified by an M - preceding the code number. Do not record the M on the abstract . Do not recor d the virgule (/ - slash ) on the abstract . All morphology codes begin with an 8 or 9. Example: Infiltrating duct carcinoma is code M -8500/3. Record code 85003 on the abstract (paper or computer). Note: Subsequent references to morphology codes will be stated without the preceding M - in the code. c. Review all pathology reports that describe the primary site before coding histology and behavior. Read each pathology report in its entirety. Although reports from the definitive cancer -directed surgery is usually the best, sometimes all of the positive tissue is removed at biopsy. Example: The pathology report from a skin biopsy states malignant melanoma, NOS. At wide excision, no residual tumor was found. Code the histology from the biopsy report as malignant melanoma, NOS (8720/3). d. If no tissue or cytology specimen was obtained for a diagnosis of malignancy, but a recognized medical practitioner makes a clinical diagnosis of cancer, malignancy, malignant tumor, or malignant neoplasm, code to 8000/ 3 (Neoplasm, malignant). If the physician is more specific, use the more specific morphology code. The codes for cancer, NOS (8000/3) and carcinoma, NOS (8010/3) are not interchangeable. If the physician says that the patient has carcinoma, code carcin oma, NOS (8010/3). e. Code the final pathologic diagnosis. Exception: At times, the final diagnosis is Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), e.g., carcinoma, NOS; melanoma, NOS; sarcoma, NOS; lymphoma, NOS; or malignant tumor, NOS. Code the histology from th e microscopic description or comment if it describes a more specific histology (higher ICD-O-3 code) such as adenocarcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, spindle cell sarcoma, etc. Record the best information found. Item Length: 4 Data Type: Numer ic ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 106 Example: The final pathologic diagnosis is car cinoma (8010/3) of the prostate. The microscopic diagnosis states adenocarcinoma (8140/3) of the prostate, grade III. The more specific diagnosis, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, grade III (8140/33), should be coded. f. Lymphomas may be classified by t he Rappaport classification or the Working Formulation. If both systems are used to classify the disease, the term used to describe the lymphoma may differ, and the Working Formulation term should take precedence ( ICD-O-3, pp. 13 -18). Example: In the Pat hology report, the Working Formulation describes malignant lymphoma, large cell, immunoblastic (9684/3). The Rappaport classification diffuse, histiocytic (9680/3). Use code 9684/3. Histology Coding Rules For all solid mali gnant tumors diagnosed January 1, 2007 or later, use the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules. For lymphoma diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Database . a. When multiple terms describe a single histology, record the numerically highest code. Example: In the diagnosis transitional cell epidermoid carcinoma, transitional cell (8120/3) and epidermoid (8070/3) are both adjectives describing carcinoma. R ecord transitional cell (8120/3). Note: If the diagnosis states transitional cell and epidermoid carcinoma, transitional cell with areas of epidermoid carcinoma, or transitional cell with a focus of epidermoid carcinoma, the diagnosis would be inte rpreted as one of mixed or multiple histologies. b. The ICD-O-3 morphology code has five digits (e.g., 8500/3). (1) When the first three digits of the ICD-O-3 morphology codes are identical , the lesions are the same histology . Record the numerically hig her code, as it is usually a more specific histology. Example: A stomach biopsy is interpreted as adenocarcinoma, NOS ( 8140/3). The pathology from the resection identifies tumor as linitis plastica ( astica ( 8142/3). (Refer to Rule K in the Introduction of ICD-O-3 on page 21 for more information.) (2) When the first three digits of the ICD-O-3 morphology code are different , the histologies are not the same. These lesion(s) have a mixed or multiple h istology. Code using the rules under paragraph d. below, Coding Mixed or Multiple Histologies. Exception 1: Lymphatic and hematopoietic disease. Use the guidelines in Appendix E -2 (Prepared by: SEER Program, NCI, 02/28/2001 ) to determine which histol ogies represent single or multiple primaries. Exception 2: If one malignancy is stated to be carcinoma, NOS; adenocarcinoma, NOS; sarcoma, NOS; or melanoma, NOS and the second lesion is a more specific term, such as large cell carcinoma, mucinous adenoca rcinoma, spindle cell sarcoma, or superficial spreading melanoma, consider this to be a single histology. Note: This rule applies when a nonspecific morphology and a specific morphology exist in a single lesion. Code as a single primary with the more sp ecific morphology. Exception 3: Code the following as single primaries with a single histology, even though the first three digits of the ICD-O-3 morphology codes differ: Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 107 Bladder lesions with morphology codes 8120 -8130 (transitional cell and papillary tr ansitional cell carcinomas) should be coded 8130/3, the combination code; Thyroid lesions with morphology codes 8260/3 (papillary carcinoma) and 8330/3 (follicular carcinoma) should be coded 8340/3, the combination code; Within each breast, lesions with mo rphology codes 8500/3 (ductal carcinoma) and 8520/3 (lobular carcinoma). Code such breast lesions to the combination code 8522/3. Use the combination code even if one of the lesions is in situ and the other invasive. Exception 4: Use the following for the determination of single or multiple primaries of non - malignant (behavior /0 or /1) primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors (C70.0 - C72.9, C75.1 -C75.3). Two histologies appearing in the same grouping in the following table are the same . Code the more specific histology. A histology in the table and a histology not in the table that have the same first three digits are the same . Code its histology according to the rules for mixed histologies. Two histologies not appearing in the table but having the same first three digits are the same . Code its histology according to the digit of the ICD-O-3 morphology code is the behavior code. The behavior code is not used to determi ne multiple histologies. Lesion(s) may have a single histology with invasive and in situ components. This is a single histology . Code the behavior of the invasive component. If a single lesion has multiple histologies, one invasive and one in situ, cod e the invasive histology, even if the histology code for the in situ component is higher. Note: This rule is also used for multiple lesions with the same histology. One lesion may be invasive and another lesion in situ, or each of the lesions may have i nvasive and in situ components. Example 1: Pathology of a breast mass shows infiltrating ductal carcinoma (8500/3) with a large intraductal component (8500/2). This is a single histology. Code the histology as infiltrating ductal (8500) and the malignan t behavior (/3). Example 2: A patient has a colectomy and the pathology identifies two lesions in the sigmoid colon. The first lesion is an invasive adenocarcinoma (8140/3) and the second lesion is an adenocarcinoma in situ (8140/2). This is a single hi stology. Code the histology and behavior as adenocarcinoma, NOS (8140/3). Exception: Two primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors (C70.0 -C72.9, C75.1 - C75.3) in which one is malignant (behavior of /2 or /3) and one is non -malignant (behavio r of /0 or /1) are always separate primaries, regardless of timing. c. Cancers are considered simultaneous if diagnosed within two months of each other. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 108 d. Coding Mixed or Multiple Histologies A single lesion with mixed or multiple histologic types is one primary. To code mixed or multiple histologies with the same behavior existing in one primary, use the following guidelines in this priority order: (1) Select a combination code Example 1: The pathology report of a breast cancer describes mixed duct al (8500/3) and lobular carcinoma (8520/3). Record the combination code ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma (8522/3). Example 2: The pathology report of a carcinoma of the cervix describes mixed adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Record th e combination code adenosquamous carcinoma (8560/3). (2) Code the histology that comprises the majority of the tumor. Phrases such as predominantly and with features of are often used to identify the principal histology. Example: A lung lesion is predominantly squamous cell with focal areas of bronchiolo -alveolar adenocarcinoma (8250/3). A combination code does not exist. Record the predominant histology, squamous cell carcinoma (8070/3). Note: The terms with foci of, area s of, or elements of describe minor areas of involvement. Do not code the histologies described by these terms unless there is a combination code. (3) Code the histology with the highest ICD-O-3 morphology code. Example: A patient with bladder cancer is diagnosed with mixed transitional cell carcinoma (8120/3) and epidermoid carcinoma (8070/3). There is no combination code for these histologies, and the pathology report does not identify a predominant histology. Record the highest morphology code, t ransitional cell carcinoma (8120/3). e. Determining Multiple Primaries For all solid malignant tumors diagnosed January 1, 2007 or later, use the SEER Multiple Primary and Histology Coding Rules. For lymphoma diagnosed 2010 and later use the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Manual and the Hematopoietic Database. Enter the case into the database as a single or multiple primary as documented by the physician. If physician determination is absent or unavailable, use the fol lowing guidelines, which are based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). (1) Determine whether there is a single lesion or multiple lesions. (2) Decide whether the tumor(s) involve a single site or multiple sites. Use t he rules documented in the section for Primary Site in this chapter . (3) Decide whether the tumor(s) are a single histology or mixed/multiple histologies. Follow the Histology Coding Rules described above in this section. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 109 (4) Use the following table to decide whether the case should be abstracted as a single primary or multiple primaries. (Use only for cases diagnosed prior to 01/01/2007.) LESIONS SITE(S) HISTOLOGY VARIABLES PRIMARY Single Single Single Single Single Mixed/multiple Single Single or multiple Single Single Different behavior codes, in situ (2) and invasive (3) Single Same as previous site Same as previous histology Within two months of diagnosis Recurrence of the original primary Same as previous site Same as previous histolo gy More than two months after diagnosis New primary unless physician states it is recurrent or metastatic. Exceptions: Basal, prostate; non - malignant intracrania l & CNS tumors. Multiple Single Single Simultaneous Single Multiple Single Simultaneous Multiple unless physician states it is metastatic. Exceptions: Ovaries (simultaneous bilateral), retinoblastoma, and Wilms tumor are single primaries. Single Mixe d/multiple Simultaneous Single Single Multiple (Each tumor has a different histology.) Simultaneous Multiple Exceptions: Breast (lobular and ductal); bladder (transitional and papillary); thyroid (papillary and follicular). Multiple Multiple Simultane ous Multiple Example 1: Single lesion, single site, single histology, different behavior The pathology report from the biopsy of a cervical lesion identified invasive carcinoma (8010/3) and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (8070/2). This is a single hi stology, because carcinoma, NOS is a nonspecific morphology and squamous cell carcinoma is a specific morphology. Code the more specific histology and the invasive behavior (8070/3). Example 2: Multiple lesions, single site, single histology, diagnosed w ithin two months A patient has a colectomy in August 2002 for an adenocarcinoma (8140/3). The physician biopsies the anastomotic site in September 2002. The pathologic examination confirms adenocarcinoma. This is a recurrence of the original tumor and should not be reported again. Example 3: Multiple lesions, single site, single histology, diagnosed more than two months apart A patient has surgery for a squamous cell carcinoma (8070/3) of the hard palate (C05 .0) in January 2003. The physician biops ies another hard palate lesion in April 2003. Pathology confirms squamous cell carcinoma. There is no physician statement identifying the disease as recurrent or metastatic. This is a new primary and should be reported. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 110 Example 4: Multiple lesions, sin gle site, multiple histologies, diagnosed more than two months apart, Exception A transitional cell carcinoma (8120/3) of the trigone of the bladder (C67.0) was diagnosed in January of 2002. In May of 2003, a papillary transitional cell carcinoma (8130/ 3) of the bladder neck (C67.5) was diagnosed. Only the first bladder tumor would be reported, using a primary site code of C67.0 and a morphology code of 8120/3. Example 5: Multiple lesions, multiple sites, single histology, simultaneous The patient ha s masses in the esophagus and lung. Pathology identifies both lesions as squamous cell carcinoma, NOS (8070/3). Pathology does not identify either lesion as metastatic. There are two primaries: Esophagus (C15.9) and lung (C34.9). Example 6: Multiple l esions, single site, multiple histologies, simultaneous A patient has an adenocarcinoma (8140/3) at the gastroesophageal junction and a non - Hodgkin lymphoma (9591/3) in the body of stomach. The patient has two primaries. Example 7: Multiple lesions, mu ltiple sites, multiple histologies, simultaneous A patient has a squamous cell carcinoma (8070/3) of the soft palate (C05.1) and an adenocarcinoma (8140/3) in Barrett esophagus (C15.9). The patient has two primaries. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 111 BEHAVIOR Description The fif th digit, which follows the slash after the histology code, is the behavior code. Behavior codes are listed in ICD-O-3 page 66 and below. The State Cancer Registry requires only tumors ending in a fifth digit behavior code of /2 or /3 to be reported. Note: ICD-O-3 is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 forward. Continue to use ICD-O-2 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . Codes /0 Benign ( do not report to State Registry ) Exception: Benign neoplasms of the brain and central nervous system diagn osed January 1, 2004 or later should be reported. /1 Uncertain whether benign or malignant ( do not report to State Registry ) Borderline malignancy Low malignant potential Exceptions: Juvenile astrocytoma, listed as 9421/1 in ICD -O-3, is required and sh ould be reported as 9421/3; Borderline neoplasms of the brain and central nervous system diagnosed January 1, 2004 or later should be reported. /2 Carcinoma in situ ( report to Noninfiltrating Noninvasive neoplasia, grade III; and basal cell cell carcinoma of nongenital skin are not reportable if diagnosed 01/01/2003 or later. /3 Malignant, primary site ( report to State Registry ) /6 Malignant, metastatic site ( do not use) Malignant, secondary site /9 Malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site ( do not use) Instructions for Behavior Code a. Since tumor registries include only primary, and not me tastatic sites, behavior codes 6 and 9 should never be used. They are listed here for informational purposes only. b. Behavior codes /0 (benign) and /1 (uncertain or borderline) are not reportable to the State Cancer Registry unless listed under exceptio ns above. However, at the discretion of the cancer committee, a hospital may choose to collect some of these cases, which are called reportable -by-agreement. The behavior codes are listed here for informational purposes only. c. The behavior code /6 i ndicates a metastatic site. If the only specimen available for diagnosis was from a metastatic site, code the histologic type of the metastatic site and code a /3 for the behavior code. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 112 If the primary site is known, record the applicable topography code . If the primary site is unknown, the topography code should be C80.9. Example: If the patient had a biopsy of the lung showing metastatic adenocarcinoma (8140/6), the primary site is unknown (C80.9). Code the histology to adenocarcinoma (8140/3). d. In situ is a concept based upon histologic evidence. Therefore, clinical evidence alone cannot justify the usage of this term. If the fifth digit in Histology/Behavior is coded /2 (in situ), diagnostic confirmation should be 1, 2, or 4. The following terms are synonymous with in situ (fifth digit behavior code /2): (Adeno)carcinoma in an adenomatous polyp with no invasion of III - intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III (C21.1, 8077/2) Bowen disease (8081/2) Cervical intraepithel ial neoplasia, grade III (C53._, 8077/2) High grade in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Confirm that the pathologist use s high grade dysplasia for in situ in the GI tract.) Hutchinson melanotic NOS (C44._, NOS (carcinoma) Intraepithelial, NOS (carcinoma) Involvement up to but not including the No stromal involvement or invasion (If there is stromal invasion, it is not in situ.) Papillary, noninfiltrating or III (C52.9, 8077/2) neoplasia, grade III (C51._, 8077/2) e. Code behavior as malignant (/3) if any malignant invasion is present, no matter how limited. Any pathologic diag nosis qualified as microinvasive is not considered carcinoma in situ and behavior should be coded as malignant (/3). Example: The pathology report from a hysterectomy reads carcinoma in situ (8010/2) of the cervix with microinvasion. Code to invasi ve carcinoma (8010/3). f. Code behavior as malignant (/3) if any malignant metastasis to nodes or tissue beyond the primary is present. g. Gastro -intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and thymomas are frequently non -malignant. However, they must be assigned a behavior code of 3 and abstracted if they have multiple foci, metastasis or positive lymph nodes. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 113 GRADE/DIFFERENTIATIO N Description This is a required 1 -character field to record the ICD-O-3 code for the histologic grading or differentiation of solid tumors. Differentiation describes the tumor's resemblance to the normal tissue from which it arose. Well differentiated (Grade I) is the most like normal tissue. Grade/differentiation is the sixth digit of the histology code. For lymphomas and le ukemias, this sixth digit describes the lineage or phenotype of the cell. Codes for Solid Tumors Code Description 1 Well differentiated; differentiated, NOS 2 Moderately differentiated, moderately well differentiated, intermediate differentiation 3 Poorly differentiated , dedifferentiated 4 Undifferentiated, anaplastic 9 Grade not determined, not stated, or not applicable; unknown primaries; high -grade dysplasia. Codes for Hematopoietic and Lymph oid Neoplasms Code Description 5 T-cell, T -precursor 6 B-cell, pre-B, B-precursor 7 Null cell, non T -non B 8 N K (n atural killer cell ) (effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/1995 and after) 9 Cell indicator not determined, not stated, or not applicable . Instructions for Hematopoietic lymphoid neoplasms , refer to the Grade of Tumor Rules in the current Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Manual and Database at http://seer.cancer.gov/too ls/heme/Hematopoietic_Instructions_and_Rules/ . General Instructions for Solid Tumor Grade The instructions in this manual for coding solid tumor grade are based on the Instructions for Coding Grade for 2014+ at http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/grade/ . a. Code the grade or differentiation from the pathology report prior to any neoadjuvant treatment. If there is no pathology report prior to neoadjuvant treatment, assign code 9. b. Code the grade or diffe rentiation from the pathologic examination of the primary tumor, not from metastatic sites. Example: The pathology diagnosis for a biopsy of supraclavicular lymph nodes is anaplastic adenocarcinoma compatible with lung primary. The histology/behavior/g rade would be coded 8140/39 because the biopsy was not from the primary site. c. If the primary site is unknown, code the grade/differentiation as unknown (9). d. Code the grade (6th digit) shown below for specific histo logic terms that imply a grade. Carcinoma, undifferentiated anaplastic (8021/34) -Leydig cell tumor, differentiated (8631/33) Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 114 Sertoli -Leydig cell tum or, e. Code the grade for in sit u lesions if the information is available. Do not code grade for dysplasia, such as high-grade dysplasia. If the lesion is both invasive and in situ, code only the invasive portion. If the invasive component grade is unknown, assign code 9. f. If more than one grade of tumor is specified, code to the highest grade, even if the highest grade is only a focus. Example: Code moderately to poorly differentiated carcinoma to poorly differentiated (3). Moderately differentiated is coded 2, and poorly differe ntiated is coded 3. Use the higher code. g. Do not use the WHO grade to code this data item. For primary tumors of the brain and spinal cord diagnosed 01/01/2004 and later, record the WHO grade in the data item CS Site -Specific Factor 1 . h. When there is no pathology or cytology confirmation , code the grade of a tumor documented in CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) , or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) report . Brain tumors can be graded using these methods. Prioritization Rules for Solid Tumo r Grade Code grade using the first system that applies in the following priority order: 1) Special grade systems (See the instructions and conversion tables in section a below for breast, prostate, sarcomas, and kidney parenchyma .). Do not use the special grade system tables for any other groups. 2) Differentiation (See conversion tables in section b below for 2 -, 3-, or 4 - grade systems.) 3) Nuclear grade (See conversion tables in section b below for 2 -, 3-, or 4 - grade systems.) Note: If a 2 -, 3-, or 4 - grade system was used, code from the conversion tables below, even if it not clear whether it is a differentiation or nuclear grade. 4) Terminology (See the conversion table in section c below for coding from terminology only.) a. Special Grade Systems Breas t (excluding lymphomas) Use the conversion table below to code grade for breast using the Bloom -Richardson (BR) or Nottingham score or grade. A BR score takes precendence over a BR grade. BR may also be called: Bloom -Richardson score, the Nottingham modification of Bloom - Richardson score, Nottingham modification of Scarff -Bloom -Richardson, Nottingham -Tanovus grade, or Nottingham grade. Code usin g the highest score if multiple scores are reported, either in multiple pathology reports for the same primary or different scores for multiple tumors abstracted as a single primary. Exclude scores for specimens taken after neoadjuvant treatment was start ed. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 115 BR Conversion Table for Invasive Breast Carcinoma Grade Code Description 1 BR score of 3, 4 or 5 2 BR score of 6 or 7 3 BR score of 8 or 9 1 Low grade, Bloom -Richardson (BR) grade 1, score not stated 2 Medium (intermediate) grade, BR grade 2, sc ore not stated 3 High grade, BR grade 3, score not given If there is no BR or Nottingham score stated and it is not clear that a stated grade is a BR or Nottingham grade, do not use the conversion table above. Use the next system that applies from the solid tumor prioritization rules listed above. Prostate (excluding lymphomas ) For prostate cancers, code the tumor grade using the highest Gleason score reported, regardless of whether it is from a biopsy, TURP, prostatectomy or autopsy. Exclude scores f or specimens taken after neoadjuvant treatment was started. Gleason Pattern Gleason grading is based on a 5 -component system, based on 5 histologic patterns. The most predominant pattern and second most predominant pattern are identified and stated in th e pathology report. If the primary pattern is 3 and and the secondary pattern is 4, Gleason pattern is 3 + 4. Gleason Score The primary and secondary Gleason patterns are added together to create Gleason score. If Gleason patterns are 3 + 4, the Gleason score is 7. Rules for when only a single number for Gleason is stated: If the number is less than or equal to 5, and not specified as the score, do not use the information. If the number is greater than 5, assume that is is a score and use it. If the rep ort states a specific number out of a total of 10, the specific number is the score. (e.g. , for Gleason 3/10, the score would be 3.) Gleason Conversion Table for Prostate Cancer (revised for cases diagnosed 2014 and forward) Grade Code Gleason Score (sum of primary & secondary patterns) 1 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, or 6 2 7 3 8, 9, or 10 Note: Gleason score 7 was moved from Grade code 2 to 3 , effective for cases diagnosed from 01/01/2003 through 1 2/31/2013 . Gleason scores 5 and 6 were moved from Grade code 2 t o 1, effective for cases diagnosed on or after 01/01/2014. Kidney Parenchyma (excluding lymphomas ) For kidney cancers, code the tumor grade using the Fuhrman Nuclear Grade. It is a direct conversion from Fuhrman Nuclear Grade to tumor grade as shown belo w. Do not use for kidney renal pelvis.

Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording tex t about the site and histology. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions a. Record a brief, but s pecific, description of the site of origin for the tumor being reported. Include laterality if applicable. Use standard abbreviations to conserve space if necessary and if each abbreviation has a clear meaning and only one interpretation. Example 1: Upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of right (RT) breast. Example 2: Splenic flexure of colon. b. Record a brief, but specific, description of the histologic type, behavior, and grade of the tumor being reported. Use standard abbreviations to conserve space if neces sary and if each abbreviation has a clear meaning and only one interpretation. Example 1: Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma (ca). Example 2: Moderately well differentiated (MWD) adenocarcinoma in adenomatous differentiated nodular. Example 4: Superficial spreading melanoma. Example 5: Astrocytoma, stage III. Example 6: Adult T -cell leukemia. c. In the Description of Diagnosis or the RMCDS Dx Procedure Pathology field, record any additional pertinent information from cytology and histopathology reports. In RMCDS it is not necessary to repeat information recorded in the primary site and histology text fields. Include, as applicable: Date(s) of procedure(s) Type(s) of tissue speci men(s) Gross tumor size Extent of tumor spread Involvement of resection margins Information regarding lymph -vascular invasion (LVI) Number of lymph nodes involved and examined Differential diagnoses considered and any ruled out or favored. d. Facilities u sing paper abstracts to report should also attach copies of medical record documentation (such as pathology reports and operative reports) that identifies the site and histology information for the primary being reported. However, text describing the site and histology must be completed by all reporting facilities.

Right justify and enter leading zeros. Note: Code this data item for cases diagnosed on or before December 31, 2003. For cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004 code tumor size using CS Tumor Size. Codes 000 No mass or tumor found; e.g., a tumor of a stated primary site is not found, but the tumor has metastasized. 001-988 Exact size in millimeters; for melanoma, depth in hundredths of millimeters. 989 989 millimeters or larger; melanomas greater than or equal to 9.89 mm in depth. 990 Micros copic focus or foci only, no size is given. 998 Tumor involvement of specified esophageal, stomach, colorectal, lung and main stem bronchus, and breast primaries. See coding instructions. 999 Unknown; size not stated; not stated in the patient record; not applicable. Instructions a. Code the exact size of the primary tumor in millimeters (mm). Conversion/Rounding To convert centimeters to millimeters, move the decimal point one digit to the right (or multiply the centimeters by 10). 0.1cm = 1 mm 1 cm = 10 mm 3.2 cm = 32 mm Use code 001 for tumors less than 1 mm in size Formulas for converting inches to millimeters are listed below. 394 inch = 10 mm 1 inch = 25 mm Exception: For melanomas, code the depth of invasion in HUNDREDTHS of millimeters f or the following sites: 1 -mm depth would be recorded as 100. Use code 989 for melanomas of the above sites that are 9.89 mm or greater in depth. b. Recording pathologic size versus clinical size: (1) Use the size documented on the pathology report when: The pathologist identifies the size of a completely excised primary tumor. The surgical margins were grossly free of disease (there may be microscop ic involvement). (2) Use the clinical size when: The primary tumor was not surgically excised. The primary tumor was excised but the margins were grossly involved. The primary tumor was excised but the pathology report does not specify tumor size. The pat ient was treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy before the primary was surgically excised. Code the size of the tumor prior to the therapy. Item Length: 3 Data Type: Numeric Right Justified, Zero Fill ACoS: Required* State Registry: Required* Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 123 Use the clinical tumor size documented in the following reports/examinati ons (listed in priority order): operative report, scans, x -ray, or physical examination. c. Code the size of the primary tumor, rather than the size of the specimen, polyp, ulcer, cyst, or metastasis. Example: The patient had an excisional breast biopsy . Pathology report states that the specimen measures 2 cm x 3 cm, but does not state the actual size of the tumor. Do not use the specimen size of 2 cm x 3 cm. Code the size from the operative report, mammography, or the physical exam. d. Code the larg est dimension or diameter of a tumor when multiple measurements are recorded. e. Record the size of the largest tumor when a patient has more than one tumor in the same primary site. f. When a tumor has both in situ and invasive components, record the si ze of the invasive component only. For purely in situ tumors, code the size as stated. g. Do not report the tumor size based on a biopsy unless the biopsy removed all of the primary tumor. Code the size of the residual tumor if an excisional biopsy is p erformed, and residual tumor at the time of resection of the primary site is found to be larger than the excisional biopsy. h. Do not add pieces or chips together to create a whole. They may not be from the same location, or they may represent only a ver y small portion of a large tumor. A clinical size may be documented in a physical exam, an ultrasound of the prostate, or a cystoscopy of the bladder. i. Record 998 when the following terms describe tumor involvement in these specific sites: Esophagus ( C15.0 a behavior code of /2 or /3) Lung and main stem bronchus Diffuse, entire lobe or lung (C34.0 - C34.9) Breast - C50.9) Diffuse; widespread; 3/4 or more of breast; inflammatory carcinoma j. Record 999 for the following: Tumor size is unknown or not documented in the patient record. Prostatic chips or bladder chips are the only measurement documented in the patient record. If only one size is given for a mixed in situ and invasive tumor. For a needle biopsy specimen. The patient was treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherap y before the primary was surgically excised and no clinical size prior to therapy is documented.

Required by the State Registry for all cases diagnosed through 12/31/2003 and beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2015 and later . Description This is a required 1 -character field for recording a code that indicates the exte nt of cancer spread. The only way to determine the correct Summary Stage is by referring to the SEER Summary Staging Manual , 2000. You cannot determine the correct code without using this manual. The Summary Stage must be completed on all cases diagnose d through 2003 . Refer to the SEER Summary Staging Manual for complete guidelines on assigning Summary Stage to be used in this section. Note: SEER Summary Staging Manual , 2000 is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003 and beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2015 . Continue to use SEER Summary Staging Guide , 1977 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001 . Codes 0 In situ 1 Localized 2 Regional by direct extension 3 Regional to lymph nodes only 4 Regional by direct extension and t o lymph nodes (combination of codes 2 and 3) 5 Regional, NOS 7 Distant metastases/systemic disease 9 Unstaged, unknown, or unspecified Definitions and Rules a. Summary Stage of disease is a clinical judgment of the extent of cancer spread and should incl ude all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. Stage does not change as the disease progresses. Metastasis t hat is known to have developed after the original diagnosis was made should be excluded. b. For all sites, the extent of disease is based on pathologic, operative, and clinical assessment. If there is a discrepancy between the pathology report and the op erative report, the priority for assessing extent of disease is based on pathologic, operative, then clinical findings, respectively. Gross observations at surgery are particularly important when not all malignant tissue is removed. If no surgery is perf ormed, use all diagnostic or radiological evidence and therapeutic procedures available in the medical record to determine the Summary Stage, if enough information is provided. c. Autopsy reports are used in coding extent of disease by applying the same r ules for inclusion and exclusion. d. The terms used to describe tumor involvement are sometimes ambiguous. Chapter 4 lists terms that may be interpreted as tumor involvement or non -involvement. e. There is only one correct Summary Stage for each tumor. If the State Cancer Registry receives reports from multiple hospitals for the same case and the Summary Staging doesn't match, State Registry staff will select and save only the most appropriate Summary Stage based on the best information available. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required* State Registry: Required* Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 130 COD ES TERM DEFINITIONS 0 In Situ Not progressed through the basement membrane of the organ involved (non - invasive tumor). Only organs with an epithelium can be in situ; this excludes muscles, connective tissues, fat (adipose tissue), bones, cartilage, lig aments, tendons, blood cells and vessels, and lymph nodes and vessels. Used only when the pathology report demonstrates that involvement is confined to the basement membrane and the tumor is described as noninvasive, pre - invasive, noninfiltrating, intraduc tal, intraepithelial, or in situ. See the behavior section in this chapter for additional terms that are synonymous with in situ. If there is evidence of lymph node involvement of a tumor described as in situ, it would indicate that an area of invasion was missed, and it is not an in situ lesion. Be cautious regarding needle biopsy of the lung. The specimen may be from the edge of the lesion and be reported as in situ, when actually an invasive lesion of advanced stage is present. Coding Tips: If the fifth digit of Histology/Behavior code is /2 (in situ), Summary Stage must be coded 0 (in situ). If Summary Stage is coded 0, the behavior code must be /2. 1 Localized Limited to the site of origin; progression through the basement membrane, but not bey ond the walls of the organ involved. Includes tumors confined to the primary organ site or described as microinvasive or early invasion. Stage I (localized) lymphomas are included here. 2 Regional by direct extension Tumors not confined to the organ of origin (primary site), but which extend into adjacent organs or tissues by passing through the wall of the primary organ. If the tumor spreads to a NON -contiguous organ from the primary site, it is no longer regional. 3 Regional to lymph nodes only Tumo r involvement with regional lymph nodes only. Includes lymph nodes in the area (region) of the primary tumor that contain tumor and the cancer has not spread to other organs by direct extension. Do not use evidence of palpable nodes as described in the ph ysical examination of the patient to increase the stage of disease unless the record clearly states that in the physician's judgment, the node is involved. Nodes described as fixed or matted are considered involved. Mass in the mediastinum, retroper itoneum, and/or mesentery (with no specific information as to tissue involved) is considered involvement of lymph nodes. Any unidentified lymph nodes included with the resected primary site specimen are to be considered regional, rather than distant, lymp h nodes. Regional lymph nodes are not palpable for inaccessible sites such as bladder, kidney, lung, liver, and ovary. The best description concerning regional lymph nodes will be the surgeon's evaluation at the time of exploratory surgery or definitive s urgery, or x -ray and CT scans if no surgery is performed. 4 Regional by direct extension and to lymph nodes Tumor invades adjacent organ(s) and regional lymph nodes (codes 2 and 3). 5 Regional, NOS Regional, not other wise specified. (The stage is known to be regional, but the medical record is unclear as to whether it is through direct extension or lymph node involvement.) Stage II (regional) lymphomas are included here. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 131 COD ES TERM DEFINITIONS 7 Distant Cases that have (1) Direct extension beyond adjacent organs or tissues, (2) Metastases to distant lymph nodes, and/or (3) Metastases to distant site(s) via the circulatory or lymphatic system or by seeding or implantation to parts remote from the primary tumor. This category usually includes brain, liver, bone, and lung met astases. Code the following primary sites as having distant metastases/systemic disease (7): Leukemia, multiple Stage III and IV (distant) lymphomas are included here. 9 Unstaged No information or death certificate only. Includes the following: 1) Unknown primaries (C80.9) 2) Unstaged or unspecified primaries 3) Patients with recurrent disease see n for the first time at your hospital after your reference date, unless the stage at initial diagnosis is known. See additional definitions in the Glossary at the end of the Policy and Procedure Manual. Instructions a. To determine the Summary Stage cod e, using the SEER Summary Staging Manual, look up the section for the original site where the cancer started. Each such section is divided into general staging categories (localized, regional, and distant). (1) The Localized category lists the layers o r parts of the primary organ. If the cancer is contained within these layers, it is considered localized (code 1). (2) The Regional category is divided into Direct Extension and Lymph Nodes subcategories. If the cancer has spread to any of the adj acent organs or sites listed in the Direct Extension subcategory, it is considered regional by direct extension (code 2). If the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes specified, it is considered regional to lymph nodes (code 3). If the cancer has spread to adjacent organs and to regional lymph nodes, use code 4, a combination of codes 2 and 3. (3) The Distant category lists the most common, but not all, sites of distant spread for each primary site. If the cancer has spread to an organ that is not directly touching the original primary organ, it is considered distant by direct extension or metastasis (code 7). Positive lymph nodes that are not in the region of the original primary site are considered distant lymph nodes (Summary Stage code 7). Use the SEER Summary Staging Guide to determine if a lymph node is regional or distant. The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (the TNM coding book) is also a good reference to use when determining Summary Stage, even if you do not actually assign TNM codes. T he AJCC manual often lists lymph nodes that are considered regional (vs. distant lymph nodes) and includes illustrations that may clarify the various layers of an organ (e.g., colon). Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 132 b. In the SEER Summary Staging Guide 1977 , the categories localized, r egional by direct extension, and distant are subdivided into further categories, although these subdivisions are not used at the State Registry. The categories are not subdivided in the SEER Summary Staging Manual 2000. For cases diagnosed prior to Janua ry 1, 2001, the subdivisions should be coded as follows: CODES SUMMARY STAGE DESCRIPTION OF SUBDIVISION 1 Localized L1, L2, L3, LX 2 Regional by direct extension R1, R2 7 Distant metastases/systemic disease D1, D2 c. Unknown primaries (C80.9) should be coded 9 (unstaged), even if the unknown primary has been diagnosed from a metastatic site. Example: A patient with an unknown primary site (C80.9) has metastases in the brain and liver. Although at least one of these sites has to be a metastatic site distant from the original primary (since brain and liver are not adjacent to each other), Summary Stage should be coded 9 (unknown) to be consistent with ACoS rules in the FORDS. If you want to document these metastatic sites, record them in the text item , Substantiate Stage . d. Kaposi Sarcoma (1) For cases diagnosed January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003 , use the Kaposi sarcoma staging scheme found in the SEER Summary Staging Manual , 2000. (2) For cases diagnosed prior to 2001 (according to advice fr om NAACCR), since there is no disease - specific staging scheme for Kaposi sarcoma in the SEER Summary Staging Guide, 1977, registries may use the scheme appropriate for the primary site. If the primary site is skin, use the skin other than melanoma schem e. Although this is not ideal, it does allow grouping of cases based on how extensive the Kaposi sarcoma was at diagnosis. Example: A single lesion of the skin with no lymph node or other involvement would be Summary Stage 1 (local). A patient with eith er a lesion on both the right and left legs, or widespread skin lesions, would be Summary Stage 7 (distant). e. Malignant Melanoma Clark's Level and Breslow's Depth of Invasion are other staging systems for malignant melanoma. Use the following conversi on when the medical record reports only Clark's Level or Breslow's Depth of Invasion. (Use only for melanoma of skin, vulva, penis, and scrotum.) Summary Stage Code Summary Stage Clark's Level Breslow's Depth of Invasion Extent of Disease 0 In situ I No invasion Intraepidermal 1 Localized II 0.75 mm Invasion of papillary dermis 1 Localized III > 0.75 - 1.50 mm Invasion of papillary -reticular dermal interface 1 Localized IV > 1.50 - 4.0 mm Invasion of reticular dermis 2* Regional extension* V 4.0 mm Invasion subcutaneous tissue (through entire dermis) *Summary stage 1, Localized, in Summary Stage 1977 for cases diagnosed prior to 2001. Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 133 f. Lymphomas The staging system for lymphomas is provided below. It is based on the 1971 Ann Arbor class ification and should be used for anatomic staging of Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin lymphomas. Appendix E -1 has some tips for coding lymphomas and leukemias. Note: The only valid Summary Stage codes for lymphomas are codes 1, 5, 7, or 9. Example: A Stage II lymphoma is coded as Summary Stage 5, not 2. Summary Stage Code Summary Stage AJCC Staging Extent of Disease 1 Localized I Involvement of a single lymph node region. 1 Localized IE Localized involvement of a single extralymphatic organ or site. 5 Regional II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. 5 Regional IIE Localized involvement of a single associated extralymphatic organ or site and its regional nodes with or without other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. Note: The number of lymph node regions involved may be indicated by a subscript (e.g., II3). 7 Distant III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm. 7 Distant IIIE Involvement of lymph node regions on b oth sides of the diaphragm that may also be accompanied by localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site. 7 Distant IIIS Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm that may also be accompanied by involvement of the spleen . 7 Distant IIIE+S Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm that may also be accompanied by localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site and involvement of the spleen. 7 Distant IV Disseminated (multifocal) involveme nt of one or more extralymphatic organs with or without associated lymph node involvement, or isolated extralymphatic organ involvement with distant (non -regional) nodal involvement. 9 Unspecified 99 Unstaged, unknown, unspecified. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 134 OVERVIEW OF COLLA BORATIVE STAG E (CS) DATA COLLECTION SYSTE M The complete instructions and site -histology defined codes are available in the current version of the Collaborative Stag e Data Collection System Coding Instructions (CS Manual ). Part I provides general instruc tions and the instructions and codes for generic (non site -specific) items. Part II contains the site - specific instructions and codes. The CS Manual can be downloaded at: http://cancerst aging.org/cstage/manuals/index.html Collaborative Stag e was designed for registrar use. It relieves registrars from the necessity of staging a single case according to more than one staging system. It avoids the problems that can occur when it is necessa ry to consider multiple pieces of information simultaneously to assign a single code. The derived stage codes are ideally suited for data analysis because of the consistency that can be obtained with objectively recorded, identically processed data items. Effective Date Collaborative Stag e (CS) is to be used for cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. It is not to be used for cases diagnosed prior to that date. How Collaborative Stag e Works For Collaborative Stage , registrars code discrete pieces of information once and the CS computer algorithm derives the values for AJCC T, N, M, and Stage Group (for cases that meet TNM criteria) ; Summary Stage 1977; and Summary Stage 2000. The CS data items listed belo w are coded by the registrar. CS Tumor Size CS Extension CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval CS Lymph Nodes CS Reg Lymph Nodes Eval Regional Lymph Nodes Examined Regional Lymph Nodes Positive CS Mets at DX CS Mets Eval CS Mets at DX - Bone CS Mets at DX - Brain CS Mets at DX - Liver CS Mets at DX - Lung CS Site -Specific Factors 1 -25, for some sites The CS Algorithm produces the output items listed below. The derived AJCC items are separate from the physician -coded items, and the derived Summary Stage items are separate from the manually coded items collected by the CoC in the past. The derived items must never be manually altered. Derived AJCC -6 T Derived AJCC T Descriptor Derived AJCC -7 N Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 135 Derived AJCC -7 N Stage Group Derived SS1977 Derived SS2000 Timing of Data Collection The data collected in the Collaborative Stag e System are limited to information gathered through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment, OR all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression , whichever is longer . Disease progression i s defined as further direct extension or distant metastasis known to have developed after the diagnosis was established. Information about tumor extension, lymph node involvement, or distant metastasis obtained after disease progression is documented shou ld be excluded from the CS coding. Coding CS Items a. Code the CS items for every analytic case. Read the medical record carefully to identify the primary site and histology and determine their ICD -O-3 codes. While you are reviewing the record, make mental notes about the tissues and lymph nodes that are involved by tumor. b. The abstractor enters the primary site and histology codes into the cancer abstracting software. A schema selection algorithm determines which schema is appropriate to each combin ation of primary site and histology, and if applicable, an additional schema discriminator variable. c. Begin assigning codes for the Collaborative Stag e data items. Be sure to read the notes and follow the site/histology -specific instructions at the beg inning of each item. Some schemas may have site - specific factors associated with extension, lymph nodes, or metastasis. Keep these in mind as you assign the codes. Code the tumor size in the CS Tumor Size item. Code the extent of direct tumor spread in the CS Extension item. Code how the greatest tumor size and spread was determined in the CS Tumor Size/Ext Eval item. Code whether regional lymph nodes are involved in the CS Lymph Nodes items. Code how the farthest regional lymph node spread was determine d in the CS Reg Node Eval item. Code the number of positive regional lymph nodes from the pathology report in the Regional Nodes Positive item. Code the number of regional lymph nodes examined by the pathologist in the Regional Nodes Examined item. Code th e farthest distant metastasis (including distant lymph nodes) in the CS Mets at Dx item. Code how the distant metastasis was determined in the CS Mets Eval item. Code whether there are metastases in the bone, brain, lung and/or liver in the appropriate CS Mets at DX - Bone, Brain, Liver, and Lung fields . Code the CS Site -Specific Factors as required or applicable. d. When all the CS codes are completed, the computer can convert them into the T, N, M, Stage Group, Summary Stage 1977, and Summary Stage 2000. Depending on your software system, the final stage information may be derived now, when the case is saved, or prior to exiting the case. When the computer derives the final stage information, the program will check the histology code and other coded in formation to determine whether T, N, M and Stage Group will be generated for the case. If the histology code is on the computer's exceptions list for that site, the T, N, M, and Stage Group will be reported as Not applicable. Summary Stage is generated for every case. Coding Instructions Cancer Identification Chapte r 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 136 Site-Specific Factors Some schemas require additional information to derive stage or that is considered to be of clinical or prognostic importance. CS Site -Specific Factors 1 -25 are designed to collect that information and are included i n every schema where they are needed.

Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 143 CS METS AT DX *For cases diagnosed 01/01/2004 and later. Description This item identifies the distant site(s) of metastatic involvement at time of diagnosis. This data item represents distant metastases (The AJCC M component or distant stage in Summary Staging) at the time of diagnosis. In other words, when the patient was diagnosed, tumor had already spread indirectly (through vascular or lymph channels) to a site r emote from the primary tumor. The structure of this data item is based on the M category of AJCC. In some schemas, there may be additional items in CS Extension or CS Lymph Nodes that map to distant stage in Summary Staging ( 1977 and/or 2000) and there may be some items in CS Mets at Dx that map to regional stage in Summary Staging. Regardless of where such items are recorded, the staging algorithms will properly account for the information. Rationale The presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis is an independent prognostic indicator, and it is used by Collaborative Stag e to derive AJCC M codes and SEER Summary Stage codes.

It is not sufficient to merely code the items. The information from the medical record supporting the codes must be recorded. Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor' s instructions for recording text that substantiates staging. Instructions a. Identify the specific evidence in the medical record that justifies the staging and record the evidence briefly , in this field. Standard abbreviations can be used to save space . It is not necessary to repeat information documented in other text fields. Examples: Staging Text Summary Stage 4 Small cell carcinoma of the rt. lung with extension to the pericardium and mets to 3 of 4 hilar lymph nodes. Summary Stage 1 Poorly diffe rentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with invasion propria. LN neg. Summary Stage 7 Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the rt. ovary with extension to the small intestine. Summary Stage 5 Diffuse, histiocytic malignant lympho ma of the cervical and mediastinal lymph node regions. Bone marrow free of disease.

Use this field to clarify any coding that is vague (e.g., specific metastatic site coded as a 9) or to justify any coding that requires the coder to override an edit error message (e.g., metastatic site coding that is consistent with AJCC staging but inconsistent with Summary Stage). c. Document any unresolved discrepancies between physician and registry staging decisions. d. Facilities using the pa per abstract to report should also attach copies of medical record documentation (such as the pathology and operative reports) that substantiates the extent of disease. However, text that substantiates the staging must be completed by all reporting facili ties.

Facilities should refer to the current AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer for staging rules . ACoS Requirements Hospitals with cancer programs approved by the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) must record pathologic or clinical classifications of TNM and stage group in order to meet ACoS approval standards. In October 1981, the Commission on Cancer resolved that the staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) would be used in all approved cancer programs. The AJCC developed its staging system for evaluating trends in the treatment and control of ca ncer. This staging is used by physicians to estimate prognosis, plan treatment, evaluate new types of therapy, analyze outcome, design follow -up strategies, and assess early detection results. In 1982, breast cancer was the first site implemented. Effec tive January 1991, ACoS required AJCC TNM staging for all required (analytic) cases that had a staging scheme in the AJCC Manual for Staging of Cancer , Third Edition. The Commission has since published the fourth, fifth, sixth , and seventh editions of the manual. The effective dates for the various editions are listed below. AJCC Second Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed in 1988 or earlier . AJCC Third Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed from 1989 through 1992 . AJCC Fourth Edition: Effective for ca ses diagnosed from 1993 through 1997 . AJCC Fifth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed from 1998 through 2002 . AJCC Sixth Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed in 2003 through 2009 . AJCC Seventh Edition: Effective for cases diagnosed 2010 and later. AJCC Staging System The TNM system for describing the anatomic extent of disease is based on the assessment of three components: T = The extent of the primary tumor N = The absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis M = The absence or p resence of distant metastasis The TNM elements are defined for specific anatomic sites and/or histologic types in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. These elements should be recorded on a staging form or in the medical record. Refer to the AJCC Cancer Stag ing Manual and review Chapter 1, Purposes and Principles of Staging and the rules in each of the site -specific chapters. Each site -specific chapter outlines the site(s) and histologies that are included in the chapter. Definitions a. Clinical (pretreat ment) stage is based on information and evidence obtained before treatment. Symptoms, physical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration (without resection) , and other relevant findings are the basis of clinical staging. Clinical stag e of disease is assigned using all information available before initiation of definitive treatment or within four months after the date of diagnosis, whichever is shorter, as long as the cancer has not progressed during that time frame . The clinical stage is essential to select and evaluate therapy. b. Pathologic stage is based on information obtained before treatment and supplemented by additional evidence from surgery and pathologic examination of the resected specimen (s). Patholigic stage of disease i s assigned using all information though completion of definitive (first course) surgery or identified within four months after the date of diagnosis, whichever is longer, as long as there is no Chapter 5 Cancer Identification Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 181 systemic or radiation therapy initiated or the cancer has not progressed during that thime frame. It is a combination of all findings. The pathologic stage provides the most precise data to estimate prognosis . Pathologic assessment of the primary tumor requires a resection of the primary tumor or a biopsy adequate to evaluate the highest pT (pathologic Tumor) category. The pathologic assessment of the regional lymph nodes requires the removal of enough nodes to confirm the absence of regional lymph node metastasis and evaluate the highest pN (pathologic Nodes) cat egory. General Instructions a. Locate the specific site in the AJCC manual for the assignment of TNM elements. b. When AJCC staging does not apply to a particular site or histology because they have been excluded from the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual , record 88 in the T, N, M, and Stage Group fields. c. When the primary site is unknown, staging may be based on clinical suspicion of the site of origin. If no suspected site of origin is identified, record 88 in the T, N, M, and Stage Group fields.

Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 194 GENERAL DEFINITIONS AND RULES FOR CODING TREATMENT a. Definitive (cancer -directed) treatment is any therapy whose purpose is to modify, control, remove, or destroy proliferating cancer tissue. Treatment may be directed toward either the primary or metastatic sites, regardless of the patient's response. Record all cancer -directed treatment administered to the patient in the first course of treatment. Include treatment provided in other facilities and failed treatments (the patient did not respond). For statistical analysis of treatment, only the following codes are considered definitive treatment codes: 10-90 Surgery (removal of tumor cells) 20-98 Regional radiation treatment modality (destruction of cancer cells through rays, radons) 01-03 Chemotherapy (destruction of cancer cells through chemicals, drugs) 01 Hormone/steroid (endocrine) therapy (changing hormonal balance through hormo nes, steroids, or endocrine surgery) 01 Immunotherapy or Biological Response Modifier therapy (agents that alter the immune system or change the host response) 10-40 Hematologic transplant and endocrine procedures 1-3 Other cancer -directed therapy (nonspec ific or experimental) Codes that indicate a specific definitive treatment is not recommended, recommended but not given, or unknown whether recommended or given may be recorded in the treatment fields listed below. (1) Chemotherapy codes 82 -99 (2) Hormo ne Therapy codes 82 -99 (3) Immunotherapy (Biological Response Modifier) codes 82 -99 (4) Other Therapy codes 7, 8, and 9 (5) Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedure codes 82 -99 b. Non-definitive (non cancer -directed) treatments are performed to esta blish a diagnosis or stage, relieve symptoms, prolong the patient's life, or prepare the patient for cancer -directed therapy. Such treatments are not considered cancer -directed treatment. There is no expectation of reducing the size of the tumor or of de laying the spread of the disease. In effect, it is treatment of the patient, not the cancer. The following examples of non -definitive treatment are not considered cancer -directed therapy, but can be recorded in the designated fields, when applicable. (1) Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedure codes 01 - 09. These procedures include: Incisional biopsies Exploratory procedures with or without biopsies -otomy, -ostomy, or bypass only (2) Palliative Care codes 1 -9 (Not collected by the State Cancer Regi stry - refer to the FORDS .) The following treatments are also considered non -definitive therapies and are not coded: (1) Pain medication (2) Oxygen (3) Antibiotics administered for an associated infection (4) Transfusions (e.g., to counteract blood dyscr asia resulting from chemotherapy) (5) Medication (e.g., Epogen, Neupogen, or Procrit) to counteract blood dyscrasia resulting from chemotherapy (6) Intravenous therapy to maintain fluid or nutritional balance (7) Laser therapy directed at relieving symptom s (8) Closure of colostomy in a patient with prior resection for cancer of the bowel (9) Megestrol acetate, hormone therapy designed to improve nutritional status Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 195 c. First Course of Treatment All cancer -directed therapies specified in the physician(s) tr eatment plan during or after the initial diagnosis are part of the first course of treatment. Documentation of a treatment plan may be found in several different sources, for example: medical clinic record, consultation reports, and outpatient records. The discharge plan may document all or part of the treatment plan. (1) For all malignancies except leukemias , first course of treatment includes all methods of therapy recorded in the treatment plan and administered to the patient during or after the firs t diagnosis of cancer. Planned treatment may include multiple modes of therapy and may encompass intervals of a year or more. If the therapy is a part of an established protocol or administered within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it i s first course of treatment. When a treatment plan is not available or is unclear, consult the physician advisor. If there is no treatment plan, established protocol, or management guidelines, and consultation with a physician advisor is not possible, u se the principle: Initial treatment must begin within four months of the date of initial diagnosis. (2) For leukemias , first course of treatment includes all methods of therapy recorded in the treatment plan and administered to the patient during or af ter the first diagnosis of leukemia. Record all remission -inducing or remission -maintaining cancer -directed therapy as first course of treatment. Treatment regimens may include multiple modes of therapy and may encompass intervals of a year or more. Cer tain pediatric leukemia protocols span two years or more from induction to the end of maintenance. In these protocols, induction, consolidation, and maintenance are all first course of treatment. If the therapy for leukemia is a part of an established p rotocol or administered within accepted management guidelines for the disease, it is first course of treatment. When a treatment plan is not available or is unclear, consult the physician advisor. A patient may relapse after achieving a first remission. All therapy administered after the relapse is secondary or subsequent treatment. d. No Treatment No therapy is a treatment option (the patient refused therapy, the family/guardian refused therapy, the patient expired before therapy started, or the phys ician recommended no therapy). Therefore, first course of treatment may be no treatment. Record the date the decision was made not to treat in Date of First Course of Treatment . e. Treatment for Recurrence or Progression (subsequent treatment) includes all treatments administered after the first course of therapy is complete or was stopped. A physician may stop treatment if the disease progresses despite therapy or if the patient fails to respond. The patient may also choose to stop treatment. If ther apy is not part of the planned first course of treatment, it is considered subsequent therapy. If there is a change in the original planned or administered treatment because the patient does not respond or the disease progresses, such therapy should be e xcluded from the first course of therapy and be considered as part of a second or subsequent course of therapy. The State Cancer Registry does not require facilities to report subsequent therapy. The RMCDS program includes Subsequent Treatment screens for facilities that choose to report it. Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 196 f. Treatment Dates (1) If your software allows collection of information for only one cancer -directed surgery, record the first date on which the patient has cancer -directed surgery. Record the surgery code with the highest priority according to the rules defined in the Appendix G for site -specific surgery codes . (2) If the exact date that therapy was started is not known, the best estimate based on available information is acceptable. In the absence of an exac t date of treatment, the date of hospital admission for the first cancer -directed therapy is acceptable. Recording an approximate date is preferable to leaving the date blank . (3) If there is no basis for estimating, leave the month and day spaces blank . Every attempt should be made to enter the month and year, even if an estimate is necessary. In those rare instances when it is necessary to enter unknown month, day, or year, leave the appropriate spaces blank . If information is limited to a descriptio n, use the following: DESCRIPTIVE TERM USED DATE CODE Spring April The middle of the year July Fall October Winter Try to determine if this means the beginning of the year (January) or the end of the year (December). Code as indicated. (4) If cance r-directed therapy was initiated at another facility and you cannot approximate the date it began, leave the date blank . If you do know the exact date, you should record it, even if the therapy did not take place at your facility. (5) If the documented , planned first course of therapy occurred after four months, enter the date this planned first course of therapy was initiated, even if it was initiated after four months from the date of initial diagnosis. (6) If class of case is 38 (diagnosed at autopsy) , do not record any treatment or treatment dates. Date of First Course Treatment would be left blank .

It is used in conjunction with Date of First Course of Treatment to document whether treatment was or was not given, it is u nknown if treatment was given, or treatment was given on an unknown date. Codes 0 No treatment given 1 Treatment given 2 Active surveillance (watchful waiting) 9 Unknown if treatment was given Instructions for Coding a. Leave this item blank for cases di agnosed prior to 2010, b. Treatment given after a period of active surveillance is considered subsequent treatment and should not be coded as Treatment given (code 1) in this item. Examples: Code Reason 0 An elderly patient with pancreatic cancer reque sted no treatment. 0 The patient is expected to receive radiation, but it has not occurred yet ( Code 8 is recorded in Reason for No Radiation .) 2 The treatment plan for a patient with lymphoma is active surveillance.

Record all p rocedures done at your facility and procedures done at other facilities, if known. Codes The site-specific surgery codes are provided in Appendix G of this manual. Definitions and rules for the surgery codes are provided at the beginning of Appendix G. General Code Structure (See Appendix G for site -specific codes.) Code(s) Description 00 None; no surgical procedure of primary site; diagnosed at autopsy only 10-19 Site-specific codes. Tumor destruction; no pathologic specim en or there is pathlogic specimen 20-80 Site-specific codes. Resection; pathologic specimen 90 Surgery, NOS. A surgical procedure to the primary site was done, but no information on the type of surgical procedure is provided. 98 Special c ode for hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative , myeloproliferative (See site -specific codes for the sites and histologies), except death certificate only 99 Unknown if surgery performed; d eath certificate only Definitions a. Definitive (cancer -directed ) surgery is surgery that removes or destroys proliferating cancer tissue . This includes excisional biopsy with microscopic residual disease or no residual disease. Valid codes for cancer -directed surgery of the primary site are 10 -90. b. Non cancer -directed procedures are performed to diagnose or stage the disease ( Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedure codes 01 -07), or for relief of symptoms ( Palliative Care code 1). Record Surgical D iagnostic and Staging Procedures in the designated field of the RMCDS First Course of Treatment screens. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care data item . The following procedures are examples of exploratory (diagnostic or staging) su rgery (code 03 without procedure The following non cancer -directed procedures are examples of bypass surgery (code 04 without biopsy or code 06 with biopsy). Code only if performed as part of the initial diagnosis and work -up. If performed for palliation only, code in Palliative Care if collected. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care data item . Colostomy Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 209 Urethrostomy The following examples of diagnostic (non cancer -directed) procedures are not considered exploratory surgery. These procedures do not require an incision, since entry into a body cavity is made thro ugh a natural orifice. Code only if a biopsy was done as part - Use non canc er-directed surgery code 02 when primary site is corpus uteri. Use the cancer -directed surgery code only when performed for in situ cancer of the cervix. Brushings, washings, aspiration of cells, and hematologic findings (peripheral blood smears) are no t surgical procedures. Instructions a. After determining that cancer -directed surgery of the primary site was performed, use the best information in the operative and pathology reports to determine the operative procedure. The operative report title may not have adequate information for the surgery code. Use the operative report text and the pathology report to correctly identify the procedure performed. Use the information from the pathology report when an operative report is unclear or is inconsistent . Exception: If the pathology report states they cannot give an accurate accounting of organs removed (tumor encasement, crush artifact, etc). b. In the Surgery field, record the site -specific 2 -digit surgical code from Appendix G for the specific surgery performed as part of the first course of treatment. For RMCDS users, record the date the surgery was performed in the adjacent Date field. c. Record Surgical Diagnostic and Staging Procedures in the designated field of the RMCDS First Course of Tr eatment screens. Do record all biopsies as well as cancer -directed surgical procedures. d. More than one cancer -directed surgical procedure can be recorded in the RMCDS First Course of Treatment screens. If a biopsy was followed by a re -excision or wide excision within the first course of cancer -directed therapy and the path report for the re -excision or wide excision is negative for residual tumor, code the biopsy as an excisional biopsy. In the RMCDS program or the paper abstract, record both procedures, each with its respective date. Record the excisional biopsy date as the date of first course of treatment. Example 1: A patient has an excisional breast biopsy at your hospital January 12, 20 15. The pathology report reveals an axillary node with micrometastasis. The patient opted to have a mastectomy on March 21, 20 15. Code the procedures as follows: Surgery Code Procedure Date 41 Simple mastectomy 03/21/20 15 22 Excisional biopsy 01/12/20 15 If you can record only one surgical procedure in y our system, record the surgical code with the highest priority according to the rules on the following page and use the first date on which the patient has cancer -directed surgery (41 -01/12/20 15). Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 210 Example 2: A patient had a breast biopsy on March 15, 20 15 in the physician's office. A simple mastectomy was done at your hospital on March 27, 20 15. Both procedures should be recorded, as follows: Surgery Code Procedure Date 41 Mastectomy 03/27/20 15 02 Incisional biopsy of primary site 03/15/20 15 If you c an record only one surgical procedure in your system, code surgery 41 with 03/27/20 15 as the date of treatment. e. If the patient had no surgery at your hospital, but had surgery at another facility, you may enter the surgery information from the other ho spital, if known. In one of the RMCDS First Course Treatment screen(s), record the facility ID and the appropriate surgery code and date. In the paper abstract, identify the facility in the Description of Treatment text field. f. If the patient did no t have cancer -directed surgery, record the reason as instructed in the Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site section. Special Rules a. Coding Multiple Definitive Surgeries (1) If a single field is available for the data item Surgical Procedure of Primary Site or if a summary treatment field is provided and the patient has multiple cancer -directed surgeries of the primary site, code the most invasive, definitive surgery. For codes 00 through 79, the code positions are hierarchical. Last -listed codes take precedence over codes listed above. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is unavailable. Example: A patient has a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp in the sigmoid colon (code 28). The pathology report identifies carc inoma extending into the stalk. A week later, the patient has a hemicolectomy (code 40). Code the hemicolectomy since it is the most invasive, definitive surgery. (2) If multiple fields are available to record consecutive surgical events, code each cons ecutive surgery of the primary site. For the example above, record both procedures, each with its respective date. Record the polypectomy date as the date of first course of treatment. b. Coding Surgery for Multiple Primaries Code the appropriate surge ry for each site when multiple primaries are excised at the same time. Example 1: A patient who has cancer of the cervix and of the endometrium enters your facility for a total abdominal hysterectomy. Code a total abdominal hysterectomy for each of the t wo primaries. Example 2: A patient has colon and skin cancer. The patient had a hemicolectomy and a wide excision of the skin lesion. Code the colectomy for colon and the wide excision for skin. c. If a surgical procedure removes the remaining portion o f an organ that had been partially resected previously for any condition, code as total removal of the organ. If none of the primary organ remains, the code should indicate that this is the case. Example 1: Resection of a stomach that had been partially excised previously is coded as total removal of stomach. Example 2: Removal of a cervical stump is coded as total removal of uterus. Example 3: Lobectomy of a lung with a previous wedge resection is coded as total removal of lobe. d. Code 98 applies to sp ecific tumors that cannot be clearly defined in terms of primary or non -primary site. Use code 98 for the following: All hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, myeloproliferative disease s; All unknown primaries and ill -defined sites. Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 211 Exception: For death certificate only cases, use code 99. e. For extra -lymphatic lymphoma, code surgery using the site -specific surgery coding scheme for the primary site (not the lymph node scheme). f. For facilities that collect Palliative Care: If the procedure coded in this item was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient more comfortable, then also record this surgery in the Palliative Care field. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care data item . Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 212 DATE OF SURGERY FLAG Description This flag explains why there is no appropriate value in the corresponding date field, Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAACCR Item #1200). This data item was added to Volume II Version 12 (effective January 2010). Rationale Prior to version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously b een transmitted in date fields. Codes 10 No information whatsoever can be inferred from this exceptional value. (It is unknown if any surgical procedure was performed.) 11 No valid date is applicable in this context (for example, no surgical procedure was performed). 12 A valid date is applicable but not known. (Surgery was performed but the date is unknown.) Blank A valid date is coded in item Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAACCR Item #1200). Instructions a. Leave this item blank if Date of First Surgical Procedure (NAACCR Item #1200) has a full or partial date recorded. b. Use code 12 if the Date of First Surgical Procedure cannot be determined, but the patient did receive first course surgery. c. Use code 10 i f it is unknown whether any surgery was performed. d. Use code 11 if the no surgical procedure was performed. e. Code this data item (when appropriate) even if your software uses the traditional format for date entry. Examples: Description Date (Leave un known portions blank.) Date of Surgery Flag Full date known *01/08/201 5 or 201 5/01/08 Blank Month & year known *01/_ _/201 5 or 201 5/01/_ _ Blank Year _/_ _/201 5 or 201 5/_ * For date entry, your software may use the traditional format (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMM DD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. The computer will store either in the interoperable format.

The item can be used to compare and evaluate the extent of surgical treatment. Codes 0 None 1 Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node (s) 2 Sentinel lymph node biopsy (only) 3 Number of regional nodes removed unknown or not stated; regional lymph nodes removed, NOS 4 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed 5 4 or more regional lymph nodes removed 6 Sentinel node biopsy and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at the same time, or timing not stated 7 Sentinel node biopsy and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at different times 9 Unknown or not applicable Use the operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative proce dure was a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx), or a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, or a combination of both SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection. Review both the surgeon's planned procedure as well as the description of the procedu re that was actually performed. The operative report takes precedence over the pathology report for distinguishing between SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and a regional lymph node dissection. Definitions Code Definition 0 No regional lymph node surgery. No lymph nodes found in the pathologic specimen. Diagnosed at autopsy. 1 Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) regardless of the extent of involvement of disease. Note s: If additional procedures were performed on the lymph nodes, use the appropriate code 2-7. For breast, biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) is uncommon. Confirm that the procedure was not actually a sentinel lymph biopsy. 2 Biopsy of the first lymph node or nodes that drain a defined area of tissue within the body. Sentinel node(s) are identified by the injection of a dye , radio -label , or a c ombination at the site of the primary tumor. Note s: Additional non -sentinel nodes can be taken during the same operative procedure. The additional nodes may be discovered by the pathologist or selectively removed (harvested) as part of the SLNBx procedure by the surgeon. If the operative report confirms that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLNBx, use code 6. 3 Sampling or dissection of regional lymph node(s) and the number of nodes removed is unknown or not stated. The procedure is not spe cified as sentinel node biopsy. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 214 Code Definition 4 Sampling or dissection of regional lymph node(s) with fewer than four lymp h nodes found in the specimen. Note: Code 4 should be used infrequently. Ensure that t he procedure is not specified as SLNBx in the operative repo rt. 5 Sampling or dissection of four or more regional lymph nodes. Notes: If relatively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a relatively large number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same, or separate, procedure (code 6 or 7). 6 SLNBx and procedures that would be coded 3, 4, or 5 performed at the same time, or timing not stated. Notes: Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedure s to harvest only a few nodes. If re latively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio -label injection) and the surgeon performs a more extensive dissection of regional lmph nodes, use code 6. 7 SNLBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) in separate surgical events. Note s: Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node complet ion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. If relatively few nodes were examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only ( code 2). 9 It is unknown whether regional lymph node surgery was performed; death certificate -only; for lymphomas with a lymph node primary site; an unknown or ill -defined primary; or for hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or myelopr oliferative disease. Instructions a. Record t he scope of regional lymph node surgery for each surgical event even if no surgery of the primary site was performed. b. Record surgical procedures that aspirate, biopsy, or remove regional lymph nodes in a n effort to diagnose or stage disease in this data item. Record the date of this surgical procedure in data item Date of First Course Treatment and/or Date of First Surgical Procedure as appropriate. c. Codes 0 -7 are hierarchical. If only one procedure can be recorded, code the procedure that is numerically higher. d. If two or more surgical procedures of regional lymph nodes are performed, the code for each subsequent procedure must include the cumulative effect of all preceding procedures. For exampl e, a sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by a regional lymph node dissection at a later time is coded 7. e. Code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries when the patient two primaries with common regional lymph nodes. f. Use code 9 for the follo wing: Primaries of the meninges, brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and other parts of the central a lymph node primary site (C77.0 -C77.9); Unknown or ill -defined primary (C76.0 -C76.8, C80.9); Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 215 Do not code distant lymph nodes removed during surgery to the primary site for this data item. Distant nodes are coded in the data field Surgical Procedure/Ot her Site . h. Refer to the current AJCC Cancer Staging Manual for site -specific identification of regional lymph nodes. i. For facilities that collect Palliative Care: If the procedure coded in this item was provided to prolong a patient's life by contro lling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient more comfortable, then also record this surgery in the Palliative Care field.

Description This is an optional 1 -character field for recording the reason that no surgery was performed on the primary site. This item is related only to first course of therapy . This information is to be coded if it is available in the medical record. Codes 0 Surgery of the primary site was performed. 1 Surgery of primary si te was not performed because it was not part of the planned first course treatment. Diagnosed at autopsy. 2 Surgery of the primary site was not recommended/performed because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, progression of tumor prior to planned surgery, etc.). 5 Surgery of the primary site was not performed because the patient died prior to planned or recommended surgery. 6 Surgery of the primary site was not performed. It was recommended by the patien t's physician, but was not performed as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was noted in the patient record. 7 Surgery of the primary site was not performe d. It was recomme nded by the patient's physician but this treatment was refused by the pa tient, the patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 8 Surgery of the primary site was recommended, but it is unknown if it was performed. Further follow - up is recommended. 9 It is unknown whether su rgery of the primary site was recommended or performed. Death certificate only cases . Instructions a. If Surgical Procedure of Primary Site is coded 00, then record the reason based on documentation in the patient record. b. Use code zero (0) if the rec ord specifies that surgery of the primary site was performed. (Surgery of Primary Site is coded in the range of 10 -90.) c. Use code 1 if the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not inc lude surgery of the primary site, or if the option of , no treatment , was accepted by the patient. d. Use code 1 if Surgical Procedure of Primary Site is coded 98. e. Use code 7 if the patient refused recommended surgical treatment, made a blanket refus al of all recommended treatment, or refused all treatment before any was recommended. f. Use code 8 if it is known that a physician recommended primary site surgery, but no further documentation is available yet to determine whether surgery was performed. Cases coded 8 should be followed and updated to a more definitive code as appropriate. g.

Death certificate only. * Note: For cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2003, the codes reported in this data item describe any radiation administered to the patient as part or all of the first course of therapy. Codes 80 and 85 describe specific conversion of radiation therapy coded according to earlier coding rules and should not be used to record regional radiation for cases diagnosed on or later than January 1, 2003. Instructions a. Select the code for the regional radiation treatment modality that the patient received as part of the first course of treatment. Record all radiation that is given as part of first course therapy, even if it is palliative. (1) Radiation treatment modalit y will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Segregation of treatment components into regional and boost and determination of the respective treatment modality may require assistance from the ra diation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. (2) In the event multiple radiation therapy modalities were employed in the treatment of the patient, record only the dominant modality. (3) Note that in some circumstances the boost treatment may precede the regional treatment. (4) For purposes of this data item, photons and x -rays are equivalent. (5) Code radioembolization as brachytherapy. Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 221 (6) Do not confuse a radioiodine scan with treatment. Only treatment is coded in this item. b. In the Regional Radiat ion Treatment Modality field, enter the code from the list above for the radiation treatment modality that the patient received. For RMCDS users, record the date the radiation treatment started in a hospital -specific treatment screen in the date field adj acent to the Radiation item. c. If only one radiation treatment modality is delivered to a patient and it is not specified as either regional or boost treatment, assume it's regional treatment and code in Regional Radiation Treatment Modality. Codes with Examples: 00 PUVA (psoralen and long -wave ultraviolet radiation) is used to treat melanoma. Record PUVA treatment as Code 1 in Other Treatment . 20 A patient with prostate carcinoma receives pelvic irradiation at the reporting facility, and is then referr ed to a major medical center for experimental proton therapy boost. 24 A patient treated with breast conserving surgery has an interstitial boost at the time of the excisional biopsy. The implant uses Ir -192 and is left in place for three days. This is f ollowed by 6 MV photon treatment of the entire breast. In this case, the boost precedes the regional treatment. 25 In an experimental program, a patient with as Stage III carcinoma of the prostate receives 4,500 cGy to the pelvis using 15 MV photons, an d then the prostate receives a 600 cGy boost with neutrons. 25 Patient receives 15 MV external pelvic treatment to 4,500 cGy for cervical carcinoma, and then receives two Fletcher intracavitary implants. 29 A patient with carcinoma of the parotid receives daily treatments of which 60% are delivered by 15 MV photons and 40% of the dose is delivered by 16 MV electrons. 50 Yttrium -90 microsphere radioembolization is used to treat an inoperable liver cancer. 53 A prostate cancer patient is treated with I -125 se eds. I -125 is low dose brachytherapy. 98 A patient with a head and neck cancer underwent regional radiation treatment elsewhere and was referred to the reporting facility for an HDR brachytherapy boost. Detailed treatment records from the other facility are not available.

Description This is a required 1 -character field to record a code that indicates the reason no regional radiation therapy was administered to the patient. Codes 0 Radiation t herapy was administered . 1 Radiation therapy was not administered because it was not part of the planned first course treatment. Diagnosed at autopsy. 2 Radiation therapy was not recommended/administered because it was contrai ndicated based on other patie nt risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, progression of tumor prior to planned radiation, etc.). 5 Radiation therapy was not administered because the patient died prior to planned or recommended therapy. 6 Radiation therapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician, but was not administered as part of first course treatment. No reason was noted in patient record. 7 Radiation therapy was not administered; it was recommended by the patient's physician, but was refused by the patient, the patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was documented in the patient record. 8 Radiation therapy was recommended, but it is unknown whether it was administered. 9 It is unknown if radiation therapy was recommended or administered. Death certificate only cases. Instructions 1. If Regional Treatment Modality is coded 00 (not performed), record a code that indicates the reason based on patient record documentation . 2. Record code 1 if the treatment plan included multiple alternative treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include radiation therapy. Example: A patient is offered either surgery or brachytherapy to treat his stage 1 prostate and chooses surgical treatment. Record code 1 in Reason for No Radiation. 3. Record code 7 if the patient refused recommended radiation therapy, made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment, or refused all treatment before any was recommended. 4.

If follow -up to the specialist or facility determines the patient was never there and no other documentation can be found, change the code to 1. 6. Cases coded to 8 should be followed and updated to a more definitive code as indicated. 7. Record c ode 9 if the treatment plan included multiple alternative treatment options, but it is unknown which treatment, if any, was provided. Item Length: 1 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: *Required Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 228 CHEMOTHERAPY Description This is a required 2 -character field to record chemotherapy administered as first course of therapy. If chemotherapy was not administered, this item records the reason it was not administered to the patient. Chemotherapy consists of a group of anticancer drugs that inhibit the reproduction of cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis an d mitosis. Record chemotherapy administered at your facility, as well as chemotherapy given at any other facilities, if known. Codes 00 None, chemotherapy was not part of the planned first course of therapy ; diagnosed at autopsy. 01 Chemotherapy administ ered as first course therapy, but the type and number of agents is not documented in the patient record. 02 Single -agent chemotherapy administered as first course therapy. 03 Multiagent chemotherapy administered as first course therapy. 82 Chemotherapy was not recommended/administered because it was contraindicated due to patient risk factor s (e.g., comorbid conditions, advanced age , progression of tumor prior to administration, etc.). 85 Chemotherapy was not administered because the patient died prior to p lanned or recommended therapy. 86 Chemotherapy was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but was not administered as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was stated in the patient record. 87 Chemotherapy was not admin istered. It was recomme nded by the patient's physician, but this treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Chemotherapy was recommended, but it is unknown i f it was administered. 99 It is unknown whether a chemotherapeutic agent(s) was recommended or administered because it is not stated in the patient record. Death certificate only. Instructions a. Select the code for the type of chemotherapy that the pati ent received as part of the first course of treatment. Record chemotherapy as cancer -directed therapy when it is delivered concurrently or as adjuvant treatment. (1) Use code 00 if chemotherapy was not administered to the patient, and it is known that it is not usually administered for this type and stage of cancer. (2) Use code 00 if the treatment plan offered multiple alternative treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include chemotherapy. (3) Use code 00 if the option of , no treatment , was accepted by the patient. (4) Code chemoemoblization as 01, 02, or 03 depending on the number of chemotherapeutic agents agents used. (5) If it is known that chemotherapy is usually administered for this type and stage of cancer, but was not administered to the patient, use code 82, 85, 86, or 87 to record the r eason it was not administered. (6) Use c ode 87 if the patient refused recommended chemotherapy, made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment, or refused all treatment before an y was recommended. (7) Use code 88 if it is known that a physician recommended the patie nt receive chemotherapy, but no further documentation is available yet to confirm its administration. (8) Use code 88 to indicate referral was made medical oncologist a nd the registry must follow to determine whether it was given. If follow -up with the specific specialist or focility indicates the patien t was never there, use code 00. Item Length: 2 Data Type: Numeric ACoS: Required State Registry: Required Chapter 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 229 (9) Use c ode 99 if it is not known whether chemotherapy is usually administered for th is type and stage of cancer and there is no mention in the patient record whether it was recommended or administered. (10) If a chemotherapy drug is given for a reason other than cancer -directed treatment, do not code the drug as chemotherapy. If in doubt whether the chemotherapy drug is given to alleviate a symptom and not for cancer -directed treatment, consult your oncologist or oncology nurse. (11) For facilities that collect Palliative Care : If chemotherapy was provided to prolong a patient's life by controlling symptoms, to alleviate pain, or to make the patient more comfortable, then also record the chemotherapy provided in the Palliative Care field. The State Registry does not collect the Palliative Care data item . b. In the Chemotherapy field, en ter the code from the list above for the chemotherapy that the patient received. For RMCDS users, record the date the course of chemotherapy was started in the adjacent Date field. Example: Single agent chemotherapy 5 -FU was started on July 15, 20 11 at a physician's office as part of the first course of treatment. The treatment would be entered as follows: Chemotherapy code 02, Date: 07/15/20 11. c. One planned course of chemotherapy may be given in several segments. These segments are recorded as one course. The date listed for that course of chemotherapy should be the date the first segment of that course began. d. Two or more single agents given at separate times during the first course of cancer -directed therapy are considered a combination reg imen and coded 03 (chemotherapy, multiple agents). If two or more single agents are given at different times after the first course, it is subsequent treatment and can be recorded in the Subsequent Treatment RMCDS screens. The State Registry does not c ollect subsequent treatment. Chemotherapy Information and Definitions a. Refer to the SEER *Rx Interactive Drug Database (http: //seer.cancer.gov/) to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents . b. Chemotherapeutic agents ma y be administered by intravenous infusion or given orally. Other methods of administration include: Intrathecal. Administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid through a lumbar puncture needle into an implanted access device (Ommaya reservoir). Pleu ral/pericardial. Injected directly into pleural or pericardial space to control malignant effusions. Intraperitoneal. Injected into the peritoneal cavity. Hepatic artery. Injected into a catheter inserted into the artery that supplies blood to the liver . c. Chemotherapy agents may be administered singly or in a combination regimen of two or more chemotherapy drugs. They are administered in treatment cycles. The time span of a treatment cycle varies. It is dependent upon the histology, stage of diseas e, and treatment modalities. Chemotherapy may be administered for several weeks or several years. d. Clarification of terms: (1) Concurrent chemotherapy (multimodality therapy, combined modality therapy) is given before, during, or after other treatment modalities (surgery, radiation, etc.) as part of the treatment plan. (2) Adjuvant chemotherapy is given after other methods have destroyed the clinically detectable cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given to destroy micrometastases (undetectable cancer cells) . The intent is to prevent or delay a recurrence. Example: A patient has breast cancer with positive nodes. All detectable tumor is removed by a modified radical mastectomy. The patient receives adjuvant chemotherapy to destroy any micrometastasis that may be present. The chemotherapy is given to delay or prevent a recurrence. Coding Instructions Treatment Data Chapter 5 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 230 (3) Neoadjuvant therapy is given prior to surgical resection or radiation therapy to reduce the bulk of a locally advanced primary cancer. Example: A patient with locally advanc ed breast cancer receives chemotherapy to reduce tumor size. Chemotherapy is followed by a modified radical mastectomy. (4) Chemoembolization is a procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or mechanically and anticancer drugs are administrered directly into the tumor. Code as Chemotherapy when the embolizing agent(s) is a chemotherapeutic drug(s). Use SEER *Rx Interactive Drug Database (http:seer.cancer.gov/) to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeu tic agents. Example: A patient with primary liver cancer is treated using the following procedure: Under x -ray guidance, a small catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and the catheter tip is threaded into the artery in the liver that supplies b lood flow to the tumor. Chemotherapy is injected through the catheter into the tumor and mixed with particles that embolize or block the flow of blood to the tumor. (5) Ancillary drugs are medications whose actions are not directed at the patient's malig nancy per se but that enhance the effects of the cancer -directed therapy. For example, ancillary drugs may modulate the actions of specific chemotherapeutic agents by increasing their effectiveness in destroying tumor cells or by decreasing the potential for specific side effects. Ancillary drugs are not to be coded as cancer -directed therapy. Example: Folinic acid (leucovorin) stabilizes the drug -enzyme complex and thus increases the cytotoxic effects of 5 -FU and is frequently administered with 5 -FU for this purpose. Use chemotherapy code 02 (single agent) for 5 -FU and leucovorin treatment. e. Chemotherapy is divided into the following classifications: Group Subgroup(s) Examples Alkylating agents Mustard gas poside 5 Treatment Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 231 Group Subgroup(s) Examples Camptothec in Targeted therapy A group of newer cancer drugs that act directly against a bnormal proteins in cancer cells. f. If the patient has an adverse reaction, the physician may change one of the drugs in a combination regimen. If the replacement drug belongs to the same group as the original drug, there is no change in the regimen. Example: The physician documents a multimodality treatment plan that includes a combination regimen of chemotherapy. Vinblastine is one of the drugs in the chemotherapy regimen. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the physician says the Vinblastine will be replaced with Vincristine and the chemotherapy will continue as planned. This is a continuation of the planned first course of therapy. If the replacement drug is in a different group than the original drug, it is subsequent therapy. Exception: Unless there is disease progression, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and all subsequent planned first course of treatment would be recorded as first course, even if there is a change in chemotherapeutic agents and/or groups. g. Code the six drugs listed below as BRM, beginning with January 1, 2013 diagnoses. Continue to code cases diagnosed prior to 01/01/2013 as chemotherapy.

After these treatments are done, the patient's own stem cells are reinfused to restore the destroyed cells . Allogeneic BMT : \"Allo\" means \"other.\" Stem cells are removed from another person, called a donor. Most times, the donor must have the same genetic makeup as the patient, so that their blood is a \"match.

Endocrine irradiation and/or endocrine surgery are procedures that suppress th e naturally occurring hormonal activity of the patient and thus alter or affect the long -term control of the cancer's growth. These procedures must be bilateral to qualify as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. If only one gland is intact at the st art of treatment, surgery and/or radiation to that remaining gland qualifies as endocrine surgery or endocrine radiation. Instructions a.

(4) Use code 6 for the following: Unconventional methods whether they are the only therapy or are given in combination with conventional therapy (complementary medicine) . Alternative therapy only if the patient receives no ot her type of treatment. c. Do not code ancillary drugs (defined in the chemotherapy section of this manual ) in this field. There is no coding scheme for ancillary drugs. Examples of ancillary drugs: Allopurinol G-CSF (growth stimulating factors) Epogen Leucovorin Neupogen This a partial list. Refer to the SEER *Rx Interactive Drug Database (http: //seer.cancer.gov/) if in doubt as to which drugs are ancillary drugs and not coded. d. Do not code supportive care, observation, or any treatment that does not meet the usual definition in which treatment modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Exception : For specific hematopoietic diseases as instructed in the Hematopoieic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Case Reportability and Coding Man ual. Definitions a. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM): any medical system, practice, or product that is not thought of as standard medicine (conventional medicine). CAM treatments may include dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal pre parations, acupuncture, massage ther apy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medicine. Alternative medicine is used in place of standard treatment. b. Phlebotomy may be called blood remov al, bloodletting, or ven esection. c. Transfusions may include whole blood, RBCs, platelets, plateletpheresis, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), plasmapheresis, and cryoprecipitate.

In the paper abstract, the Description of Treatment field is a single field for recording all ty pes of treatment. The RMCDS abstract screen provides a separate text field for each treatment modality. Facilities using other types of registry software should follow their vendor's instructions for recording treatment text. Rationale Text is needed to justify the codes selected for the data items and to record information that is not coded at all. The text is used for quality control and special studies. Instructions Surgical Procedures a. Record information describing all surgical procedures perform ed as part of treatment. b. Include, as applicable: Date of each procedure; facility where each procedure was performed; type(s) of surgical procedure(s), including excisional biopsies and surgery to other and distant sites; lymph nodes removed; regional tissues removed; metastatic sites; and positive and negative findings. Radiation Beam a. Record information regarding treatment of the tumor with beam radiation. b. Include, as applicable: Date radiation treatment began; facility where treatment was give n; type(s) of beam radiation (e.g., orthovoltage, cobalt 60, MV x -rays, electrons, mixed modalities); and other treatment information (e.g., patient discontinued after five treatments). Radiation Other a. Record information regarding treatment of the tumo r with radiation other than beam radiation. This includes brachytherapy and systemic radiation therapy. b. Include, as applicable: Date treatment began; facility where treatment was given; type(s) of non - beam radiation (e.g., high dose rate brachytherapy , seed implant, radioisotopes [I -131]); and other treatment information. Chemotherapy a. Record information regarding chemotherapy treatment of the tumor. b.

Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 255 DATE OF LAST CONTACT OR DE ATH Description This is a required 8 -character field to record the date of last contact (DLC). If the patient is dead, this field records the date of death. Determine whether your software vendor uses the traditional format for date entry (MMDDCCYY) or the interoperable format (CCYYMMDD). The RMCDS program uses the traditional format. Definition This date may be the discharge date, date of death, date of a patient's visit to a doctor's office or clinic, or the date the patient was last contacted, wh ichever is the most recent. This date must be the latest date in the record. For example, a treatment date cannot be later than the Date of Last Contact . Instructions a. If no information is known after the patient is discharged from your hospital, reco rd the date of discharge or the date of the patient's last outpatient visit. When abstracting a case with more than one admission or clinic visit, make sure the date of last contact is the last clinic visit date or the last discharge date, or whatever the latest date is. b. If you are aware of a more recent date the patient was last alive after discharge (such as through correspondence or telephone contact), record the latest date of contact known. The date may be the date the patient was contacted by te lephone or responded to a letter. Record the date of the actual patient contact. Do not use the date information was received in the mail, or the date information was requested from a patient, physician, or clinic. Do not record the date follow -up infor mation was recorded on the abstract or follow -up card, or the date the case was entered into the computer. Note: Failure to find a patient on a list of deceased individuals does not consititute evidence that the patient is alive. Neither Vital Status nor Date of Last Contact or Death should be changed. c. If a patient has multiple primaries, all records should have the same date of last contact. If the State Cancer Registry receives information from more than one facility for the same patient, this fiel d will be updated in each of the patient's records. The latest date of last contact or death will be recorded for all of the patient's tumors. d. Estimate the date of last contact when the exact date is not available. An approximate date is better than using unknowns. If the specific day of the month is unknown, leave the the day section blank e. If information is limited to a description, use the following: DESCRIPTIVE TERM USED DATE CODE Spring April The middle of the year July Fall October Winter Try to determine if this means the beginning of the year (January) or the end of the year (December).

Use the most accurate information available. Codes 0 Dead 1 Alive Instructions a. If no follow -up information i s ever received, code the patient's vital status on the date of his/her last discharge from the hospital. b. If a patient has multiple primaries, all records should have the same patient vital status. Do not change a patient's vital status at discharge u nless new follow -up information is available. c. There is no code for unknown, since you must know at least whether the patient was alive or dead at the time he or she last left your facility.

Tumor status changes if the patient has a recurrence or relapse. Codes 1 No evidence of this tumor 2 Evidence of this tumor 9 Unknown, indeterminate whether this tumor is present, not stated in the patient record Instructions a. Code the best available information concerning the tumor status of the patient as of the date of last contact or death. b. Code tumor st atus independently for each primary tumor. If a patient has multiple primaries, each record could have a different tumor status. If the patient has evidence of the other primary tumor, but does not have evidence of this tumor, code 1, no evidence of this tumor. c. Code patients who have hematopoietic disease (e.g., leukemia) that is in remission as no evidence of this tumor (code 1). d. Official death certificates do not always record the presence of tumors. If the registry abstract indicates that the patient had a malignant or non -malignant tumor immediately before death, code evidence of this tumor (code 2). Consult the registry physician advisor when questions arise. Decisions on tumor status coding can be based on information such as: How much ti me elapsed between the last follow -up and patient's death? Was the last follow -up and tumor status information from a medical source (physician, hospital admission)? Are autopsy findings available to the registry? Example: A prostate cancer patient has a two-year history of metastatic disease. The patient had a bone scan at your facility in April 2015. The urologist's diagnosis was progressive bony metastases and the bone scan confirmed extensive bone destruction. The registrar finds an obituary documen ting the patient's death in a nursing home in June 2015. Record the tumor status as evidence of this tumor (code 2).

Record the cause of death listed on the death certificate. Central (state) registri es are the primary users of this data item. Use the underlying cause of death ( ICD-10 code), even if believed to be in error. All underlying causes of death should be left -justified. The decimal point is assumed to be between the third and fourth digit, but should not be entered. Special Codes 0000 Patient alive at last follow -up 7777 State death certificate or listing not available 7797 State death certificate or listing available, but underlying cause of death not coded; or the coded underlying cause of death is not available Instructions a. For all cases not meeting one of the above code descriptions and where the patient has died and the cause of death is known, record the ICD-10 underlying cause of death code. b. Use code 7777 when the patient ha s died, but the death certificate is not available. Hospitals would almost always record code 7777 for cause of death. c. Use code 7797 when the patient has died, but the coded underlying cause of death is not available. d. Some codes have an optional f ifth digit. The fifth digit is not used in coding cause of death. e. The ICD-9-CM code for cause of death obtained from the medical record should not be used for the underlying cause of death code if no death certificate is available. Use only the ICD-10 code from the death certificate. If hospitals record cause of death from the medical record for their own use, the State Registry will replace it with the death certificate code. f.

Description This is an 8 -character field (when combined with sequence number). The Central Tumor Registry (CTR) Number is an internal number that will be assigned and used by the State Cancer Registry only. In the RMCDS prog ram, it appears in the abstract screen and on reports as CTR # (Central Tumor Registry Number). There is a unique CTR number for each person in the central registry. If a person has more than one primary tumor, the sequence number will distinguish one tu mor from the next. In hospitals using the RMCDS program, the CTR number that appears in the hospital's abstract screen is the same as the hospital registry's accession number for the patient. The first four digits are the accession year (YYYY). The next five digits are the accession number (#####). The last two digits are the sequence number (SQ), so that the number looks like this: YYYY#####SQ. When the hospital submits cases on diskette to the State Registry, the CTR number is automatically changed to the unique CTR number used by the central registry. Hospital accession numbers are also maintained in the central registry. Item Length: 6 + 2 Data Type: Numeric (FOR STATE USE ONLY) Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 265 DATE CASE REPORT REC EIVED (STAMP DATE) Description This is an 8 -character field for the date the electronic or paper abst ract (or source record) is received by the State Cancer Registry for the respective tumor. If multiple reports are received from two or more sources, the applicable date for each reporting source is maintained in the State record for the tumor. The item label is Stamp Date in the State RMCDS screens. RMCDS screens for hospitals do not include this item. Rationale This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard -setting organizations and consequently, timeliness standards have been established. This item can be used with the Date of First Contact to measure timeliness of reporting by individual facilities to the State Registry.Item Length: 8 Data Type: Numeric (FOR STATE USE ONLY) Corrections And Follow -up Chapter 6 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 266 CHAPTER 6: CORRECTIONS AND FOLLOW -UP OVERVIEW This chapter describes how corrections, deletions, and follow -up information on previously submitted cases are reported to the State Cancer Registry. Part I explains the purpose for corrections and follow - up; who submits reports; and when , how, and where reports are submitted. Part II describes various methods to accomplish follow -up. Part III details how to complete the Correction and Follow -up Form. Part IV explains how to complete the Correction form for Multiple Patients . Forms are available upon request from the State Cancer Registry. PART I: GENERAL INS TRUCTIONS A. Purpose 1. Corrections The latest or most complete information and conclusions about a case should be reported. Over time, documentation may be added to a patient' s medical record that was not available when an abstract was originally completed. Such information may, in the interest of accuracy, require modification of the originally reported data. For example, early diagnostic information may support a diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. Later it may be learned that the original site of disease was breast cancer. In another case, more extensive work -up may reveal that disease originally thought to be malignant is benign and the case should be deleted from the S tate Cancer Registry database. For such cases it is important to correct the primary site, histology, and/or extent of disease as information becomes more complete. There is no time limit for making revisions that give better information about the origin al diagnosis or stage. Note: This does not mean that as the disease progresses, the stage should be changed according to the latest stage of disease. Staging should reflect only information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first cours e of treatment or within four months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer. 2. Follow -Up Systematic, annual follow -up of cancer patients is an important function of the cancer registry. Annual follow -up achieves two impo rtant objectives: To encourage continued medical surveillance of patients for early detection and treatment of recurrences and subsequent cancer; To obtain information for patient care studies and survival. Additional benefits of hospital -based follow -up efforts include provision of follow -up service to physicians and enhanced public relations resulting from the hospital's continued concern for patient welfare. From an epidemiologic perspective, a statewide follow -up effort permits tracking of patients in the event that case control studies are required or patient contact is necessary to assess public health risks. The American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer requires a specified successful follow -up rate for all cancer programs seeking approval . B. Who Submits Correction and Follow -Up Reports Any hospital having correction or follow -up information about a patient who was previously reported to the State Cancer Registry may submit information on that patient to the State Cancer Registry. Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 267 C. When to Submit Corrections and Follow -Up Information 1. Corrections Corrections or modifications to previously submitted data should be completed and submitted to the State Cancer Registry as soon as possible after the need for correction is discovered. 2. Follow -Up Follow -up should be performed at least annually for each patient, usually on the anniversary of the date of last contact. Follow -up reports may be submitted to the State Registry at least quarterly, particularly for hospitals that treat a l arge number of cancer patients. Hospitals are encouraged to submit updated information more frequently in order to maintain a complete record of the patient's treatment and a current database for analytic purposes. This permits an orderly workflow at bot h the State Cancer Registry and the reporting hospital. D. How to Report Corrections and Follow -Up Information Corrections, deletions, and follow -up can be submitted in a number of different ways that are outlined below. 1. Copies of the Original Paper Abstract If your hospital reports by paper abstract, changes or follow -up may be submitted on a copy of the original paper abstract. a. Make a copy of the original form. b. In red, write Correction, Delete, or Follow -Up at the top of the form. c. In red, cross out the original data in the field to be corrected and write the corrected or follow - up information beside the old. 2. Correcton and Follow -Up Form Changes and/or follow -up may be submitted on a Correction and Follow -Up Form, explained in Part III of this chapter. a. Complete all identifying information on the form to ensure the appropriate case is corrected, deleted, or updated. b. Complete section D. Corrections or section F. Follow -Up Information, as applicable. c. Make a legible copy of the original form and mail the copy to the State Cancer Registry, keeping the original at your hospital. 3. Corrections for Multiple Patients Corrections for multiple patients, such as those identified on a discrepancy report from the State Cancer Re gistry, may be submitted by one of the following two methods: a. Write the correct information next to the error message on the discrepancy report and return the corrected report to the State Registry; or b. Record the corrections on the Correction Form f or Multiple Patients explained in Part IV of this chapter. 4. Corrections by Telephone Changes may be submitted by calling the State Cancer Registry at (317) 233 -7158 with the correction or deletion. Changes of this type should be limited to five patie nts or less. Be prepared to identify the case by patient name, sequence number, and possibly date of birth or Social Security Number so that State Registry staff can change the correct record. 5. Computerized Registries Follow -Up and Recurrence When th e State Registry processes disks received from hospitals with computerized registries, the most current follow -up information is automatically entered into the computer from the Corrections And Follow -up Chapter 6 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 268 diskettes. This includes date of last contact or death, patient's vital statu s, and cause of death, if applicable. Other Changes (Corrections or Deletions) All other information the hospital may have changed, updated, or corrected in any previously reported case is NOT automatically updated in the computer when the disks are pro cessed. These changes must be reported manually, in writing, or verbally. The information will not be automatically updated in order to prevent writing over data which had been previously corrected or consolidated by State Registry staff. The system at the State Registry is designed so that when reports for a single case are received from multiple hospitals and there are significant differences in the information reported, they are not permitted to write over each other or merge until State Registry sta ff have analyzed and researched the differences and determined the best information and/or codes. The cases are then manually changed and consolidated. The work of the State Registry staff would be lost if new information from one of the hospitals could write over any changes made in the consolidation process. The consolidation process is described in more detail in Chapter 7 of this manual. E. Where to Send Correction and Follow -Up Reports Envelopes should be carefully sealed and labeled CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION. The envelope should be clearly addressed: Indiana State Cancer Registry Indiana State Department of Health 2 North Meridian Street, Section 6-B Indianapolis, IN 46204 -3010 All reports submitted must be legible. Illegible forms will be returned to the hospital. The hospital should keep a record of reports submitted to the State. Cancer Registry personnel will keep track of reports received from each hospital. F. Confidentiality As correction and follow -up reports are being c ompleted, care should be taken to ensure that the content of each is treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as the medical record. These reports are abbreviated medical records and should be treated as such. A full discussion of confidentiality is found in Chapter 8 of this manual. PART II. FOLLOW -UP Reporting annual follow -up data to the State Cancer Registry is optional. The State encourages hospitals to report follow -up information whenever possible in order to obtain a more co mplete record. Accurate and complete information about the current health of each patient may be difficult to obtain, but the importance of collecting this information is undeniable. A. Frequency of Follow -Up Follow -up efforts should be initiated on tho se patients for whom no information has been received within the last 12 months. Cases are considered delinquent if no contact has been made within 15 months after the date of last contact. A follow -up (tickler) file must be maintained, either manually o r by computer, by which to identify patients due for follow -up. For hospitals that submit follow -up information, it is recommended that follow -up data collection be a monthly task of the hospital that first treats a case. B. Cases to Include in Follow -Up The American College of Surgeons, Commission on Cancer, requires annual follow -up on all analytic cases . Chapter 5 Follow -up and Additional Data Coding Instructions Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 269 A hospital may elect to report recurrence or follow -up information on any case that has been reported to the State Cancer Registry. See Chapter 3 on Reporting for further information on the reportable cases. Patient of advanced age and stage of disease should not be assumed deceased and withdrawn from follow -up after a prescribed time period. These patients may have exceptional responses and occa sionally be long -term survivors. C. Cases Not to Include in Follow -Up Carcinoma in situ of the cervix Non-analytic cases (cases neither diagnosed nor receiving any part of the first course of therapy at the reporting hospital) Patients residing in foreign countries Cases which were not required to be reported to the State Cancer Registry (see Chapter 3, Section D of this manual. ) D. Data Fields to Include in Follow -Up The State Cancer Registry needs minimal follow -up data on patients in its database in o rder to calculate survival time from date of cancer diagnosis to date of death. This data includes: Date of last contact or death Patient's vital status (alive or dead) Cancer status (with or without disease) A full explanation of these items is found i n Chapter 5 of this manual. There are additional data items relating to recurrences and follow -up that hospitals may want to collect for their registries: date and type of first recurrence, distant site(s) of first recurrence, and subsequent treatment f or persistent or recurrent disease. Since the State Registry does not collect these items, they will not be explained here. Please refer to the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards ( FOR DS) for coding rules and information. E. Follow -Up Sources 1. Most follow -up information is obtained through review of hospital readmissions, outpatient visits, or letters to the patient's physician. Hospitals are encouraged to share follow -up information with other facilities that are following the same patient. R emember to re -contact physicians even though the first contact may not have been productive. After a period of time, the patient may have returned for a subsequent visit to the physician. When these methods are not effective in providing follow -up inform ation, a variety of other sources may be employed. 2. Hospital policy, consistent with legal requirements for confidentiality, should be developed governing potential contact with relatives, friends, etc. If hospital policy permits, patients may be conta cted by letter or telephone. All patient contact should be accomplished in a responsible and compassionate manner. Many hospitals' policies caution against mention of the patient's diagnosis. 3. Voter Registration roles can be a source of addresses for patients who have moved. Date of the last election in which the patient voted or date of registration to vote may be used as the date of last contact if no further information can be obtained. 4. Miscellaneous methods of locating patients include the Soc ial Security Administration office, medical and life insurance companies, local utility companies, and credit bureaus. Most of these sources will provide only last known address. Corrections And Follow -up Chapter 6 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 270 5.

OVERVIEW Definition Quality control is the cancer registry function concerned with the assessment and improvement of dat a quality. The characteristics of quality include case completeness, data accuracy, data completeness, and timeliness. Goals To detect and correct errors or omissions in existing data; To identify and effectively address opportunities for improvement in training, documentation, and/or systems in order to assure the quality of subsequent data collection. Responsibility A designated CTR (Certified Tumor Registrar) is responsible for the quality assurance program. Qualified, experienced CTRs conduct qualit y assurance activities. Components of Quality Control The State Registry quality control activities include the following: Analysis of observed/expected completeness rates Casefinding audits Reabstracting and re -coding audits Visual editing of data quali ty Computer editing of data quality Evaluation and consolidation of case -sharing and duplicates Procedure manual (documentation) maintenance Staff training and development Feedback and consultation from quality control activities to data collectors Resolut ion of discrepancies B. ASSESSMENT/IMPROVEME NT OF DATA ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS 1. Observed/Expected Completeness Rates Case Volume Case volume is monitored to assess and improve the completeness of data. The actual number of cases reported by each facility is compared to an estimated expected volume. The expected case volume for a year is based on an assessment of the number of cases reported in each of the preceding five years. An annual caseload can be estimated by the number of acute care medic al and surgical beds at the facility. A hospital with 250 acute medical and surgical beds may typically see 250 new cancer cases per year. For small hospitals without radiation therapy centers, this figure is probably within 20% of the actual caseload fo r the first years of the registry. For hospitals offering radiation therapy, 50% is added to the total number of beds to determine annual caseload (e.g., a hospital with 100 beds would see 150 cancer cases per year). This formula is not reliable for majo r referral centers. When fewer reports are received than expected for a given year, the reporting source is contacted to assess the reason. If the decline in number of cases is not the result of an explainable cause, such as a change in facility service s or an abstracting backlog, the facility will be asked to review casefinding procedures. The Indiana State Cancer Registry personnel will be available for consultation and assistance in the review. A review would include an examination of the hospital's patient index; pathology reports; chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and outpatient logs; diagnostic or disease index; and print -outs of cancer -related diagnostic codes from the billing system. Quality Control Chapter 7 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 276 Patterns Indiana data is compared with national averages in order to assess and improve the completeness of data. Based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, the proportion of cases from each of the common organ sites is compared to Indiana da ta and used to determine whether Indiana data are comparable to national data. Any discrepancies will be investigated. 2. Casefinding Audits Casefinding audits are performed to assess and improve the completeness of reporting. The audit is a study to v erify that a facility is reporting all applicable newly diagnosed cancer cases and to help the facility improve casefinding procedures if needed. The audit involves reviewing the facility's casefinding procedures and all sources for potential cases in the facility. The cases identified in this review are compared with cases reported and missed cases are documented. The reviewer calculates a completeness rate from these numbers and compares the rate with the completeness rate goal of 95%. Separate proced ures are available describing in more detail how casefinding audits are conducted. Each year the State Registry will select up to 20% of Indiana hospitals for casefinding audits. Sample specifications will be based on hospital annual caseload. Six mont hs will be reviewed for hospitals with 0 -100 annual cases. Three months will be reviewed for hospitals with 101 -499 annual cases. One month will be reviewed for hospitals with 500 or more annual cases. The State Registry will make consultative recommen dations to the hospital registrar during the audit and will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. 3. Reabstracting Audits Reabstracting audits are performed to asses s and improve data accuracy in terms of the data collectors' adherence to established principles of coding, abstracting, and staging. The audit involves reviewing the facility's source records for randomly selected cases and reabstracting selected data elements. The reabstracted items are compared with the facility's abstract and discrepancies are reviewed to identify needs for clarification, corrections, and education. Separate procedures are available describing in more detail how reabstracting audits are conducted. Each year the State Registry will select up to twelve (10%) Indiana hospitals for reabstracting audits. The sample will be limited to a subset of cases diagnosed the previous year in the same half of the year as the time of the audit. The State Registry staff will make consultative recommendations to the hospital registrar at the time of the audit and will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. 4. Recoding Audits Recoding audits may be performed to assess and improve the accuracy of data from new coders or from coders with educational needs identified by other quality control activities. The audits involve independently reassigning codes to abstract ed text information or from copies of specific medical record documentation requested from the facility. The recoded items are compared with the original codes submitted and discrepancies are analyzed to identify needs for clarification, correction, and education. The State Registry staff will submit a written report of results and recommendations to the hospital and the State Registry within thirty days of the audit. 5. Quality Control for Newly Submitted Cases Each new submission of cases is loaded i nto a subsystem and subjected to both visual and computer edits before being transferred into the main database. Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 277 a. Visual Edits Visual editing is performed to assess and improve data accuracy and completeness. Visual reviews are performed on cases recei ved by State Cancer Registry staff to determine if data are complete, as well as, logical and internally consistent. Visual editing includes assessment of frequency reports of required items for blank items or invalid codes. It may involve analysis of listings with specified data items for all cases in a subsystem. It may involve one hundred per cent review of each abstract when the cases involve difficult diagnoses, are from new coders, or are from coders with educational needs identified by other quali ty control activities. Dates of birth, accession years, admission and discharge, initial diagnosis, and treatment are monitored for logical progression. Accession number, sequence number, and class of case are visually reviewed for logic. Agreement with l aterality, site codes, histology, and sex are reviewed for logical consistency. Completeness is assessed by monitoring the number of unknowns or blanks in demographic and cancer data. The reporting source is contacted as needed for correction, clarifica tion, or completion of required data elements. Transcription accuracy reflects the quality of procedures for transferring the data from the paper abstract to electronic medium. For cases entered from paper abstracts by State Cancer Registry personnel, ea ch screen is carefully checked against the abstract for transcription errors prior to transfer to the main database. b. Computer Edits The State Cancer Registry develop and apply State -required computerized edit sets based on those from the NAACCR standar d edits that are required by NPCR. These edits are provided to RMCDS hospitals; are available to facilities using other registry systems as part of the FTP submission procedure; and are made available to other vendors for incorporation into their registry systems. The computerized edit sets assess the accuracy of all data received by applying standard computerized data edits. The computerized edits include the following: single field (to check for valid codes), multi -field (to check for consistency and logic between different fields), multi -record (to check for consistency between multiple sequences), and multi -database (to check for consistency between different hospitals seeing the same patient for the same tumor). Inconsistencies or discrepancies not detected during manual edit checks are identified by these edits. The Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems' (RMCDS) edit program, though no longer updated by the vender, are applied by the State Cancer Registry to identify potential Indiana ZIP code/county code inconsistencies that are not addressed by the NAACCR edits. State Registry staff members analyze the edit reports and the abstracts and make corrections as indicated. When the staff member determines that the original information is correct, the ed it is overridden and the reason is recorded in the Comments section. When the analysis of computerized edits identifies variations from coding rules or incomplete information, the issues are reported to the responsible facility for correction, clarifica tion, or completion of required data elements. Responses from the reporting source with justification and/or documentation supporting the original information are reviewed and changes made as indicated. Quality control reviews are performed on reports be fore the data are released. In addition to the routine computerized edit checks, the subset of cases used in the report is checked for duplicate Quality Control Chapter 7 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 278 cases to ensure patients are not counted more than once for each tumor. Patterns in the data are studied for inconsistencies. For example, a listing of pediatric cases containing colon, breast, or prostate cancers would identify a need for further review and action 6. Consolidation The State Cancer Registry may receive duplicate reports for a single case from the same hospital, multiple hospitals, nonhospital facilities, death records, or another state registry. State Cancer Registry staff identify duplicate reports for a single case, resolve any discrepancies between reports, and consolidate the reports into a single record. Applicable multiple primary rules of the standard - setting organizations are applied. The purpose of consolidation procedures is to accurately determine cancer incidence in Indiana. Identification of Duplicate Cases The process of ident ifying duplicate reports (that have been submitted electronically) is initiated when recently received cases are transferred into the main database. See Attachment B, Procedure for Transferring Subsystems to the Main Database. The following mechanisms ar e used to identify potential duplicates: computer -automated merges, computer -generated identification of potential duplicates (error reports), manual search of the database by Social Security Number, and periodic execution of computerized multiple sequence consistency checking. Computer -automated Merges When critical identifying data elements are identical (e.g., patient name, Social Security Number, date of birth, sex, sequence number, primary site code), the oncoming case merges with the duplicate case i n the main database. A list of all such merges is generated by the system and printed by staff for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section below. Error and Possible Match Reports When some, but not all, critical, identifying data elem ents are identical, the oncoming case is added as a new case into the main database. The system identifies most of these cases on either the Error Report or the Possible Match Report. The Error Report lists the cases that match all critical elements exce pt the primary site and identifies each new case by the original case's Central Tumor Registry (CTR) number and a sequence in the 90's. The Possible Match Report lists the cases that match all critical elements except the sex, date of birth, or Social Sec urity Number and identifies each new case by a newly assigned CTR number with the sequence as reported. The reports are printed by staff for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section below. Note: The system does not identify possible m atches that differ only in sequence, last name, or some variations in first name (e.g., Theodore versus Ted). Most of these are identified by Multiple Sequence Report analysis or the Social Security Number search procedure. Social Security Number Search After resolution of potential duplicates identified by the Error and Possible Match Reports, staff search the main database by the Social Security Numbers of all the oncoming cases, identifying additional potential duplicates for analysis described in the Analysis of Discrepancies section below. Computerized Multiple Sequence Consistency Checking The system's Multiple Sequence Consistency Checking identifies discrepancies between legitimate multiple primary cases, as well as potential duplicate cases that may not have been resolved in the procedures described above. This program is executed periodically and all discrepancies and potential duplicates are analyzed and resolved. The process of identifying duplicate reports (that have been submitted in other than electronic format) is initiated by manually searching the main database and subsystems. Matched records for the same patient are compared, using applicable multiple primary rules to determine whether Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 279 the same primary is involved. If the reports are determined to be for the same primary, the analysis of discrepancies process described below is applied. Analysis of Discrepancies The abstracts for each of the potentially duplicate cases are opened and reviewed side by side so that all data items are c ompared and any discrepancies identified. For cases that were automatically merged, the original abstract for oncoming case is available as the pristine record, which can be opened and compared with the existing abstract. Discrepancies between patient identifying data items may be resolved by searching the Social Security Death Index, if applicable. The reporting facilities may also be contacted for review of their source records for the correct information. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are duplicate cases, the abstract that will be the consolidated record (the case with the earlier date -on- file) is corrected as applicable. Discrepancies between cancer identifying data items and treatment data are reviewed with analysis of supporting text; assessment of the more extensive diagnostic work -up; consideration of class of case and dates seen; and appropriate application of coding rules. The more accurate and complete information is identified. The reporting facilities may also be contacted for review of their source records for clarification. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are duplicate cases, the abstract that will be the consolidated record (the case with the earlier date -on-file) is corrected as applicable. If the analysis results in a determination that the reports are duplicate cases that have not been automatically merged, they are manually merged. The oncoming case is merged to the case with the earlier date -on-file (the consolidated case) by deleting the oncoming case and entering the consolidated case CTR number and sequence in the box provided by the system. The consolidated records for all merged cases retain the facility -specific information (accession number, sequence, admission and dis charge dates, medical record number, and class of case) for up to ten facilities. In addition, the original abstract submitted by each facility is retained as a pristine record. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are separate primaries (same patient) , both reports are saved. (If these were computer -automated merges, the cases are unmerged.) Sequencing is updated, and any discrepancies between CTR number, Social Security Number, race, date of birth, place of birth, date last se en, vital status, and cause of death are resolved and corrected. If the analysis results in a determination that the cases are separate primaries (different patients) , both reports are saved. After cases have been consolidated and pass all computerized e dit checks, inter -record edit checks are applied periodically to identify and resolve inconsistencies between multiple primary records for one patient. Facility Feedback When the analysis of discrepancies identifies variations from coding rules, the issu es are reported to the responsible facility for educational purposes. 7. Procedure Manual Maintenance Current, written documentation of the State Registry's definitions and methods are maintained in a policy and procedure manual, which is provided to all State Registry employees, contract consultants, and employees of reporting facilities. The manual documents the Registry's data set definitions, codes, coding rule interpretations, and procedures. The standards of ACoS, NAACCR, and SEER are incorporated in the manual to the extent possible. Appropriate portions of the documentation will be provided to investigators and users of the data, as needed, to explain definitions and methods. Quality Control Chapter 7 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 280 A Policy and Procedure Manual maintenance system is used for updatin g the documentation and keeping it current. The system involves monitoring release of new standards, rules, and definitions by ACoS, NAACCR, and SEER. Information from quality control activities are also be used in assessing the need to revise the proced ure manual. When revised, dated pages are provided to all Registry staff, contract consultants, and reporting facilities. A library of revisions to the manual is kept at the State Cancer Registry. When revised, dated pages are provided to all Registry staff, contract consultants, and reporting facilities. The State Cancer Registry also maintains an unusual case reference file to aid in consistent data collection for difficult cancers. 8. Staff Training and Development The State Cancer Registry prov ide training opportunities for employees of the State Registry and employees of reporting facilities. Training programs are developed in cooperation with the Indiana Cancer Registrars Association, Indiana Health Information Management Association, and Roc ky Mountain Cancer Data Systems. Training will provide feedback to State Cancer Registry staff on the quality and effectiveness of services provided to reporting sources and the public. Training programs are based on standard reference manuals and may a ddress the following areas: Anatomy and physiology Medical terminology Site specific or other topics in oncology Reporting requirements Confidentiality and information security Casefinding Abstracting/coding/staging Follow -up Quality control Data processi ng (computer software) American College of Surgeons updates Hospital based cancer/tumor registry management Topics identified through other quality control activities 9. Feedback and Consultation The results of quality control activities are reported to the applicable data collector to maintain data quality and eliminate recurring errors. Feedback may be written or by telephone call or one -on-one meetings. Feedback to the reporting facilities include the following: Information about changes or correcti ons made to abstracts at the State Registry Discrepancy lists resulting from computer or visual edits Results of casefinding and reabstracting audits with analysis of discrepancies and recommendations for improvement Information from analysis of observed/e xpected completeness rates. The abstractor's identification and date completed are required items in the RMCDS and are useful in identifying contacts for feedback. A complete list of the abstractors and/or contact person for each hospital is maintained a t the State Cancer Registry. When feedback is indicated, the questions are directed to the person on this list. C. ISSUES RELATED TO QU ALITY 1. Timeliness of Data Data collection must be conducted according to schedule. With the exception of early deat hs, no case should be abstracted less than four months after admission. Abstracting too soon may result in the omission of important information from the database if complete information is unavailable at the time of abstracting. Cases are due at the Sta te Registry no later than six months following a confirmed Chapter 7 Quality Control Indiana Cancer Re gistry 2015 Draft 281 diagnosis. Abstracting too late reduces the usefulness of the cancer registry data and reports. Cases submitted by each reporting source are monitored for timely receipt. 2. Personnel Data coll ection in reporting facilities must be performed by knowledgeable and qualified individuals. The individuals serve as the primary abstractors and may be responsible for staff supervision, cancer case auditing, and report writing. The Commission on Cance r, American College of Surgeons encourages registry staff to maintain Certified Tumor Registrar (CTR) credentials. The State Cancer Registry can provide hospitals with information on how to become a CTR, certified by the National Cancer Registrars Associa tion (NCRA). Information on NCRA is found in Chapter 1 on References. 3. Use of References and Edits Hospital staff should use available reference materials, many of which are free, rather than trying to memorize codes. Hospitals with computerized regi stries should ensure all records pass computer edits at the hospital level before sending data to the State. Standard edits, such as the EDITS project system developed by NAACCR, are available from standard setting organizations. 4. Maintenance of Logs a nd Records Hospitals must keep documentation by date sent of reports submitted to the State Cancer Registry. Hospitals submitting paper abstracts must submit a legible copy of the original to the State Cancer Registry and keep the original for their reco rds. State Cancer Registry personnel will keep a copy of discrepancy reports returned to the reporting source for completion, clarification, and correction. 5. Submitting Correction or Follow -Up Chapter 6 details how to submit corrections and follow -up information. Two correction forms, which permit changes or deletions to be made to the Hospital Abstract Form, are explained. The Correction and Follow -Up Form also allows reporting of annual follow -up information. 6. Other Resources Further informatio n on quality control procedures may be obtained by requesting Volume I: Cancer Program Standards published by the Commission on Cancer, American College of Surgeons. The State Cancer Registry complies with the NAACCR Standards for Cancer Registries , Volum III: Standards for Completeness , Quality , Analysis , and Management of Data. Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 282 CHAPTER 8: CONFIDENTIALITY A. OVERVIEW 1. Purpose The State Cancer Registry is committed to preserving the confidentiality of information obtained for medical, educationa l, research, and statistical purposes. Confidentiality policies and procedures are maintained in all phases of the State Registry operations in order to: Protect the privacy of individual patients; Protect the privacy of the facilities reporting the case s; Abide by applicable confidentiality -protecting legislation or administrative rules. 2. Definition Confidential data includes any information that identifies a specific patient, health care professional, or institution. The obligation to protect confi dentiality extends indefinitely, even after the death of the patient. Legal requirements for confidentiality are described in IC 16 -38-2-(4-7) and 410 IAC 21 -1-5, found in Appendix A. B. RESPONSIBILITY 1. Reporting Source (Hospital or Other Health Care Provider) The reporting source (hospital or other health care provider) is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of registry data collected and maintained on site and for submitting data to the State Registry in a way that protects confidentiali ty. The hospital should develop and implement confidentiality policies and procedures that address staff training, access control, record/abstract handling and storage, and release of registry data. Paper abstracts must be handled and stored in a way th at prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing confidential data. Information maintained in computerized systems must be protected by physical and electronic measures to control access to confidential data. Hospitals should mail copies of completed ab stracts and/or patient record copies promptly to the State Registry, following the instructions in Chapter 3 of this manual for sealing and labeling the container and for keeping records of the cases submitted. 2. State Registry The Program Director is u ltimately responsible for information security at the State Registry. This responsibility includes ensuring that State Registry staff are accountable for compliance with the confidentiality policies and procedures of this chapter. C. STATE REGISTRY POLIC IES AND PROCEDURES 1. Staff Awareness a. All State Registry personnel and consultants receive specific training about the confidentiality of registry information and their responsibilities. b. All personnel handling or having access to cancer registry da ta are required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. This includes staff from other departments, sections, or programs that are outside the State Cancer Registry but within the Indiana State Department of Health. The agreement documents that the employee has read and understands the State Cancer Registry policies for handling the data, agrees to abide by the policies, and is aware that failure to comply with any of these requirements constitutes a class A misdemeanor which Chapter 8 Confidentiali ty Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 283 will result in disciplinary acti on in accordance with State policies. The agreement remains in effect after cessation of employment. A copy of the Confidentiality Agreement is available from the State Cancer Registry upon request. 2. Access Control a. A current, written list of person s with legitimate access to confidential cancer data is kept in the State Cancer Registry office. The nature and extent of their access to registry data are defined and are restricted to the information needed to do his/her job. b. All file cabinets wher e confidential data are stored in open areas are locked except when in use by authorized State Cancer Registry staff. The file room designated for the Cancer Registry Program is locked except when authorized State Cancer Registry staff are present. c. Employees are provided with the equipment for ensuring the physical security of confidential information. Confidential patient abstracts are stored in locked file cabinets. Backup tapes of the statewide database are stored in a locked, fireproof safe. d. Field staff maintain abstracts and/or printed reports in locked briefcases which are kept in a secure place when unattended. Access to confidential information is limited to authorized hospital personnel. Discussions regarding patient records occur only in settings where privacy is assured. e. The computer system provides access only to authorized individuals. The system has a three tiered level of security. 1) The first level is the user Login Name. Each central registry staff logging into the networ k file server must enter his/her unique user login name. 2) The second level is the confidential password, established by the user. The password is altered on a regular basis and when there is concern that security may be in jeopardy. 3) The third level is the password to gain entry to the Rocky Mountain Cancer Data Systems (RMCDS) software. Network users who need the data for epidemiologic studies may be allowed limited access to only the non -confidential portions of the database. The RMCDS program is set up to allow Read Only for such individuals. When a user is no longer employed at the State Registry, his/her password and access codes are deactivated immediately. f. Disclosure or sharing of codes, numbers, or names used to access the computer i s strictly prohibited. g. When printed reports containing confidential information are no longer needed, they are disposed of by shredding. 3. Data Collection and Management a Electronically Submitted Data The State supports the programs described below that ensure the secure transmission of electronic cancer data by reporting facilities. 1) The FTP Program The preferred method for submitting data is the ISCR FTP Program that encrypts the facility's data file and sends it to the ISCR through the Internet using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). If the facility prohibits or limits the use of FTP, the program can also send the encrypted file as an e -mail attachment. The method meets government security requirements. Confidentiality Chapter 8 2015 Draft Indiana Cancer Registry 284 2) Web Plus An alternate method is the Web Plus program that securely uploads the facility's data file through a browser. The method also meets government security requirements. b. Submitting on Diskettes Effective July 2009 the State Cancer Registry no longer processes data submitted on diskettes. Diskettes received and processed prior to this date have been securely backed up to a server and have been destroyed by the Commission on Public Records. c. Abstract Forms & Paper Copies of Medical Records Mail labeled CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INF ORMATION is opened only by designated State Registry staff. Such mail is kept in a secure location before and after it is processed. State Cancer Registry personnel stamp each form with the date received and maintain a register by hospital documenting t he date the batch was received, the date the batch was entered, the number of forms enclosed, and the accession year for the cases. The State Registry retains the abstract forms and registers indefinitely. After processing, abstract forms are filed by ho spital, accession year, and accession number. d. Quality Control Communications When State Registry quality control (QC) activities require returning abstracts, inquiry forms, or discrepancy lists to reporting facilities, the mailings are carefully seale d and labeled CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION. When telephone calls are made to address QC issues, reasonable efforts are made to ensure the conversations are private and addressed to an authorized data collector at the reporting facility. When QC com munications are transmitted by electronic mail (e -mail), patient -identifying information will be limited to accession numbers. Patient -identifying e -mail received at the State Registry is treated with the same level of security and confidentiality as othe r confidential medical information. e. Facsimile Transmission Confidential information should be transmitted via facsimile only when urgently needed for patient care. When such transmission is necessary, the cover page will include a confidentiality not ice that indicates the information is confidential and limits its use. After transmission, a follow -up call will be made to verify that the information was sent to the appropriate destination. 4. Disaster Recovery The Indiana State Department of Health I nformation Technology Services is responsible for the comprehensive disaster recovery plan that includes the State Cancer Registry data and systems. The plan includes frequent and regular backup, off -site storage, and procedures for retrieval. It is designed to protect operating systems, applications, and data. 5. Sabotage Anti-virus software is used to help detect and block computer viruses and other forms of sabotage. 6. Release of Registry Data a. Hospital Requests Confidential information may be r eleased by authorized State Registry personnel to health care providers and institutions upon verbal or written request and without further review procedures under either of the following circumstances: 1. The requestor is directly involved in the care or follow -up of the patient; 2) The information requested is from the hospital's own registry. b. Patient or Individual Requests Chapter 8 Confidentiali ty Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 285 The State Cancer Registry staff do not respond to individuals requesting whether or not the State Registry contains informatio n about them. Individuals making such requests are referred to their treating physician. c. Physician Requests Confidential information may be released to physicians and local health officers for diagnostic and treatment purposes if the patient signs a written consent and the patient's attending physician gives verbal or written consent to the release. d. Other States Pursuant to IC 16 -38-2-7, effective May 15, 1988, the Indiana Cancer Registry may release confidential information concerning individual cancer patients to the cancer registry of another state under the following condition: The other state has entered into a reciprocal agreement with the State Cancer Registry which provides that information that identifies a patient will not be released t o any other person without the written consent of the patient. e. Other External Requests 1) Requests for use of confidential data are handled in accordance with IC 16 -38-2-(5-7). 2) Confidential cancer registry data will not be made available for the fo llowing purposes: a) Businesses that are trying to market a product to cancer patients; b) Health care institutions that are trying to recruit new patients; c) Insurance companies that are trying to determine the medical status of a patient. 3) Requests for State Cancer Registry data for other purposes, such as research projects, are processed as outlined below. a) The request must be submitted in writing and include the following information: The purpose for which data are needed or an outline of the pr oposed research with a justification of the need for the data; The information required; The names of the persons who will have access to the confidential information; The time period for which the data are needed.

This Act may be cited as the \"Benign Brain Tumor Cancer Registries Amendm ent Act.\" SEC. 2. NATIONAL PROGRAM OF CANCER REGISTRIES; BENIGN BRAIN -RELATED TUMORS AS ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF DATA COLLECTED. (a) IN GENERAL - Section 399B of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280e), as redesignated by section 502(2)(A) of Pub lic Law 106 -310 (114 Stat. 1115), is amended in subsection (a) -- (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as subparagraphs (A) through (E), respectively, and indenting appropriately; (2) by striking \"(a) IN GENERAL - The Secretary\" and inserting the following: (a) IN GENERAL - (1) STATEWIDE CANCER REGISTRIES - The Secretary; (3) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) (as so redesignated), by striking \"population -based\" and all that follows through \"data\" and inserting the following: population -based, statewide registries to collect, for each condition specified in paragraph (2)(A), data; and (4) by adding at the end the following: (2) CANCER; BENIGN BRAIN -RELATED TUMORS - (A) IN GENERAL - For purposes of paragraph (1), the conditions referred to in this paragraph are the following: (i) Each form of in -situ and invasive cancer (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), including malignant brain -related tumors. (ii) Benign brain -related tumors. (B) BRAIN -RELATED TUMOR - For p urposes of subparagraph (A): (i) The term \"brain -related tumor\" means a listed primary tumor (whether malignant or benign) occurring in any of the following sites: (I) The brain, meninges, spinal cord, cauda equina, a cranial nerve or nerves, or any other part of the central nervous system. (II) The pituitary gland, pineal gland, or craniopharyngeal duct. (ii) The term \"listed,\" with respect to a primary tumor, means a primary tumor that is listed in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (commonly referred to as the ICD -O). (iii) The term \"International Classification of Diseases for Oncology\" means a classification system that includes topography (site) information and histology (cell type information) developed by the World Health Orga nization, in collaboration with international Legislation and Regulations PUBLIC LAW 107 -260 Appendix A Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 301 centers, to promote international comparability in the collection, classification, processing, and presentation of cancer statistics. The ICD-O system is a supplement to the International Statistical Classifica tion of Diseases and Related Health Problems (commonly known as the ICD) and is the standard coding system used by cancer registries worldwide. Such term includes any modification made to such system for purposes of the United States. Such term further includes any published classification system that is internationally recognized as a successor to the classification system referred to in the first sentence of this clause. (C) STATEWIDE CANCER REGISTRY - References in this section to cancer registries shall be considered to be references to registries described in this subsection. (b) APPLICABILITY - The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to grants under section 399B of the Public Health Service Act for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent fiscal years, except that, in the case of a State that received such a grant for fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may delay the applicability of such amendments to the State for not more than 12 months if the Secretary determines that compliance wi th such amendments requires the enactment of a statute by the State or the issuance of State regulations. Indiana Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 302 APPENDIX B: REPORTABLE LIST The definitions in the State Cancer Registry Policy and Procedure Manual describe reportable cases in terms of their ICD-O-3 topography and morphology codes. These pages contain all reportable malignancies with an International Classification of Diseases of Oncology, Third Edition ( ICD-O-3) behavior code of /2 or /3. Diagnoses with a behavior code of /0 (benign) or /1 (borderline) are not reportable to the State Cancer Registry except for intracranial and central nervous tumors diagnosed 01/01/2004 and later. See section B of this appendix for the reportable list of benign and borderline intracranial and central nervou s tumors. A. REPORTABLE MALIGNANCIES Conditions are to be reported if the diagnosis includes the words: Cancer Carcinoma (except certain basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, CIS, CIN III, and PIN III, as described in Chapter 3) Leukemia Lympho ma Malignant Melanoma Sarcoma The following terms, used as adjectives, are also to be reported when used in the description of a malignancy: Anaplastic Histiocytic Intraepithelial Keratinizing Medullary Moderately differentiated fferentiated Small cell Well differentiated The morphologic terms listed below are malignancies and should be reported. Changes in ICD-O-3 are identified by special formatting that is explained below. Underlined terms represent newly reportable morpholog y terms for 2010 diagnoses. Most, but not all, of the underlined terms have new ICD-O-3 codes associated with them. Highlighted items are terms that changed from borderline in ICD-O-2 to malignant in ICD-O-3 and are reportable if diagnosed on or after Jan uary 1, 2001. A strikethrough indicates the term was changed from malignant in ICD-O-2 to borderline in ICD-O-3 and is not reportable if diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001.

Cancer registrars are often faced with multiple pathology reports for patients with hematologic malignancies, and the diagnoses reported may require diffe rent morphology codes. This is due in part to the fact that more intensive diagnostic study may yield a more specific diagnosis, and in part to the natural histories of hematopoietic diseases, which may progress from one diagnosis into another. The table on the following pages, provided to aid the registrar in determining single versus subsequent primaries, employs the following guidelines: 1. Lymphoma is a general term for hematopoietic solid malignancies of the lymphoid series. Leukemia is a gener al term for liquid malignancies of either the lymphoid or the myeloid series. While it is recognized that some malignancies occur predominantly (or even exclusively) in liquid or solid form, because so many malignancies can potentially arise as either leu kemias or lymphomas (or both), all hematopoietic malignancies are assumed to have this potential. 2. Malignancies of the lymphoid series are considered to be different from those of the myeloid series. Therefore, a lymphoid malignancy arising after diagno sis of a myeloid malignancy (or myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorder) would be considered a subsequent primary; however, a myeloid malignancy diagnosed after a previous myeloid malignancy would not count as a subsequent primary. Histiocytic malignancies are considered different from both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. 3. Hodgkin lymphoma is considered to be different from non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Among the NHLs, B - cell malignancies are considered different from T -cell/NK cell malignancie s. Therefore, a B -cell malignancy arising later in the course of a patient previously diagnosed with a T -cell malignancy would be considered a subsequent primary. However, a T -cell malignancy diagnosed later in the same patient would not be considered a subsequent primary. 4. The sequence of diagnoses affects whether a diagnosis represents a subsequent primary. In some cases, the order of occurrence of the two diagnoses being compared is a factor in the decision as to whether the second diagnosis is a n ew primary. How to Use the Table Assign the ICD-O-3 code to the first diagnosis and find the row containing that code. Assign the ICD-O-3 code for the second diagnosis and find the column containing that code. In the cell at the intersection of the fir st diagnosis row and the second diagnosis column, an \" S\" symbol indicates that the two diagnoses are most likely the same disease process (prepare/update a single abstract), and a \" D\" indicates that they are most likely different disease processes (prepare more than one abstract). Note 1: If one of the two diagnoses is an NOS (not otherwise specified) term and the other is more specific and determined to be the same disease process, code the more specific diagnosis regardless of the sequence. For example , if a diagnosis of non -Hodgkin lymphoma, NOS is followed by a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, assign the morphology code for the follicular lymphoma. Note 2: The table on the following pages and the \"Complete Diagnostic Terms for Table (Based on ICD-O-3)\" display only the ICD-O-3 primary (boldfaced) term associated with the code. Refer to the International Classification of Diseases, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) for a complete list of related terms and synonyms. Prepared by: SEER Program, NCI, 02/28/2001.

E -mail: seerweb@ims.nci.nih.gov Indiana State Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 335 APPENDIX F: CODING TIPS Appendix F is under revision and unavailabl e at this time. Indiana State Cancer Registry 2015 Draft 336 APPENDIX G: SURGERY TREATMENT CODES DEFINITIONS AND RULE S Additional site -specific definitions and rules may be found with the site -specific codes. Surgical Procedure of Primary Site a. If registry software allows only one procedure t o be collected, document the most invasive surgical procedure for the primary site. If registry software allows multiple procedures to be recorded, Surgical Procedure of Primary Site refers to the most invasive surgical procedure of the primary site. b. For codes 00 through 79, the code positions are hierarchical. The codes' numeric sequence may deviate from the order in which the codes are listed. Last -listed codes take precedence over codes listed above, because: 1) Within groups of codes, procedure s are listed with increasing degrees of descriptive precision; and 2) Succeeding groups of codes define progressively more extensive forms of resection. Example for RECTOSIGMOID (C19.9): A polypectomy with electrocautery is coded 22. 20 tumor exci sion, NOS 26 Polypectomy 27 Excisional biopsy Combination of 20 or 26 -27 WITH 21 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) 22 Electrocautery 23 Cryosurgery 24 Laser ablation 25 Laser excision c. Use codes 80 and 90 only if more precise information about the surgery is u navailable. d. Code 98 applies to specific tumors that cannot be clearly defined in terms of primary or non -primary site. Use code 98 for the following: All hematopoietic/reticuloendothelial/immunoproliferative/myeloproliferative disease sites and/or histologies, WITH or WITHOUT surgical treatment; All unknown and ill -defined disease sites, WITH or WITHOUT surgical treatment. If any surgical treatment was performed on these cancers, assign code 1 in the item, Surgical Procedure/Other Site. e. Biopsie s that remove all of the tumor and/or leave only microscopic margins are to be coded in Surgical Procedure of Primary Site. f. Surgery to remove regional tissue or organs is coded in Surgical Procedure of Primary Site only if the tissue/organs are rem oved in continuity with the primary site, except where noted in Appendix G. g. If a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, then code the total or final result s. When multiple first course primary site surgical procedures are performed for a single tumor, the most extensive or definitive is the last performed, and the code should represent the cumulative effect of the separate procedures.
