Prior to your appointment we will discuss what you are looking for from your session, and with the information you provide I will create a special, loving environment for you to be in whilst I work with you. This isn't a passive session, this is a call for deep inner work. Though you will be and feel completely held & safe, this is a place for you to dive deep into yourself and see and feel your truth. To show up for yourself where you are needed & take sovereignty over your own journey. You are in control here. My approach is soft, kind & more yin in energy. You will be held in love, care and non judgement throughout this individual ceremony. There will be a range of healing therapies to come out of this session depending on what you need and where the energy needs balance. I may provide you with kundalini kriyas or meditations, mantras, affirmations, crystal healing, loving touch and connection with oils, and we will always conclude with a deeply healing sound bath with you comfortable on a massage bed. Everything will be provided for you to just be, and heal. SAT NAM x "}
