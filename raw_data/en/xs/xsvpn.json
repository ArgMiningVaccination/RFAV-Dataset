It is the oldest medical system on the planet and most other medical traditions have their roots in Ayurveda. Thousands of years ago 'India' covered a vast area, from Afghanistan to China. Ayur means 'Life' and Veda means 'knowledge'. [Ayurveda](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/ayurveda/) then is 'the knowledge of life'. It is a system whic helps us to understand our true nature and our relationship with everything around us. Ayurveda gives us the knowledge for a long and healthy life by offering a deep understanding of each person's unique body. Ayurveda allows us to recognise the true essence of a person and that we are totally unique. This is unlike modern western medicine, which likes to place people in categories, name their diseases, and rely upon trials, assuming that everyone is essentially the same. Historical evidence shows that Ayurveda has influenced almost all medical systems of the world. The Egyptians learnt about Ayurveda long before the invasion of Alexander in the 4th Century BC through their sea trade with India. Greeks and Romans came to learn of Ayurveda after the invasion of Alexander. It was through this connection that Unani medicine came about, which has its origins in Greek, Ayurvedic and Persian cultures. From AD100-300 Ayurveda spread to the East through Buddhism and influenced Chinese and Tibetan medicine. The Islamic physician Avicenna, who helped to form the European medical tradition via Unani medicine, strictly followed Ayurvedic principles. Even Paracelsus, sometimes considered to be the father of modern Western medicine, followed the basic teachings of Ayurveda. Greek medicine is very similar to Ayurveda and we will look at those similarities later in the course. Hippocrates is quoted as saying 'foolish is the physician who despises the wisdom of the ancients'. His many sayings clearly show his understanding of [Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/ayurveda/). Content 1.
