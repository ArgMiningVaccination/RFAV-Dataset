Since most pets' health problems are diagnosed once illness has become very advanced, it's vital to strive to prevent disease from occurring. What Can Veterinary Acupuncture Do for My Dog or Cat? Veterinary acupuncture stimulates the release of the body's own pain relieving and anti-inflammatory substances. Relaxation of muscles at the site of needle insertion and more distant locations body is achieved with veterinary acupuncture treatment, creating both a local and generalized pain relieving effect. Veterinary acupuncture improves tissue blood flow, oxygenation and removal of metabolic wastes and toxins. Unlike prescription and over the counter pain medications, veterinary acupuncture lacks potential adverse side effects for your pet's internal organs. Your pet's medications or supplements will not adversely interact with veterinary acupuncture treatment; therefore it can safely be used to treat a variety of illnesses. How Does Veterinary Acupuncture Work? The goal of acupuncture is to promote the body to heal itself. Acupuncture enhances blood circulation, nervous system stimulation, and the release of anti-inflammatory and pain relieving hormones. Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into body tissue where nerve bundles and blood vessels come together. These collections of nervous and vascular tissue are termed acupuncture points, which course over all aspects of the body's surface on meridians (energy channels). The meridians permit a cycle of energy to occur throughout the entire body over the course of the day's 24 hours. Boomer For owners who are contemplating acupuncture, this is one success story that you might want to read. This adorable little guy is Boomer; pictured with his dad, Dan. Boomer was paralyzed in the lower half of his body when came to us a month ago and was unable to empty his bladder or bowels on his own. We began acupuncture treatments and by the 3rd visit Boomer was beginning to stand and urinate a little on his own. After 6 treatments, not only was he standing, but running and urinating/defecating on his own! While his movement isn't 100% restored, Dr. Morris and staff are thrilled with the result! This is just one example of how acupuncture can work to improve motor function in animals with Intervertebral Disk Disease and/or neurological deficits. "}
