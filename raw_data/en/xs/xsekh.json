Whooping cough outbreak closes Waldorf school. Public health officials have ordered the The East Bay Waldorf School on El Sobrante, California, to temporarily close in response to an outbreak of whooping cough (pertussis) among its students. The victims include at least 16 children, about half of whom were in kindergarten. Whooping cough is spread through the air by coughs or sneezes, or by other close personal contact. The disease can be fatal to infants and can last for months in children and adults. Press reports indicate that fewer than half the students at the school were immunized against whooping cough. Statewide, about 98% are immunized against it, but California law enables parents to opt out for various reasons. [Wetzel KS.

Contra Costa Times, May 9, 2008] Waldorf schools are small, private campuses (about 800 throughout the world) whose teachings are based on the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner (1865-1925), an Austrian mystic who claimed to be clairvoyant and founded the religion of Anthroposophy.

Bachynsky convicted again. A federal jury has convicted Nicholas Bachynsky, M.D. of one count of conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud, and one count of securities fraud. The jury also returned a supplemental verdict forfeiting Bachynsky's interest in $450,000 in United States currency and two Swiss bank accounts. Bachynsky's conviction arose out of the marketing of stock and notes for Helvetia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was launched in early 2001 to administer and develop a worthless cancer treatment called intracellular hyperthermia therapy (ICHT). During the trial, the government proved that Helvetia's sales materials failed to disclose that ICHT is extremely dangerous and that Bachynsky's licenses had been revoked.
