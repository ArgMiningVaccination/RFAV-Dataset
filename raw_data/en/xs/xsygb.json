The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed support for Labor and the Coalition at 50 per cent two-party preferred. It has eliminated Labor's narrow two point lead over the Government, with the result falling within the poll's margin of error. The primary votes for Labor, the Coalition and the Greens have all declined slightly by one point each, with a three point rise in support for independents. According to The Australian, the Coalition's primary vote stands at 40 per cent, while Labor's sits at 35 per cent. The Greens are at 10 per cent with \"Others\" at 15 per cent. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull continues to lead Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as preferred Prime Minister, 45 per cent to 30 per cent. A number of other polls have also suggested a tight race, less than four weeks out from the July 2 federal election. The poll follows the launch of new video advertisements about Mr Turnbull's childhood. The video, released on Mr Turnbull's Facebook page on Sunday night, outlined the Prime Minister's admiration for his father Bruce Turnbull. \"He was a single father and we lived together. Two guys \u2014 big brother, little brother, really. It was that type of relationship,\" he said in the video. Bruce Turnbull, a hotel broker, died in a light plane crash in 1982. Another advertisement targets Labor's opposition to company tax cuts by using vision of the former treasurer Paul Keating announcing cuts to the corporate tax rate. Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten will both attend the RSL's Centenary national conference in Melbourne this morning. The event marks 100 years since the League's first conference was held in Melbourne. "}
