The expression \"Holoenergetic healing\" means \"healing with the energy of the whole.\" The method's premises include the following. (a) Separation is illusory. (b) Maintenance of this illusion requires \"energy.\" (c) Often, physical or mental ill ness or stress is symptomatic of such consumption of \"energy.\" (d) Releasing oneself from the illusion of separation liberates tremendous \"energy.\" (e) Healing is the gradual elimination of the illusion of separation. Holoenergetics comprises four stages: (1) the recognition phase, wherein the patient purportedly identifies the source of his or her illness; (2) the resonance phase, wherein the patient allegedly comes to terms with the aforementioned source; (3) release, wherein the patient supposedly releases the \"disharmonious energetic pattern\" associated with the source; and (4) the reformation phase, wherein, according to Laskow, the patient replaces the \"dysfunctional\" pattern with an image symbolizing \"the positive life-force intentthe energy that's aligned with the natural order and harmony of the inherent healing process of the body.\" hologramic hypnotherapy: Method promoted by Donna Michel of New York City. It includes guided visualization (see \"creative visualization\" and \"guided imagery\").

Hahnemann coined the word \"dynamis\" to refer to the \"vital force.\" His final theory held that the \"vital force\" is the source of all biological phenomena, that it becomes deranged during illness, and that appropriate homeopathic \"remedies\" work by restoring the \"vital force.\" The major principles of homeopathy include the following. (a) A substance with specific effects in a healthy person can cure a person with similar symptoms. (b) The process of repeated dilution and vigorous shaking of harmful substances renders them \"medically active\" yet \"free of side effects.\" (c) Each body has only one soul; thus, a person has only one core problem at a time, and only one remedy is necessary for a \"curative action.\" (d) Proper selection of a remedy requires taking into account numerous minutiae about the patient's situation. (e) \"Mind symptoms\" usually are more important than physical symptoms. (f) Humans are \"soul energy\" vibrating in an \"energy pattern\" (the so-called physical body).

In an essay titled \"My Mucusless Diet and Naturopathy,\" Ehret held that \"internal impurity\" was the only and that \"unusable elements,\" mainly from \"mucus-forming foods,\" caused it. \"Mucus-forming foods,\" according to one of Ehret's articles, include dairy products, eggs, fats, meat, and all starchy foods. In one of the 25 \"lessons\" that constitute the text of Mucusless Diet Healing System, Ehret, citing Genesis, called fruits and \"starchless greenleaf vegetables\" the \"natural food of man.\" Mucusless Diet Healing System: Subject of Prof. Arnold Ehret's book of the same name. The Mucusless Diet Healing System encompasses the mucusless diet, \"V\" stands for \"vitality,\" \"P\" for the \"power\" that keeps one alive, and for \"obstruction\": all \"internal impurities.\" The system's theory holds: (a) that a beard is a \"secondary sex organ\"; and (b) that \"natural\" love is the highest form of invisible nourishment from \"the infinite\" for body and soul. Multidimensional Cellular Healing (MCH): Apparently, a group of \"techniques\" that purportedly enables \"conscious connection to other realities\" and involves attaining a state of \"Holographic Beingness.\" Author and \"transformational healer\" Ken Page created the Field in which \"I.H. allegedly are who \"heal\" in and beyond the three-dimensional \"earth realm of reality.\" Apparently, Multi-dimentional healing is a form of vibrational medicine that includes distant healing (see \"absent healing\"), \"hands-on healing\" (see \"bodywork\"), manifestation (see \"manifesting\"), psychic heal ing, and a form or variation of angelic healing. multi incarnational recall and emotional body balancing: Mode of energy balancing developed by author Chris Griscom, founder of the Light Institute of Galisteo, in New Mexico. It purportedly uses techniques from Windows to the Sky acupressure to remove \"blockages\" and to facilitate recall of \"multi incarnations.\" Multi-Orgasmic Couple: A purported means of learning how to prevent the indiscriminate loss of \"sexual energy\" while one enhances \"spiritual growth.\" It is related to Healing Love. muscle testing {manual muscle testing, Muscle Response Testing (M.R.T.) technique, \"Muscle technique, M.R.T., M.R.T. system, M.R.T. technique, muscle-testing procedure}: Variety of procedures used with the supposed aim of tapping the body's \"innate intelligence\" and thereby determining the \"energy levels\" of \"life forces\" that control the body. Muscle testing is a component of every form of kinesiology (see above) and a purported means of discovering \"imbalances.\" Myofascial Release: Mode cleanses nadis, the alleged \"subtle vessels\" of the \"physical and subtle bodies.\" The purported result is a reduction of nervous tension. Nadi Sutra Kriya: Purportedly, a way of touching marmas to stimulate them and create a \"balancing effect.\" Natural Hygiene (Hygienic Health System, Life Science): Variation of Nature Cure represented by proponents as the legacy of Sylvester Graham (1794-1851). Graham, the originator of the graham cracker, began his career as a Presbyterian minister and temperance lecturer. He professed the following. (a) Frequent involuntary discharges of semen presage debility. (b) Ingestion of \"improper\" foods or overeating cause seminal discharges. (c) Masturbation brings on pimples and potentially fatal sores. (d) Digestion entails an expenditure of \"vital force.\" ... nadi shodhanam (channel purification): Yogic cleanses nadis, the alleged \"subtle vessels\" of the \"physical and subtle bodies.\" The purported result is a reduction of nervous tension. Nadi Sutra Kriya: Purportedly, a way of touching marmas to stimulate them and create a \"balancing effect.\" Natural Hygiene (Hygienic Health System, Life Science): Variation of Nature Cure represented by proponents as the legacy of Sylvester Graham (1794-1851). Graham, the originator of the graham cracker, began his career as a Presbyterian minister and temperance lecturer. He professed the following. (a) Frequent involuntary discharges of semen presage debility. (b) Ingestion of \"improper\" foods or overeating cause seminal discharges. (c) Masturbation brings on pimples and potentially fatal sores. (d) Digestion entails an expenditure of \"vital force.\" (e) Diet is a means of economizing the \"vital force.\" (f) A diet is healthful if it narrowly prompts the digestive organs to function normally. According to \"Hygienic\" literature, the first \"hygienic doctor\" was Isaac Jennings, M.D. (1788-1874), who taught that obedience to \"physical law\" facilitates obedience to \"moral law.\" Natural Hygiene's postulate is that disease is a process of \"purification\" and repair. The major \"Hygienic\" practices are fasting, food combining, and a form of veganism that emphasizes uncooked foods. Some \"Professional Natural Hygienists\" do not subscribe to food combining. Natural Medicine Path (the Medicine of the South, the Natural Medicine of the South): Mode of Cherokee healing. The Natural Medicine Path is an animistic form of herbalism. Nature Cure (Nature Care): Progenitor of naturopathy. Nature Cure is a variation of self-healing whose most important measures are fasting and rest. Originally, Nature Cure was a hydropathy-centered \"natural\" lifestyle. Its postulate is: (a) that all disease, barring accidents and the conse quences of hostile surroundings, is due to violations of \"nature's laws,\" and (b) that, therefore, \"true\" healing consists in a \"return\" to \"natural\" habits. Naturology: \"Religious science of health\" taught by the American Institute of Holistic Theology, a nonaccredited correspondence school in Youngstown, Ohio. Naturology is a theistic variation of naturopathy that includes acupressure, herbology, homeopathy, iridology, and Natural Hygiene. naturopathy (natural healing, natural health, natural medicine, natural therapies, nature cure, naturology, naturopathic healing, naturopathic health care, naturo pathic medicine): Miscellany encompasses auriculotherapy (ear balneotherapy (e.g., mud baths), cupping, electroacupuncture, fasting, the Grape Cure (and other mono-diets), hair analysis, herbalism, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, in ternal hydrotherapy (e.g., colonic irrigation), iridology, Jin Shin Do, medicine, Ortho-Bionomy, orthomolecular psychiatry, thalassotherapy (\"therapeutic\" use of seawater and sea air), Tuina, and zone therapy. Naturopathy originated in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in Germany. Dr. John H. Scheel, a German-born homeopath, coined the word \"naturopathy\" in 1895, when he opened the Sanitarium Badekur in New York. Vitalism is fundamental to naturopathy. neo-Reichian massage: System based on theories developed by Wilhelm Reich (see \"orgone therapy\" and \"Reichian Therapy\"). Practitioners purport patterns\" armoring\"). Reich postulated that obstructions to orgone neuroses and most physical disorders. Muscular contractions (\"body armor\") in various parts of the body supposedly manifest such \"blockages.\" Network Spinal Analysis (Network, Network Chiropractic, Network Chiropractic Spinal Analysis): Conspicuously vitalistic form of chiropractic founded in 1983 by Donald M. Epstein, D.C. It embraces the following principles. (a) An innate or \"resident\" intelligence (\"inborn wisdom\") governs all human biological processes through the nervous system and never harms the body. (b) This \"intelligence\" directs the \"life force\" (\"vital life energy\" force\"), which bestirs every cell. (c) Malposition of the spinal cord, nerves, and vertebrae can cause mechanical tension that may impede the \"vital life force.\" (d) Mental and chemical stress can cause such mechanical tension. (e) Removing mechanical impediments to the \"vital life force\" heightens the operation of \"innate intelligence\" naturally. (f) The universe and society are intrinsically good. Neural Organization Technique (NOT): Variation of cranial osteopathy (see \"CranioSacral Therapy\") developed by Carl A. Ferreri, D.C. neural therapy: Form of energy medicine (vibrational medicine) akin to acupuncture, developed in Germany circa 1930 by two brothers, Ferdinand and Walter Huneke (also spelled \"Huehneke\"). The Hunekes, both medical doctors, maintained that injections of local anesthetics into areas of \"energy\" disturbance (\"interference fields\") could relieve pain, immobility, and dysfunction. Injection sites include acupoints, scars, and the sites of old fractures or past infection. Purportedly, neural therapy energizes \"short-circuited\" cells and helps to regulate \"biological energy.\" Proponents recommend it for hundreds of health problems. neuro-bioenergetic treatment: Variation of acupuncture pioneered by Yee Wing Tong, M.D. It involves intramuscular injections of Novocain. NeuroBioFeedback (NBF): Combination of biofeedback and therapy.\" The Alexandria institute (Hastings-on-Hudson, New York) defines neural therapy as a \"non-invasive, highly effective means to create efficient brain function using only light and sound.\" NBF is a purported way to create \"healthy patterns of brain functioning.\" Its apparent postulate is that the mind and body can function well when the brain is \"fit\" and functioning well. Allegedly, NBF in conjunction with \"sport psychology mental skills training techniques\" may enable reaching \"the ZONE\" (see \"Three Phase Workout\") at will. One of NBF's major promoters is hypnotherapist and aromatherapist Bob Reese, A.T.C., C.P.P.T. (\"Certified Peak Performance Trainer.\"). New Age Shiatsu: Style of shiatsu developed by Zen priest Reuho Yamada, one of the teachers of Harold Dull NewBirth Process: Combination Its theory posits emotional, mental, and physical \"bodies\" that harbor \"dysfunctional blocks.\" New Era Dianetics: Variation of dianetics. Newtonian manifestation: Form of manifesting characterized by correction of mental pictures, especially of mundane wants such as cars, houses, and jobs. N.I.A. technique (NIA): Form of exercise promoted by Windows to the Sky, an organization in Chester, New York. It allegedly \"opens\" the heart and mind and integrates body, mind, and spirit. \"N.I.A.\" Daishonin (1222-1282), founder of nichiren-shu (\"School of the Lotus of the Sun\"). Daishonin was a militant Japanese patriot and a supposed incarnation of an early disciple of the Buddha. Chanting the Japanese expression \"Namu myoho renge-kyo\" (which literally means \"Veneration to the sutra [scriptural discourse] of the lotus of the good law [i.e, the Lotus Sutra]\") is the core of NS worship. NS chanting is an alleged means of gaining anything one wants, notably health, influence, and material assets. Nine Gates Training Program: Sequence whose foci are nine alleged bodily \"energy centers.\" It apparently encompasses Breema, kahuna healing, Reiki, and Sufi healing. Nine Star Ki: System of \"directionology\" and futuristic astrology based on the oriental theory of the Five Elements. Supposedly, it is a \"profound sci ence\" and the most comprehensive astrological s ystem. Members of the macrobiotic community reportedly use Nine Star Ki to determine the best directions in which to travel and which directions to avoid. Non-Contact Therapeutic Touch (NCTT): Variation of Therapeutic Touch (TT) that does not involve touching. In the early 1980s, NCTT replaced TT in the TT community. Apparently, \"Therapeutic Touch\" and \"TT\" now refer primarily to NCTT. Norse magic: Western European magical tradition. It is a form of ritual magic that supposedly enlists: (a) the Aesir (\"Asa-Gods\"), whose mythical home is Asgard; (b) \"Light\" (helpful) elves; (c) good dwarves; (d) the \"rulers of the Elements\"; and (e) dead ancestors. Norse magic allegedly promotes mental, physical, and spiritual health. Nsoromma Body Therapy: Combination of relaxation, shiatsu, and yoga promoted by painter Vivinne (Narmada) Williams, M.F.A. Nuad Bo Rarn (Thailand medical massage): Mode of bodywork wherein the practitioner manipulates the subject into hatha-yoga-like positions and thus allegedly facilitates the flow of \"energy\" in the subject's body. Its theory holds that 84,000 \"energy lines\" (Sen) compose the body and that ten of these have priority. Numbers Diet (Jean Simpson's Numbers Diet): Numerological diet for weight loss developed over 23 years by Jean Simpson, author of Hot Numbers and Hot Lotto Numbers. Its postulate is that, with a number based on the month, day, and year of one's last birthday, one can learn what di etary pitfalls are likely on any particular day. numerology: The study of the magical meanings of numbers and of their supposed influence on human life. It is a purported calculative means of obtaining information about one's personality, capabilities, and future. The basis of numerology is that numbers have an \"inner nature\" and \"vibration.\" Numerological considerations include an individual's full name, birthplace, and birth date. (Numerological interpretation of one's name is called \"onomatomancy.\") For example, the number eleven is connectable with the eleven loyal apostles of Jesus Christ; the number twelve with the entire group of apostles, the twelve divisions of the zodiac, and the twelve months of the year; and the number thirteen with covens (groups of thirteen witches). Nutripathy: \"A religious science of experiencing mental, financial, physical, social and spiritual health using specific universal laws,\" according to NutripathyThe Key to Your Prosperity, Success and Spiritual Fulfillment (1984). Gary A. Martin, D.N., Ph.D., Th.D., D.Sc., originated the system in the late 1970s, allegedly thanks to divine influence. It includes hair analysis and a variation of Bach flower therapy. Its premises include: (a) God is in everyone. (b) One's \"True Self\" is God (\"Love\"). (c) \"Proper nutrition\" and realization of one's \"true identity\" together make for a perfect life. nutritional herbology: Form of herbology expounded by author and \"research chemist\" Mark Pedersen. It is part of the \"educational\" basis of Nature's Sunshine Products, Inc. (NSP), a multilevel marketing organization whose headquarters are in Spanish Fork, Utah. Nutritional herbology theory encom passes the ancient Chinese theory of the Five Elements. Nutrition Kinesiology (NK): Alleged means of identifying: (a) health-impairing (e.g., allergenic) foods and other substances and (b) \"corrective\" nutrients. NK involves \"acupoint tests\" and muscle testing (see above). Nvwoti (Cherokee herbal medicine): Native American form of botanical \"healing\" that purportedly treats all human components: emotional, physical, societal, Hygiene\"](https://quackwatch.org/related/natural_hygiene/) Natural hygiene, an offshoot of naturopathy, is a philosophy of health and \"natural living\" that opposes immunization, fluoridation, food irradiation, and most medical treatment and advocates eating a \"raw food\" diet of vegetables, fruits, and nuts. It also advocates a vegetarian diet, periodic fasting, and \"food combining\" (avoiding food combinations it considers detrimental). According to its philosophy: Health is the result of natural living. When people live in harmony with their physiological needs, health is the inevitable result. By supplying the organism with its basic requirements (natural, unadulterated food; sunshine; clean, fresh air; pure water; appropriate physical, mental and emotional activities; and a productive lifestyle) while simultaneously eliminating all harmful factors and influences, the self-constructing, self-regulating, self-repairing qualities of the body are given full rein. ...

Background History The Natural Hygiene movement is said to have been founded during the 1830s by Sylvester Graham, (inventor of the \"Graham cracker\") but declined until \"resuscitated\" from \"almost dead\" by Herbert M. Shelton (1895-1985). Shelton claimed that \"Hygienic care is the only rational and radical care that has ever been administered to the sick in any age of the world in any place.\" [1] In a 1978 interview in Natural Living, Shelton described his educational background this way: I postgraduated from the University of Hard Knocks and left before I got my diploma. I went through the usual brainwashing process of the school system in Greenville, Texas and revolted against the whole political, religious, medical and social system at the age of sixteen. During the next several years, Shelton obtained a \"Doctor of Physiological Therapeutics\" degree from from the International College of Drugless Physicians, a school established by Bernarr Macfadden, and took a postgraduate course at the Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics in Chicago. Then he went to New York where, \"after nine months of brainwashing,\" he acquired degrees in chiropractic and naturopathy. In 1920, after further study and apprenticeship at various institutions, Shelton published the first of his 40 books, Fundamentals of Nature Cure. In 1928 he founded Dr. Shelton's Health School in San Antonio, which operated at seven different locations until 1981. From 1934 through 1941, he produced a 7-volume series under the title The Hygienic System. In 1939, he launched Dr. Shelton's Hygienic Review, a monthly magazine that was published for about 40 years. Natural hygiene's primary organization has been the National Health Association (NHA), which is headquartered in Tampa Florida. Shelton founded NHA as the American Natural Hygiene Society (ANHS), which assumed its present name in 1998. Membership costs $35 or more and includes a subscription to Health Science, its quarterly magazine. Recent tax returns (filed under AHNA's name) state that the organization's income from membership dues was $29,209 in 2006, $50,242 in 2005, $53,794 in 2004, $54,866 in 2003, $43,174 in 2002, and $47,794 in 2001. These numbers suggest that during the past six years, NHA has had between 800 and 1500 members. NHA has actively promoted certification of \"organic foods\" and opposed immunization, fluoridation, and food irradiation. In 2003, some \"hygienic doctors\" launched the [International Natural Hygiene Society (INHS)](http://naturalhygienesociety.org/), a volunteer-based, web-based network with no membership fees. Its Web states that it has over 800 members. The [International Association of Hygienic Physicians (IAHP)](http://www.iahp.net/) is a professional association for licensed medical doctors, osteopaths, chiropractors, and naturopaths) who \"specialize in therapeutic fasting supervision as an integral part of Hygienic Care.\" Founded in 1978, the IAHP offers an internship program for \"certification in fasting supervision.\" In December 2007, its Web site referral list included 26 members from the United States and 11 from other countries. Most are chiropractors, but a few hold other degrees. Therapeutic Philosophy According to an ANHS brochure published in the 1980s: A thoroughgoing rest, which includes fasting, is the most favorable condition under which an ailing body can purify and repair itself. Fasting is the total abstinence from all liquid or solid foods except distilled water. During a fast the body's recuperative forces are marshaled and all of its energies are directed toward the recharging of the nervous system, the elimination of toxic accumulations, and the repair and rejuvenation of tissue. Stored within each organism's tissues are nutrient reserves which it will use to carry on metabolism and repair work. Until these reserves are depleted, no destruction of healthy tissue or \"starvation\" can occur. Natural Hygiene publications promote fasting for children as well as for adults. The brochure also stated: Natural Hygiene rejects the use of medications, blood transfusions, radiation, dietary supplements, and any other means employed to treat or \"cure\" various ailments. These therapies interfere with or destroy vital processes and tissue. Recovery from disease takes place in spite of, and not because of, the drugging and \"curing\" practices. In 1982, a federal court jury awarded over $800,000 to the survivors of William Carlton, a 49-year-old man who died after undergoing a distilled water fast for 30 days at Shelton's Health School. An article in the Los Angeles Times stated that Carlton had died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from a weakened condition in which he lost 50 pounds during his last month of life. The article also noted that he was the sixth person in five years who had died while undergoing treatment at the school [2]. Shelton and his chiropractic associate, Vivian V. Vetrano, claimed in their appeal that Carlton had persisted in fasting after Dr. Vetrano had advised him to stop. However, the verdict was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court declined further review. \"Food Combining\" Another central component of Natural Hygiene is its system of \"food combining,\" the incorrect notion that various food combinations eaten during the same meal can cause or correct ill health. In Food Combining Made Easy, he stated: To a single article of food that is a starch-protein combination, the body can easily adjust its juices. . . to the digestive requirements of the food. But when two foods are eaten with different . . . digestive needs, this precise adjustment of juices to requirements becomes impossible. Natural Hygienists believe, for example, that consuming a high-protein food and a high-carbohydrate food at the same meal will, at the least, tax the body's enzymatic capacity. In Food Combining, Shelton grouped foods into seven partially overlapping categories: - proteins such as nuts, peanuts, and avocados - starches, including sweet fruits, such as peanuts, chestnuts, pumpkins, bananas, and mangos - fats such as most nuts and avocados - acid fruits such as citrus fruit and tomatoes - \"sub-acid\" fruits such as pears and apricots - non-starchy and green vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, and watercress; - melons such as watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe. Hygienic classification schemes differ somewhat, but certain foods are not recommended under any circumstances. Shelton taught that the following combinations are indigestible: \"acids\" and starches; proteins and starches; acids and proteins; fats and proteins; sugars and proteins; sugars and starches (note that Shelton classified sweet fruits as starches); melons and anything other than fresh fruit; and even two different proteins. Such pronouncements were debunked more than 70 years ago in both scientific and popular literature. Despite its many absurdities, Natural Hygiene enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s, thanks to Harvey and Marilyn Diamond and their books [Fit for Life](../../11Ind/fitforlife.html) (1985) and Living Health (1987). Harvey received his \"Ph.D. in nutritional science\" from T.C. Fry's unaccredited American College of Health Science in Texas, which offered a voluminous correspondence course detailing Fry's views. Natural Hygiene advocates have written two other popular books: The Beverly Hills Medical Diet (1982), by Judy Mazel, and Unlimited Power (1986), by Anthony Robbins Although Natural Hygiene's \"official\" dietary rules are rigid and restrictive, its adherants vary considerably in the extent to which they follow them. (Fit for Life gives reluctant consent to the consumption of milk (preferably unpasteurized) and plain yogurt; and its dinner menus include seafood and poultry. The Bottom Line Natural Hygiene is dangerous because it encourages prolonged fasting and discourages proven medical interventions. While its recommended diet has two admirable characteristics (low fat content and high fiber content), its recommended avoidance of dairy products is an invitation to osteoporosis. No scientific study has ever compared the disease and death rates of Hygienists with those of other people. But it appears to me that the hazards far outweigh the possible benefits.

Questionable clinic will close. The Washington Court of Appeals has issued a [mixed ruling](http://www.casewatch.net/ag/wa/kline/appeal.shtml) in the case of Monte Kline and his clinics. In 2005, a King County Superior Court Judge ordered Kline, who prescribed dietary supplements and other products based on the results of electrodermal testing (EDT), to pay nearly $2 million in penalties and attorneys fees for violating the State of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The judge also ruled that Kline and Pacific Health Center (PHC), of Bellevue, Washington, were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture without a license and ordered them to stop doing so. The Appeals Court concluded: We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. But practicing any of these disciplines without a license is not a per se CPA violation. The State failed to prove defendants did not have the level of competence they represented to the public or that any member of the public was even potentially injured by their actions. As such, the State did not prove a violation of the Act. Because the State did not prove defendants violated the CPA, the trial court also erred in imposing penalties under that statute. The case began in 2003 when the Washington Attorney General accused Kline and the clinic of misrepresenting the significance of his credentials and the diagnostic capabilities of EDT. [EDT is a bogus procedure](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/electro.html)claimed to detect \"imbalances\" in the flow of \"electromagnetic energy\" through the body. The devices are fancy galvanometers that reflect how hard the operator presses a probe against the patient's skin. No such device can be legally marketed in the United States for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Kline has a \"PhD in Nutrition & Wholistic Health Sciences\" from [Columbia Pacific University](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/cpu.html), a nonaccredited correspondence school that was ordered to cease operations in California in 2001. Following the Appeals Court ruling, Kline announced that he would close his Bellevue clinic because the \"unlicensed practice\" ruling barred him from doing EDT. Leading quackery historian dies. James Harvey Young, Ph.D., Candler Professor Emeritus at Emory University, died on July 29, 2006 at 90 years of age from complications following a stroke. During his career, he produced nine books and about 150 articles and book chapters. His first and most famous book was [The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America Before Federal Regulation](http://www.quackwatch.org/13Hx/TM/00.html) (1961). His 1967 sequel, [The Medical Messiahs: A Social History of Health Quackery in Twentieth Century America](http://www.quackwatch.org/13Hx/MM/00.html), illuminated the political struggle for government regulation of health products and inspired Dr. Stephen Barrett to follow in his footsteps. Both books were republished by Consumers Union and are archived on Quackwatch. In a chapter in The Health Robbers, Young concluded, \"Quacks never sleep. But education and regulation can reduce the toll they take in wasted resources and human suffering.\" Canada issues senseless homeopathic regulations. Health Canada's Natural Health Directorate, whose role is to \"ensure that Canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe, effective, and of high quality,\" has issued rules for homeopathic products. [ [Evidence for homeopathic medicines, version 2.0](http://www.homeowatch.org/reg/canada.pdf). National Health Directorate, November 2006] - Those with a nonspecific recommended use or purpose must be labeled \"Homeopathic medicine,\" \"Homeopathic Preparation,\" Homeopathic drug,\" or \"Homeopathic remedy.\" - Those with a specific recommended use or purpose must (a) be suitable for self-care, (b) not require the supervision of a health care practitioner, and (c) be supported by \"evidence\" such as previous marketing experience, expert opinion reports, textbooks, homeopathic provings, homeopathic materia medica, and homeopathic repertories. \"demonstrate a clear rationale for each ingredient.\" These regulations are senseless because no homeopathic product has been proven effective for treating any health problem. [Barrett S. [Homeopathy: The ultimate fake](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeo.html). Quackwatch, Dec 28, 2003] The alleged substantiation relies primarily on \"provings,\" most of which were done during the 1800s and early 1900s. These involved taking various substances and recording every twitch, sneeze, ache or itch that occurred afterward\u2014often for several days. Homeopathy's followers take for granted that every sensation reported was caused by whatever substance was administered, and that extremely dilute doses of that substance will help people with those specific symptoms. Materia medica are compilations of provings that are used to match a patient's symptoms with a \"corresponding\" drug.

In 2011 and 2012, her Web site described her as specializing in \"integrative oncology\" and [claimed that she was \"able to help all cancer patients with alternative medicines].\" The methods she offered included Gerson therapy, laetrile, mistletoe injections, thymus extracts, and intravenous vitamin C and hydrogen peroxide, none of which has been proven to benefit cancer patients. As noted below, the board's investigation concluded: - Messer offered, facilitated and rendered diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with unproven and/or disproven claimed beneficial effects and failed to obtain adequate informed consent. - Messer falsely represented in advertising that she was able to treat cancer. - Naturopaths who treat cancer patients are required to consult with or co-manage their care with a medical or osteopathic doctor. However, Messer failed to do this. - Messer told a board investigator who posed as a cancer patient: \"You know, we can't say we treat cancer, but that's silly because we do. I have extensive training in integrative oncology and treat cancer patients all the time.\" - Messer self-reported that she had issued prescriptions for drugs that were beyond her scope of practice. - When Patient A examined her billing records, she found that she had been charged for services that had not been rendered. - Messer doctored Patient B's records in an attempt to protect herself from possible repercussions from the patient's death one month after starting treatment with Messer.

MESSER || | | | | | | | |No. M2014-1078 | FINDINGS OF FACT, This matter comes before the Board of Naturopathy (Board) for final order. The Board members deciding the case were: Chad Aschtgen, ND; Dean Neary, ND; and Michael Whitney, ND. 1. FINDINGS OF FACT 1.1 On September 10, 1996, the State of Washington issued Respondent a credential to practice as a naturopathic physician. Respondent's credential is currently active. 1.2 The Department submitted the Declaration of Blake Maresh, Executive Director, with attached exhibits. 1.3 In or about April 2012, Patient A was diagnosed with Stage 3.5 rectal cancer by a medical doctor, who referred Patient A to the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, WA. Patient A's treatment plan involved chemotherapy and radiation and eventual pineal resection surgery. However, after three to four (3-4) weeks of treatment, Patient A decided to stop chemotherapy and radiation due to vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. Patient A's friend found Respondent on the internet and Patient A presented to Respondent on or about July 6, 2012. 1.4 Respondent treated Patient A at the \"Goddess Sanctuary,\" a residential clinic and spa where cancer patients are treated by utilizing the Gerson Therapy protocol, and other alternative methods, including laetrile. The Gerson protocol for Patient A included drinking juices thirteen (13) times per day, strict vegetarian organic diet, coffee and or castor oil enemas, and taking vitamins sold by Respondent. 1.5 In or about October 2012, Respondent entered into an arrangement with Patient A where Patient A moved in with Respondent at the Goddess Sanctuary. In exchange for light housekeeping, directing patients to the sauna and Jacuzzi, serving soup to patients, and presenting the Gerson Therapy workshops to patients, Patient A would receive free room and board, free naturopathic care, free food and juices, and a discount on supplements from Respondent 1.6 During Patient A's time at the Goddess Sanctuary, she had become acquainted with Patient B, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer. Patient Band his wife lived in the Goddess Sanctuary during October 2012. Respondent treated Patient B through a regimen of juices (Gerson protocol) and laetrile. Patient B also received treatment via a \"Rife machine\", an electrical device that purportedly treats cancer through transmission of radio and/or electromagnetic waves onto the patient's cancer cells. Patient B died on November 8, 2012 after approximately one (1) month at the Goddess Sanctuary. Patients A and B were not related by blood or marriage to Respondent and both resided together at the Goddess Sanctuary for a period of approximately one (1) month under Respondent's oversight and care. 1.7 In or about February, 2013, Patient A obtained her patient records from Respondent's clinic. Patient A noted that there were fraudulent billings for her care because some of the dates of treatment were dates when she had been in Oregon visiting family members. On some of the other dates of treatment, Patient A disclosed that she had merely stopped by the clinic to buy supplements, and had never actually seen Respondent for treatment. 1.8 Review of Patients A and B's records demonstrated that Respondent failed to meet the standard of care resulting in patient harm or unreasonable risk of harm because: - - Respondent offered, facilitated and rendered diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with unproven and/or disproven claimed beneficial effects. Patient A and B's records did not contain adequate informed consent regarding these unproven treatment protocols. - Respondent failed to provide truthful, informative, unbiased, transparent and actual informed consent regarding risks, benefits, evidence for and against proposed treatments/diagnostic methodologies. This included the risks and benefits of declining definitive treatment, and incorporating the consent forms in the patient's medical record. Patients A and B were especially vulnerable considering their cancer diagnosis. Extra effort should have been made to ensure the clarity and completeness of the documented and signed informed consent so that a verifiably informed choice could be demonstrated by either Patient A or Patient B. - Respondent failed to treat malignancy while consulting with or co-managing with another authorized provider under RCW 18.57 or RCW 18.71. Respondent failed to document adequate consultation and co-management with a medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy in Patient A and B's charting. Respondent should have documented that non-conventional care was delivered in concert with ongoing . consultation or co-management with a medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy. However, this was not done. As a result, Patients A and B did not receive complete and adequate treatment for their respective conditions. Respondent did not inform Patient A and B that she was required to work in conjunction with another authorized provider under RCW 18.57 or RCW 18.71. - Respondent represented false or misleading advertising with respect to her ability or methodology to treat cancer. These representations were made to both Patients A and B, whom as a result, were inappropriately misled and isolated during their cancer treatment residency at the Goddess Sanctuary. - Laetrile or Amygdalin is not approved by the U .S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cancer or any other medical condition. The active ingredient in Laetrile is cyanide and has a toxic effect which purportedly kills cancer cells. Washington State law insulates a physician from disciplinary action when a patient requests laetrile after \"having been given sufficient information in writing to\u00c2\u00b7 make an informed decision.\" Patient B's charting does not document the well-known risks of laetrile and does not contain adequate informed consent regarding laetrile treatment for Patient B's cancer. Therefore, Respondent failed to meet the standard of care regarding administration of laetrile and may not invoke immunity under RCW 70.54.150. 1.9 Patient B's signature on the informed consent form was forged and Respondent misrepresented facts contained in Patient B's record to help insulate herself from any repercussions arising from Patient B's death. Respondent's misrepresentations included the notation that she had consulted with Patient B's oncologist. The \"Gerson Therapy Medical History Questionnaire\" correctly listed the age of their children and was filled out in unrecognizable handwriting. 1.10 On or about July 8, 2013, Respondent conducted a telephone consultation with an undercover investigator posing as a patient with Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. The investigator indicated that she did not want to go through painful radiation and chemotherapy. In response, Respondent explained that the \"Whipple operation\" was not effective. Respondent also indicated that she administered laetrile to cancer patients \"all the time.\" Respondent also stated: \"You know, we can't say we treat cancer, but that's silly because we do. I have extensive training in integrative oncology and treat cancer patients all the time.\" 1.11 On or about November 18, 2013, Respondent self-reported at the direction of the DEA misuse of her DEA license for the past nine years and the fact that she rendered prescriptions beyond the scope of authorized practice for a naturopathic physician. Among the unauthorized prescriptions, the DEA agent involved with Respondent's case disclosed that Respondent had issued eight (8) prescriptions beyond the scope of authorized practice, which included Alprazolam, and Phentermine Compound. Respondent had also issued prescriptions with her expired, out of state (Arizona) DEA#, and had instructed her staff to use the Arizona stamp when she was not present to manually sign prescriptions. Respondent had also prescribed a thirty (30) day quantity and a ninety (90) day quantity of Alprazolam to Patient C in a matter of nine (9) days. When questioned about this excessive prescription Respondent stated that Patient C's boyfriend stole the first set of Alprazolam, and admitted that this information was not documented in Patient C's charting. Respondent agreed to voluntarily surrender (for cause) her DEA registration in lieu of revocation proceedings. In addition, Respondent prescribed laetrile beyond the scope of her license and may not utilize an affirmative defense under RCW 70.54.150 because she did not work in conjunction with a medical doctor or osteopathic physician, and did not provide sufficient information in writing for Patient B to make an informed decision. 1.12 On December 9, 2015, the Board served Respondent with a copy of the following documents at Respondent's last known address: - - Statement of Charges; - Notice of Your Legal Rights; - Answer to Statement of Charges and Request for Settlement and Hearing (Answer). 1.13 On December 29, 2015, Respondent filed an Answer to Statement of Charges with the Adjudicative Clerk Office. Respondent affirmatively waived her opportunity for a hearing on this matter. In addition to the Answer to Statement of Charges, Respondent submitted a written statement and/or materials she wanted the disciplining authority to consider in disposition of the case. The disciplining authority considered the written statement and/or materials submitted by Respondent in determining the sanctions set forth in Section 4. 2. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 2.1 The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and over the subject matter of this case. RCW 18.130.040. 2.2 Except as otherwise required by law, the Department bears the burden of proving the allegations set forth in the Statement of Charges by a preponderance of the evidence. WAC 246-11-520. The Washington Supreme Court has held the standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings against physicians is proof by clear and convincing evidence. Nguyen v. Department of Health, 144 Wn.2d 516, 534 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 904 (2002), In 2006, the Washington Supreme Court extended the Nguyen holding to all professional disciplinary proceedings. Ongom v. Department of Health, 159 Wn.2d 132 (2006), cert. denied 550 U.S. 905 (2007): However, in 2011, the Washington Supreme Court overruled Ongom, but declined to overrule Nguyen. Hardee v. Dept. of Social and Health Services, 172 Wn. 2d 1 (2011). 2.3 Given the legal uncertainty regarding the standard of proof for disciplinary proceedings, the evidence in this matter will be evaluated under both the clear and convincing standard, as well as the preponderance of the evidence standard. 2.4 Respondent filed a response to the Statement of Charges within the time allowed by WAC 246-11-270(1)(a)(i) or WAC 246-11-270(3) affirmatively waiving her right to a hearing. In addition to the Answer to Statement of Charges, Respondent submitted a written statement and/or materials she wanted the disciplining authority to consider in disposition of the case. The Board may issue a dispositive order based on the evidence presented to it. RCW 18.130.090(1) and RCW34.05.440. 2. 5 Based upon the Findings of Fact, Respondent has committed unprofessional conduct pursuant to RCW 18.130.180(1), (4), (7), (12), (13), and (24), RCW 70.128.050(1), RCW 69.50.308(9), and WAC 246-836-210. 2.6 Sufficient grounds to take disciplinary action against Respondent's credential. RCW 18.130.160 and RCW 18.130.180. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH SANCTION RULES 3.1 The disciplining authority applies WAC 246-16-800, et seq., to determine appropriate sanctions. WAC 246-16-800(2)(c) requires the disciplining authority to impose terms based on a specific sanction schedule unless \"the schedule does not adequately. address the facts in a case.\" 3.2 Respondent's alleged conduct falls in Tier B of the \"Practice Below Standard of Care\" schedule, WAC 246-16-810. The sanction range associated with that tier does adequately address the alleged facts of this case. 3.3 The disciplining authority considered the following aggravating factors: - - Gravity of the misconduct. - Vulnerability of the Patients. - Motivation is criminal, dishonest or for personal gain. 4.

Respondent may not petition for reinstatement of credential for a period of at least five (5) years from the effective date of this Order. 4.2 If and when Respondent petitions for reinstatement, the disciplining authority may place terms and conditions on Respondent's credential as deems necessary to protect the health and safety of the public.

The investigation began after a former employee, Jeffrey Gorumba, filed a whistleblower complaint in Federal District Court in Seattle. Gorumba's complaint (shown below) and the accompanying declaration alleged that the SCTWC had: Knowingly permitted physicians to falsify patient records to reflect examinations they did not perform Submitted claims for more complicated services than were actually performed Billed for certain services of physicians who were absent when the services were performed Submitted claims for administering drugs at the center that were actually dispensed for administration at home Wrongfully terminated his employment as ...

The investigation began after a former employee, Jeffrey Gorumba, filed a whistleblower complaint in Federal District Court in Seattle. Gorumba's complaint (shown below) and the accompanying [declaration]alleged that the SCTWC had: - Knowingly permitted physicians to falsify patient records to reflect examinations they did not perform - Submitted claims for more complicated services than were actually performed - Billed for certain services of physicians who were absent when the services were performed - Submitted claims for administering drugs at the center that were actually dispensed for administration at home - Wrongfully terminated his employment as a physician's assistant after he objected to the alleged wrongdoing SCTWC was affiliated with Cancer Treatment Centers of America, which was dismissed from the litigation. The settlement agreement called for Gorumba to receive 20% of the $478,000 plus $180,000 to settle his claim of wrongful termination.

S. C. \u00a73729 by the Defendants. 1.2 The \"allegations or transactions\" upon which this suit is based have not been publicly disclosed in a criminal; civil, or administrative healing, in a congressional. administrative, or Government Accounting Office report. hearing, audit or investigation, or from the news media. 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(A). 1.3 The Qui Tam plaintiff is the original source in that he \"has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.\" 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(B). He has been providing information through this litigation and previously provided information to agents of the United States Government in connection with this matter. 1.4 Seattle Cancer Treatment & Wellness Center is a Washington Corporation which resides and transacts business at Seattle, Washington, within the Western District of Washington. 1.5 Venue exists in this District pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a73730(b)(1) in that Defendants are qualified to do business in the State of Washington and transact substantial business in the District. II. PARTIES 2.1 The Defendant CANCER TREATMENT CENTERS OF AMERICA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION OF WASHINGTON, P.C., is a Washington corporation, doing business as SEATTLE CANCER TREATMENT AND WELLNESS CENTER (hereinafter \"SCTWC\"), with its principal place of business in Seattle, and is engaged in the business of medicine, including, inter alia, treating cancer patients using naturopathic and \"'holistic\" medicine, and with chemotherapy. 2.2 Many of SCTWC's patients arc receiving financial support through the Medicare programs of the United States Government (\"Medicare\"), and SCTWC receives payments from Medicare for treating a subset of its patients. 2.3 Relator Jeffrey Gorumba resides in King County, Washington. He is a former employee of the SCTWC, who was at material times employed in the capacity or a Physician's Assistant ('\"PA \"). He was employed by SCTWC from approximately September, 2001 until June 6, 2002. 2.4 The Defendant CANCER TREATMENT CENTERS Of AMERICA (hereinafter \"CTCA') is a non-Washington corporation intimately involved with Defendant SCTWC. It advertises and refers patients to SCTWC, monitors the patient billing and other practices of SCTWC, requires licensing and other monetary payments from SCTWC, and directs the amounts and form of billing for many services needed by SCTWC, among other activities. On information and belief, C'I'CA oversees the billing practices of SCTWC. III. STATEMENT OF FACTS A. Medicare Regulations Limit Amounts and Types of Payments for Services 3.1 Medicare pays certain limited fees for services provided to qualified patients, The regulations and policies of the United States Department of Health and Human Services mandate that Medicare funds may he paid to health care providers for services provided to qualified patients, but only in certain amounts for certain services. 3.2 As an example of the foregoing regulations and policies, only health care providers, including Physician's Assistants, who are licensed to practice are eligible for payments from Medicare, and then only for services they provided which arc within their scope of practice. 3.3 As another example, a health care provider such as SCTWC may charge Medicare for services provided by a Physician's Assistant \"incident to\" the supervision of 'the Physician, but only when the Physician is in the building where the Physician's Assistant is providing the services at the time the services are being provided. If the Physician was not present for the services, the Physician's Assistant's services must be billed to Medicare at a lower rate, and is reimbursed by Medicare with less money than if the Physician was present in the facility. 3.4 As another example, a full comprehensive physical exam with review of multiple physical systems (such as heart, lungs, nervous system. etc.) is reimbursed by Medicare at a higher rate, i.e., for more money, than a more limited examination. B. SCTWC Treats with Chemotherapy and Naturopathy 3.5 Seattle Cancer Treatment & Wellness Center treats approximately 20 patients a day with chemotherapy. An unknown proportion of those patients arc eligible for Medicare. SCTWC bills Medicare for services it provides to these eligible patients. C. Charging for Services Beyond the Scope of the Provider's License 3.6 When Relator Gorumba started working for SCTWC, he was not yet approved by the State of Washington to provide Physician's Assistant services. Relator Gorumba became so qualified in October, 2001l and his license was retroactively effective as of October 1, 2001. 3.7 Prior to Relator Gorumba becoming qualified, physicians employed by SCTWC dictated notes, and SCTWC billed Medicare at Physician or Physician's Assistant \"incident to\" rates based on services Relator Gorumba had provided, usually without the doctor having seen the patient at all on that occasion. 3.8 Another Physician's Assistant named Bennett Reyes was seeing patients in a similar capacity as Relator Gorumba, Mr. Reyes was not qualified to see patients in the capacity of Physician's Assistant before November 1.2001. Nevertheless, upon information and belief, prior to him becoming qualified, SCTWC billed for Mr. Reyes' services, or under other names for services he had provided, at Physician or Physician's Assistant \"incident to\" rates. D. Throughout Relator Gorumba's employment, Dr. Chue regularly arrived at the office in the late morning or early afternoon, but patients were seen and treated with chemotherapy beginning in the early morning. 3.10 During a period in December, 2001, P.A. Reyes and/or Relator Gorumba saw patients \"incident to\" the supervision of Dr. Ben Chue, however, Dr. Chue was nor present at all because he was too sick to work for a period of approximately two weeks. 3.11 On occasion, Dr. Chue and/or [another oncologist] left early to visit patients at another facility, took vacation, was out town at CTCA meetings, or was ill, and therefore was not present in the facility to supervise the PA's treatment of patients. 3.12 Despite these absences, SCTWC. billed Medicare for many patients seen by Relator Gorumba or P.A. Reyes \"incident Chue or [the other oncologist] at times when the supervising doctor was not present in the facility. On many of these occasions, no doctor was present in the facility. 3.13 On information and belief, such practices began long before Relator Gorumba became employed by SCTWC, and have continued since his employment ended. 3.14 [The other oncologist] started working at SCTWC in December, 2001, but at first did not have a Medicare billing number. Dr. Manoucher Sardo formerly worked for SCTWC, before Mr. Gorumba became employed there. On information and belief, patients seen by or incident to the supervision of [the other oncologist] were billed under Dr. Sardo's name and number initially. E. Billing for Full Examination when Less Comprehensive Exams Were Provided 3.15 On many occasions, physicians employed by SCTWC dictated chart notes for a full examination and SCTWC billed Medicare for a full examination performed by Relator Gorumba, PA Bennett Reyes, Dr. Chue . . . and others, whether or not a full examination had been conducted on the patient. 3.16 SCTWC billing procedures involve the health care provider marking a form with the billing codes. Administrative staff then submitted bills to Medicare. Dr. Chue told Relator Gorumba that he had previously had problems with Medicare, or wanted to avoid problems with Medicare, and so he wanted to mark his own billing on the forms. 3.17 Prior to that conversation, Dr. Chue instructed Relator Gorumba to mark \"99215\" on the forms. Unbeknownst to Relator Gorumba, this number reflected a full or comprehensive physical examination, however Relator Gorumha had not provided a comprehensive examination to the patient, but a lesser, more limited exam. In this time frame, Relator Gorumba also observed Dr. Chue to dictate chart notes for a more comprehesive examination than had been performed. On information and belie, Dr, Chue similarly caused overbilling for work by PA Reyes and others. 3.18 Subsequent to that conversation, Relator Gorumba dictatcd records for patients he saw, and marked on the billing sheet the number of minutes of contact he had with the patient. Dr. Chue, without seeing the notes Gorumba had dictated, marked the billing forms. Dr. Chue had insufficient knowledge of what level of services Relator Gorumba had actually provided to the patient at the time Dr. Chue initiated the Medicare billing process for that patient visit, and could not have accurately billed. On information and belief, Dr. Chue overbilled, and similarly overbilled for work by P A Reyes and others, 3.19 When Relator Gorumba was working under the supervision of [the other oncologist, he was instructed] to dictate portions of the chart notes, then say \"normal program.\" This was an instruction to the transcriptionist to cut and paste a record of a comprehensive examination into the chart, even though a comprehensive exam had not been conducted. [The other oncologist] instructed Relator Gorumba to mark \"99214\" on the billing forms for these \"'normal program\" examinations. This billing number reflects an examination which is only slightly less thorough than a comprehensive examination. However, Relator Gorumba had not conducted a comprehensive examination or a nearly comprehensive examination. On information and belief, [the other oncologist] similarly caused overbilling for work by PA Reyes and others. 3.20 Upon information and belief, informed by the habits of SCTWC employees, SCTWC bills, and, for years has billed, for a full examination, whether or not anyone actually conducted a full examination on the patient, and such conduct continues. F, Non-Medicare-Reimbursable Services Were Paid By Medicare 3.21 SCTWC treats many patients with naturopathic treatments. On occasion, treatments which would be rejected if authorized by naturopathic physicians have been instead ordered by the medical doctors of SCTWC, who, on information and belief, did not see or treat the patient in question. G. Medicare Billing, Not the Patient's Health Care, Drove Treatment Decisions 3.22 Many patients came to SCTWC and CTCA for naturopathic, holistic, acupuncture, massage, and similar treatments because they had little other hope after chemotherapy had failed to cure them. SCTWC and CTCA naturopaths referred patients to the SCTWC oncologists, including those identified herein. 3.23 Relator Gorumba was informed by said oncologist that treatment of some said patients with chemotherapy is \"pointless\" and \"isn't doing any good.\" However, said oncologists prescribed chemotherapy anyway, because Medicare would pay for it, and solely for purposes of billing. Such treatment was not reasonable or necessary. H. These are Fraudulent Misrepresentations 3.24 Relator Gorumba discussed his concerns about the above-referenced billing practices with SCTWC Administrator Kim Carlson. Ms. Carlson encouraged such practices, indicating for example, that the \"normal program\" procedure meant Medicare would be billed for more money than if the chart and bills reflected that fewer systems were reviewed. She said each chemotherapy patient was worth $50,000 to $55,000 to SCTWC. She instructed him to \"play the game,\" meaning he, too, could participate in Medicare and insurance fraud. 3.25 The purpose of falsifying the billing records is to obtain monies for Seattle Cancer Treatment & Wellness Center from the United States Government, which monies Seattle Cancer Treatment & Wellness Center would not otherwise obtain, 3.26 The defendants knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, to officer or employee of the United States Government, false or fraudulent claims for payment or approval. 3.27 The defendants knowingly made, used, or caused to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government. 3.28 The defendants conspired to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid. 3.29 The defendants' representations to the Government or its agent regarding the presence of a doctor in the same facility for \"incident to\" billing purposes were false representations of material fact. 3.30 The defendants' representations to the Government or its agent regarding the qualifications of health care providers who served Medicare-eligible patients were false representations of material fact. 3.31 The defendants' representations to the Government or its agent regarding the extent of Physician or Physician Assistant evaluations, number of systems evaluated, and/or \"level\" or the evaluations were false representations of material fact. 3.32 The defendants made these false representations of material fact knowingly as that term is defined ill 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(b). 3.33 The false representations were believed by the government and acted upon by the government to its damage. 3.34 These practices resulted in billing for more services than actually were provided, and resulted in SCTWC, and, through it CTCA, receiving more money from Medicare than it was entitled to. 3.35 Based on information and belief, these fraudulent practices have been ongoing and continuing for a period or years before Relator Gorumba's employment and continued after his termination. I. Pattern and Practice of Fraud Perpetrated by CTCA 3.36 Based on information and belief, these practices are encouraged, condoned, organized, or required by CTCA, and are part of a pattern and practice of fraudulent billing, upcoding, and overbilling by other CTCA-affiliated corporations. J. Wrongful Retaliatory Termination 3.37 Relator Gorumba became dissatisfied with this system as he came to understand the above-referenced procedures were illegal He told Administrator Carlson that he had concerns and did not want to have anything to do with the Medicare and other insurance fraud referenced above. She told him \"This place is about making money,\" and he should just \"play the game.\" Mr. Gorumba refused. In retaliation, his employment was terminated the next day. IV. CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES 4.1 The facts stated above give rise to a violation of the Federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(l)(2)(3). 4.2 The defendants are liable for the actions of their agents, and thcir employees under the doctrine of Respondeat Superior. V. DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES 5.1 As a proximate cause of the fraudulent practices described above the United States of America has suffered damages in amounts fraudulently billed to the United States. VI. CLAIMS OF RELATOR GORUMBA FOR HIMSELF 6.1 Jeffrey Gorumba's employment was terminated because he opposed illegal practices referenced herein. This conduct violates 31 U.S.C, \u00a73730(h). As a separate claim arising out of similar facts, this conduct violates the common law of the State of Washington, specifically the tort of Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy. VII. DAMAGES SUFFERED BY RELATOR GORUMBA 7.1 As a proximate cause of the fraudulent practices described above Jeffrey Gorumba has suffered damages in the form of lost wages, damage to his career (future earning capacity), general damages for emotional distress, and other actual damages. VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE plaintiff prays for damages as follows on behalf of the United States and/or on his own behalf as appropriate: On behalf of the United States: 1. Economic damages ill an amount to be proven at time of trial. 2. A civil penalty of not less than $5000 and not more than $10,000 per violation, 3. Treble damages, as provided for in 31 U.S.C. \u00a73729(a). On behalf of Jeffrey Gorumba: 4. Lost wages and benefits of employment, both past and future, lost future earning capacity, and other economic damages in amounts 10 be proven at time of trial. 5. General damages for emotional distress. 6. Other actual damages in amounts to be proven at time of trial. On behalf of either or both the United States and Jeffrey Gorumba. 6. Prejudgment interest. 7. Reasonable attorney fees and costs. 8. Whatever additional damages the court shall deem to be just and equitable.

It summarizes scientific Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. PBS features misleading \"integrated medicine\"report. The Public Broadcasting System has aired a 2-hour special, \"The New Medicine,\" which portrays \"integrated medicine\" as a new way to provide personalized care for patients. The program states correctly that it is important to pay attention to patients' concerns and emotional needs, but it falsely portrays this as a new medical approach. Segments of the report suggest that relaxation therapy can be helpful in certain situations, but the program exaggerates its importance. Images scattered throughout the program depict the administration of acupuncture and therapeutic touch without indicating that neither has any influence on the course of any disease. A coordinated Web site states that \"integrated medicine only uses complementary therapies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness,\" but its list of methods includes homeopathy, qigong, reiki, and others that are ineffective and/or based on nonsensical theories. The site also gives poor advice about finding practitioners and fails to address whether it makes sense to look for them. Consumers Union pans hoodia. Based on lack of evidence, Consumer Reports on Health (CRH) has recommended against taking products containing Hoodia gordonii, an herb that is widely promoted as an appetite suppressant. Hoodia is a cactus extract said to keep South African tribesmen from feeling hungry during long hunts. CRH's literature search yielded only two reports: (a) an unpublished report from a manufacturer about nine volunteers who were followed for 15 days, and (2) a study in which the ingredient was injected into the brains of rats. Neither of these studies substantiates the claims made by hoodia marketers. The editors also noted that Pfizer had tried to develop hoodia into an obesity drug but had given up after failing to make an acceptable synthetic version. [ [Hoodia: Worth trying for weight loss](http://www.consumerreports.org/main/crh/displayc.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=899485&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=362577&bmUID=1143047252288)? Consumer Reports on Health, Feb 2006] Unlicensed naturopath receives 13-year sentence. Brian Edward O'Connell, has been given consecutive sentences of 5 years for theft, 5 years for perjury, and 3 years for criminally negligent homicide. He also received concurrent sentences of 12 months in the county jail for practicing medicine without a license and 24 months in jail for 3rd degree assault. For many years, O'Connell operated Mountain Area Naturopathic Associates in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, where he displayed numerous degrees and certifications claiming he was doctor and a naturopath. Investigators concluded that O'Connell had treated about 4,000 patients even though he had no license to practice medicine or naturopathy in Colorado and was not certified as any kind of health-care worker. (His only health-related \"training\" had come from the Herbal Healer Academy, a nonaccredited correspondence school in Arkansas.) He also testified (fraudulently) as a toxicology expert in many court cases. In this case, O'Connell was prosecuted for hastening the death of a 19-year old cancer patient by injecting a hydrogen peroxide solution. He also injected hydrogen peroxide into a 17-year-old female, which caused her to go into cardiac arrest. Another of his patients had terminal liver cancer and was told by O'Connell that a \"black salve\" compound would pull the cancer out of his body. Instead it created open, bleeding wounds that continued until his death. O'Connell also provided a \"photoluminescence\" procedure in which he would withdraw the patient's blood, run it through ultraviolet light, and inject it back into the patient's bloodstream. Earlier this year, while the jury was being selected for his trial, it came to light that O'Connell had misrepresented his toxicology-related credentials in a 1999 trial in front of the judge who was assigned to the current case. When told that prosecutors planned to file an additional perjury charge, O'Connell decided to plead guilty instead of going through the trial. [ [O'Connell pleads guilty during jury selection](http://www.co.jefferson.co.us/news/news_item_T3_R134.htm). News release, Feb 1, 2006, Office of the District Attorney of Jefferson and Gilpin Counties] Additional details about O'Connell's practices and \"credentials\" are spelled out in a civil suit brought against him by the parents of the 19-year-old boy. That suit was settled last year for an undisclosed sum. [Barrett S. [Unlicensed naturopath facing wrongful death](http://www.naturowatch.org/legal/oconnell.shtml).

FDA warns WaterOz about illegal claims. The FDA has ordered WaterOz, of Granville, Idaho, to stop making illegal therapeutic claims for a dozen dietary supplement and herbal products. [Breen CM: [Warning letter to Gregory W. Towerton](http://www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/g5752d.htm), March 8, 2006] The company has been making such claims for several years. In 2000, the Internal Revenue Service launched a criminal investigation based on evidence that Hinkson had willfully failed to file income tax returns or pay Social Security taxes for his workers. The investigation led to the arrest of company founder David Hinkson for tax evasion, marketing adulterated drugs, selling misbranded and adulterated ozone generators, and structuring financial transactions to avoid bank currency reporting requirements. In 2004, Hinkson pleaded guilty to two of the product-violation charges and a jury found him guilty on 26 counts related to the tax misconduct. [Archived versions of the WaterOz Web site](http://web.archive.org/web/*/wateroz.com) show that from 2000 to 2002, the site contained \"recommended protocols\" for using 22 mineral products to treat about 100 \"specific health issues\" including AIDS, appendicitis, cancers, Down's syndrome, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and parasites. In 2002, the 60-page [WaterOz Buyer's Club catalog](http://www.quackwatch.org/14Legal/wateroz.pdf) offered about 200 products with false claims that more than 100 diseases and conditions are caused by mineral deficiency and can be effectively treated with the products. Despite the product-violation conviction, the site continued to advertise most of the mineral products with unsubstantiated health claims. In 2005, he was sentenced to 43 years in prison for soliciting the murders of a federal judge, a federal prosecutor, and an IRS agent in retaliation for the criminal case. It is not clear whether he still owns the company. [Quackwatch has additional information about Hinkson](http://www.quackwatch.org/14Legal/hinkson.html). Dental imposter arrested.

Donsbach 424 Calle Primera, Suite 102 San Ysidro, California 92073 Dear Mr. Donsbach: The Oregon Board of Naturopathic Examiners has asked this office, pursuant to our responsibility under ORS 348.885, to determine the authenticity of your 1960 Hollywood College doctoral diploma. After considerable investigation, we find that the diploma is not authentic. In addition to \"17st day of June,\" the diploma copy contains several very obvious internal inconsistencies in spacing, line, and calligraphy. It is not copied from an integral diploma. Instead it is, with a different name of recipient, a copy identical to one that has been determined by the Arizona Department of Public Safety to be a photocopy manipulation, derived from an actual chiropractic diploma of one Hollywood College School of Chiropractic. This office has further determined (1) that separate sworn depositions, obtained by the State of Arizona from a dean and a board president of Hollywood College, affirm that the college did not offer any naturopathic education or degree in 1960; (2) that a 1961 commencement program from the Hollywood College indicates no naturopathic faculty or ceremony, while it names, as a 1961 chiropractic graduate, a person who submitted to Arizona the same 1960 naturopathic diploma as yours; (3) that creation of the Hollywood College naturopathic diploma copy, using parts of the school's authentic chiropractic diploma, required xerographic reduction technology, which did not exist until 1969; (4) that documents purportedly from three different institutions in two states carry your name with the same misspelling and in essentially the same calligraphy; and (5) that all of the signatures on the ND \"diploma\" from Hollywood College appear to have been written by the same hand; but in any case that the signatures include \"Jesse Lester MD,\" despite the fact that Lester reported no MD in his 1963 naturopathic license application to the State of Arizona. We now propose to prohibit you from claiming a doctor's degree in Oregon and to notify the naturopathic board of this determination. whereupon you would be prohibited from holding a professional license dependent upon the possession of such a degree.

Charged with nine counts of illegal activity, Donsbach pleaded guilty in 1971 to one count of practicing medicine without a license and agreed to cease \"nutritional consultation.\" He was assessed $2,750 and served two years' summary probation. Here is a case summary from the California Bureau of Food and Drug. [Quackwatch has additional information about Donsbach's shady activities]. Kurt W. Donsbach Case Resum\u00e9 April 12, 1971 Inspectors from the Fraud Section of the Bureau of Food and Drug successfully culminated a five-month investigation April 9, when Kurt W. Donsbach of Nature's Way Health Food Store, 10072 Chapman Avenue, Garden Grove, entered a plea of guilty to practicing medicine without a license before West Orange County Municipal Court. In December of 1970, a nine-count complaint was prepared by the Orange County District Attorney's Office against Donsbach, which included practicing medicine without a license, representing certain food supplements to have an effect upon cancer, heart conditions and stomach ulcers, and false advertising of certain food supplements and various vitamins and minerals. According to Jim Eddington, Inspector in the Bureau and the arresting officer, on several occasions Donsbach made representations to an undercover agent that her breast cancer could be controlled if she followed his advice and adhered to a strict regimen of vitamins, minerals and an herbal tea called Chaparral. On other occasions, Donsbach told one undercover agent that her emphysema and heart condition would be helped 100% by following a prescribed regimen of vitamins, minerals and herbs. On one occasion, Donsbach instructed an undercover agent to take cabbage tablets daily to effect a cure for his stomach ulcer. Donsbach also operates WESTPRO LABS located in Garden Grove, a vitamin and mineral repacking firm which markets various products under the same name. It was calculated that if the undercover agent had followed Donsbach's treatment to the letter, she would have been spending about $60,00 per month for an extended period of time for the vitamins, minerals and herbs recommended which were almost exclusively WESTPRO LABS products. Donsbach represented himself as a Doctor of Chiropractic, Doctor of Naturopathy and Bachelor of Therapeutic Science. The investigation by the Bureau disclosed the fact that Donsbach is not licensed as a chiropractor in this state and that the other two credentials are not recognized by the State of California. According to the undercover operators who went to Donsbach, business was good. On almost every occasion the operators reported that about fifteen persons were also there\u2014waiting to see the \"Doctor.\" The \"Doctor\" was receiving \"patients\" and treating them (via organic vitamins and minerals, etc.) for disorders ranging from spastic colons to menopause, from serious heart ailments to breast cancer. If Donsbach was receiving moneys in the range of what was reported earlier from every victim he exploited, his annual gross would be $720.00/victim/year, or almost 2 million dollars a year, based on a five-day \"wok week\" and seeing 10 \"patients\" a day. . . Not bad. Unfortunately for \"Dr.\" Donsbach, he has agreed to get out of the \"nutritional consultation\" game in California, since he pled guilty to playing doctor without a license. The Court was not at all amused by what Donsbach was doing. He was sentenced to pay $600 plus P.O.E. to the Court, pay $2,000 restitution to the Bureau and to serve 2 years summary probation with terms that ge obey all laws. Jim D.
