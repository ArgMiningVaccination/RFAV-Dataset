A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Many people buy homeopathic and herbal remedies and take them alongside their prescribed medication. These remedies are not so strictly controlled but may still interact with the prescribed medicine and cause side effects, it is advisable for the GP's advice to be sought and care staff should not give any remedies to service users without GP authorisation. This, therefore, takes us to the most shared concerns people present about how homeopathic medicines are manufactured and of their safety. The raw materials used for various homeopathic medicines are known poisons. Samuel Hahnemann's goal was to search for a means to treat patients less severely than the treatments used in his day, which often involved purging, leeching, bloodletting, 2. Due to the comprehensive rehabilitation of the human body, I know osteopathic medicine is a superior approach to healing. I have internalized the ideology that a patient must be treated holistically and paralleled this idea while working at Response Crisis Hotline. I sympathize with callers who have diseases including schizophrenia, PTSD, crippling anxiety and depression. These patients are prescribed medication to relieve the pain, but they do not address the debilitating mental state the patient resides in at the time of the call. These patients often doubt their self-worth, and believe they are a burden to others and want to terminate their existence. I need to use a variety of skills such as patience, listening, quick thinking, intuition Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Homeopathy helps to restore children to health, to overcome their weekness and to get them ready for a healthy ife. People who have taken homeopathic remedies from childhood have fewer chronic diseases later on in their lives. The greatest protection is when all of the layers are removed and a proper constitutional remedy is given. Children have less layers than earlier than I , I have to first make it recognized that i am now not a health care professional. I do nonetheless have a fascination for typical remedies and homeopathic therapies, despite the fact that i'm also not thoroughly against western treatment. I just think that if a traditional comfort can comfortably treat a distinctive disorder, then there's no motive why I must take pharmaceutical medications. Because many of the treatments of alternative medicine do not adhere to the principles of conventional medicine, whether or not to allow practice of these techniques in the United States is a major concern of the medical community today. The Food and Drug Administration is the decision making body of issues such as this and more often than not, does not approve many of these practices. Due to the fact that holistic medicine sometimes contradicts the fundamentals of biomedicine, health care regulation boards such as the FDA find it difficult to accept many of these treatments. Because the Western world is so unfamiliar with these techniques it is only natural for medical community to often disprove these methods. However, as more and more doctors discover the limitations of Nux Vomica Homeopathy Remedy for Headache Homeopathy, \"the practice of medicine that embraces a holistic, natural approach to the treatment of the sick (Chase, 2007-2016, para 1). Homeopathy treats the person as a whole and all homeopathy remedies are from natural resources such as vegetables, mineral or animals (Chase, 2007-2016). There are three basic principles to Homeopathic medicine: Let Likes Cure Likes, The Minimum Dose and The Single Remedy (Chase, 2007-2016). There are also two main categories to consider in the treatment acute and chronic. In this paper the author will input a chronic problem and will obtain a recommended remedy for the problem at www.abchomeopathy.com. The author will then try the remedy for a few days and will review its effectiveness. The author will also then research the remedy and provide support for its effectiveness or non-effectiveness. Good for Health Modern medicine and healthcare system have categorized herbal medicine as a natural remedy used when people can't afford to purchase conventional drugs. They are perceived inferior because they cost less but the health benefits are endless. However, there have been various situations and instances that prove that herbal medicine is good for health. Homeopathic is effective for a wide range of ailments such as colds, flu, arthritis, allergies, and sprains to name just a few of the maladies for which there are homeopathic treatments for. But even homeopathy's most devoted supporters can not explain why it works, only that it does work. Critics of the homeopathic methods argue that the fundamental ideas behind homeopathy defy the laws of chemistry and physics and that it's theory makes no sense in the scientific world. (Langman, 1997). They also claim that homeopathic 'cures' are due to the so-called placebo effect; that the patients and professionals of homeopathy believe so strongly in their treatment that their belief system is actually the cure, not the homeopathic method used. (Langman, 1997). Homeopathy's newfound success also dismays many physicians, scientists and consumer advocates who regard the homeopathic formulas as ineffective, at best, and dangerous, at worst. They're especially concerned that by attempting to cure their ills with the homeopathic method, patients will not seek assistance from established treatments for very serious, perhaps life Homeopathy thus makes use of minute doses of generally natural substances which stimulate the body's own healing abilities and initiate the body's process of recovering from illness. By examining some of the most popular, enduring alternative medical systems, one can begin to see some general trends of the systems, understand some recurring flaws, and understand the attraction and usefulness of alternative medicine in today's health care system. However, alternative medicine remains controversial. Whether it can be supported scientifically or not, alternative medicine may be useful to encourage both physical and mental well-being via a placebo effect. For this reason, alternative medicine must be considered by physicians as a complement to modern medicine. How do you cure someone of an illness by giving that person a tiny concentration of something that actually causes the illness? According to proponents of the science, homeopathy not only works, but works better than conventional medicine. They say that somewhere along the line the pharmaceutical industry got involved in medicine, at which point natural remedies were abandoned in favor of chemical formulations. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
