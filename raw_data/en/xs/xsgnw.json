{"title": "Aortic Dissection and Hypotension Without Cardiac Tamponade: A Case Report", "author": "Ryuichi Ohta; Chiaki Sano", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Ascending aortic dissection is typically characterized by severe chest or back pain. However, its presentation can be atypical, leading to diagnostic challenges, especially in settings where classic symptomatology may not be evident. In this report, we described the case of a 74-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room of a rural community hospital with chief complaints of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, without the classic symptoms of chest or back pain associated with aortic dissection. Despite initial treatment for autonomic dysregulation, the patient's symptoms persisted. Subsequent comprehensive assessments, including computed tomography angiography, revealed an ascending aortic dissection extending to the bilateral common carotid arteries. This atypical presentation, characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion and systemic hypotension without tachycardia, emphasizes the need to maintain a high suspicion index, even in the absence of hallmark symptoms. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of ascending aortic dissection in patients with nontraditional symptoms. Recognizing these atypical presentations is crucial for timely intervention, especially in rural settings with limited advanced diagnostic tools. This case also highlights potential sex disparities in symptom presentation, emphasizing the need for clinicians to recognize nontraditional symptoms in women. Rapid identification, evaluation, and management are imperative to prevent severe outcomes, and a multidisciplinary approach has proven to be the most effective in such cases.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-30", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
