Our anti-body defenses are...| |8/22/2011 - Big Pharma, the CDC and other public health organizations tell the mainstream media (MSM) what to report about outbreaks and epidemics.

According to official public...| |8/17/2011 - When it comes to vaccine efficacy and safety, the vaccine industry, CDC, and other medical establishment authorities close their eyes and lie so often it sticks as reality to the mainstream media and gets to the masses. One only needs to look at the criminality of major vaccine pushers to begin questioning...| |8/11/2011 - Just when you think some progress is being made for allowing exemptions from required vaccination schedules, along comes a threatening policy statement from a group that does most of those vaccinations.

Most vaccines were scarcely a blip on the radar, not affecting the natural decline of the disease at all. In a few unfortunate cases such as polio,...| |5/23/2011 - Vaccinations are even worse than what most have thought.

His son, Alberto, has had to endure years...| |2/1/2011 - To hear it from proponents of the vaccine industry, vaccines are based on rock-solid science that proves them to be completely safe and widely effective.
