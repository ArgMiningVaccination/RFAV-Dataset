Homeopathy is a very safe and effective form of energy medicine that provides healing and holistic wellness. It addresses the entire, whole person not just the symptoms the person is experiencing. A Homeopath will ask you various questions in the consultation. Each individual experiences a cold differently, feels pain and describes that pain differently, and has different sensations related to the pain. There can be modalities or sensations that happen at the same time. For instance, \"when I get a headache I also have a pain in my left ear.\" A [ trained Homeopath](https://homeopathichealingcolorado.com/about-amy-certified-homeopath/) will listen without interruption and ask questions until they feel they have the full picture of what you are experiencing. Sharing very specific details with your Homeopath is key in discovering the right [Homeopathic remedy](https://homeopathichealingcolorado.com/what-is-homeopathy/) for your symptoms. Healing mental, emotional, and physical symptoms with Homeopathic remedies is the ideal way to full holistic wellness. How Does Homeopathy Work? Energy medicine addresses the natural state of your body. It works to remind your body, mind, and spirit how a balanced life should feel. On the mental/emotional plane, Homeopathy can alleviate depressed states, anxiety and panic attacks. It works effectively for grief and loss, and calms manic episodes related to ADHD and Autism. On the physical plane, Homeopathy speeds up the healing process, reduces physical pain and soreness. It also works to eliminate infections, alleviates blood pressure issues, clear skin conditions, and so much more! Typically, Homeopaths see clients who have tried every other form of medicine and is a last resort. Although Homeopathy has been successfully practiced for close to 300 years and used by over 200 million people worldwide, it isn't immediately thought of for help. That is unfortunate since it is such a safe, effective, and powerful form of healing!
