All participants will take 2 capsules orally, three times per day following meals for 12 weeks. | Dietary Supplement: CuraLin | CuraLin is a dietary supplement manufactured by NutraStar Inc. and sold by CuraLife; it is a blend of nine ayurvedic plants and herbs. The CuraLin formulation contains the following ingredients (per 2 capsules): - Hemoglobin A1C [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. In the presence of sustained elevated glucose levels, glucose non-enzymatically binds to hemoglobin, leading to the formation of glycated hemoglobin, and later, advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are responsible for many of the complications of T2DM. Thus, HbA1c, in conjunction with fasting blood glucose, is used as diagnostic criteria for T2DM (HbA1c 6.5%), and is used as a marker of glycemic control in diabetic individuals. As the life cycle of a red blood cell is approximately 90 days, serum HbA1c measurements are a snapshot of the percent of glycated hemoglobin over the prior two to three months, and thus serve as a snapshot of glycemic control in T2DM. HbA1c will be expressed as a percentage. - Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]Concentration of the enzyme Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in the blood is considered a measure of liver inflammation and oxidative stress. Liver function markers will be expressed as IU/L. - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]Concentration of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the blood is considered a measure of liver inflammation. Liver function markers will be expressed as IU/L. - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]Concentration of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood is considered a measure of liver inflammation. Liver function markers will be expressed as IU/L. - Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]The Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of - cell function and insulin resistance (IR) is a calculated ratio of fasting plasma insulin to glucose, and reflects the balance between hepatic glucose output and - cell insulin secretion. It has been used in greater than 500 research publications to provide an estimate of insulin sensitivity and - cell function, and is used to predict the level of insulin resistance. In patients with T2DM, the HOMA-IR is able to assess changes in -cell function and IR, and thus, provide a reflection of treatment effects. The HOMA-IR will be expressed as a number, where '1' is considered normal, and anything above '1' is reflective of some degree of insulin resistance. - Fasting Blood Glucose [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]FBG, in conjunction with HbA1c, is used as a diagnostic criteria for T2DM (FBG 126 mg/dL), and is used as a marker of glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Levels are associated with future cardiac events and other complications of T2DM. FBG will be expressed in mg/dL. - Estimated glomerular filtration rate [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]As estimation of the rate at which the kidneys filter and reabsorb protein based on age, ethnicity and blood creatinine. - Triglycerides [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]The concentration of triglyceride-based fats in the blood is a cardiovascular risk factor. - LDL:HDL ratio [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]The ratio of the concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL) to high density lipoproteins (HDL) is a cardiovascular risk factor. - BMI [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]Elevated body weight, manifesting as being overweight or obese, can cause and/or lead to exacerbations in a variety of pathologies, including T2DM, dyslipidemia, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, changes in weight are clinically meaningful in a T2DM population. This outcome measure is an important correlate and is of low burden to participants. Additionally, we will measure height in order to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). Body weight will be expressed in pounds, height in inches, and BMI in kg/m2. - Creatinine [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The concentration of creatinine in the blood is a measure of renal function. - Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The concentration of urea-based nitrogen in the blood is a measure of renal function. - PROMIS-29 Health-related Quality of Life [ Time Frame: 12 Weeks ]PROMIS-29 will measure health-related quality of life and is a validated, 29 question survey divided into seven sub-domains of function including physical functioning, social function, pain interference, pain intensity, sleep, depression, and anxiety.
