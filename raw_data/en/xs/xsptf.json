Sanford Health completes a community health needs assessment every three years. It is through this work that we identify unmet health needs in the community, and then strategically plan how to best address those needs. This process is well aligned with Sanford's vision to improve th e human condition. From December 2020 to February 2021, members of the community were invited to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs across a range of social determinants of health. Sanford Health and the NDSU Center for Social Research partnered to analyze the data from the primary research along with key secondary data points from County Health Rankings. Sanford also facilitated discussions with key stakeholders in each community to prioritize the identified needs. As a result of this process, we will address the following health needs in a formalized implementation strategy for the 2022- 2024 time period: - Mental health - Access to healthcare providers The CHNA process also focused on the many strengths and resources available in our community . This report includes an overview of the community assets that are available to address various community health needs. We have also included an impact report from our 2019 implementation strategies. We are committed to extending care beyond our bricks a nd mortar, and ultimately improving the health and wellness of our entire community. We are committed to improving the quality of life for all Thief River Falls area residents. We invite you to join us and thank you for your support of these ongoing effort s. Sincerely, Brian Carlson Executive Director Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center 3 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 BACKGROUND Community Description The Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center is located in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. Thief River Falls, located in northwest Minnesota, is one of the largest communities in that region with a population over 8,000. It takes its name from the falls of t he Red Lake River where it meets with the Thief River. Thief River Falls serves as a hub of economic activity with major employers including snowmobile manufacturer Textron Industries, Inc. (Arctic Cat), electronic parts distributor Digi -Key Corporation, and is the birthplace of Steiger Tractor. The Thief River Falls area is rich in natural beauty with forests, rivers, parks and wildlife. The community offers numerous options for recreation and physical activity, most prominently the Ralph Englestad hocke y arena. Popular outdoor activities include fishing, snowmobiling, hunting, skating and bird watching. The community boasts many well -maintained parks and a bike trail system. There are several fitness centers in town including Sanford Health Thief River Falls Wellness Center, which recently relocated to new, larger space with expanded fitness programs and options.

Sanford Thief River Falls employs 45 clinicians, including physicians and advanced practice providers, and over 600 employees. CHNA Purpose The purpose of a community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and develop a Community Investment/Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate and justify the not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health issues from a b road perspective. A community health needs assessment identifies the community's strengths and areas for improvement. A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Investment/Community Benefit Program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retaining our not -for-profit status. Regulatory Requirements Federal regulations stipulate that non- profit medical centers conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years and prioritize the needs for the purpose of implementation strategy development a nd submission in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code 501(r) (3). The Internal Revenue Code 501(r) requires that each hospital must have: (1) conducted a community health needs assessment in the applicable taxable year; (2) adopted an implementation s trategy for meeting the community health needs identified in the assessment; and (3) created transparency by making the information widely available. The regulations stipulate that each medical center take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community. Hospitals are required to seek at least one state, local, tribal or regional government public health department or state Office of Rural Health with knowledge, information or expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Non -profit hospitals are required to seek input from members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in the community, or organizations serving or representing the interest of such populations, and underserved populations experiencing disparities or at risk of not receiving adequate care as a result of being uninsured or due to geographic, language or financial or other barriers. The community health needs assessment includes a process to identify community res ources that are available to address the assessed needs and to prioritize the needs. Hospitals are to address each and every assessed need or explain why they are not addressing the needs. Once the needs have been identified and prioritized, hospitals ar e required to develop an implementation strategy to address the top needs. The strategies are reported on the IRS 990 and a status report must be provided each year on IRS form 990 Schedule H. 6 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 Finally, hospitals are to be transparent with the findings and make the written CHNA report available to anyone who asks for the report. Sanford places the CHNA reports and the implementation strategies on the Sanford website. Hospitals are required to keep three cycles of assessments on the web site. The 2022 report will be Sanford's fourth report cycle since the requirements were enacted in 2010. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. We worked closely with public health experts thro ughout the assessment process. Public comments and responses to the community health needs assessment and the implementation strategies are welcome on the Sanford website or contact can be made at https://www.sanfordhealth.org/about/community- health -needs -assessment . No community comments or questions regarding the previous CHNA have been made via the website link or email address. CHNA Process Sanford Health, in coordination with public health experts, community leaders, and other health care providers, w ithin the local community and across Sanford's care delivery footprint, developed a multi -faceted assessment program designed to establish multiple pathways for health needs assessment. Limitations The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the community. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. However, gaps in individual data sources may arise when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, income, minority status) with the current population estimates. For example, these gaps may occur due to the difficulty in contacting them through the survey process. To mit igate limitations, the CHNA evaluates community health from several perspectives; a stakeholder and community survey, meetings with community leaders that have special knowledge and expertise regarding populations, secondary data sources such as the U.S. C ensus Bureau and County Health Rankings, public comments from previous assessments, and institutional knowledge by Sanford employees locally and across the Sanford enterprise. Community and Stakeholder Survey Members of the community were asked a series of questions through an online survey designed in partnership with health experts and public health officials across the Sanford footprint to understand the needs of the community based upon the UW Population Health model. Each respondent was asked to rat e community drivers from poor to excellent. Any response other than excellent was offered a follow up opportunity to comment on the reason. Respondents were also asked a series of questions specific to their health care access, health care quality, barrier s to care, travel to care, and insurance. The survey was sent to a sample of the Pennington County population secured through Qualtrics, a qualified vendor. The full set of questions is available in the appendix. Consultation with Public Health, Community Leaders, Other Health SystemsCommunity & Stakeholder SurveySecondary DataAsset MappingLocal Community Stakeholder MeetingsCommunity Health Needs IdentifiedImplementation Plan 7 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 To further promote community involvement the survey was also sent to community stakeholders and elected officials with knowledge and connections amongst medically underserved, low income, or minority populations. Stakeholders were asked to complete the instrument as a resident of the community an d forward the survey to their respective populations for greater involvement. The survey was highlighted in a Sanford Health News article (https://news.sanfordhealth.org/community/health- needs -assessment -survey/) and promoted through social media via paid communication s. The paid communications yielded 344,300 impressions and 1,150 completed surveys across the system. Survey data for the local community should be considered directional and best utilized in conjunction with additional data. A total of 95 respondents from the CHNA area completed the survey. 6,748 total respondents from across the Sanford footprint completed the survey. Secondary Data County Health Rankings is based upon the UW Population Health model and serves as the main secondary data source utilized for the community health needs assessment. Alignment of the survey and secondary data within the UW Population Health model allows for greater connection of the data sets. Population data are sourced to the U.S. Census Bureau. Additional da ta sources may be used and are sourced within the document. Health Needs Identification Methodology The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University was retained to develop the initial community health needs list for each community and buil ds upon their involvement during the previous cycle. The following methodology was used to develop the significant health needs presented later in the report: Survey data was stratified into representative groups based upon population: large urban communit ies, medium sized communities, and rural communities. The three groups were analyzed separately. Thief River Falls is included with Bemidji, MN, Aberdeen, SD, Vermillion, SD, and Worthington, SD. To identify community health care needs, each community's s core by question was compared to the average stratified composite of the comparative group. For example, if the composite stratified system -wide average score is 4 and an individual community's average response was 2.5, that would suggest an issue of conce rn and a potential community health care need to be highlighted in the summary findings. Upon determination of a potential strength or need, County Health Rankings (https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) and responses from open- ended questions provided ad ditional insights into the drivers of the respective needs. A similar methodology was also used to provide additional insights into findings from County Health Rankings data with relevant health needs highlighted in the survey findings. Health needs ident ified through either the survey or County Health Rankings data but not both were also included in the findings. 8 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise followed with key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. Community Stakeholder Meetings Community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA research. Facilitated discussion commenced and each participant was asked to consider the needs identified above that should be further developed into implementation strategies. Health needs identified during the previous cycle but not raised through the survey or County Health Rankings were also considered. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. The facilitated discussion sought to inform on several aspects: What are the biggest challenges currently with these needs in the community? Does the community have gaps in services, access, outreach, etc.? OPPORTUNITIES - where can we have greatest impact in addressing these needs? Which are most urgent in nature? Is there work being done on these needs? What are the resources currently not utilized within the community that could address this topic? Which fall within the purview of healthcare system and which do not? Can the non- healthcare needs be shared with other entities or organizations? Is there anything you consider an urgent need that we have not discussed? At the end of the meeting the hospital a dministrator proposed the specific health needs to be addressed within the Implementation plan with input from the community members present. Administrator recommendations are based upon all factors, including primary and secondary data, input from the com munity stakeholder meeting, and scalability of current hospital programs and resources to address the identified needs efficiently and effectively. All identified needs not addressed in the implementation plan were shared with other community partners for action. Requests for survey data and other CHNA assets by public health organizations, governmental bodies, and community partners were and continue to be supported. Community Definition Pennington County in Minnesota is included in the data analysis and represents a majority of volumes to Sanford Thief River Falls hospitals. No population was excluded from the process. 9 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Community Health Summary CHNA respondents were asked to rate various community health issues and their personal health and wellness on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1= poor, 2= fair, 3= good, 4= very good, 5= excellent. Overall, perceptions among CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area regarding the following community health issues were positive. Average scores for childcare and preschool quality (average score=3.32), employment and economic opportunities (average score=3.52), access to healthy food (average score=3.62), comm unity safety (average score=3.80), and environmental health (average score=3.97) in the Thief River Falls market were all above 3.00 and were all higher than the average for the comparison group of similar -sized market areas. When asked about their persona l health, CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated their current health and wellness as good overall (average score=3.18); however, the average score was the lowest among similar markets served by Sanford Health. According to CHR, Pennington County ranks in the upper -middle range of Minnesota counties in terms of overall health. Adults in the Thief River Falls market average about 3.5 physically unhealthy days each month and 11 percent of adults average at least 14 days of physical distress per month - both measures are similar to the average for the comparison group of similar -sized markets served by Sanford Health. The following six areas of concern were identified for further discussion (in no particular order). Significant Identified Healt h Needs Access to Health Care Providers Access to affordable, quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance, local care options, and a usual source of care help to ensure access to health care. Having access to care allows individuals to enter the health care system, find care easily and locally, pay for care, and get their health needs met. While CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated their ability to access health care as good (average score=3.57), the score was lower than the average for the comparison group of similar- sized markets served by Sanford Health. In addition, when respondents were asked about the most important health care issues impacting their community, access to health care servi ces and providers was their top concern (slightly higher than COVID -19 concerns). Nearly one in six CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area who needed care in the past year did not receive it (16%), which was the highest percentage among similar mar kets served by Sanford Health. When asked why, the main reason was due to a lack of local providers (36%) - a reason which surpassed cost and COVID- 19 concerns. In addition, about half of CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area reported traveling ou tside of their community to receive health care services in the past three years (52%). When asked why, 67 percent of respondents who traveled for care indicated that the needed services were not available locally. One in five CHNA respondents in the Thie f River Falls area indicated they do not currently have a primary care physician (20%). CHR data indicate that the uninsured rate is relatively low in the Thief River Falls area (4.3%); however, the primary care physician ratio (one physician for every 1,575 people) is slightly higher than the comparison group average. CHR data also indicate that when compared to similar markets, the Thief River Falls area has the lowest mammography screening rate (45%) and one of the lowest flu vaccination rates (47%). 10 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 In the stakeholder meeting access to providers was discussed as a priority need in the community, although it was discussed alongside access to quality healthcare, mental health, and the aging population. Stakeholders believed that APPs like nurse practition ers were underutilized in the community because some residents only want to be treated by physicians. It was suggested that in addition to increasing the number of APPs in the area Sanford and community members could work to promote awareness regarding APP s talent and services. Meeting participants also had interest in increasing home health services for the elderly population. Telehealth was an area that stakeholders would like to see utilized as a way to increase access, although it may be difficult for t he elderly population to effectively use telehealth services. Overall increasing access to health care providers is a need of the community that stakeholders would like to see improve and somewhere where Sanford health could make a meaningful impact.

High quality care in inpatient and outpatient settings can help protect and improve health and reduce the likelihood of receiving unn ecessary or inappropriate care. CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated the quality of health care in their community as good (average score=3.04); however, the average score was the lowest among similar- sized markets served by Sanford Healt h. In addition, with the exception of affordable housing, CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated the quality of health care in their community lower than any other community health issue. For respondents who traveled for care in the past three years, 36 percent did so because they were after better or higher quality care (following 67% of respondents who indicated they needed a specialist or the needed services were not available locally). During the stakeholder meeting, access to quality hea lthcare was discussed within the context of increasing access to healthcare providers rather than as an isolated, individual need. Access to quality healthcare is a need in the community but will not be directly address in the implementation plan , although it may be influenced through other priority issues, particularly increasing access to healthcare providers. 11 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 Local Asset Mapping Health Insurance resources : Sanford Health Plan, 1749 - 38th St. S., Fargo NW Service Cooperative, 114 - 1st St. W., TRF Insurance Brokers, 102 S.

It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage o f life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood1 When CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls market were asked which health care services they would like to see offered or improved in their community, most said behavioral and mental health services (46%) followed by addiction treatment (36%). According to CHR, adults in the Thief River Falls market average about 3.8 mentally unhealthy days each month and 13 percent of adults average at least 14 days of mental distress per month. One of the mos t important measures of mental health within a community is suicide. CHR data indicate that the suicide rate in the Thief River Falls area (21 suicides per 100,000 people) is the highest among similar markets served by Sanford Health. Mental/behavioral health and substance abuse was identified as the number one health concern of the community during the community stakeholder meeting. In particular mental health concerns among youth was noted as an area of concern as the community lacks sufficient services for at -risk youth. Addressing the substance abuse and mental health needs of the community in the wake of the COVID -19 virus was also discussed as a consideration. Participants noted that lack of available local providers results in dif ficulty scheduling an appointment to see a mental health professional. Scheduling strains are also evident in the length of time required for a follow up visit.

As housing costs have outpaced local incomes, households not only struggle to acquire and maintain adequate shelter, but also face difficult trade- offs in meeting other basic needs. When the majority of a paycheck goes toward the rent or mortgage, it c an be difficult to afford doctor visits, healthy foods, utility bills, and reliable transportation to work or school. This can, in turn, lead to increased stress levels and emotional strain. CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated the availab ility of affordable housing in their community as less than good (average score=2.51). When respondents were asked to explain why they rated available, affordable housing as they did, responses focused on a limited selection of affordable housing units and rentals to choose from, for households with middle and lower incomes. Based upon the stakeholder meeting affordable housing is a known community need. Community leaders report that there is a gap in the housing market where the houses available in the com munity do not match the needs of its inhabitants. City officials report that work is being done to address this need through programs like workforce housing, and Sanford's efforts would not be most effective spent addressing affordable housing in the imple mentation plan as other organizations are addressing the need and have the appropriate competencies for the issue. Sanford would however be able to take a support role in the city's addressing of the issue.

Healthy homes can improve lives and provide a foundation of health for individuals and families, but unhealthy homes can just as easily undermine quality of life and even c ause poor or substandard health. A decent home is paramount to healthy aging3. CHNA respondents in the Thief River Falls area rated the quality of long -term care, nursing homes, and senior housing as good (average score=3.05); however, the average score was lower than the comparison group average. When the 23 percent of respondents who rated the quality of long -term care as poor or fair were asked why they did so, responses referenced a lack of facilities, staff, and trained staff. When CHNA survey respo ndents in the Thief River Falls area were asked about what health care services they would like to see offered or improved in their community, nearly one in five respondents indicated long -term care (18%). Based on the community stakeholder meeting long t erm care can be defined as more of an issue of access to providers than specifically long -term care. The participants of the meeting articulated a need for improving home health services for the elderly population. Other aspects of long -term care are impor tant but were not a significant topic of discussion.

In the past year we have added five new providers and are in the process of licensing a new facility for Substance Use Disorders (SU DS). Adolescent care providers has been a focus in recruitment but due to the specialization it is a difficult recruit. We continue to recruit for additional providers, particularly with training in adolescent care and treatment. The shift to telehealth, particularly video, was enabled by time -limited, regulatory changes related to reimbursement, privacy standards for telehealth technology, and licensure. \"Post - COVID -19 policies will determine whether telehealth remains central to US health care or returns to the periphery. Projected Impact Increased access to mental/behavioral health and substance abuse is the number one health concern of the community. In particular , sufficient mental health services for at risk youth do not support current needs . Addre ssing the substance abuse and mental health needs of the community in the wake of the COVID -19 virus was also identified.

Through telehealth technologies we have been able to expand access beyond the traditional face to face encounters. Telehealth opportunities are many, however constrained to some degree by payment models and whether insurance payors wil l recognize telehealth as a covered service. The COVID pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of telehealth by the consumer, providers and insurers however it remains to be seen whether support and adoption of this service option will continue at the pac e experienced during the pandemic. With regard to nurse practitioners, there is certainly opportunity to work with our partners to increase awareness among the general community of the expert care they can provide. Projected Impact Increase the number of local providers servicing Thief River Falls through locally based providers, outreach from other Sanford facilities, or telehealth/virtual care platforms. Increased providers will expand the number of available services and appointments available to the lo cal community. 17 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 Goal 1: Develop a fulltime dermatology clinic in Thief River Falls Actions/Tactics Measurable Outcomes & Timeline Resources to be committed Leadership Note any community partnerships and collaborations - if applicable Hire dermatology providers for TRF Providers signed.

Over the past several years Sanford TRF has worked to implement Team -Based care or \"Patient - centered primar y care\" to improve the delivery of high -quality care. Patient -centered primary care is relationship -based with an orientation toward the whole person, which includes partnering with patients and their families to understand and respect each patient's uniq ue needs, cultural values and preferences. In addition, we continue to work with our provider specialists from other markets to bring as many specialists to Thief River Falls as can be reasonably supported by patient volumes. Affordable Housing: Affordab le housing is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group determined that other organizations are addressing the need and have the expertise and competencies required to address the need. Sanford Thief River Falls will continue to part icipate in community discussions to address the housing shortages in Thief River Falls. Several large apartment buildings and single -family starter homes have been developed over the past several years , however , there remains a significant need for housing . Sanford will share information from the Community Health Needs Assessment with stakeholders addressing the issue as requested. Long -Term Care : Long -term care is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group determined that the need is a lower priority compared to other areas for purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment . Sanford Thief River Falls works collaboratively with the long -term care providers in and around our community. Open and candid discussions occur regularly with Sanford offering to assist in ways that make economic sense and enhance the quality of life for the residents in these facilities. Sanford continues to partner with long term care providers through agreements supporting the provision of medical oversight as required by regulation. Sanford will share results of the Community Health Needs Assessment with The Evangelical Good Samaritan Society and other long -term care providers, as requested. Public Transportation: Public transportation is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group determined that other organizations are addressing the need and have the expertise and competencies required to address the need. Sanford Thief River Falls continues to participate in community discussions regarding the needs and ideas around public transportation. Sanford has always been willing to support local initiatives in ways that make sense for the community and that can demonstrate a reasonable return on investment and sustainability for the community . Sanford Thief River Falls is addressing the need by sharing survey information with local transportation partners as appropriate and continuing to support patients by arrange rides to health care appointments when possible. 19 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 EVALUATION OF 2019 -2021 CHNA Mental Health and Substance Abuse In 2019, Sanford Thief River Falls received approval for the development and implementation of a substance use disorder (SUD) service line, but implementation of the program is on hold due to COVID -19, following initial plans to open in the Fall of 2020. Sanford Thief River Falls completed the renovation of the facility that will house the SUD program in late fall of 2020. Application for licensure through the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) was submitted in November 2020. However, the licensing division of DHS has been operating at greatly reduced staffing levels due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. The reduced capacity has delayed review of the license application and is currently under DHS review as of February 2021. No indication on the timing of a decision has been provided. The program will open and begin providing services as soon as the l icense is received. The BHS -6 behavioral health screening tool is one of several depression screening tools available to providers to assess a patient's mental health relative to depression. Currently only Sanford One Care Clinics are using the BHS -6 scre ening tool and all other Sanford clinics are using the PHQ -9 patient health screening tool. TRF is using the PHQ -9 which has been incorporated into the EMR medical record as a screening prompt for providers on an annual basis for all primary care patients . In CY19 TRF's primary care provider teams achieved an overall administration percentage rate in excess of 90% for the PHQ -9; well above the target of 80%. Upon completion of the PHQ -9 screening and based on the individuals score, the provider may recomm end additional screenings and further clinical follow -up with a mental health professional. Sanford has an algorithm that outlines each step in the process. Children and Youth The children and youth priority has been significantly impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Employers have not been willing nor engaged in the development of childcare options and strategies, primarily due to the masking, social distancing, and business closure mandates from the state of Minnesota. Children's Therapeutic Support Ser vices (CTSS) is a flexible package of mental health services for children who require varying therapeutic and rehabilitative levels of intervention. The program is provided in all Thief River Falls schools to address the dangers of drugs in addition to oth er mental health issues. The CTSS program has also been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic as most schools discontinued in- school learning and implemented distance learning structures; effectively removing children from the CTSS model of behavioral health services. Referrals and engagement decreased during the school shut down/distance learning. Sanford Thief River Falls implemented telehealth services and did more in- home work with families that were willing. Referrals have seen a marked increase since scho ols returned to in- person learning and we would expect a return to normal caseloads by the end of March 2021. Additionally, TRF behavioral health staff make themselves available and participate with law enforcement educating school age children regarding the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program every year. 20 dba Sanford Thief River Falls Medical Center EIN #4 1-0709579 CONTACT INFORMATION The Community Health Needs Assessment, Implementation Plan, and survey data are available online at https://www.sanfordhealth.org/about/community -health -needs -assessment .
