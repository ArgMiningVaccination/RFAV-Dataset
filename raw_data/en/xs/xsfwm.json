The principles of integrative oncology include: - Treating the whole person: Integrative oncology practitioners focus on treating the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of a patient's health. This approach recognizes that cancer treatment can have a profound impact on a patient's overall well-being and quality of life. - Combining conventional and complementary therapies: Integrative oncology combines conventional cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy with complementary therapies such as IV therapies, supplements with anti-cancer effects, hyperthermia, peptides and nutrition counseling. This approach is designed to optimize the effectiveness of cancer treatment while minimizing side effects and improving quality of life. - Personalized treatment plans: Integrative oncology recognizes that every patient's cancer journey is unique. Integrative oncology practitioners work with patients to create personalized treatment plans that take into account each patient's individual needs, preferences, and goals. - Evidence-based therapies: Integrative oncology practitioners rely on scientific evidence to guide the use of complementary therapies. They prioritize therapies that have been shown to be safe and effective in scientific studies and incorporate them into a patient's treatment plan in a thoughtful and evidence-based manner. - Collaboration with conventional medical providers: Integrative oncology practitioners work closely with conventional medical providers to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. This collaboration is critical to ensuring that integrative and conventional treatments are coordinated and optimized for each patient's unique needs.
