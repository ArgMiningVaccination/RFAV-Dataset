Strongly enforcing public ordinances, increasing liquor license regulation, mobilizing citizens to attend city council meetings, modifying the environmental design, using the court system to direct alcoholics to treatment, and gaining the cooperation of liquor store and tavern owners to decline alcohol to habitually intoxicated people. In a multi-phased, 3-year process, Broadway Street was transformed into a booming business district. From 1993 to 1998, the area experienced a 58-percent reduction in total police calls, and from 1993 to 1997, it experienced a 70 percent decrease in the demand for rescue squad services. From 1995 to 1998, the Broadway business district has gained $8.4 million in new public and private investment, 410 new jobs, and 33 new businesses. Scanning In the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Broadway Street had a seedy reputation. Transient alcoholics slept on park benches outside of neglected, decaying buildings. Liquor bottles littered the streets, and rowdy taverns went unchecked for decades. Law-abiding citizens avoided the area while businesses suffered financially. Over the last 40 years, 16 to 18 taverns operated in Broadway's 3-block business district. Shootings, stabbings, and other violent crimes occurred in these taverns. Broadway became known as the \"Wild West.\" Residents and business owners viewed Broadway as isolated and they felt abandoned by city government. Before 1995, there was little growth in the Broadway business district. Analyzing the Problem In 1995, the Green Bay Police Department adopted the concept of community policing, assig-ning two officers to the Fort Howard district, which encompasses the Broadway business district. Green Bay's community policing officers (CPOs) focus on long-term problem solving and typically are not dispatched to calls for service. The newly stationed CPOs interacted with neighborhood residents, schoolteachers, children, and business people. No longer insulated from the public by squad cars, they experienced neighborhood conditions first hand. Within a short time of being assigned to the Fort Howard District, the officers observed the following about the Broadway district: A disproportionate demand for police and rescue services compared to the rest of the city. O An unusually' high concentration of crimes such as battery, disorderly conduct, retail theft, criminal damage to property, public urination, prostitution, and drug activity. Visibly intoxicated people engaged in inappropriate behavior near the elementary school and in city parks (sleeping on benches, vomiting, urinating, and defecating outdoors). Transients and Taverns Police department analyses revealed that approximately 20 individuals, mostly intoxicated people who lived on the streets and people who had mental illnesses, were involved in most of the neighborhood complaints. The homeless shelter had referred many of these individuals to the Brown County' Mental Health Center's Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse outpatient counseling. Many chose not to accept these services and remained on the street, though they would have been permitted to stay at the shelter if they were sober. Analysis showed most victims of serious crimes were patrons of the problem taverns. Repeat calls were made to the same licensed liquor establishments for fights and other alcohol-related problems. Persons who did not patronize area taverns rarely were victims. Rates of other crimes such as rape, muggings, and assaults were very low for citizens who did not patronize the taverns. Loosely Regulated Liquor Licenses The city's Protection Welfare Committee, which regulates liquor licenses, often approved and renewed licenses without question. Convicted drug dealers were granted bartender licenses. The progression of disciplinary action against the owner of a problem tavern began with a series of warning letters issued by the committee and culminated with issuance of a municipal citation by the police. Before 1995, no liquor license had been forcibly revoked since the late 1970's. Patrol officers usually did not issue citations to bar owners if they' were absent at the time of incidents. Loose bar management and re=malar owner absence enabled an environment that was tolerant of disorderly and illegal conduct. Unfortunately, under the existing system, it was difficult to hold bar owners accountable. Police Enforcement Lacking The police response to alcohol-related complaints in the Broadway business district rarely included enforcement action, partly due to a change in the local jail policy. In the early 1990's, the local jail began refusing to accept prisoners who had blood alcohol content levels higher than .30 percent, unless they had received medical clearances. This eliminated what was known as the \"drunk tank\" and left no other practical alternative for street patrol officers. The consequences of the policy were that police would spend time transporting arrested individuals to a hospital emergency room to receive medical clearance and then transporting individuals to a jail or a mental health center. These facilities often released people to the community in 24 hours, where police officers would find them in the same condition soon after their release. Patrol officers viewed the 2 hours spent transporting arrestees from place to place as a waste of time and taxpayer dollars) The community police officers learned about the neighborhood's lack of faith in and reliance on the police through a cooperative relationship with the Fort Howard-Jefferson Family Neighborhood Resource Center, a bilinmaal, multicultural, grass- roots organization with a commitment to strengthen the Broadway' neighborhood. The community police officers listened to area business leaders and neighborhood residents at meetings sponsored by the Center. The community members said Broadway was viewed as a dumping ground by the rest of the city, including the police, and its business community had long ago lost faith in the police department's response. Citizens no longer called to report nonemergency problems to the police. The Green Bay Police Department's analysis showed that officers also did not make sufficient use of other agencies, such as the revenue department, park department, city attorney's office, building and health inspection departments, and mental health services, that were available to help them. Also, officers did not fully understand the different roles that municipal and circuit courts could play in resolving disorder problems--the latter court could require participation in treatment, the former could not--and did not refer offenders to the appropriate court. Environmental Design Flaws A review of building design in the Broadway area highlighted numerous deficiencies. Several taverns had dark alcoves and doorways facing alleys, permitting criminals discrete, easy access to the taverns. Drug users and sellers could quickly duck into taverns and get lost in the crowd, making it difficult for patrol officers to make arrests. Poorly designed landscaping created hiding places for people who were intoxicated and living on the streets. Dense undergrowth made detection of transients during routine surveillance difficult. Response The Green Bay Police Department planned a five- phase response to do the following: Eliminate illegal activity from the neighborhood. Reduce the need for police and rescue services. Bring business to the neighborhood by improving the public's perception of the Broadway business district. Restore public faith in the police department by building a cooperative working relationship. Phase 1: No-Serve List The police targeted a core group of individuals who accounted for most of the problems in the area. Officers provided liquor store and tavern owners a list of people who were habitually intoxicated, accompanied by a letter requesting the licensees to decline service to these people. To alleviate concerns of bar and liquor store owners who were reluctant to call the police when there was a disturbance, the police and business owners agreed that legitimate calls for assistance would not be used against the businesses. The police department distributed a letter to license holders that was approved through the city attorney's office. To gain compliance with the no- serve list, police educated liquor retailers and tavern owners on their responsibility to decline service to intoxicated people. The letter defined intoxication by physical characteristics. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter to the police department expressing concern over distribution of the no-serve list, arguing that \"Targeting some individuals to be denied legal goods and services causes a tangible change in the legal and social status of the affected individuals.\" The ACLU requested that the police department retrieve the lists from bar owners and issue a directive to prohibit the practice in the future. However, the Green Bay City Attorney reviewed the ACLU's complaint and advised the police department that the no-serve list was supported by Wisconsin statute 125.12(2)3, which prohibits distribution of alcohol to \"known habitual drunkards.\" The police department continues the practice, which has turned out to be one of the most successful programs implemented by the Fort Howard district's CPOs. Phase 2: Operation: \"Hot Seat\" Patrol officers stepped up enforcement of ordinance violations in the neighborhood during phase 2. Citations and arrests were made where warnings had been given in the past. Offenders were diverted from municipal court to circuit court, which has the authority to order treatment. Phase 3: Modifying Environmental Design Police department analysis showed that no attention had been paid to environmental design in the areas experiencing problems. In phase 3, the police department and other city agencies made the following changes: \u00ae 3 o Trimmed shrubs that concealed illegal activity'. o Modified park benches to prevent individuals from lying down. o Eliminated access to an unsecured apartment building that transients used as a hiding place. Regularly maintained park grounds, eliminating buildup of litter and bedding generated by transients. o Improved lighting and limited access to dark alcoves behind taverns. Phase 4: Operation: \"Spotlight\" The police department proactively sought media attention because it realized that if it pitched the story to the media first, the media was more likely to present a more balanced story. The police department made it clear to the press that arrests, liquor license hearings, and crackdowns were part of the revitalization and improvement of the neighborhood. The department pointed out that random crimes, such as muggings, were rare. Phase 5: Increased Regulation of Liquor Licenses Since most citizens were unaware of the license regulation for problem liquor establishments, the community-police response included educating the public about how they could influence the actions of the Protection and Welfare Committee, which regulated licenses. CPOs provided citizens with the following information: o Dates and times of Protection and Welfare Committee meetings. o The names and phone numbers of council members who sat on the committee. o The proper procedure for addressing the committee. Meetings once conducted in a small room in city hall were moved to city council chambers in 1996 to accommodate the increased number of citizens attending. The neighborhood's interest in the committee's actions had increased committee members' accountability to the public. Bar Owners Liable Working with the city attorney's office, the police department implemented changes to city ordinances. Police officers now can cite bar owners, even if they are not present during the time offenses are committed. The city attorney's office developed a system whereby points are assessed against the liquor license upon conviction of an alcohol-related offense. The police automatically can suspend a license and close a tavern for a designated period of time after 12 points have been accumulated. Assessment During the past 4 years, the health of the Broadway business district continually has improved. Five taverns rife with criminal activity were closed as the result of the joint efforts of community police officers and citizens. Citizens played a key role in driving out these taverns by pressuring council members to take action. Community policing efforts drove out three other troublesome businesses--a pawnshop, a business where illicit drugs were sold, and an adult bookstore. Improved Public Perception Since 1995 the Broadway business district has experienced substantial growth in new businesses and jobs. On Broadway, a private, nonprofit organization that promotes investment in the Broadway business district, found the following in an analysis of investment in the neighborhood: o $8,364,808 in public and private investment. o 410new jobs. o 33 new businesses. o A $1.8 million day care center under construction in 1999. 53. I million in streetscape, sidewalk, and lighting improvements from the city government. Reduced Need for Police and Emergency Services Computer-aided dispatch system statistics show a remarkable decrease in the demand for police resources, including: a 58-percent reduction in total police calls from 1993 to 1998. o a 70-percent decrease in the demand for rescue squad services from 1993 to 1997. . a 69-percent reduction in disturbance calls from 1993 to 1997. This significant reduction in the demand for police resources frees police officers to assist in other areas of the city. Restored Public Faith in the Police To educate and mobilize neighborhood residents, the Green Bay Police Department built a close, cooperative working relationship with the Fort Howard-Jefferson Family Neighborhood Resource Center, which sponsored neighborhood meetings and handled mass notification of city hearings. Through this relationship, the Green Bay Police Department has restored public faith in its ability to solve problems in the Broadway district. Dale Smith, owner of Dale's Millenium Motors, a Broadway district business, notes, \"Our neighborhood is easily 100 percent better because of the beat cops and their extra efforts.\" Tom Perry, associate editor of the Green Bay Press Gazette, wrote, \"Forget the negative images, the news from Broadway is mostly positive and upbeat.\" Broadway has become not a part of town that needs to be avoided, but rather % great place to shop,\" according to Larry and Ben Frye, owners of the Broadway district's String Instrument Workshop. Did Crime Relocate? While some problem taverns chose to relocate to other areas of the city, they were not a problem once they and their problem patrons were no longer sharing the same neighborhood. The habitually intoxicated transients did move to areas of the city where enforcement was not as stringent. However, displacement had an unexpected side benefit: Other neighborhoods asked for and received community policing teams assigned to their districts. The Broadway business district now is a thriving part. of downtown Green Bay. The Green Bay Police responded to the same calls in the Broadway business district for decades with no change. Only when the police employed the assistance of the community did long-lasting changes take place. Sidebar: Resources That Helped Broadway Succeed Funding The Green Bay Police Department has been assisted by funds from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. A grant enables the department to pay salaries for four community-policing officers for 3 years. Two of these officers are assigned to the Fort Howard District. Training The department developed its own problem- solving training by organizing meetings with other similarly assigned police officers from across the State. Herman Goldstein's book, \"Problem Oriented Policing,\" helped the department develop problem-solving strategies. Donations Community members donated equipment and office space for community policing officers. The officers' office space was provided free of charge in an elderly housing complex in the neighborhood. Area businesses donated a @ computer, cellular telephone, police bicycles, and office furniture. The Fort Howard neighborhood and area businesses conducted a fundraising campaign in 1998 to send the two community policing officers to the Police Executive Research Forum's Problem Oriented Policing conference in San Diego, California. Notes 1. One individual, known as \"Rooster,\" had been placed at the mental health center more than 80 times for intoxication. The Brown County Health Center estimates that the cost for an admission for detoxification is $400 per day with an average stay of 2 days. St. Vincent's Hospital estimates that the hospital emergency room costs average $300 to $400 for this type of visit, and the police department's business manager estimates that it costs an average of between $50 and $100 depending on the man-hours required to handle the call. \"Rooster's\" 80 visits, then, amount to $96,000 in taxpayer dollars.

YAR programs are governed by local boards of youth and adults responsible for grant-making. Through projects whose costs are affordable to any community, young people in classrooms, neighborhood centers, youth organizations, community foundations, and clubs tackle a range of social issues that concern them--from health, housing, education, and the environment to drug abuse, gangs, illiteracy, and crime. Youth from all walks of life get involved. Some are experienced in community service; others may be new to volunteering. Some have troubled histories; some are honor roll students. Some live in inner cities; others live in suburban or rural areas. All want to make their communities better places for themselves and others. You are important. You are part of us. And we can't solve community problems without you. This is YAR's message to young people. When youth get involved in YAR projects and serve on YAR boards, they begin to feel a sense of connection, civic responsibility, and self-worth as they see their own ideas and actions create positive change in social conditions. [] In communities across the country and abroad, youth who have never joined organized activities are taking leadership roles alongside experienced youth and adult leaders. are learning the values of working as part of a group to solve conflicts and other social problems. [] In juvenile correctional settings, youth are taking responsibility, creating solutions, and gaining pride and a sense of connection to their communities. Developed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) in 1987 with funding from the Lilly Endowment, Inc., the Youth as Resources (YAR) model proved so successful that in 1995 NCPC, again with support from the Lilly Endowment, established the Center for Youth as Resources (CYAR), a separately incorporated organization Center for Youth as Resources - 1000 Connecticut Avenue.

All YAR programs embody a fundamental YAR philosophy--youth can and do make a difference in meeting critical community needs. They create and conduct community service projects. They partner with adults on local YAR boards to make program policy decisions. And, they act as grantmakers, evaluating project proposals from their peers and awarding grant dollars. As YAR programs evolve according to unique local needs and resources, each site develops a history and flavor of its own. Yet all adhere to a common set of standards that constitute the mission and philosophy of Youth as Resources. Since 1987, Youth as Resources programs have involved more than 200,000 youth in thousands of projects benefitting people in urban, suburban, and rural communities in the United States and abroad. All Youth as Resources Programs J Provide grants for youth-planned, youth-led community service projects; [] Are governed by a local board including youth and partners in policy-making, grant-making, and governance; [] Fund and support service projects that help to ritlcal communlty needs; and [] Recognize and celebrate positive youth ions to the community.

Local YAR programs may also create their own nonprofit organizations. A local board of youth and adults to award grants Boards of young people and adults who reflect the diversity of their communities govern local YAR programs. Youth and adult board members review grant applications and select grantees. Together, they set program policy and determine criteria for grant applications. Adults support youth by modeling leadership, cooperation, and a strong service ethic. A pool of grant money to support projects Funders of local programs have included businesses, local and state government agencies, philanthropic foundations, and social service programs. The money needed varies depending on local needs and the number of youth the local program wishes to engage in community service. A YAR director A local YAR program director oversees daily operations, provides training and support to youth groups, conducts community outreach, raises and manages funds, monitors youth projects, and works closely with the board.

YAR's success has been in reaching all types of young people in all types of settings. Many are traditionally hard-to-reach youth not typically involved in volunteering. All youth are encouraged to participate through community outreach efforts conducted by the board and the program director. Adult volunteers Caring adults from all areas of community life step forward to support youth efforts to design and deliver projects. Every youth project has an adult volunteer who provides logistical support and guidance, while ensuring that young people have central roles in making decisions and leading projects. Local project sponsors Youth seeking to run a project need a sponsoring group to be the conduit for their YAR grant funds. YAR projects are sponsored by a range of nonprofit organizations, from those involved with youth (schools, 4-H clubs, group homes, and Girl Scouts) to community organizations such as religious insitutions, public housing authorities, nursing homes, park departments, police departments, and environmental groups. Recognition of youth accomplishments One key to YAR's success is community recognition of youth accomplishments. Local programs sponsor recognition events at the end of each round of projects--an awards dinner or other ceremony where the news media and local celebrities help celebrate and thank the young people involved in service. In addition, many programs host a kick-off event to announce awards. The press and the public are invited to meet youth awardees and learn about their projects.

Two rival Nations (enemies), joined to form the B.G.D.N.: DISCIPLE NATION - led by David \"Devil\" Barksdale, who grew up on the south side of Chicago, Engiewood area. GANGSTER NATION - led by Larry Hoover, who aLso grew up on the south side of Chicago, Englewood area. The B.G.D.N. was formed to counter the power and control, along with an increased membership, of another rival gan~ leader, Jeff \"Ange~.\" Fort. Fort was the leader of the Blackstone Rangers who formed the Black P. Stone Nation by uniting sma!.ler faction street gangs. At a meeting of these two nations, a coin toss determined which name would be p!.aced ahead of the other. Hoover won the toss and the Gangster name preceded the Disciple name. Barksda[e became the supreme ruler, with Hoover being second in command. Policy for the B.G.D.N. was determined by Barksdale and Hoover in conjunction with a ruling council The ruUng council consisted of members who were previous leaders of the smaller faction ~angs. Leadership was broken down further along military type structuring; Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, and Dons controlling different neighborhoods. Barksdale was shot in 1969 and died in 1972 from liver failure along with other compl.ications from these wounds. After Barksdale death, Hoover began praising the teachings of \"King David\" (Barksdale) and made himself the new supreme leader, taking control of the B.G.D.N. Jerome \"Short-y\" Freeman a former \"Renegade Disciple\" challenged Hoover's leadership. Freeman, always loyal to Barksdale, never wanted to join with Hoover and the Gangster Nation. Freeman, along with the support of other leaders who resented Hoover, made himse[f.a parallel supreme leader (KING) of the B.G.D.N. along with Hoover. Freeman moved to Madison, Wisconsin were he was arrested for Armed Robbery and sentenced to Waupun Correctional Institution in 1977 and released in 1982. Having two \"Kings,\" the B.G.D.N. split along old lines of the Discipl.e and Gangster Nations. Freeman in control of the Disciples and Hoover in control of the Gangsters. This loyalty difference is a |arge factor of why the B.G.D.N. is a loosely structured organization. Despite this split in loyalty to \"Kin8 Hoover\" and \"King Short'y,\" all B.G.D.N. members remain loyal to \"King David\" and regard hir~ a martyr. This appears to be the one uniting factor in maintaining this Nation.

Shortly after they moved, they established the Spanish Cobras in Milwaukee. After having dominated a section of the south side other groups emerged such as the Rican Brothers who started out as a \"good guy\" gang to protect themselves from the Spanish Cobras. Being out numbered, the Rican Brothers slowly diminished. Another group ted by two local youth emerged calling themselves the Latin Kings. The Latin Kings were formed in opposition to the Spanish Cobras. In 1987, a Leader of one of the two families of Spanish Cobras was murdered. It was believed that a member of the other family murdered this member. The killing caused a break up between the two families, resulting in a group calling themselves La Familia.

CONS'nTUTION We the membership are grateful to the Heavenly Father of his blessing in permitting us to enjoy the Ethic, Religious, and Political l.iberties provided. As we combine the sacrifices of the brothers in the past and present, we are grateful to them, for it was through them that this Unique and Supreme Organization has extended throughout the years. We as members will honor and respect the set of laws of our Constitution and will maintain a representative and an orderly governing body in that way. 1. Eliminate poverty and inequality within our Organization. 2. To assure Education, Political and Economical development within our Organization. 3. To provide Safety, Security, and Domestic Tranquility for the entire membership. 4. To provide a more gratifying style of social living for the liberties of our children. We bless all of our members along with their families, and will continuously strive to provide our descendants with a more peaceful environment. \"AMOR\" The purpose for this preface is to define our fast existence, Present existence, and our future directions as we continue to strive to achieve success throughout the coming years. First of all, one must understand the existence of our Organization since the late 60\"s when we had to pursffe a positive and more satisfying existence of survival that brought about a true shining (GREEN) light for the puoose of our direction. However, it wasn't until the recent years that the shining Light was able to develop itself into a welt Organization group of folks, who now struggle to better the economical deprivation of our descendants. /ks an example we offer the following, two well known organizations which were formed to bring about political Labor orientation with the assistance of our allies emerged together to represent the \"Youth Latin Organization,\" (YLO) in the early 70's. Organizing the YLO enabled them to press for better working conditions that would bring about Economical Development in our communities. In the middle of 1979, the \"United Latin Organization\" (ULO) was organized. After realizing and acknowledging our cultural beliefs and its values, we and our allies set out to brin~ about poiiticai power, better working conditions, better housing conditions, and peace and harmony throughout our hispanic communities. Our groups did not survive because of the lack of education, and the news media, who along with the governmental system wholeheartedly participated in causing destruction to our cause. Then survived b~cause they developed the sufficient potential needed to achieve the Growth, Education, and Social Development needed to maintain an office that would petition any governmental system that oppressed our struggle. We, as a true \"Green Organization,\" that has manifested itself into a Unique one, and that has developed sufficient knowledge to bring about the necessary changes within the concept, the NEW CONCEPT wil.l serve as a mechanism to bring forth the necessary objectives that will guide our membership to become professional in whatever field they may choose. This direction will point out more efficiently our goals, will give our information about the new objectives and interest within and plans that will better our future. Nonetheless a pattern of discipline must come about in a more aggressive manner, to enforce our rules more then ever, to serve as a means to our members.

Though originally its members were Maniac Latin Disciples (MLD), a disageement resulted in a group of gang members breaking away to form a new gang, the SPANISH COBRAS. Despite this, the two gangs are still closely aligned and are allies. In 1979, \"KC\", the leader and founder of the SPANISH COBRAS, was killed by members of a gang called the Insane Unknowns. The ensuing gang war was called the \"'War of Insanity\" and resulted in the deaths of many gang members over a week long period. Even today, SPANISH COBRA gang members return to the grave site of their fallen leader, \"KC\". The gang also does a retaliatory shooting on the anniversary date of his death, using this as a motive for the shooting. J The criminal expertise of the SPANISH COBRAS is in the street level sale of narcotics, which is enforced by the use of drive-by shootings. Their number one rival is the Latin Kings, who control most of the area surrounding the SPANISH COBRAS' territory, with the COBRAS having mastered the \"art\"~'bf drive-by shootings in their on-going war with the Latin Kings. The SPANISH COBRAS are part of a coalition called the United Latino Organization (ULO), which is made up of the Imperial Gangsters, Latin Jivers, Maniac Latin Disciples, and the SPANISH COBRAS. Members of the SPANISH COBRAS have been found to be residing in several of the Midwestem states, as well as in Denver, Colorado; West Palm Beach, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas.

The FBI said it had warned local police that Terrance Richardson, sought in two Chicago\" area homicides, might come to Green Bay looking for ing Sunday that left one man wounded and led to a chase southward on Interstate 43, end- ing in the arrest of Richardson and two others in Ozaukee County. Chicago detectives said they might come to Green Bay today to interview the three. The warning to Green Bay police noted that Richardson, 23, was considered extremely dangerous and sometimes used a Thompson submachine gun. \"He sprayed bullets all over the place in a drive-by homi- \"cide,\" said Terrance Thedford; a Chicago detective attached to an FBI fugitive ~ight task force that. was looking for Richardson. and found he was wanted for murder in Chicago. Richardson, described as a leader of the Conservative Vice Lords gang, remains jailed alongtwith Vincent Thornton, 22, and Maurice Johnston, 17, all of Chicago. The three are being held on $500,000 bond each on charges of attempted first-degree inten- tional homicide. Their prelimi- nary hearing is scheduled Tuesday in Brown County Circuit Court. According to the criminal complaint, the three intended to kill Earl L. Miller, 34, of Green Bay and wounded him when he dove through a window and fled from them. Bay Sunday. Drug traffic here has ~increased steadily\" over the past several years, and it is due to gangs from Chicago, Milwaukee and Minneapolis doing business here, Swanson said. The reason for Green Bay's attraction is twofold: One, there are fewer drugs on the market here; and two, they consequent- ly command a higher price, which means big~_er profits for gangs. The presence of gang leaders here is \"a community problem, 'not a police problem,\" Swanson added, asking people to get more involved by reporting sus- picious activity.

VICE LORD KEYS 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. WHAT IS LORDISM It is the philosophy, the ideology and guidelines of a chosen way of life. A loadstone that was made manifest through the then primitive teaching influenced by the times and environment of its first teacher the HONORABLE PEPPILOW, and chiselled down by devoted believers from various schoo(s of thought into its structure of today. WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF LORDISM First the be[ief in its authenticity in the sight of God. We don't believe anyone people have a monopoly on God or anyone re[igion can claim him exc[usive[y. We be[ieve that man represents the tivin 8 temp[e of God and God exists in that temple. We bel,ieve that all men are created equal in the sight of God and that the righteous Vice Lord wil,[ be a recipient of God's grace in the same fashion that any other righteous person will regardless of his/her religious persuasion. All religious books affirm marts superiority over the rest of God's creation, thus it is from the understanding of such books that the righteous believers have obtained a deeper understanding of his Lord sel,f. The Quran says that Allah (God) put man here as his Vice Garret/Garrison. Our interpretation of this is that he put man here to be his Vice Rul,ers of this physical world. THE MEANING BEHIND OUR NAME \"Vice\" means one having faults (the human being), second in importance (man being second only to Al.lah), Allah (God) being ruler of all, the world and universe. Man was elected by him to be his righteous believers or his vice rulers of the physical world. \"Lord\" means on having dominion over other, a ruler. We see ourselves as God's highest creation, his custodians of this physical world, his Vice Lords. We believe that whether you address yourself as a Muslim, a Christian, a Jehovah Witness, etc.. By the definition of that which just been define you are still a Vice Lord, the only difference is on of interpretation and acceptance of faith. WHAT IS THE RELIGION OF VICE LORDS Lordism is the religion yet he is not rel,igious fanatic. The Quran and aU the religious books teU man to take of the bounties of the earth. The righteous believer interpret this as a sign that man should always strive to improve his life condition and strive to bal,ance himseff; spiritually, physical,/,y, mental,ly and materially. The righteous believer seeks to promote himself in the sight of God, but he also has concerns and needs in this worl,d. ABOUT THE RELIGION A Lord is a seeker of truth, as Lordism encompasses every facet of l,ife. We acknowledge the existence of God in every people and acknowledge every peoples right to communicate with him. Lordism is a complete way of life, it is a life of invol,vement with both God and State. It is the belief in the one true God and associates no partners with him. THE RELIGIOUS BOOK OF RIGHTEOUS BELIEVERS A Lord will study any rel,igious book and use them selectively as reference points and guidance if they will help to cont'Hbute to his devel,opment, but always in the frame of mind that man and not God is the author of such books. He believes in the presence of God and believes that \"no book\" have been able to capture that presence fully or truthfully. To him, everything in print deals with the relative truth and not the absolute. Absolutes are things the mind of God knows them, while relative truths are things as the highest reasoning of man understands them to be. Of all the rel,igious books, Lords tend to favor the Quran. WHY DOES A LORD LEAN TOWARDS THE QURAN We believe that there is knowledge and truth to be gained even'from the bibl,e, but only after a long tedious process of shifting through its maze. On the other hand, regardless of the fixation of the relative truth that we automatically apply, we still find the Quran to be the best book for our people, as the Quran corresponds more with our way of thinking and is very supportive of our way of life. Still we are Lords and not Muslims, there exist that de~ree and that difference. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LORD AND MUSLIM What is the difference between a Lord and a Musl,im since both acknowledge the Quran? The difference is in our guidelines, name, application and interpretation of faith. BELIEF OF A LORD (1) Belief in the one God who's proper name is \"Al,lah.\" (2) Prayer. (3) The belief that man is the highest temple of \"Allah\" and vice ruler of all made manifest in the physical realm of creation. (4) The bel,ief that all religious books only deal from the relative and not the absolute. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRAYER ] A Lord does not pray in the conventional styl,e of a Muslim. A Lord making prayer brinss his forefingers and thumbs to~ether and shape the pyramid over his head in a symbolic gesture and says: \"Oh Allah, I seek shelter from the forces of evil and the schemes and threatening plans of my enemies.\" Then brings his hands down in a palms up position to make prayer. GREETINGS It would not subtract any degree from you if one would greet a Muslim as he would greet you, but greet our brothers under the master sing with the greetings of \"Lah Via Va Va I[lilaha Ha(a[ul,\" with our palms up. He should return the greetings, \"Via Va Va Lah Ha[alu[ I[[i[aha.\" @ 12. 13. 14. WHAT'S THE MEANING BEHIND THE GREETINGS Lah - (Love) Via - (Vice) Va Va - (Lord) ILLiLaha - (My Sword) HaLaLuL- (My Shield) WHAT IS THE MASTER SIGN Palms up and all other greetings or emblems of Vice Lord. The meaning of Vice Lord, the righteous representation of Vice Lord (These are the master signs of Vice Lord). WHY THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT Because the Vice Lord Nation is symbolic to the family, it represents the highest principles of a real BLood-Line family Love, Truth, Justice, Harmony, Peace, Freedom, and Understanding. As in every family, the Lord Father and Queen (mother) upon producing Life have to bestow a name of their favor upon that life, for every Life they produce they honor that Life with a first name for distinguishing purposes and the child automatically inherits the last name which will affirm, its identity. Such is the composition of the various branches or fractions that make up the Vice Lord Nation. They have been granted autonomy and have formed the various schools of thought according to their father; Likewise, our fathers brother who shares the same family name, no matter what his or his children's first name as Long as they adhere to and acknowledge the dictates of the parents and accept the family name, the family will embrace that child. One must remember the root of its existence is the family. The teachings as administered by Chief AL-Ugdah from the unknown school of thought. WHAT ARE THE MASTER TEACHINGS The teaching of Lordism, the teachin 8 of man as a Vice Ruler second only to \"ALLah\" in his relationship with the World. They are the teachings that places man in charge of his selves and the World he Lives in. ON THE SELVES OF MAN (MIND) Truth and Falsehood are two absolutes, personified they represent the developed man (mind), which signifies the virtuous and the non-virtuous states of man (mind) and on the higher self in existence with the lower self, the self that controls will depend on the feed of man (mind). The entire composition of the human being rotates from the axis of these~two absolutes, the selves of man (mind) are inextricable, man can only subdue his lower self not separate himself from it entirety. Distraction or temptation can open the valve and allow the Lower self to seep through the cracks. The Lord Man, Lord Father, the Vice Lord, every action, every reflection and every deed springs from the balcony of the Mind (his virtuous self) or the basement of it (his non-virtuous self). ALL the selves of man (mind) are tied to there absolutes. This fixation is universal even the three dimensions of Vice Lord spin from these fundamental truths. SYMBOLS AND THEIR MEANINGS CIRCLE The Circle means 360 \u00b0 of knowledge and what was, will always be, that BLack people once \"ruled\" the world, and will once again \"RULE.\" FI RE The Circle is surrounded by Fire. The Fire means and represents our Nation's true knowledge of themselves as being suppressed. The FLames prevent our reaching true 360 \u00b0 of knowledge because of the heat (White Structure). DARKNESSInside the Circle is Darkness or \"Jet BLack,\" and this represents that universally BLack People are a Majority People, not a minority. MOONS STAR Inside the Darkness are two Crescent Moons, they represent the splitting of one Nation into two, one in East (Asia, Egypt, Afrika, ...) and the other in the West, this is \"US.\" ALso in this Darkness is a Golden StaGthis-i# the Eye of ALLah keeping watch over hTs people, a just/justice seeking people. Representing: LOVE, TRUTH, PEACE, FREEDOM and JUSTICE. PYRAMID The Darkness also engulfs the Pyramid Triangle, which is our strength, it is the phenomenon that puzzles the white world today. There is still no knowledge of Pyramid building, even with all the technology of the white man's world. Society can't even begin to build or understand how to build the Pyramid, yet the Pyramid was built by BLack People. We, ALmighty Lords are sheltered by this Pyramid of strength, until we are able to cleanse our minds; there are three aspects to the formation of the mighty puzzling Pyramids, they are: physical, mental and spiritual knowledge. We must decide now, how we want to Live. Are we going to Let our physical cravings take control of our minds? Or are we going to control our bodies, as it is supposed to be? \"MIND OVER MATTER.\" SUN Inside the Pyramid is the Sun, this represents the rising of Truth in our Nation, Gnce our minds have again gained control over our physical bodies. We will think as men, and be able to understand and respect one another's Life position, 'Then We Can Move As Men (ONE:)\" in a righteous direction. We, Like all BLack People Living within the shelter of the Pyramid, under the watchful Eye of Allah, we are guided down the proper path. HAT The Hat represents the sheltering of our heads, until we can get them together. It also represents the fact that we are Conservative in our thinking. GLOVES The GLoves represents \"Purity,\" that we will keep our hands clean of any act that causes division among our people. This is aLso the reason for representing as we do now (paLms out/upward), we show each other that CANE GLASS our hands are cLean, I MEAN YOU NO WRONG! (A Vice Lord wiLL never give the Patms Up Sign while wearing a GLove(s). ) The Cane is our staff of strength, as we need the Cane to help waiL, when we are old. The Cane represents the need for \"US\" to support one another in these trying times. The GLass represents the celebration of the birth of this ALmighty Vice Lord Nation. .I I 5 V L ~x~l~ -. ~J ~. \" ; ~ \"i ......... \" \u00b0 ............ !

Biackstone and his gang would meet on the corner of Black, stone and 65th. Fort lived on a street named In 1969, Fort controlled approximately 6000 gang members and his gang was recognized as being the most powerful gang at that time. Fort controt|ed the entire Woodlawn area and began calling himself the \"Black Prince.\" Fort then changed the name of his gang, from \"Black, stone Rangers,\" to \"Black P Stone Nation.\" Fort controlled this gang with the help of 21 othe.rgang members that were called the \"Main 21 .\" At meetings, held at the First Presbyterian Church, Fort and the \"Main 21\" would address gang membership in excess of a thousand members. Reports were given on guns stockpiled, disciples (rivals) beat up or shot down, how many TVs-cars-stoves- refrigerators were stolen etc.. Fort would stress to his membershipthe importance of extortion, terror and not letting anyone stand in the way of the Nation at these meetings. In the [ate 60's, Fort received $980,000 dollars from the federal government in the form of \"Anti-Poverty Funds.\" In 1969, Fort was invited to the White House for President Richard Nixon's inaugural ball. Fort did not attend the inaugural ball, but did send a member from the \"Main 21 .\" In 1972, Fort was sentence to five years in federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas for defrauding the federal government of $980,000 from the federal job-training program. He was released from prison on March 12, 1976 and paroled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Fort tried to join the \"Black Muslims\" and the \"Moorish Science Temple of America\" upon his release from prison. Fort was refused membership by both. The term \"El Rukn\" then began to appear. On Apn..[ 14, 1978, the El Pyramid Maintenance and Management Corporation was formed. This corporation purchase a building at 3947 S. Drexel for ten thousand do[t.ars in stacked bills. This building was then named \"El Rukn Grand Major Temple of America\" and El Rukn symbols and colors were displayed on the building. Fort began calling himself \"Chief Malik\" and conducted meetings at this new building. Meetings were conducted along Islamic lines, but the content remained similar to that of the old B[ackstone meetings. The organizational chart of the El Rukn Tribe includes 21 Emirs and also remains similar to the Main 21 (generals) of the Black P Stone Nation. El Rukn Tribe of Moorish Science Temple of America believe th~ God is Allah and Mohammed his prophet, that Noble Drew All was \"Holy man', but not the last prophet. The \"Glorious Koran together with the \"Holy Koran\" of the \"'Moorish Science Temple of America\" and the writings of Jeff Fort form the beliefs of the El Rukns. Hold Services on Friday and on Sunday. Sunday services are for women and children for instruction purposes. El Rukns wear a Kufi (red~black/green) to identify their religion and on Friday wear a fez (tapered red hat with a black tassel) to display Moorish identity.

ORIGIN Moorish Science Temple of America was founded in 1913 by Timothy Drew who was born in 1886, in the state of North Carolina. Drew influence by some forms of oriental philosophy that racially attacked Catholicism, began research and he eventually wrote the \"Holy Koran.\" The \"HoLy Koran\" for the Moorish Holy Temple of Science is not and should not be confused with the orthodox \"Mohammedan Koran,\" they are two different books. ALthough Drew had little education, sincerity of purpose and determination to lead his people from difficulties of racial prejudice and discrimination, brought him followers. Drew was obsessed in his thinking that upon becoming in the faith of Moorish Science, one must first claim their true nationality (Morocco). Asiatic\" (any person not of pale hue, non-Caucasian) had to refuse being called Black, Colored, Negro, Afro-American, etc. and henceforth call themselves \"Asiatic\" or more specifically, \"Moors\" or \"Moorish Americans\". \"Noble Drew All,\" (Timothy Drew) declared members as \"Moslem\" (people of dark hue) under the Divine Laws of the \"Holy Koran\" of Mecca, Love Truth Peace Freedom and Justice. He instructed members to honor all divine prophets, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and Confucius. Members were taught to believe that a sign, a \"star within a crescent moon,\" had been seen in the heavens, and that this betokened the arrival of the day of the \"Asiatic,\" and the destruction of the Europeans (whites). Membership began wearing \"fezzes\" (tapered felt cap; red with black tassel) and became openly conspicuous while walking the streets. TempLes were established as membership increased in Newark, New Jersey (first), Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, and numerous cities in the South. As membership increased, others were appointed by Noble Drew ALl to help extending his work. These newly appointed leaders soon began exploiting the membership and while growing rich, made attempts to displace Noble Drew All. EventuaLly one of the leaders was killed and although Noble Drew All was out of Chicago at the time of the slaying, he was arrested by the police to await trial for the slaying. Released on bond, Noble Drew All died under mysterious circumstances and the trial was never held. Since his death this group has split into many sects. Some follow the spirit of Noble Drew All, while others follow the reincarnation of Noble Drew All with their leader claimino to be the former prophet returned to earth in another body. The Leader of each branch temple is known as \"Grand Sheik\" or \"Governor.\" Organization structuring is lacking due to secrecy of group, but there are elders and stewards. Members are called \"brothers and sisters.\" Moorish-Americans take one of the tribal names of his nationality and sign that tr-iba[ name behind his Slave name. This is done because, the so-called Black people of America are in fact the descendants of the ancient Moabites who were of the Canaanite people and the founders of Civilization. The Moabites were Moslems and the founders of the Holy City of Mecca. Ti~e \"HOLY KORAN\" is sacred and SECRET; No non-believer may see the \"HOLY KORAN\" and for that reason little is known. The first page does contain a picture of Noble Drew ALl. He is pictured as being tall and slender. He is dressed in dark trousers, dark shoes, a white robe and sash, collar and necktie, and fez. His right hand is stretched across his breast. The introductory page speaks of Noble Drew All as being ordained by Allah and as his prophet, Noble Drew ALl is to divulge His secrets to the dark folk of America. The concluding chapters, which are numbered 45-48 teach of the divine origin of Asiatic nations with Egypt as the capital empire of the domination of Africa. In these last chapters many of the principals of the cult are expounded. PRINCIPALS 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Charter of Moorish Science Temple came from the great capital empire of Egypt.

On this same day, the Pope of Rome proclaimed that day to be forever a day of thanksgiving for all European Christians. Why? because the so called blacks of Granada (Moors) who were originally from what was referred to as Africa, Spain, and Arabia surrendered the city of Granada, the Last stronghold of the Moors in Spain, and the walls of the Moorish Empire came tumbling down. These Sad(an Moors (Sada meaning black) were driven into Morocco and further down into west Africa (their former kingdoms in Morocco and other parts of north Africa were now occupied by the so called Arabs who betrayed them) and were later betrayed, captured, and sold into America as Slaves. Hunting down the stem, deep olive Kharajite Moor from Baghdad, Turkey and siaying him was an act highly regarded by the Christian European forces who despised these Moors, mockingly called -I-urkies\", and the European looked up on these Turkish Moors as being wild and heathen people and regarded them as their natural enemies. (Turkey is the home [and of our people, who were called the Hittities.) So what you actually celebrate on your so called THANKSGIVING DAY, is the Proclamation of the Pope of Rome who later in league with Queen Isabella sent Cardinal Simenos to Spain to murder any Moor that resisted the Religion of Christianity. History records that after the fall of the Moorish Empire in Spain on November 25, 1491, you Moorish fore- fathers began to be forced and coerced into the religious habits of Christianity and as they reluctantly adopted that religion, they began to be known as Moriscos, Negroes, Blackamoors, Co[oreds, InfideLs, and final.[y Slaves. They were finally ordered to abandon their native dress, and to wear the hats and breeches of the European Christian, and to adopt the dirt of their European Ch,Hstian conquerors by giving up bathing. The Christian Church at that time barred bathing as sinful, as during the act of bathing, the naked body was revealed, and it was believed by the church that demons and devils lurked whenever the unclothed body was revealed. The Moors were ordered to renounce their Asiatic languages, their ancient customs, ceremonies, and to adopt the holy days and celebrations of the Roman Catholic Church. The Moors were forced to adopt European Chnstian names, and to behave as European. The Christian Emperor, Charles V sanctioned this monstrous decree in 1526. When the Christian Caucasoids of America treated the Moors ~ enslaved in America in the monstrous way that we all are so familiar with, it wasn't a mere haphazard happening in human nature. The American Caucasoid Christian was foUowing the above mentioned Christian decree. We must not be duped into the believing that it was the poor Caucasoid trash who instituted slavery, nor the poor Caucasoid trash perpetuate slavery. It was those Caucasoids who were educated in the ancient mysteries of the Moorish people. Their aim was to obscure the Moorish people from their ancient science, so they could steal it, claim it as their own, and rule by it. \"-7 J 16 LATRN KINGS ORIGIN CHICAGO - Nation was founded in 1964 by Yahve. OriginaLly called \"Crains\" and [ater changing the name to Latin T Birds. Eventually, changed name again, -Yahve\" caLLing them \"Kings.\" Later the word \"Latin\" was added, forming what we know today as being the \"Latin Kings.\" MILWAUKEE - In 1976 two families of Spanish Cobras moved from Chicago to MiLwaukee following the murder of one of the family members who was the Leader of the Spanish Cobras in Chicago. ShortLy after they moved to MiLwaukee, they established the Spanish Cobras in MiLwaukee. After dominating a section of the south side, other groups emerged, including the Latin Kings. (Two Local youths formed the Latin Kings in opposition to the Spanish Cobras.)

I is this egotistical force for recognition which Leads to rivaLry and senseless disputes which often cost the high price of human Life. The life of our People, the oppressed Third WorLd People. With the intentions of changing this social and oppressive phenomena the King Manifesto is written; to serve as a guide and enlighten our deplorable conditions under the existing order of things. With this thought in mind we proceed to create the New King, the Moral. King, the King of Others, the (over of men and the Turning Wheel of Change. Devoting your life to the principles of Kingism implies a Life of service to your fellow man. We can be of service in no other way. If you turn your back on your Brother simply because of a (abel you are turning your back on the ALmighty King Nation. j One who does not know the Almighty Latin King Nation and its Laws is Like a plant growing in the shade. Although it knows not the Sun, it is nevertheless absolutely dependent upon it. The Nation is in your hands. If you turn your back on the Nation you are denying yourself the sole purpose of your existence; the right to be free! NATION MEN Who is a Nation man and who is not? The difference Lies in what they do, how they carry themselves and how they talk. But in order for one to really understand the contrast one must know and understand the principles of the King Manifesto and Modern Kingism. One of the dearest contrast exampLes is when the so-caLled Nation Man claims to be a Latin King, a member of the Almighty Latin Kin~ Nation, and by the same token says, q am a LittLe; A Coulter King; A Pee Wee; I'm from such and such a branch or chapter, etc.\" He might be a Latin King, that is true, but he definitely is not a Nation Man. This clearly testifies that his so-ca(led Nation Man is really a demagogue, a preacher of a false philosophy, an agent of confusion and disunity. His mind is broad only to the scope of where his particular \"dick\" is concerned. Outside of that dick mentality his mind meets with the brick-wall of prejudice and individualism. Nation Men on the other hand are devoted followers and believers of unity, supporters of the harmonious whole. For Nation Men there are not horizons between dicks and branches for they identify only with the Nation, not with a particular dick, branch or section - natural allies together in one nucleus, on Nation, the Almighty Latin King Nation. ALMIGHTY LATIN KING NATION The Almighty Latin King Nation is a religion which gives us faith in ourselves, national self-respect, power to educate the poor and relieve the misery around us. It is the Brotherhood of man, blending Like the waves of one ocean, shining as the Sun, one soul in many bodies bearing fruit of the same tree. It creates in us a thirst, like the heat of earth on fire, a thirst for knowledge, wisdom, strength, unity and freedom. It is the Sun glowing the essence of our being, the brightness in our eyes that cast reflections of its rays spitting fire in all directions. It is the unshakable spirit and the nobleness of our hearts, the limitless power of the mind, the unrelentless will to be free. It is the pride, ambition, Love, sacrifice, honor, obedience and righteousness, all our powers and all our desires thrown into the mission of human service and united into one Single Gold Sun. If you want to find Yahve serve the Almighty Latin King Nation. Put on the Gold Sun - Black and Gold colors, place your right fist upon your heart and pledge devotion to the ALmighty Latin King Nation, to Yahve and all oppressed people.

We ask you Almighty King to bless our departed Brothers and sisters, members of our beloved and mighty Nation, who on this very day rest in the bosom of your sanctuary. May they rest in your care and may they have found the peace and ..... .\"reedom they sought. In days of confusion and oppression. May the blessings of the ancients and the wisdom of the ages ~uide us and keep our Nation strong as we battle the forces that seek to deny us. We, the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation, are entrusted with a divine mission, one that transcends personal gains and recognition. As Kings and Queens we pledge ourselves ever faithful to that mission. Make us all aware that others took to us for guidance and let us always prove ourselves worthy of providing it. For, though we are of different Nationalities, we all share the same cultures of our ancient ancestors whose every word is law throughout the world. It is our destiny to lead rather than to be led. We, the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation, have the blood of royalty in our veins. We are the guiding light of our, People. Place wisdom in our minds, Love in our hearts, and fortitude to withstand the trials of time. Guide and protect our Coronas so that they may lead us to our ultimate goal - the awakening of our People to their oppressed state that they may lift our heritage to its rightful place among the thrones of Kings and Queens. Let the manifestation of our sacrificed brothers and sisters be the path to thee, and let it be as it was in the beginning; strong King and Queen wisdom - peace in Black and Gold. THREE STAGES OF KINGISM Kingism is the doctrine of the Almighty Latin King Nation. There are three stages or cycles of Nation life that constituted Kingism. They are: PRIMITIVE, CONSERVATIVE, and NEW KING stages. In order for one to grasp a good understanding of each stage and its development, one must understand and consider the social factors surrounding each stage. O 22 PRIMITIVE STAGE is the stage in Life where the King Warrior acts on impulse, executing his actions without giving them the serious thoughts that they demand. A stage of immaturity where the King Warrior's time is spent \"gang-banging\", getting high and being recognized as big and bad. This can also be classified as the wasteful stage to a certain extent; to the extent that what is being done is being done unconsciously. Yet it is not wasteful, in the sense that the environment conditions this type of behavior in order for one to survive the hardships of ghetto life - that undesirable level at the lowest plane of social existence. It is wasteful in that energy is being misused. There are no objectives for one's actions except for the factual phenomena that the entire affair is centered around recognition, label recognition and personal recognition. This egotistical tendency often leads to a blind alley. Regardless of how senseless one's actions may seem at this level, this is the original stage of Kingism and from the roots of the Primitive Stage emerges the second stage, it is at this [eve[ where one either breaks or becomes strong. True lovers of the Nation develop at this stage. CONSERVATIVE STAGE (also known as the Mummy Stage) in the stage of so-called maturity. At this level the King Warrior becomes tired of the Primitive Stage. He no longer wishes to participate in the senseless routine of gang fighting, hanging on the corner or being recognized as big and bad. Most often at this [eve[ the King Warrior gets married and retires, alienating himself from the boys and the Nation, concentrating his energies and devotion to his Queen, his children and his responsibilities to them; ignoring the fact that he has unconsciously been neglecting his main responsibility to them and himself i.e., to make himself and his loved ones free! It is inappropriate to call this stage the Maturity Stage due to the fact that the King Warrior at this time does not really become mature in the true sense of maturity. Instead he becomes mummified or reaches a level of mummified maturity. He, in his conservative role, lives with no future, accepting life as it has been taught to him by the existing system that exploits all People of color:dehumanizes them and maintains them under the economic and social yoke of slavery. True members of the Nation do not quit at this level, they do not cease to identify themselves with the Kings, instead they alienate themselves from them. They do not cease to be who they are, they conserve what they are; they become conservative. There are more Kings at this [eve[ than at any other level. And, although this stage has all the characteristics of a regressive stage, it is really the stepping stone into the third stage of Kingism - the New King Stage. NEW KING STAGE is the stage of awareness and decision. The Primitive and Conservative stages are a compliment to the third. They go hand-in-hand with this stage of maturity, it does not keep the King Warrior in the limbo state of being i.e., the mummy Like stage. At this level there is a stage of awareness, an awareness of one's self as a subject of decision. Under the New King Stage the world takes a completely new form. One no longer continues to visualize the street comer as his turf or being tough as a man of survival as in the Primitive stage nor does he remain in the mummy stage. Instead he learns to appreciate the values of organizational work, the values of life and Brotherhood. One no longer views the rival warrior as the cause of one's ills, instead his vision broadens to the extent of recognizing himself as a subject of decision. He learns that his ills lie at the roots of a system completely alien to his train of thought and his natural development due to the components of dehumanization that exists therein. This stage is what determines righteousness, for it is at this stage where awareness leads to the point of decision, that point where one must decide one's future. This is where he either becomes an accomplice to the anti-King system or a 1 subject of decision - A New King! The New King recognizes that the time for revolution is at hand. Yes, revolution - a revolution of the mind! The revolution of knowledge! A revolution that will bring freedom to the enslaved, to all Third World People as we together sing and praise with joy what time it is - it's Nation time! Time for all oppressed People of the world to unite. The young warriors and future leaders look at the New king with the hope of someday being free. We shall not destroy the faith they have in us, for in doing so we destroy ourselves. 1 he New King IS the end product of complete awareness, perceiving three hundred-sixty degrees of enllghtment. He strives for world unity. For him there are no horizons between races, sexes and senseless [abels. For him everything has meaning, human life is placed above materialistic values. He throws himself completely into battlefield ready to sacrifice his life for the one he loves, for the sake of humanization. The New King is endowed with the supreme natural powers that surpass the human scope of comprehension. These highly complex anergic entities separate him from the abstract world and all those who surrender themselves to vanity and idleness and place materialistic values above and beyond human principle. The New King sees himself as a subject of decision, a Sun that must glow forever to enlighten those not so fortunate as he. He feels that rays of the Sun glowing in the essence of his being, giving him life, energy and strength - the strength of his unshakable spirit and the nobleness of his heart. The hypnotizing profundity of his gaze reflects the limitless power of his mind and the unshakable will to be FREE. The New King is the turning wheel of change, he recognizes what time it is - It's Nation time! He sees the rulers of our present system Lavishing their treasures freely on the means of destruction, then towards that which would promote the happiness of mankind. These strifes and this discord must cease and all oppressed People unite as one Nation, as one kindred, as one family. The New King is aware of the fact that in the Almighty Latin King Nation all are servants, Brothers and Sisters - natural allies together in one nucleus. As soon as one feels a little better than the other, a tittle superior to the rest, he is in a dangerous position and unless he casts away the seed of such evil thought, he is not an instrument for the service of the Nation. Just as calamity id due for disobedience, so deliverance from calamity can be obtained by obedience. Turning from the Nation brings inevitable disaster and turning to the Nation brings blessings. In order to establish the Kingdom of freedom in the world, it must first be established in the hearts of men. The King that Lives the Life according to the teachings of this Nation is the True King. A King who loves his Nation, his People and freedom; one who works for universai peace, universal Brotherhood. A man may call himself a King just as an ugly man may call himself handsome, yet if he does not live the life of a True King, he is not a King, and a ugly man deceives no one. He who would be a New King needs to be a fearless seeker and Lover of freedom. If his heart is pure and his mind is free from prejudice he shah not fail to recognize freedom from slavery. The call of the New King to mankind is that men should open their eyes and use their reason, not suppress it. It is seeing and free thinking, not servile credulity that will enable the True King to penetrate the clouds of prejudice, to shake the fetters of blind imitation and attain from the realization of truth a new revelation. The New King will not only believe in the teachings of his Nation but will find in them the guide and inspiration for his life and joyfully impart to others the knowledge that is the well - spring of his own being. Only then will he receive the full measure of poser of the Almighty Latin King Nation. \" When a man becomes a New King the will of the Nation becomes his will, for to be at variance within the Nation is one thing that cannot endure. The Almighty Latin King Nation requires whole-hearted and complete devotion. How can divine King Love be demonstrated to an unbelieving world its capacity to endure to the utmost blows of calamity and the treachery of seeming friends; to rise above all this undismayed and unembittered, still to forgive, bless and unite? The light of King Love irradiates his foggiest days, transmutes his suffering into hope and martyrdom itself into an aesthetical bliss. The New King Longs to see believers of freedom shouldering the responsibilities of the cause. Now is the time to proclaim the Kingdom that is rightfully ours. Now is the time for union and concord. Now is the day of unity because it's Nation time! The New King recognizes that the day of resurrection is here. A time for the appearance of a new manifestation of truth. The rising of the dead means the spiritual awakening of those who have been sleeping in the graveyard of ignorance. The day of the oppressor must now be judged by the oppressor. FEARLESSNESS To the ALmighty Latin King Nation, fearlessness implies absence of all kinds of fears. It is the freedom from such as hunger, humiliation, wrath and criticism of others. It is also the freedom from the fear of resistance, the freedom from the fear of loss of courage and freedom from the fear of physical death. It is a necessity for a true Latin King because cowards can never be moral. Fearlessness is indispensable for the growth of other noble qualities. f How can one seek liberation, truth, or cherish love without fearlessness? Moral Bravery is, for the Nation, the highest heroism and it consist in the readiness to sacrifice patiently and fearlessly, everything, including life for the good of other members or the Tribe of Righteousness out of love for them. 0 CROWN The CROWN is the NATIONAL EMBLEM of the Almighty Latin King Nation. It displays our royalty among men; our sovereignty and our Kingdom among Nations. The CROWN is a symbol that is recognized all over the world and although there are many different types, the two that the ALmighty Latin King Nation identify with the most are the IMPERIAL and CORONET. The IMPERIAL is the one most generally used to represent our beloved Nation because of its very meaning and magnificence. Each of the CORNET'S five points has a special meaning. They represent LOVE, HONOR, OBEDIENCE, SACRIFICE and RIGHTEOUSNESS. The Crown enthrones our idealism, or belief and attitudes towards a better way of Life in the universe. COLORS BLACK represents the solid dominate color of the universe, the brave and the bold, the darkness of the immense night. It represents People of one idea, one body, mind and soul, the Alpha and the Omega. GOLD represents the fabulous brilliant Sun at its highest peak; the splendor glow of hope in oppressed People, the brilliance of the mind and the solid unity in strength, Love and sacrifice. Two colors of natural creations existing since the beginning of time and enduring forever. 24 SALUTE A fist upon our hearts...it means, \"I DIE FOR YOU\". For you are flesh of my flesh, bl.ood of my bl.ood, son of my mother who is the Universal Nature and follower of Yahve who is the Almighty King of Kings; it also means LOVE - STRENGTH - SACRIFICE. Behold Latin King - Glory to the Queens and Power to the Kings. Almighty Latin King Love, Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, Always and Forever! NATION FLAG The Flag sha[I, consist of either two stripes - one BLACK and one GOLD - running horizontally with a circle in the upper left corner of the top color with a Crown in the center of the circle or the Flag may consist of three tripes running vertically with a circ[e in the center stripe and a Crown in the circle. The Flag shali never touch the fl.oor or be placed where dishonor may fall upon it. BROWN FORCE The Latino can draw additional, strength from another force too if he has the wil.l, and the faith. Anonymous mil.[ions of BROWN MEN and WOMEN have given their life in the fight for liberation. They have fought against colonialism, hunger and ignorance and for the human dignity of our PEOPLE. They have drawn from one another, through unity, a force of fortitude - BROWN FORCE - that which provides the splendor glow of hope in oppressed peopl.e. The seed they cast into the founding of a Nation - the Almighty Latin King Nation - has withstood the trials of time. Drawing upon the endurance and fortitude of BROWN FORCE, we continue our quest to unify and insure free political and culture expression among the Third World People and among the commonwealth of individuals. We are the People's l.iberating force - BROWN FORCE - the foundation of the Nation. ALMIGHTY EYE ' When a King Warrior accepts Kingism as described in the King Manifesto, his life takes a complete turn. For him everything changes. His vision is no longer limited to narrow horizons, instead he is gifted with the power of the Almighty Eye - a Sun that glows to enlighten, through the sense of sight, the New King and the Nation. The eyes of the Nation are everywhere there is a Nation man, a True King. His perceptions, viewed in the concept of universal human progress, is the reflections of his soul., his ideology, his quest for freedom and his desire for unity among his People. His observations are free and independent; his thoughts are not cl.ouded by any form of prejudice and his actions are based on common sense and knowledge. Seeing, perceiving and observation by all Kings is the network of the Nation - the eyes of the Almighty Latin King Nation are everywhere. KING AM I Whether in front or profile I stand On that finished form let glory bestow Black its midnight shadow, Gold its morning star In precision clear, a vision ever so bright That over the rest the domineering light Spreads the extensive vigor of its rays Any yields to me the power they praise That majesty, that grace, rarely given To remove the restraints with which they confine To pass before the turning wheel of change With supreme perfection my aim Love, truth and knowledge my claim. Below the thunderous lofty arch light The whole in [ovel.iest harmony unites For a True King the brightest glories soar The King of Kings applauds him and the worl.d adores Let then each be firm allied And let no one sperate or divide United in strict decorum, time and place An emulous love and genuine faith Be Grace, Be Majesty thy constant strive That majesty, that grace - King Am I. CODE OF KINGISM Every Member of the Nation shall honor, respect and protect with his life the lives and reputation of all members of the Almighty Latin King Nation.

Instead, here he was on the Fourth of Juty weekend last year, zigzagging his Ford Taurus through Illinois and Indiana wirah two semiautomatic hand,rams by his side, pick- ing offthose targeted for extinction in Matt Hale's Racial Holy War. RAHOWA! Such music to the ears of a lifelong j.giner-quitter for whom only a bloody exit strategy now made any sense. Ben Smith had once been a Muslim, and later a left-winger. His circle of friends had once included blacks, Jews and Asians. Now he was spraying them with bullets. The only constant in his life had been a stewing propensity for violence half-assed and unchanneled, until Matt Hale furnished Ben Smith with commandments: De- stray and banish a//Jewish thought and influence from society. Remember that the inferior colored races are our deadly ene- mies. Decide in early youth that duringyour lifetime you will make at leas~ one major &s~ing contribution to the White Race. And so, in Chicago, Ben Smith made his one major lasting contribution by wounding six Orthodox Jews on their way home from services. Then, in Skokie, Illinois, he shot in the back and kilJed former Northwestern University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong while the 43-year-old black man was walking with two of his children. He fired on two Asians in Northbrook, injured a black man in SpringField and a black pastor in Decatur, wounded a Taiwanese American grad stu- dent in Urbana and finally idled by a church in Bloomington, FEBRUARY 2000 GQ 189 Indiana, where he took aim at a Korean doctoral student named Won-Joon Yoon and shot him fatally in the back. Only then, on the evening of Independence Day, did Benjamin Nathaniel Smith take leave of his miserable existence and turn the gun on himself. His martyrdom in the holy war was assured the following day when Matt Hale, whom Smith once termed =the greatest living man,\" assessed the carnage thus: \"As far as we're concerned, the loss is one white man.\". Such music. STANDING ON THE FRONT PORCH of his residence in East Peoria, Illinois, Matt Hale, 28, performs the first movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony on his vi- olin. He is somewhat rusty at first, not having practiced since the local orchestra ousted him for holding views it found ab- horrent. Before long, however, his fingers regain their agility. The intensity burns through Hale's Wally Cleaver--e.sque face. He flexes his jackal-like cheekbones, and his dark eyes bore into the sheet music. Now the melody surrenders, and the dul- cet fury of the notes holds sway over the neighborhood. And though no sugges- tion of bliss softens his austere face, what- ever heaven Matt Hale could hope for is right here in this world, colored by lawns and pines, cardi- nals and cicadas, and otherwise as white as a hospital. At the conclusion of the movement, Hale lets his bow go limp. The neighbors offer their applause. \"I fi~mared, what the heck,\" Hale calls out, waving. ~Nice day, might as well enter- .t~n_~e neighbors.,. What the heck. The venom seldom leaks into Hales earnest tenor when a member of the press is pres- ent-which is to say that the usual steady stream of racial epithets was in short supply on the Hale porch during the summer of 1999. On July 22, activists from across the state held an antiracism demonstration in East Peoria, culminating in a march down Randolph Street, where Matt Hale lives with his father. The protesters and the media found Hale sit- ting quietly on the porch swing, reading Ben Klassen's The White Man's Bible. The three signs stuck in his front yard brandished the sweetly quotable message I FORGIVE YOU WHITE LIBERALS FOR YOUR IGNORANCE--I STILL C_4A~. The march was an asticulation of central Illinois's horror over Ben Smith's shooting spree and the national attention it brought to the region. The World Church of the Creator had lost one white man, but as Smith had surely anticipated, his death was a net gain for Mart Hale. =As much as we wish Ben was still alive,\" he tells me in his forthright midwestern lilt, \"if it was his wish to get incredible publicity for the church and bring our message to millions and millions of people, he suc- ceeded.\" That message, Hale insists, is that his Racial Holy 190GQ FEBRUARY 2000 I7 IT IC S( ti la is =17 hi rk tC Sa th PLAYING IN PEORIA: Hale was talented enough as a violinist to play in a local orchestra, until he was booted out because of his extreme views.

He spread theword with bullets, and tl:= :-' to the bloodshed, Hale--for years a staple on the Monc~, Geraldo and Springer freak-show circuit----could now offer up his yuppie countenance to every major news organization in America. It was as if we had awakened to find a bron- tosattrus looming in our drivewa?: Matt Hale would not dis- aFee if you compared his ~ideolo~\" to that of AdolfHider. We know what that meant in Germany circa 1933. But what does it mean in America today? The Simon Wieser, ~ka!

The two are close, young Hale insists, though they sel- dom eat together anymore, as the son dines twice daily on raw fruits and vegetables, nuts and see~---- a \"salubrious living\" diet prescribed by the church's founder, Ben Klassen. Russ Hale confines himself to the back of the house, while Mart Hale operates out of a small, garishly red room on the second floor, where stacks of Ben Klassen's fourteen books, including Building a Whiter and Bmgbter World, On the Brink of a Bloody Radal War and Salubrious Liv- ing, and assorted other church propaganda share space with a computer, a fax machine, an Israeli flag that serves ..... as a doormat, a picture of Ben Klassen's gravestone in Otto, North Carolina, a few stuffed animals and a pair of nun-\" chucks.

Otherwise the ten-room house is unpeopled, musty and in dire need of a woman's touch. Dreams are stillborn here. The first three sons of Russ and Evelyn Hale never went to college and, admits the mother (who dropped out of school after the eighth grade), \"are willing to settle for less.\" Yet when Matthew Frederick Hale entered kindergarten and was told to write his name, \"I steadfastly refused m print it in small letters,\" he remembers. \"I always did it in capital letters. I thought my name de- served it.\" Years later, after fighting with his big brothers, Hale consoled himself by writing in his diary, \"I have plenty of time to prepare for my rise.\" From the start, Matt Hale's dreams were kept alive by in- fusions of Freudian longing and Niety.schean ressentiment. His parents divorced when he was 8, and though Evelyn Hale won custody, she elected to move out of state and foist the boys on Russ. \"I had to work all the hours I could,\" Russ Hale remembers, \"so Mart was more or less independent.\" Matt Hale remembers being \"bullied a lot by my brothers and kids in the neighborhood and school.\" He spent his years of solitude in the East Peoria li- brary; reading about the mighty and the vengeful, conquerors like Magellan and Cortes, war- riors like Patton--and, inev- itably, Hitler. In 1984, just b.efore his thirteenth birthday, Matt Hale procured a copy of Mein I~5~mpfi Therein did Mart Hale at last find something about himself to be proud of. THE THREE AMIGO.% Hale, cenre-r, with two of his acolytes, Michael Koch,/~ and James Burnett. Hale claims to have 3,000 active church members, but a recent mailing list showed only 207 addresses. The problem, Hale contends, is that the white race is apathetic about its fate and therefore has not rallied to his cause. Hale ad _!re iYlovi-~ '~ ~ :; - ~'f2 lmmex sely. \"The message it imparts is that if these nonwhites carl prevail over their trials and tribulations, then, go!!y, we can. He was white, with rich Germanic blood flowing through the family tree. Though in bleached-white East Peoria he had never been in the company of either Jews or blacks, his father, who does not think of himself as a racist (\"I have a lot of black friends at the nursing home I visit,\" he tells me), made clear to his sons that he opposed racial mixing, and he habitually changed the TV channel whenever TheJ~firsons came on. \"I always did~l!i want his approval on things,\" Hale recalls. Bu~ the boy went overboard. When he was 13 and artending a dance in a downtown Peoria pizza parlor, Hale witnessed, as he puts it in his \"short biography-\" posted on the World Church of the Creator Web site, \"a nigger in its late teens repeatedly kissing a young White FEBRUARY 2000 GQ 191 girl. The sight made him physically ill, and he decided then and there that his mission would be to ensure that one day such sights would never happen again.\" Hale formed the New Reich in the seventh grade to protest the reading of Anne Frank's Diary afa Young Girl. Thus began an academic life unvisited by a moment's peace. When the principal called his father about the swastikas on his books and locker, Russell Hale said to his son, \"You know, your [German] great-grandfather wouldn't like this.\" Replied the boy smartly, \"Great-Grandpa believed what he was told.\" When Matt visited his mother in Texas during the summer, Evelyn Hale recalls, \"I tried to talk him our of his views, and we ended up arguing and both of us in tears.\" At East Peoria Community High School~ \"which was maybe 10 percent nonwhite,\" Matt says, \"but for someone who's racially consdous, that seemed to be a lot\"- he wrote \"White Power\" on his book covers, taped a photo of H_itler inside his locker and sat in the library read- ing two books, The Racist Reader and The Hate Reader, over and over. Since that fateful evening at the pizza par- lor, he says, \"I knew I'd be known as a white activist. I always had the sense that I would make my mark.\" And so he endured the hazing of his peers, the way they made fun of his knee- ~~ high white socks in ,gym class, the way they called him Beethoven because he played the violin. They were his white brer.hsen, after all, and Matt Hale still had time to prepare for his disciple,\" Matt Hale says. Ben Klassen, the World Church of the Creator's founder, committed suicide in 1993, before he and his disciple could ever meet. \"I believe that Klassen will go down in history as the greatest white man who ever lived. Greater than Hitler. Because while Hitler certainly showed the Jews could be defeated in modern times, using a government overtly based on racist principles, Ben Klassen gave us the first religion of our race, and I think that will prove more important. I may not agree with him on every single point. For one, I'm an attorney, and he was very hostile to lawyers. For another, he wouldn't like to talk to the media, and obviously,\" he grins, \"I'm the opposite\" Obviously The media first discovered Hale when he was 18 and littering the Bradley University campus with racist flyers Student protests ensued, the administration consid- ered expulsion, and young Matt Hale gleefully wore the crown of thorns. Reporters found Hale to be telegenic and far more voluble than his glowering hooded predecessors in the white-power movement. Time and again, he was ar- ASSASSIN: Ben Smith was drawn to the church's crude racial notions, but he was no mere theoretician. Last July Fourth weekend, he,vent on a rampage in Illinois and Indiana, murdering two and wounding nine before finally killing himself. rested on trumped-up charges by Peoria-area authorities who found his views too reprehensible for public.airing. Time and again, Hale prevailed in court and reaped the harvest in the press, thus winning the admiration of white- supremacist groups across America. His courtroom adven- tures inspired him to enroll in Southern Illinois University School of Law. Bur in 1995, before his first semester, Hale ran for a seat on the East Peoria City Council. Blessed with high name recognition and an agenda no one could forget, Hale garnered 546 votes, which, unfortunately, placed him eighth among eight candidates. With barely a trace of irony, he explains his defeat to me: \"Our main constituency, they're not registered to vote. They've given up on the system.\" So it proved fortuitous that dour, 75-year- old Ben Klassen had scarfed down four bot- tles of sleeping pills in 1993 and left the World Church of the Creator in disarray. The church's resources had been pilfered by traitors, key mem- bers were imprisoned, factions had erupted, and no one had yet re- sponded to Klassen's final exhorta- tion: \"Now the younger generation must pick up the torch and fight the battle.\" Freshly chastened by political defeat, Matt Hale now contemplated the idea of leading a racist religion, a grandiose venture even by Hale's standards As Klas- serfs graceful prose had it, the white race was \"the finest and noblest cre- ation of Nature'~one, however, \"under attack by our mortal racial enemies: Jews, niggers and the mud ..I races.\" The only hope was to \"win th~ worldwide White Racial Holy War within this genera- tion,\" enabling \"the White Race to exclusively populate the world.\" And all this would be accomplished through legal, nonviolent means, \"just as Hitler did in Germany.\" Should the other races resist, wrote Klassen, \"then the White Race must meet fire with fire, and retribution and vengeance will be our answer. For every one of ours they kill we will exact ten times their number, starting with the rabbis. And so on. How could Matt Hale resist such a holy calling? And how could the church deny one so skilled in media- friendly hatemongering? On Hale's twenty-fifth birthday, July 27, 1996, on the Superior, Montana, ranch of church reverend Slim Deardorff, a dozen Guardians of the Faith awarded him a ten-year term as Pontifex Maximus. Then, as Hale remembers it, \"I gave a speech, pledging to bring Creativity into the hearts and minds of white people every- where and to continue Ben Klassen's legacy and to make sure that every white man, woman and child Would one day honor his name.\" 7 .2 i 7. ~a =4 \"Z \u00a2\u00a2 .~. ~:\" A, SC si h fi d el rI n r_l h F tt a aA rl Ci L L a] CA rl O: 'W 0 p, ft t\u00a2 f< h, tl O.

AS I PASS MY DAYS ON THE PORCH with Matt Hale, a growing sense of pity threatens to overtake me. He speaks compul- sively of Klassen's wisdom, but the old man is gone, having left behind only a scattered collection of half-wits and feions--and rules, the last of which was, in effect, Don't change any of the rules. Hale practices the salubrious-living diet, but few if any of the other members do. Many are booz- ers and potheads; some, I am told, are nonwhite. Klassen ad- monished his followers to speak only Latin, which of course no one does. (When I ask Hale if he has mastered the lan- g'uage, he testily replies, \"No, I simply have had marly other things to do.') An ex-member tells me that Hale is forever hectoring his comrades to pay their $35 annual dues. Did Hider face such indignities? Well predating Matt Hale's arrival, the World Church of the Creator was a notorious magnet for grifters, bullies and lunatics. Despite the enormous media coverage, and despite concerns expressed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and other antihate groups about the cyber-appeal of Hale's re- cruiting efforts, the church is still lit- tle more than a loser's way station. When I ask Hale what became of one of his earliest cohorts, he mutters, \"He wasn't in it for the long haul.\" Of an- other he says, \".He had some mental peculiarities.\" Hale's former attorney from the Bradley days, Jerry Serritella, tells me that during Hale's trials, \"his followers consisted of two mopes from high school with a combined IQ of seventy- five.\" Hale acknowledges that he finds it hard to turn down anyone who calls him up to say, \"I hate niggers; sign me up.\" One of them he kicked out for beating up other members. Another he expelled for burning a copy of The WhiteMan's Bible. There are, he admits, \"a lot of bad apples in our tree.\" An ele- gant understatement. Ben Klassen exhorted the church to one day initiate a \"culling out.of the mis- fits.\" Who would that leave? A visiting Martian--and on the porch I feel very much like one--might listen to Matt Hale's claims of white superiority, then g'aze at Hale's minions and die of laughter. Though Hale once wrote of the African-American race as \"an anarchical jungle,\" he is in no position to tail Hale's Hasm Primus (sec- ond-in-command) vacated his post fully a year ago. So did the head of the church's bodyguards, the White Berets, of which now only a couple in Florida are left. The church is said to boast forty or so chapters worldwide. Five of these op- erate out of prison cells. Several of the other chapters lack a THE FOU.NDER: Ben Klassen'established the World Church of the Creator and wrote fourteen books, hlduding Building a Whiter and Brighter World and On the Brink of a Bloody Rac/a/l~r, before finally killing himself. presiding \"minister,\" although the 149-question exam on the sacred Klassen texts is open book and can be taken more than once. Then there is the lack of a Lady Pondfex. Hale married a 17-year-old Creatrix named Terra on July 19, 1997. Less than three months later, he wrote to his brethren that \"SisteI Terra has returned to Michigan. She was not ready for the in- tense, busy, spartan and salubrious life I must lead as both Pontifex Maximus of our church as well as a student of the law.\" Hale won't volunteer anything on the subject, other than telling me with a proud grin, \"One could say I'm the most eligible racist leader in the world.\" (A recent girlfriend apparently disa~ees. She was granted an order of protection against him in January 1999, after Hale banged on her door screaming \"Bitch!\" and \"Mongrel!\" and left a phone message declaring her to be \"my enem~') I can see that the Pontifex Maximus is getting no help, though he has not been shy about asking for it. More than a year ago, Hale wrote pleadingly in The Struggle for church members \"to strongly consider moving to Illinois, central Illinois in particular .... Just as Adolf Hitler knew that before he could win Germany, he must first win his home turf, Munich and then Bavaria as a whole, before we can win the world, I fervently believe that we must win our capital, Illinois.\" When I ask Hale if as many as a dozen had relocated, he mumbles, \"About that.\" Later, he puts the number of Peoria-~ area Creativity members at about twenty-five (though one former member tells me that Hale's bi- weekly sermons attract a congrega- tion of four or five). Though Hale has told reporters that the church boasts 3,000 active members, a re- cent church worldwide mailing list featured 207 addresses. When I learn this, I realize the folly of my having at one point asked Matt Hale, \"Don't you feel like sometimes scream- ing, Tm surrounded by morons!'?\" For Matt Hale is not surrounded by anyone at aLl. He cannot \"win our capital, Illinois.\" He cannot even win the town of Pekin, nine miles away from East Peoria. With a richly racist history--former Klan stronghold, home until recently of a high school team called the Chinks and the site of a cross burning three years ago--ZPekin has been the apple of Matt Hale's eye since he first showed up in 1990 with his white-power signs. They jeered him out of town then, and during my stay, the Pekin police threaten to arrest church members for dumping copies of church propaganda on res- idential lawns. Even in the most fish-belly-pale towr central Illinois--\"the town blacks just don't go to,\" in words of one lifelong Peoria black community leader-- Mart Hale has no following of any kind. CONTINUED ON PAGE 194 FEBRUARY 2000 GQ193 MATT HALE CONTINUED FROM PAGE 193 =The problem, once again, is white peo- ple,\" he sighs as we talk of his efforts in Pekin. =We don't blame the nonwhite peo- ple for seeking their own interest. In fact, they're bound to, by nature's laws.\" But the white man is apathetic, he says, not to men- tion guJlible---and, yes, often very stupid. At the end of one long day, Hale surprises me by saying, \"The bottom line is, it's subjec- tive. And, indeed, we'd be just as fanatic to our cause if we d/dn~ believe our race was su- perior.\" At my prodding, he awards the title of Second Greatest Race to the Asians, ~particularly the Japanese.\" He expresses a grudging admiration for the Jews' ability to outlast the Romans and the Cartha~nians. from my other kids? He has ambition. He'S always worked hard to get his education, and he loved it when he worked for a law firm last year. And I was so happy he was getting on with his life.

It is his universe, and often a very lonely one. One afternoon I show up to the Hale house unannounced. Russ Hale is mowing the front lawn. He waves at me as I approach the porch. A few steps from the door, I see Matt Hale appear from behind the screen. He does not open The church disavows espo ibiBit violence eGm i{ ed by i% embe\u00a2So Though contemptuous of Martin Luther King Jr., he concedes, \"I respect what he did for his people.\" And the movie Gandhi re- ceives Hale's highest endorsement: \"I've thought about making that required viewing in the church. The message it imparts for us is that if these nonwhites can prevail over tri- ads and tribula6ons, then, by golly; we can.\" tese moments, as the logic of his love race seems to lose its grip, so does Matt Hale's hatred dwindle. He then be- comes, dare I say it, regular: another guy with a ton of student loans, no job and a slight acne problem. Prominent in his thoughts is his lawsuit against the state of Illinois, which recendy denied him a li- cense to practice law on the grounds of moral unfitness. The state supreme court's judg~erit against him has been decried as legally specious by everyone from Hale to black columnists to the ACLU. Ever the nimble self-promoter, Hale has taken the opportunity to court Jewish attorney Alan Dershowitz for a few news cycles and to ar- gue with Katie Couric on the 7bday show. But the exposure affords Hale little solace. -\"1 really love law, actually,\" he says. \"I've al- ways been a person who believed in rules and order. Plus, I wanted to be the only openly racist attorney in the country.\" Later he cites a perfect case for him: =that thing in Jasper, Texas.\" Though he will not come out and say so, I sense that lawyering is his exit strategy should the church go the way of the Car- thaginians. When I ask his mother if she be- lieves that a nice leg-al practice would have diverted her son from a life of hard-core racism, she replies breathlessly, =That was my hope. You know why Matt's different it. He is livid. =I did not tell you you could come over!\" he fairly bellows. \"I do nothave to speak to you whenever it's convenient for you! HI call you when I'm ready!\" His dark eyes are predatory. I wonder if he expects me to snap into position and reply, 7a, mein Fiihrer/\" Later that eveninD he invites me over and apologizes, saying, \"Sometimes I get or- nex T.\" But what had stuck with me was not Hale's an~,m'y words. Itwas the image of him behind the screen door: solita.D; wearing a T-shirt with the ridiculous World Church of the Creator logo, consisting of a halo above a crown above a large W, emblazoned across his skinny chest. He reminded me of nothing so much as a kid left at home by his parents, dressed up like Superma_9~momen- tarily discarding his puny world'for a shot at immortality. That is how I think of Matt Hale, until I think of Ben Smith. Throughout the years, the sociopathic musings of this or that philosopher fraud have provided aid, comfort and reason for being to the easily a~tated. Two years before Ben Klassen chugged his Kool-Aid, a church \"minister\" named George Loeb murdered a black man in Jacksonville, Florida. For this, Loeb and a fellow church member who had aided him in his tem- porary escape from justice were awarded medals of honor by Klassen. Since that time, several other instances of violence have been linked to World Church of the Creator members. In each case, the church has disavowed any responsibility. Its litera- ture is spiked with assurances that the Racial Holy War will be achieved through nonvio- lent means. Of all the religions on record, Mart Hale's is the only one known to con- rain legal disclaimers. When, on our final afternoon together, 1 ask how he envisions this bloodless coup, Hale says, with a straight face, =We will be- come the law and then determine our des- tiny. The Bill of Rights would apply only to white people.\" And that will just happen, without any resistance? \"If we have mass support,\" says Hale, \"I think a lot, if not all, of these thin~ are pos- sible. I don't think the Jews are going to want to stay in America if the average white person is a Creator. I think they'll be want- ing to leave this country, just as they did in Germany when Hider came to power.\" Without violence? Hale reflects. \"I guess the distinction,\" he finally replies, \"would be whether the vio- lence is part of a legal government or not. We ffedy admit that in the future there may be violence. However, if we are the law, then we're the law.\" And so you would chase all nonwhites out of the white lands, which are... \"Certainly all of Europe. And Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S. Those are what you'd call white lands, though ours is obviously corrupted and there's a lot of work to do.\" And they would just let it happen? An{.. that would be that? \"Well. Once we withdraw all our aid from the other races--all technolog); all trade, all influence of any kind we believe the other races will revert to a more primi- tive level. And because oftb_at, the violence will be lessened.\" IfHale believes in this nonsense, he is the only one. In the meantime, he promtdotc ~ as the church's sacred text Klassen's firs, book, Nature's ErernalReligion, wherein the language of violence is hardly subliminal: \"We not only want beAievers, but dedicated fighters .... We must fight fire with fire in rhe raci~ w~r that is upon us .... We want the White Race to exclusively populate the world .... The root of all evil is the Jev~:... Hate that which is evil.\" Mart Hale's mother insists to me, \"Mr. is a complex person, but I don't see hate \":~ him. What I see is what he truly believes, which is that we should protect the white race.\" When I ask her if she is aware thar the church's sacred text preaches \"hatred for alien races\" and giving blacks \"nothing but contempt,\" the air goes out of her. \"Is that what it says?\" Evelyn Hale murmurs.

But his organization has failed utterly to attract the wily subversives who could achieve white supremacy through purely legal means. As he says, \"Most of the really quality people have been robbed from the white racial struggle. They're the people who have the most to lose by standing up.\" Instead, Hale can re- cruit only those who have already lost and are looking for someone to blame. One of these was Matt Hale's older brother David, an aimless hothead who spent more than two years in an Illinois state prison for armed intimidation. Of late, David has distanced himself from the church. A few years ago, however, the sundry threats leveled against h;s brother gave David an excuse to dust offhis rifle and patrol the Hale yard like a Roman sentinel. One day in 1991, he accompanied his younger brother to a demonstration in Peo- ria. David packed his .32-caliber handgun in the mink, and that afternoon he pulled it on three black men who were drawn by Mart Hale's SRADLEY WHITE RACIST poster. Both Hales were arrested before any buffets were fired. But for a moment, Mart Hale's dubious cause gave a wayward white boy a chance to be somebody's sick idea of a hero. Ben Smith got the same chance and made the most of it. Months before the two met for the first time at a Bob Evans diner in Champaign, Illinois, in August 1998, the soft-faced, dull-eyed introvert from the Chicago suburb of Wilmette was writing to Matt Hale about the necessity of violence. For a time, the church was a pacifie~, with- out it and Hale, Smith once said, he would probably have ended up in jail \"He changed dramatically,\" says Hale. \"No more dru~, no more getting drunk, no more physical problems with women.\" Feverishly, like a loner suddenly ~ven a chance to prove him- self to the high school spirit club, he rolled up and passed out thousands of copies of The Struggle, sometimes for twenty-four hours at a stretch. \"Everything in Ben Smith's life really did revolve around Creariv- .:t-y,\" says Hale. While riding downhill on a ;oiler coaster with his girlfriend, Smith would holler, ~RAHOWA.r'He began to re- fer to himself as August, saying that Ben- jamin sounded too Jewish. For such zealotry, \"m January 1999 Matt Hale awarded his pro- tdg~ the honor of Creator of the Year. But, admits Hale, Smith did not linger ut over the Klassen texts: \"He was more of an .at activist.\" Hale knew Smith was prone to tsing force. Once, the Pontifex Maximus it c:.issuaded the Creator of the Year from le- thrusting himself into the middle of a do- mestic conflict between a Creator couple. Another time, however, he and Smith talked about taking target practice together, Hale says. A savage beast was stirring inside the protdgd, but the mentor did not make it his mission to soothe it. When Smith enroLled at Indiana University; he littered the Bloom- ingron campus with literature that de- meaned the intelligence of nonwhites while calling for the white race to dominate the planet. Local residents responded by break- ing Smith's car window and putting up a poster with his physical description and ad- dress all over the university, which, says Hale, \"bothered him a great deal.\" Hale says he advised Ben Smith to keep a cool head. Even if that is n'ue, could Smith have possi- bly taken the words at face value? On the Bloomington campus, Smith was at war. RAHOWA. I Hate had begotten hate, and there was no retreatifig. Turning the other cheek was for the loathsome Christian. Be- sides, for an \"activist\" like Ben Smith, it was just...not...possible. Four days before the Fourth of July week- end, Hale now says, Ben Smith phoned his mentor and told him he would be driving t6 the Chicago suburbs to distribute church propaganda. On Friday, July 2, Smith walked into the W'tlmette post office and mailed a certified letter to the church's East Peoria headquarters. It read: \"Although I have not been a member of the World Church of the Creator since April 1999 [a reference to Smith's not paying his annual membership dues, though he had person- ally financed $5,000 worth of church print- in~], due to my past public support ofr.b.at legal religious organization run by Mart Hale, I find it necessary to formerly [sic] break with the World Church of the Cre- ator because I am unable and unwilling to foUow a legal Revolution of Values.\" The letter was nothing more and nothing less than a legal instrument; Mart Hale could not have penned a finer waiver. Having pro- tected the cause from harm, Ben Smith was now eligible for martyrdom. And so the lone gunman went forth. Two days later, Hale saw Smith's face on television. He was ,a'anted for murder. After he recovered from the shock, Matt Hale's agile mind went to work. He'll either be captured or killed, Hale thought. If he lives, maybe I'll represent him in coum \"I'VE HEARD SO many people say, 'Well, what's in it for me in the church?' \"says I W I N E S from FRANCE CREATIVE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE @ SAY ~-\"/~ TO Wl NE S fFom FRANCE www.frenchwinesfood.com ~k%'v G MATT HAL\u00a3 Matt Hale as we dwindle down a final day on the porch where I have been treated to music and malice in vainglori- ious narrow slices.

And the weaker will perish.\" To which he offers an almost beatific shrug. For a moment, the struggle is over, the demons within are at rest, and it is just Matt Hale and his master, a little white and this Tony provides. \"People,\" he likes to say, \"always come to me when they're on a roll and they want to own even more of the world--or when they're at the nadir.\" Indeed, to nadir dwellers, it's not just the man's bare-naked English but his very name that comes as a fiery awaken- ing: \"Tony Robbins'--so plain, every- man, untricky.

Individuals unable to adjust to a peaceful civilian life, formed a dub catted the POBOB (Pissed Off Bastards of Bloomington). In 1947, this dub terrorized Holtister, California, a small town hosting a motorcycle race. Two members of the club were incarcerated in the local jail and several, of the gang members stormed the jail and overpowered the local, police. As a result of all the notoriety, the club changed their name to the \"Hells Angels.\" Members of the Hells Angels and other newly-formed \"outlaw\" motorcycle clubs continued to engage in various forms of anti-social and criminal behavior. Most \"outlaw\" gangs use the symbol \"1%7 This symbol is based on the statement made by the American Motorcycle Association in 1965 that 99% of motorcyclists in the United States were taw abiding citizens white only 1% were not taw abiding. The Hefts Angels along with the three other major clubs began wearing the 1% patch, which is now a status symbol among many of the \"outlaw\" motorcycle gangs. The 1% patch identifies the wearer as being an \"outlaw\" biker rejecting the established morals of society. The other three major \"outlaw\" motorcycle dubs are the Outlaws, Bandidos and Pagans. Two of these dubs, the Hefts Angels and the Outlaws, have become International Organizations. The Helt's Angels have 57 chapters in the United States, Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe. The Outlaws have 29 chapters in the United States and Canada. Many taw enforcement agencies believe that the \"outlaw\" motorcycle gangs are presently in the same stage of development as organized crime was in the 1930's. Criminal activities of \"outlaw\" motorcycle gangs are deep into narcotics, weapon offenses, arson, assaults, sex offenses, kidnapping, murder, robberies, interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles, insurance fraud, burglaries, forgeries, larcenies, property offenses, obstruction of justice, traffic offenses and other public order offenses. Gang members, individually or collectively, are investing monies into legitimate businesses such as motorcycle shops, wrecking yards, pornography stores, catering, trucking industries; and real estate. Gang leaders are purchasing homes in upper income neighborhoods, driving expensive cars, cleaning up their appearance and pursuing coUege and obtaining law degrees. Congressional hearings have established a [ink between \"outlaw\" motorcycle dubs and organized crime \"Mafia\" groups. Prosecution of an \"outlaw\" motorcycle gang member for a crime is difficult in most cases. Witnesses are intimidated by threats directed at them or their families. An \"outlaw\" motorcycle dub member wit[ not testify against another dub member, due to fear of reprisal for violating the \"code of silence. Due to this philosophy, their expertise in sophisticated weapons, explosives, and welt organized intelligence networks, these gangs pose a formidable threat to society. Opposition to any one of these four major clubs is met with rapid escalating violence to the extreme. Membership changes through internal attrition as members may meet an untimely death, be arrested and sentenced to prison, or decide the disappear and attempt to divorce themselves from the gang. Most gang members are mobile and do not maintain a permanent residence. Members will sometimes use the identity of a deceased dub member to conceal their identity when wanted by law enforcement. Many of these clubs employ electronic devices capable of detecting body transmitters, buggin 8 devices or telephone taps. Clubhouses are equipped with sophisticated visual counter surveillance equipment and have the ability to monitor police radios. Clubhouses are in many ways a fortress against armed attack or police intrusion. \"Outlaw\" motorcycle gangs limit their membership. This affords the president greater control over the affairs of the gang. Limited membership helps to ensure that the gang's criminal efforts are not compromised to law enforcement. New members (prospects) must be recommended by a member and a prospect's acceptance requires an unanimous vote of the other members. More dubs are requiring prospects to commit illegal acts&nd take a polygraph test in order to ensure against infiltration by taw enforcement. When a gang becomes to [arge, the membership is divided into various chapters based on geographic location. COLORS Levi jacket containing the dub symbol on the back.

O 34 \u00ae \u00ae \\ Q Q ~ G . ~%~ k .-. ' @ SATANISM and OCCULT BELIEFS OF SATANISM Satanism (aLso referred to as BLACK MAGIC) has existed since the dawn of Christianity. According to the Bible, God is the father of all, including both Christ and Lucifer (the DEVIL). There was a conflict in heaven between the forces of Christ and Lucifer, and the Lucifer forces lost and were \"cast out into the earth.\" (Revelations 12:7-9(2)). The struggle between the righteousness of God and the forces of evil in the devil have tong been recognized. Satanist are committed with religious fervor to winning this battle. Satanist believe Lucifer rules the earth, and when the end of the world comes, the forces of Lucifer wilt overpower the forces of God and Christ and rule in heaven. Therefore, Satanist pledge allegiance to the devil, not only for his assistance in this world, but in the war[d to come. ADVOCATES OF SATANISM The leading advocate of Satanism was Aieister Crowiey. Crowley, born in 1875 in England, was raised a Christian and graduated from Cambridge University. Crowiey published a \"BOOK OF LAW\" in 1904 advocating, \"do what thou wilt shall be the whole law.\" In a later book, \"MAGIC(K) IN THEORY AND PRACTICE,\" he wrote, \"[or nearly u!l purposes human sacrifice is the best, and a male child of per[ect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable v~ctim.\" In 1909, his book, THE EQUINOX, became the bible for the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis - a satanic ritual group founded by Earl Keller in 1900). Crowley began a chapter of the OTO in Los Angeles, California in 1905. Crow[ey died in Hastings, England in 1947. Anton La Vey, born in 1930, aLso known as the \"Black Pope,\" is the best known modern day advocate of satanic belief. In 1966, La Vey established the first tax-exempt satanic church, -i-he Church of Satan,\" in San Francisco, California. In 1969, La Vey published THE SATANIC BIBLE, which outselLs the BIBLE in many bookstores. On human sacrifice, La Vey said that a Satanist should not sacrifice a human being unless, \"it were to serve a two-fold purpose; that bein~ to release the magician's wrath in the throwin~ of u curse, and more important, ta dispose of a totally obnoxious and deserving individual.\" GROWTH OF SATANISM Most black magic occult groups have certain practices and rituals that are common to all. They are usually organized into \"covens,\" consisting of 9 to 13 members. In 1946, there were an estimated 10,000 covens in the country, by 1976 an estimated 48,000, and by 1985 an estimated 135,000. A new coven member makes a strong lifetime commitment to the group, which includes a strict vow of secrecy. Members are not allowed to disassociate themselves from the group. A member breaking the code of secrecy places his life and the lives of his family in serious jeopardy. BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.

RITUALS INITIATION New members are accepted into the group and usually participate in the service. Once initiation is complete, they are sworn to secrecy on all activities of the group. GNOSTIC Worship service sometimes open to outsiders wishing to join the group. Evil spirits are caLLed upon and a desire of the group is expressed in hopes that it wit[ become a reality. MASS OF On the eve of the Mass, a black cock is killed and the heart, eyes, and tongue are cut out. ANGELS This Mass is to give the priest protection from demonic powers becoming too unruly.

Some believe that the Sur 13's and their rivals, the Nortefios (the 14's or Northerners) originated in Mexico and migrated to southern California over time. The Sur 13's settled in southern California south of Bakersfield and the 14's settled in northern California. ..\u00b0 Predominantly a Mexican-American gang, many of the members of the \"Sur 13\" street gang Currently residing in Illinois are originally from southern California, specifically from the Los Angeles area. Most appear to have been transpIanted as their families moved to Illinois in search of employment. At this time there does not appear to be an organized movement of Sur 13's to IiIinois. The number thirteen is representative of the letter \"M\", the thirteenth letter of the alphabet which is associated with \"The Mexican Mafia\". The Surefios or Sur 13 gang has been affiliated with The Mexican Mafia prison gang in California which was formed in the late 1950's in the California Department of Corrections. The Mexican Mafia is also active in the federal prison system. Currently, there is no direct link known between Illinois factions of Sur 13's and the Mexican Mafia. Although Surefios are united within the penal system, they may\" be enemies on the street depending on their allegiance to a particular faction. I Historically, gang members affdiated with the \"13\" street gang in California have been fierce rivals with ~an~ members affiliated with the LaNuestra Familia or the Nortefios or \"14\" street gang. These two factions have been at war in California for decades and the rivalry is comparable to the rivalry, which exists between the Folks and People gangs in Illinois. @ CONFIDENTIAL -For Law Enforcement Use Only \"SUR 13\" GANG ASSESSM:EN'I\" Page 6 Geographical Area The northern Illinois re,on has experienced a surge of Sur 13's moving from California to Illinois. Among the communities in northern Illinois which have noticed a growing population of\"13\" gang membe~ are Aurora, Bensenville, Carol Stream, Cary, Chicago, Crystal Lake, Elgin, Harvard, LaSalle, Mr. Prospect, Mtmdelein, Niles, Palatine, Rochelle, Rolling Meadows, West Chicago, Wheaton, Winthrop Harbor and Woodstock. For purposes of this assessment., the information and statistics contained in this report were compiled for the northern region of Illinois. An analysis of the intelligence collected indicates the concentration of Sur 13 criminal gang activity in northern Illinois is growing in Cook, Du_Page, Kane, Lake and McHemv counties. In addition, there are small Sur 13 populations developing in Ogie and LaSalle cmmties. \" N A ...\" , -, ) COiNTIDENTLAL - For Law Enforcement Use Only \"SUR 13\" GANG ASSESSMENT Page ~ 7 1 II II i ~ i -- - Criminal Activity Like other criminal street gangs, the Sur 13's are heavily involved in the world of narcotics and weapons, including trafficking in Cannabis, Cocaine, and Methamphetamines, and drive by shootings, carjackmgs and other weapons related offenses. They also participate in typical gang crime related activity such as assault and battery, threats and infi.midation, and graffiti vandalism. Typically aggressive and confrontational in nature, the local Sur 13's have discovered the di~culty in competing with more established ILlinois gangs, including the Latin Kings. They have also exhibited behavior contraryto their reputations when coming into contact with Ilhnois pohce. While cocky and belligerent during police contact in other areas of the country, including firing shots at pohce in California in order to avoid arrest, here in Illinois some Sur I3 members havebeen polite and passive. However, as in any contact with criminal street gang members, law enforcement personnel should always utilize extreme caution. 0 CONFIDENTIAL - For Law Enforcement Use Only \"SU'R 13\" GANG ASSESSMENT Page 8 Co]ors and Clothing Members of the \"13\" street =~ang identify with the color blue. Blue baudaztas, or \"Moca Rags\", are often worn either hanging from a rear pants pocket or worn covering the top of the head and tied in back. They are often folded neatly and ironed, andmay be worn as a sweatband. Some \"13\" street gang members use two pairs of laces per shoe, one white and one blue. The lace may spell out an abbreviatiofi or g~n g name, such as X3. Sur 13 gang members are also known to wear Seattle Mariners baseball team sport clothing. The attraction to this attire is based on the color blue which is part of the team color combination, and the letter\"S\" which is worn on the baseball cap.

While the groups that correspond to those images do exist in the United States, there is no evidence that they are prezent in Wisconsin. Rather, Wisconsin is home to smaller, less sophisticated Southeast Asian street gangs, be they ~ong, Lao or Vietnamese. When we talk of the Hmong, Lao and Vietnamese it is important to keep in mind that we are speaking of three different ethnic groups with different religions, languages and histories. Even though they are from the same part of the world they do not necessarily get along with one mother. Gangs are often drawn along these same ethnic li:aes. I would like to provide a quick overview of the gangs in Wisconsin, including gang names, colors, graffiti, tattoos and common crimes that they are involved in. Lastly, rll comment on ways to document these gang members and resources that are currently available. -. Presently, there are less than a dozen active gangs in Wisconsin. Membership is primarily male with art age range of 12 to 20. Active gangs, and those with any size at all, include the Asian Gangsters (AG) ('Hmong - Appleton), Asian Knights (A.K) (Hmong - Eau Claire, Milwaukee, Wausau), C~D Base (CIDB) (Hmong females - LaCrosse), Clayton County Gangsters (CCG) (Lao - Milwaukee), Laos Posse (LP) (Lao - Green Bay, Milwaukee, Wa~au), Nasty Boyz (NB) (Vietnamese, Hmong, ILLs-panic, white - Milwaukee), Tiny Man Crew fI'MC), 0-1mong - Green Bay), True Oriental Gangsters (I'OG) O'imong, Lao - Milwau.V-,'e) and Young Cho[o Lovers (YCL) (Hmong - LaCrosse). All the groups mentioned above, with the exception of the Nasty Boy-z, align themselves under the folks nation and utilize the six-pointed star and other related insignia. These Asian gangs, for the most part, are not as involved with the wearing of colors as are many Black and Hispanic gangs. You wil~ see the we~mng of blue often times in the form of a bandanna worn on the head or sticking ....... out of a pocket. The same is true of graffiti. While there is graffiti to be found, it is not in the quantity we see in other gazgs. Graffiti can tell you who is visiting from ou(oftown but it is usually found in the neighborho~ where they live and the places they hang out. Why don't we see graffiti and the wearing of colors like we do with other gangs? The kids tell us that they don't want to draw attention to themselves. Tattoos are becoming more and more popular, even though they violate the cultural norms of the Hmong. The tattoos show gang a~liations, nicknames, They have been used more than once to prove that someone is using a false name. Loc, k for tattoos and document them in detail, including with photographs. ! One of the hallm~zks of Asian gang members and non-gang members alike is their willingness to travel. This travel component is evident in the crimes that they commit, such as auto theft. The kids pride themselves on their ability to quickly s~eal cars. The cars of choice are usually foreign, with Toyotas, Nissa.as and Mazdas topping the list. The method of choice is called dent pulling or DPing. They use a dent puller to remove the cylinder on the column and then use a screwdriver to start the car. They may algo replace the cylinder with another one so that the car has a key in the ignition. Entry to the vehicle is gained by throwing a steel ball bearing or a piece of porcelain ASIAN GANGS Page 2 from a spark plug against the window causing it to shatter silently. The stolen car is used for travel and in the commission of other crimes. In addition, thcR from autos is also common. The item of choice is the car stereo, either for their own car or for resale. Two other crimes that stand out am gun store burglaries and home invasion robberies. With the burglary, a small town gun store is usually chosen due to the fact that a limited number of police officers are on duty at one given time. The store is c~scd ahead of time with the location of the guns of choice (send-autom~c pistols) identified. A ~olen car is often used to chive t~ugh the front of the business. Alarm systems are ignored bccat~se of the short duration of the offense. Two or three actors then enter the store, take the guns they want and quickly exit into another stolen car. This stolen car is then driven immediatdy out oftown. Hand drawn floor plans and street maps have been recovered from the.se vehicles on several occasions. Home invasion robberies am armed robberies of occupied residences. They am usually committed by Asians against other Asians. This is due to several cultural factors including language barriers, a reluctance to go to the police and a clistn~ of banks by many Asians re..ralting in large sums of money in the home. Many times the actors are masked and heaviiy an,'aed. The wearLug of m~.ks is often zn in~iicator of whether the actors am local or am from out of town. Locals need to conceal their identities, out of towncrs don't because they leave town immediately after the offense and are not concerned about recognition. Cranking is a term that refers to brealdng into coin operated machines. Machines of choice ~ video games; A small pry bar. usually Stanley brand, and a vice grip is all that is needed. If there is a padlock on the coin box a bolt cutter is required. Again. smaller towns with a.smalFpolice force is optimum. Look for these tools and an abundance of quarters when you stop a car. Burglaries and drive-by shootings have been on the increase in rucent years. The crimes am not confined to the Asian community and the actors am often from out of town. Mobility cannot be stressed enough. Identification of\" gang members is important for law enforcemem across the st~e. Because of the extensive travel by gang members, if things am quiet in your city it does not mean that another city is not having problems with your kids. Field intc,-views should be utlli2.mt. Information should include ethnic background, port of entry and i family history. The country of birth does not necessarily equal ethnidty. For example, many younger Hmong were born in a camp in Thailand; that does not make them Thai. This background becomes important when they give you a name that appears to be Lao and they claim to be Hmong. Port of entry matters should you want to contact ~igration and Naturaliz~ion (INS) for fingerprints or other information. Photograph your subjects when possible and include their tattoos. Check identification cards; them am many good forgeries. Ask them about their gang affiliations and documera this information. Question them about their travel throughout the state and country. Ask for the names of gangs presently in your city. @ ~,-,.,O~,..~. , ,Y ON _~.S P.mong may have two or three names, depending on their age and family status. All have a ~ven name and a dan name. There is a total of nineteen (19) possible clan names. The order of the names is usually the ~ven name followexi by the cFan name, although the names cam be revers~-xt, depen ~d.fng on which sounds better to ~e ear.

Howev~, young pe~pr.e, having gown up in the United States, are tattooing themselves more than ever before. For the L a o, taboos are more acceptable and it is not uncommon to find protecive tattoos on young and olde.r mal.es alike. Tattoos that are not religious in nature are viewed as disrespectful to the family. The Vietnamese also tattoo themse!ves. Tattoos of nicknames, gang names or symbcLs, re.iNov_s symbols and- ammals, are most common. Tattoos can also serve to intimidate. Males prflm~SIy t~r.oo themselves, ~though the number of Asian females ~i~h taboos is increasing. The majority cf~e tattoos are not professionalIy done. Tattoos can be found on manyplaces on the body including hands, arms, shoulders, chest, back, face, neck and legs. It is important that all these areas be checked; don't necessarily take someone's word that they do not have a tattoo. Also, the explanation of the tanoo may not be accurate. Keep in mind ~ initials are o~-~\"n ~--~!aJn,~J away as b.~mg thcse every .ta~too ever fore,d, nor is ff the only explanation for a ~ven taboo.

The numbers 301, also in Old English script, represent the hand sign used by members of the MEN OF DESTRUCTION with each number representing the abbreviation of the gang name MOD: The 3 is the M, the 0 is the O and the 1, when combined with the 0, is the D. The MOD GIRLS are the female counterpart to the male MEN OF DESTRUCTION (MOD). The Hmong girls use MG to repres~t their affiliation, althou~h it is not written in Old En~lish script. There are also H_mong gdrls in Milwaukee who refer to themselves as MILTOWN GIRLS or MILWAUKEE GIRLS who also use the MG abbreviation. The ORIGINAL ASIAN BOYS, a Hmong gang, was formed in La Crosse in early 1996. { OBS Another gang from California that has members in Wisconsin is the ORIENTAL BOYS.

Both use the same initials, TMC, written in Old English, and both ~ Pmong. They are found througk~out the state, in Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse and Sheboygan. I/ The TINY RASCAL GANG (TRG) is also from California and was initially Cambodian. However, in Eau Claire, members are Hmong. In Milwaukee, members are Lao. In California they are a large gang that travels e~ensively. They also use Old English letters to tattoo themselves. The WHITE TIGERS are a t-Imong gang from the St. Paul, Minnesota area. Younger members of the gang call themselves JUNIOR WHITE TIGERS. The YOUNG CHOLO LOVERS are a Hmong =an=<, <, fi'om La Crosse that has been in existence for several years.

Occasionally, it is said to mean that the bearer has committed a murder. More than one teardrop shows the number ofpeop!e who have died or the number of times in prison.

Three dots can have different meanin~ to different peopie. The most common meanings are \"My crazy life\" and \"I don't care.\" i / Five dots in a pattern found on one die can mean different things as well. The more common meanin~ are \"Us against the world\" or \"A group of good friends.'\" This Chinese symbol represents the passive, negative or feminine force in the universe (yin) and the active, positive or masculine force in the universe (yang). ] Buddhist tattoos, usually done on the Lao by a monk at a Buddhist temple, serve to protect the bearer from harm. They are sometimes called temple tattoos. They are not effective, however, if the bearer is involved in behavior that is deemed wrong or illegal. Usually they are of a more stylized nature and may be accompanied by Lao script. The most common way to disguise a gang name or initials is to use numbers. For example, Gangster Disciples use the numbers 7-4 to represent G-D; the Asian CEps use 1-3for A-C. Some gangs use numbers that resemble the initials of their gang. The Oriental Ruthless Boys use 023 to represent ORB. To them, the zero is the O, the two resembles an R and a t.hree resembles a B. Other gangs use a deck of cards; an ace is a one, a three is the number three (3). This represents the ~'-st and third letters of the alphabet Now that law enforcement is catching on, identification can be more difficult. In California, 13 stands fcr scuZh~'n California while 14 stands for northern California. For one gang, the numbers 212 mean 2 plus 12 which equals 14, or northern California. For a non-Aslant gang in California a mirrored image represents their gang, 41F, which when viewed in a mirror reads F14, the original symbols for Bulldogs, When numbers are tattooed, start by matching them with the ca~e~onding le~er of ~e ~phabet: A B C D E F G tl i J K L M 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t0 tt 12 13 N 0 P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 14 15 16 17 I8 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 o.

ACCOUNTABILITY. Restitution, community service, and victim-offender mediation create an awareness in offenders of the harmful consequences of their actions for victims, require offenders to take action to make amends to victims and the community, and wherever possible, involve victims directly in the justice process. 2. COMMUNITY PROTECTION. Immediate, community-based surveillance and sanctioning systems channel the offender's time and energy into productive activities during nonschool working hours. A continuum of surveillance and sanctions provides a progression of consequences for noncompliance with supeladsion requirements and incentives that reinforce the youth's progress in meeting competency development and accountability objectives. 3. COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT. Work experience, active learning, and service provide opportunities for offenders to develop skills, interact positively with conventional adults, earn money, and demonstrate publicly that they are capable of productive, competent behavior. Any juvenile court disposition intended to achieve the objectives of the balanced approach in a given case must be individualized and based on the circumstances of the offense and the needs and risks presented by the offender. System balance is achieved when managers and policy makers carefully allocate resources giving equal priority to these programs and practices directed at achieving the three mission objectives. Each program or practice must complement and reinforce other programs. O Comprehensive Strategy, Balanced and Restorative Justice, and ]Intensive Supervision Comprehensive Strategy: immediate sanctioning of first time delinquent offenders or non-serious repeat offenders and intermediate sanctioning of first time serious or violent offenders, or those who fail to respond to immediate sanctioning as evidenced by re- offending. Balanced and Restorative Justice: focused on accountability, community protection, and competency development. Program Philosophy: combining rewards and sanctions with increasingly intensive treatment and rehabilitative services. 1. Address issues of cost/benefit of juvenile justice in community--reduce number of youth placed out of home or reduce length of out-of-home placements without increasing risk to community 2. Address delinquency causal factors a. risk factors (Integrated Social Control Model) b. protective factors 3. Address recidivism--decrease further delinquent acts while on supervision, decrease supervision violations, reduce likelihood of future criminal behavior Target Population Identification and Selection: a risk focused graduated sanction system utilizes objective risk-based classification instruments to determine the level of the continuum most appropriate for each youth. Instruments are based on the risk the offender poses in terms of re-offending and take into account the severity of the current offense, the number and severity of prior offenses, and the presence of other risk factors. 1. Target population is generally post-adjudicated delinquents who would otherwise be committed to out-of-home placements due to the seriousness of their offense or their risk of continued delinquent activity. 2. Chronic offenders are those that have committed serious but non-violent offenses. They have committed multiple offenses, typically status as well as delinquent. Likely to have been on probation or in short term detention or residential placement and failed. The committing offense may not be that serious, but the pattern of offenses and lack of success in the community has resulted in consideration of correctional placement. Chronic offenders tend to score high on risk of drug trafficking. The seriousness of the offenses results in consideration of correctional placement. 4. Intensive Supervision Probation Programs may not be as effective as regular probation for low-risk offenders. The more intense scrutiny and stringent conditions result in technical violations that may otherwise have gone undetected. 5. Cost effectiveness is significantly improved with proper target population selection. Intensive Supervision Probation Programs can be more expensive and become prohibitive in cost when over burdened with youths whose risk of re-offending does not justify the scrutiny of the program. 6. Assessment tools ensure that specific factors are considered for all cases by all staff in a consistent manner. 7. Risk assessment instrument is a tool for estimating the probability that a juvenile offender will commit another crime. Actuarial assessments, which are based on the statistical relationship between behavior and characteristics and the outcome measured, are recommended. Actuarial assessments are based on group predictions. They are effective in predicting aggregate outcomes; they will not correctly predict outcomes for all individuals. Risk assessment is a decision-making tool, not an eliminator of the uncertainty about human behavior. 8. Needs assessment instrument does not structure the program's admission. It is used to ensure that certain problem areas are examined for each youth. It screens cases to identify youth whose needs may exceed the capability of a community-based program. Needs assessment tools are also used in case- planning to identify appropriate program services, to assist in setting treatment priorities, and to provide a baseline for measuring youth progress. 9. Program selection matrix contains the salient factors considered in determining the appropriateness for program participation. These factors generally include risk of recidivism and offense history. The matrix allows the decision to accept a youth into the program to be based on objective criteria. Factors and programs included in the matrix are policy decisions. 10. Override procedure documents in writing the reason for departure from the matrix. Supervision: case planning and case management should focus on three areas 1. How identified risk factors will be addressed (determining priorities) 2. How identified need factors will be addressed (strengthening protective factors) 3. How the total set of risks, needs, and individual circumstances will be addressed (developing a case plan that addresses'accountability, public safety, and competency development) Individual Treatment Model v. the Competency Development Model Case Management includes a written case plan and a behavioral contract. 1. Case plans should address the underlying theory of delinquency causation and specific risk factors of each youth. Priorities, long range goals, and intermediate objectives are established. 2. Behavioral contracts provide clear behavioral and achievement expectations. The relationship between objectives and long range goals, the specific behavior expectations, the specific rewards and sanctions of compliance and non-compliance, and general program rules and requirements should be included. @ The Case Manager is responsible for ensuring all involved parties understand the case plan and are working together, for brokering services needed for individual treatment and competency building opportunities, and for ensuring the youth is held accountable for the committing offense as well as daily behaviors. Community protection is addressed through the case manager's supervision, surveillance, and sanctioning of the offender. ~ ,y~,,~ \u00ae Benefits of Intensive Supervision: Competency Development Educational assistance Job training Community \u00b0 \" service -Counseling Pro-social activities Enhanced self-esteem Integrated family services Positive family interactions 0 0 KEY COMI?ETENCt[ES VocafionM Educafien, KnoMedge, Reasoning, and Creativity Reasoning, and I?rebllem Sellving CifizensMp Health/Recreation o Preparation and experience for work, career, and family life. o Understanding and value of work, leisure, and family life. o Awareness of life's' options and steps for making choices. o Adequate credentials, basic academic skills, eligibility for and awareness of opportunities for continued learning and advancement. o Broad base of knowledge and ability to appreciate and demonstrate creative expression. o Good oral, written, and computing skills and ability to learn. o Interest in lifelong learning and achieving. o Intrapersonal skills, such as the ability to understand emotions and practice self-discipline. o Interpersonal skills, such as working with others and developing and sustaining friendships through cooperation, empathy, negotiation, and conflict management. o Developing judgment skills and a coping system.

A broad range of well-structured, community-based programs is provided for most offenders. Risk focused, graduated sanctions system combines reasonable, fair, humane, and appropriate sanctions that blend concern for public safety with attention to the rehabilitative needs of the youth. Juveniles move between different levels of the continuum through a well-structured system involving different levels of control and supervision Objective risk-based classification instruments are used to determine which level of the continuum is most appropriate for the youth.

(1985) in the Integrated Social Control (ISC) model. In planning the program, each intervention should be justified by its hypothesized effect on one or more of the delinquency causation factors, and each factor should be represented by at least one intervention. The ISC approach integrates the central components of control, strain, and social learning theories. It argues that the combined forces of inadequate socialization, strains between occupational and educational aspirations and expectations, and neighborhood social disorganization lead to weak bonding to conventional values and activities in the family, school, and community. Weak bonding can lead youth to a delinquent lifestyle through negative peer influence. Integrated Strain-Control Paradigm Early Socialization Attenuation/Bonding Normative Peer Behavior Outcomes Process Structures Patterns Strong Bonds High Integration High Commitment Conventional Peer I Group Bonding *Success in Conventional Social Contexts *Positive Labeling Experiences *Increasing Integration into Conventional Activities and Roles *Organized Social Contexts *Increasing Personal Commitment Low Probability of Delinquent Behavior Patterns O Weak Bonds Low Integration Low Commitment Attenuating *Failure in Conventional Social Contexts *Negative Labeling Experiences *Social Isolation *Disorganized Social Contexts *Decreasing Personal Commitment Delinquent Peer Group 1 High Probability of Delinquent Behavior Social Disorganization. In the ISC model and other conceptualizations, some social er.vironments engender subcultures with attitudes and perceptions conducive to delinquency and other deviant behaviors. Socialization. In the context of the family, patterns of supervision and discipline established by parents in early childhood are seen as causally relevant to delinquency. In childrearing, parental discipline may be absent, inadequate, or may rely on physical punishment. Parental skill deficits may also be apparent in terms of moral reasoning, consistent application of rewards and sanctions, and abuse may be present as well. These socialization experiences may prevent the development of strong external bonds (e.g., to the family) and internal bonds (e.g., self-discipline) (Fagan et al., 1984). Strain. This factor refers to the social-psychological process by which one's disadvantaged social status causes antisocial behavior. From this perspective, delinquency is seen as an outcome of discrepancies between achievement aspirations and expectations. For example, a youth aspires to college, but does not expect to achieve this either because of perceived blocks to opportunities or self-doubts, delinquent behavior is a way of coping with the frustration of failure. Peer Bonding. The outcome of interaction between peers is critical in explaining delinquent behavior. Delinquency is influenced by one's peers through the same social- psychological mechanisms that operate in conventional bonding, namely, emotional attachment, commitment to, and involvement in peer activities arising from socialization by delinquently inclined peers. Adolescents learn delinquency by exposure to their friends' law-violating behavior, peers' social approval for delinquent acts, and anticipated rewards for engaging in delinquency. Peer group influences on delinquency are especially likely when there is weak bonding to the family and school. Self-esteem. Another potentially important factor covered by the ISC model, which should also be considered in ISP interventions, is personality characteristics related to the notion of self-esteem (Kandel, 1974; Kaplan, 1975; Kaplan, et al., 1984). Most programs design interventions that implicitly focus upon motivational variables, such as self- esteem. These factors operate at three levels. At the individual level, negative self- concept directly influences antisocial involvements. At the social group level, (i.e., the family, school, and peer group), negative outcomes of interactions with such groups (e.g., school failure) influence antisocial involvement and also influence a negative self- concept. At the societal level, the quality of neighborhood environment and the effect of occupational/educational opportunities available to the youth indirectly influe_n_ce delinquency by producing strain and affecting the ability of the family and other social groups to foster conventional bonds with the adolescent. PROTECTIVE FACTORS AGAINST CRIME, VIOLENCE, & SUBSTANCE ABUSE Understanding protective factors is the key to risk reduction 1. Individual protective factors: female gender, high intelligence, a positive social orientation, & a resilient temperament. 2. Social bonding factors: strengthen bonds with positive, prosocial family members, adults outside the family (teachers, coaches, youth leaders), & friends. Young people with strong, supported relationships with these groups invest in the goals of the group. 3. Health beliefs & clear standards for behavior: families, schools, & communities need clearly stated policies & expectations for behavior. Peer groups, schools, & communities that emphasize positive social norms. Warm, supportive relationships and bonding with adults. Opportunities to become involved in positive activities. Recognition and support for participating in positive activities. Cognitive, social, and emotional competence. @ RISK FACTORS Increase chances that juvenile will engage in behavior that leads to delinquency. 1. Availability of drugs in the community 2. Availability of firearms in the community. 3. Family conflict. 4. Lack of commitment to school. 5. Friends who engage in problem behavior. \"~ i ,t.J/~_ / .'~\"Q2 t' ~'-/ ', <f~ \\, O O Juvenile Jusnce Code Chapter 938o 534 oIntroduced in 1995 and updated in 1998 oAdjudicated delinquents oIn~ensive surveillance and community-based treatment b o 10:1 caseload ratio oDaily contact \u00b0Secure and non-secure detention holds 938.534 938.534 Intensive supervision program. 938,534(1) (1) 938.534(1)(a) (a) A county department may provide an intensive supervision program for juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent and ordered to participate in an intensive supervision program under s. 938.34 (2r), A county department that provides an intensive supervision program shall purchase or provide intensive surveillance and community- based treatment services for participants in that program and may purchase or provide electronic monitoring for the intensive surveillance of program participants.

HSS 348 and create ch. DOC 398, relating to county intensive supervision programs for delinquent youth. Statutory authority: ss. 227.11 (2) and 938.534 (2), Stats., and s. 9126(23)(e), 1995 Act 27. Statutes interpreted: ss. 301.032 and 938.534, Stats. Analysis by the Department of Corrections The proposed rule specifies the requirements for an intensive supervision program. Participation in an intensive supervision program (ISP) may be ordered by the juvenile court as a delinquency disposition under s. 938.34 (2r), Stats. The rule is based on ch. HSS 348, Youth Intensive Supervision Program, which was promulgated by the then-division of youth services in the then-department of health and social services, prior to the July 1, 1996 transfer of juvenile corrections into the department of corrections. Under this proposed rule: . The provisions incorporate references to the department of corrections and ch. 938, Stats., the juvenile justice code created by 1995 WI act 77, so that the rules are consistent with current law. . Section DOC 398.01 states that the rules apply to the department, county departments and delinquent youth. Section DOC 398.02 identifies the county departments affected by the rule. 3. Definitions generally follow the terminology in s. HSS 348.03, with a few exceptions. . Section 398.04 outlines the ISP program requirements for referral and screening, participant rights, program goals and case plan, required daily face-to-face contact between the youth and caseworker, and the client load of a caseworker. . Under s. DOC 398.05 and s. HSS 348.05, an ISP participant can be placed in non-secure or secure detention. The ch. DOC includes minor changes to conform to the revised provisions of s. 938.534, Stats., and to add the option of placement in non-secure detention for crisis intervention. Provisions in s. HSS 348.05 (2) on placement decision-making and record- keeping are not retained in ch. DOC 398 because the court and the county board, under s. 938.534 (i), Sia[s., develop those policies. 6. Section 398.07 establishes the duration of a youth's participation in an ISP, in the same terms as s. HSS 348.07. SECTION 25. Chapter HSS 348 is repealed. SECTION 26. Chapter DOC 398 is created to read: Chapter DOC 398 INTENSIVE SUPERVISION PROGRAM DOC 398.01 Authority and purpose DOC 398.05 DOC 398.02 Applicability DOC 398.06 DOC 398.03 Definitions DOC 398.07 DOC 398.04 Program requirements Placement in non-secure or secure detention Right to hearing in secure detention Duration of program DOC 398.01 Authority and purpose.

This -all sounds straightlbrward and is traditionally what one would expect as a cunscqucnce tot my son's 1-,~havior. However, I would like to speak from my family's personal perspective and comment on the results of Judge Needham's Orders.

Prior to being charged with theft had become increasingly out ol'contrul. The change in his behavior began shortly before the school year ended. 1 Ie would not come home after school, he wuuld be out a~'r eurfcw, his grooming habits and dress changed for the worse, and his attitude at home became bclligcrcn! and combative.

First, I want to thank the St. Croix Co. Social Workers for making my first year teaching in the ABLE Program a memorable experience. Sec.ond, to provide feedback regarding the Intensive Supervision Program. The social workers that have juveniles placed in the ABLE program have been an asset to the success of this program. They have been understanding and supportive of my role as a teacher. As many of you know, I am still a social worker at heart and sometimes struggle keeping my role as teacher in check. I appreciate the frequent contacts that each worker has made with their respective clients. Sometimes just their presence makes a difference in thejuvenile's progress in school. Attendance is significantly higher with frequent contact. Students can't learn if they are not in school. The Intensive Supervision Program has made the difference between failing and succeeding for at least three of my students. The daily contact and the follow through that Ms. Lisa Grant has provided these three students has helped them experience success in school, which several have not had for quite some time. Except, for when they were in placements. The program has provided discipline and structure that these students so desperately needed. Attendance, school progress, and attitude have greatly improved since they started the program. They have experienced bumps along the way; however, the structure of the program has given them, as well as their families, the support necessary for them to keep trying and not return to old behaviors. This past year, Ms Grant as well as Ms. Hutton and Ms. Overbye accompanied the ABLE students on a couple field trips to local correctional facilities. The purpose of these field trips was preventative as well as educational. Our hope is that the students gleaned something fi'om the inmate's negative experiences. Again, I want to extend my appreciation to the St. Croix Co. Social Workers for their team effort with the ABLE Program. I look forward to another year and will continue my journey of transition from a social worker into an experienced teacher. I know I have my work cut out for me! 0 is to measure the success of 1he inZensive $upervisioo Program (/$P). h is important to evaluate effectiveness, strengthx. ~ wea.kncss~ ~o work towar~ the mos~ efficient program for yomh and families.

(not his real name) is a seventeen-year-old who became involved in the CAP Intensive Supervision ,~gram in July 1999. He also was referred to and .~ame involved in CAP s Youth Job Center in August \"~r99. In the following article, John talks about and provides insight to his experience with these two ser- vices. I became involved in the CAP Supervision program due to being charged with retail theft and criminal damage to property (graffiti). In addition, I wasn't going to school or following through with any of my parents' expectations. I was also using (marijuana) on a regular basis and basically wasn't following through with anything. Although I wouldn't admit it at the time, in the end these programs (CAP Supervision and Youth Job Center) probably saved me from going to Wales (Ethan Allen School for Boys - a juvenile correctional facility). With CAP Supervision, I had to do weekly drug screens which meant I couldn't use as much. I had counselors who checked on my school attendance every day and called me every night to make sure I was at home. If I messed up, my parents would call my counselor and tell him i had done, so I knew he would come and see me ss with me. I used to miss school all the time, so if they wouldn't have checked on me, I would probably not be going to school like I currently am or working. Now I'm actually putting in the effort to attend school every day. Once I knew what was expected with supen, ision, my counselor referred me to CAP's Youth Job Center. I (continued on back page) Teaching skills today for tomorrow's challenges Young Voices (continued from page 4) went through a two-day training where we learned how to interview for a job, fill out a job application, and how to talk your boss if you have a problem at work_ We also did mock interviews and really learned what it would be like to work. then met individually with the counselor and decided what j~ were available and what kind of job I wanted. We decided t Pizza Pit would work out the best so an interview was set Ul z which I went to. I got the job. I really found the Youth Job Center to be helpful, particularly if you're looking for your t job. When I think of CAP, I think about an alternative to correcti or out-of-home placement. To improve it, they need to exte the curfews and stop the UA's. My counselors gave me sup port when I made the right choices. It's not like I wanted to involved, but it sure beat the alternative. CAP gave me the tools to help me stay out of trouble. I didn't realize how me I was screwing up until I became involved with CAP. I hat( at first, but as I got more involved and completed the progra it felt great to be successful. Now, I give other kids a hard t when they become involved in the system. ,- .... ...:..:...:.:...:..: ,~ ~,~...,, : ,oa ago e o .A I got put on the Intensive Supervision Program following Several immoral and illegal acts at K-mart while working there I forged 66 checks and stole several packs of cig~ettes, CD player, and speakers.

I am not sure of exactly how they caught me but I - ~..~.~-~--:~ suspect that is why they had security follow me around the. store. But they ~ me in the office one day called the cops and confronted the situation. At court I was found guilty of the crime and was sentenced to one year probation and I was put on ISP fight : away. I have to pay 1200 dollars in restitution and I have ,~0 hours of community service. . Starting on phase 1 was the hardest. ? All of a sudder/all my rights seemed to have been ripped from my hands and I had no trust form anyone. I was restricted from telephone calls; visitors, and I~vin 9 myhome. I had to start seeing a .-. \":, probation officer everyday, and check into the jail on the weekends. Phase 2 lasted 2 or 3 months I still had to check in but ][ o had 4-6 hours of free time a week. On Phase 3 and 2 1 was given a pager and Lisa Grant would page me and I would have to call back within 10 minutes. As time went along and I .. gained more trust I would get from phase to phase and received more privileges such as to the point when I had unlimited ~ee time. Though I have broken the rules and regulations on tiffs \u00b0 program. For example I have skipped school 4 times I have been late 3 times, I had 1 positive urine test and my morn found my paraphernalia.

I will keep by private life unsullied as an example to all, maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule; develop self- restraint, and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed in both my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the laws of the land and the regulations of my department. Whatever n see or hear of confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty. I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities, or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting gratuities. I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith and I accept it as a public trust to be held as long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession ....... law enforcement. Article 2.01 Primary Responsibility of Police Cadet The primary responsibility of the police cadet is to act as a positive role model for their peers and the community. The police cadet will primarily be working with employees of the Wolf Point School District. The police cadet will also assist sworn officers of the Wolf Point Police Department as directed.

He will make certain of his responsibilities in the particulars of their enforcement and his authority to do so under this program, seeking aid from his supervisors in matters of technicality or principle when these are not clear to him; he will make special effort to fully understand his relationship to other public officials, particularly on matters of jurisdiction, both geographically and substantively. Article 2.04 Utilization Of Proper Means To Gain Proper Ends The police cadet shall be mindful of his responsibility to pay strict heed to the selection of means in discharging the duties of his office. Violations of law or disregard for the public safety and property on the part of the cadet are intrinsically wrong; they are self-defeating in that they instill in the public mind a like disposition. The employment of illegal means, no matter how worthy the end, is certain to encourage disrespect for the law and its officers. If the law is to be honored, it must first be honored by those who enforce it. @ Article 2.05 Cooperation With Public Officials In The Discharge Of Their Authorized Duties The police cadet shall cooperate fully with other public officials in the discharge of authorized duties, regardless of party affiliation or personal prejudice. He shall be meticulous, however, in assuring himself of the propriety, under the law, of such actions and shall guard against the use of his office or person, whether knowingly or unknowingly, in any improper or illegal action. In any situation open to question he shall seek authority from his superior, giving him a full report of the proposed service or action. Article 2.06 Private Conduct The police cadet shall be mindful of this special identification by the public as an upholder of the law. Laxity of conduct or manner in private life, expressing either disrespect for the law or seeking to gain special privilege, cannot but reflect upon the police cadet and the police service. The community and the service requires that the police cadet lead the life of a decent and honorable person. Following the service of a police cadet gives no special perquisites. It does give the satisfaction and pride of allowing and furthering an unbroken tradition of safeguarding the public. The cadet who reflects upon this tradition will not degrade it. Rather, he will so conduct his private life that the public will regard him as an example of stability, fidelity, and morality. Article 2.07 Conduct Toward The Public The police cadet, mindful of his responsibility to the whole community, shall deal with individuals of the community in a manner calculated to instill respect for its laws and its police service.

The cadet shall, at all times, have c!ear appreciation of his responsibilities and limitations when dealing with violators; he shall conduct himself in such a manner as will minimize the possibility of having to use force. To this end, he shall cultivate a dedication to the service of the people and the equitable upholding of their laws whether in the handling of law violators or in dealing with the law abiding. It is the responsibility of the police cadet to notify their supervisor immediately at the first sign of trouble. The cadet's supervisor will be the person they are assisting at the time, be it a law enforcement officer of the Wolf Point Police Department or a civilian employee of the Wolf Point School District. Any cadet who violates Article 2.08 shall be terminated immediately. Article 2.09 Gifts And Favors The police cadet, representing government bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining, in his own conduct, the honor and integrity of all government institutions. He shall, therefore, guard against placing himself in a position in which any person can expect special consideration or in which the public can reasonably assume that a special consideration is being given. Thus, he should be firm in refusing gifts, favors, or gratuities, large or small, which can, in the public mind, be interpreted as capable of influencing his judgment in the discharge of his duties. No such gift, favor, or gratuity may be accepted without prior approval of the Chief of Police. @ Article 2.10 Attitude Toward Profession The police cadet shall regard the discharge of his duties as a public trust and recognize his responsibility as a public servant. By diligent study and sincere attention to self-improvement, he shall strive to make the best possible application of science to the solution of crime, and in the field of human relationships, strive for effective leadership and public influence in matters affecting public safety. He shall appreciate the importance and responsibility of his office, and hold cadet work to be an honorable profession rendering valuable service to his community.

They're paid $4.75 an hour and are considered part-time city employ- . es. ,And most importantly, the cadets, ages 13 to i6, have become role models for other youths, Police Chief Ron Kemp said. The program, the only one of its kind in the state, is funded by a state Board of Crime Con- trol grant and by Tribal Strategies Against Vio- lence Partnerships, an agency recently formed on the reservation. For years, city and tribal officials have pon- dered ways of curbing the rising juvenile crime rate on the reservation. They see this program as a step in that direction. The cadets spend six hours a month pa- !rolling and a dozen hours meeting and study- ,ng. They wear matching uniforms: green jack- ets with an embroidered badge, matching T- ~hirts and pants. Each is issued a flashlight, ra- dio and code book; they're not allowed to carry iirearms. Being a cadet is not all fun and games, Kemp said. The cadets spend a lot of time learning the held; most are considering a career in law en- [orcement once they leave high school and col- lege. \"'l want them to know how our system of gov- eFnment works by giving first-hand experience ,m a limited basis, to the system,\" Kemp said. Those who aren't interested in being officers iust want to help out. \"When people ask why do i do it, I tell them I like helping out the commu- nity.\" Friesen said. The cadet program is one way of providing positive role models in the community, Kemp said And it's already working.

Journalism student Cameron Lawrence said problems in the School of Journalism go deeper than Allen. \"You're basically putting a Band-Aid on a festering problem,\" he said, warning Allen's successor rally would face the same conflicts be- cause the faculty is resistant to change. \"I still feel I cannot move away from the decision,\" UM Provost Bob Kindrick said of his decision to dismiss Allen. \"The information 1 have is persuasive enough to me or I never would have taken this step.\" Professor Dennis Swibold said the faculty does. not have a prob- lem with Allen as a journalist but as an administrator. But no one will say what Allen did to earn the ire of his faculty because com- ments could be used against them around journalism schoo dean in a possible court case, he said. Allen has appealed his removal to UM President George Denni- son. If Dennison backs Kindrick, Allen could appeal to the Board of Regents. About 20 journalism students protested the move on the steps of Main Hall and the Internet. Students aren't the only ones protesting. Ted Hilgenstuhler, a 1950 grad- uate of the journalism school, has threatened to cancel a $100,000 giR to the school if Allen loses his job. \"The dean was terrific to me,\" he said of meeting Allen. \"' n wmtmg gram this year, his dad said. And there's a waiting list of others who hope to join the program. \"I hope visitors can walk away with a positive impression of kids in this town,\" Kemp said. \"Because this town has a lot of good kids.\" Parents admit that. the thought of their children riding in a on-duty po- lice car can make their hair stand on end. \"As a parent, who wouldn't be worried about them ~LI WILII LIUFI: a\u00a2IIU busi- nessman. \"But I have every confi- dence in Ron Kemp and the pro- gram.\" And the benefits outweigh their anxiety, some parents say. To be a cadet, a student must have a satisfactory GPA. Chase's grades have risen since he joined the pro- list to join police cadet program \"It helps the kids with self-esteem and they learn respect,\" said Agnes Heser, whose daughter Darci, 16, is the department's lone female cadet. The police department tested the program last summer with two cadets. The pilot program sparked community interest, so Kemp ex- panded the program in September.

INTRODUCTION The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was passed in 1978.1 Its passage was a congressional response to the high number of Indian children who were removed from their families and tribes by nontribal public and private agencies, and placed in non- Indian foster homes or made available for non-Indian adoption, z The placements in non- Indian homes resulted in a separation of Indian children from their culture, which led to serious adjustment problems as they grew up in a white culture that did not acknowledge their Indian heritage. One of the most serious failings of the present system is the removal of Indian children from the custody of their natural parents by nontribal government authorities who have no basis for intelligently evaluating the cultural and social premises underlying Indian home life and childrearing, 3 and therefore have no understanding of how the Indian extended family can play a critical role in the life of an Indian child. Both the congressional hearings that resulted in the passage of the ICWA and the subsequent Court cases that interpreted the ICWA noted the serious impact that removal O 1 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71901-1963. z Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

The cornerstone of the ICWA is its recognition of the importance of tribal integrity, the cultural and social standards of the tribal community, and the concept of extended family in Indian society. Recognition of these principals resulted in the ICWA jurisdictional and procedural requirements that must be followed in any court proceeding where the result may be the removal of an Indian child from his or her home and the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand. In most cases, these will be child protection proceedings. Please note that the Indian Child Welfare Act must be read in conjunction with other applicable state or federal laws. Generally, ICWA procedures must always be followed unless other state or federal law provide a higher standard of protection for the Indian child, parent, or Indian custodian, s 4 Id. at 34, quoting Hearings on S.1214 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and Public Affairs of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 95 ~ Cong., 2d Sess.

PROCEEDINGS COVERED BY THE ICWA 1. CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS The ICWA requirements apply to child custody and placement proceedings that take place in state courts. these cases. In many jurisdictions, a specialized Juvenile Court will hear There are four types of proceedings that meet the ICWA definition of a \"child custody proceeding\". Each type of proceeding will have its own procedures and forms. FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT is any action that removes an Indian child from his or her parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where the parental rights have not been terminated. TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS is any action that results in the termination of the parent-child relationship. PREADOPTIVE PLACEMENT is a temporary placement of an Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior to or in lieu of adoptive placement. ADOPTIVE PLACEMENT is the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption. 2. DELINQUENCY STATUS CASES The ICWA does not apply generally to delinquency cases, but does apply to status cases such as Truancy and Runaways. A \"status case\" is a case in which the behavior is subject to court action because the perpetrator is a juvenile. These cases are brought to court through either police citation or agency petition. Truancy and Runaway status cases are subject to ICWA requirements because they are involuntary proceedings that may lead to an out-of-home placement. The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 4 C. ICWA REQUIREMENTS 1. MEMBERSHIP The starting point in determining whether the ICWA applies is a determination as to whether the child is an \"Indian child\" as the term is defined by the ICWA. The ICWA defines an Indian child as follows: Unmarried. o Under the age of 18. o Member of an Indian tribe or eligible for membership in an Indian tribe. o Is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe. 6 Each of the four requirements must be met for the ICWA to apply. It is important to note that not only must the child be a member or eligible for membership, but a biological parent must also be a member. The tribes determine their own eligibility criteria for membership. The individual tribes must be contacted for written verification of tribal membership status as early in the proceedings as possible to determine whether ICWA will apply or not. A membership eligibility form requesting this information can be sent to the tribe or tribal representative at the onset of the proceeding. See Appendix, Form A, iVfernbership Eligibility Form. Even if the child or parent has knowledge of tribal enrollment process or eligibility requirements, the tribe is the ultimate authority and the tribal determination is the govermng authority regarding membership of the child and parent. In instances where a child is eligible for membership in more than one tribe, both tribes should be contacted for written verification of eligibility] If a child is eligible for membership in 6 25 U.S.C. \u00a71903 (4). 7 Guidelines for State Courts, 44 Fed.

If the child is eligible for membership in more than one tribe but is not a member of either tribe, Minnesota guidelines require that the Court determine the tribe with which the child has the most significant contacts by considering the following factors: 1. Length of residence on or near the reservation of each tribe. 2. Child's participation in activities or each tribe. 3. Child's fluency in the language of each tribe. 4. Whether there has been a previous adjudication with respect to the child by a court of one of the tribes. 5. Residence on or near one of the tribe's reservation by the child's relatives. 6. Tribal membership of custodial parent or Indian custodian. 7. Interest asserted by each tribe in response to the notice received by the tribe. 8. The child's self-identification. 8 \u00ae 8 Minn. Dept. of Human Services Kegs \u00a7XIII at 3523 (Adapted from Guidelines for State Courts, Indian Child Custody Proceedings, Federal Register, November 26, 1979, B.2.). The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 6 2. NOTICE REOUIREMENT A primary tenet of the ICWA is the belief that the Indian child's tribe has a discrete interest, separate from the parent or Indian custodian, in any proceeding involving an Indian child. That tribal interest is protected throughout the proceeding. Tribal involvement is initiated through the provision of notice to the tribe of a proceeding involving a child of the tribe. The ICWA requires that notice be sent to the parent or Indian custodian and to the tribe at least ten days prior to any involuntary proceeding for foster care placement or termination of parental rights. If the tribe wishes to participate in the hearing, they may, upon request, be granted an additional twenty days to prepare. 9 States may have additional requirements. As an example, Minnesota law requires that an informal social service notice be sent to the tribe's social service agency within seven days of a determination that the child's condition could lead to an out-of-home placement and agency involvement will be required beyond thirty days.l\u00b0 The formal ICWA notice must be sent by registered mail and must inform the parent and tribe of the pending proceedings and of their tribe's right of intervention. If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, notice should be provided to the Secretary of the Interior by registered mail, who then has fifteen days after receipt to provide the required notice to the parties. 9 25 U.S.C. \u00a71912 (a). lo See Minn. Stat. \u00a7257.352, subd. 2 (1985); Minn. Dept. of Human Services Regs. \u00a7XIII at 3531. The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 7 The Guidelines provide that notice shall include the following: Name of the child. \u00ae Child's tribal affiliation Copy of the child's tribal affiliation, if known. Name of the petitioner and his attorney. Statement informing the parents, Indian custodian, and Tribe of their respective fights to intervene. Statement that if the parents or Indian child are unable to afford counsel, one will be appointed for them. Statement that the parents, Indian custodian, or tribe have up to twenty days to prepare for the proceeding. Location, mailing address, and telephone number of the court. Statement informing the parents, Indian custodian, or Tribe of the right to request a transfer to Tribal Court. Potential legal consequences on the rights of the parties if the child is adjudicated dependent. Statement that child custody proceedings should be kept confidential. 1~ 3. ACTIVE EFFORTS A significant component of ICWA is the requirement that a child placement agency demonstrate that \"active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts have proved unsuccessful. ''~2 Active efforts must take into account the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child's tribe. It must involve and use the available resources of the extended family, tribe, Indian social service agency, and individual Indian care givers. 13 Those resources are to be used to help the family function successfully to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. \"Individual Indian care givers\" refers to @ ~ BIA Guidelines, \u00a7B.5(b), at 67588. t2 25 U.S.C. \u00a71912(d). The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 8 medicine men and women and other tribal members who may have special skills that can be used to help the child's family succeed. The term \"active efforts\" is a term of art. As yet, it does not have a clear legal definition. It is, however, the highest standard a child placing agency is required to meet. In Minnesota, most placements are governed by the \"reasonable efforts\" standard, which is to exercise due diligence to use appropriate and available resources to prevent the child's removal from the home. The Court must be satisfied that sufficient efforts were made to meet the \"active efforts\" requirement, and this will be met on a case-by-case basis. At a minimum, the child placing agency must maintain regular, documented contact with the child's tribe through the designated tribal representative, make use of culturally appropriate services, and document active attempts to engage the parents in services to correct the underlying issues. If out-of-home placement is to be pursued, the placement preferences and criteria of ICWA must also be satisfied, including considering extended family] 4 Active efforts must continue throughout the duration of a child protection case until a final permanent decision has been made regarding the child. 13 44 Fed. Reg. 67592 \u00a7D.2 (1979). 14 U.S.C. \u00a71915(b). See also Matter of Welfare of M.S.S., 465 N.W.2d 412 (Minn.App. 1991). The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 9 4. EXPERT TESTIMONY by QUALIFIED EXPERT WITNESS When the Court orders the out-of-home placement of an Indian child, the ICWA requires that the petitioning party demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that \"continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. ''is The ICWA requires that this determination be supported by the testimony of a \"qualified expertwitness.\" Once a child is placed out-of-home, the out-of-home placement cannot continue for more than ninety days, absent extraordinary circumstances, without the testimony of a qualified expert witness. ~6 Expert Testimony Under the ICWA guidelines, the \"qualified expert witness\" must testify on two basic questions to determine whether or not serious damage to the child is likely to occur: Is it likely that the conduct of the parents will result in serious physical or emotional harm to the child? If such conduct will likely cause such harm, can the parents be persuaded to modify their conduct? 17 The BIA Guidelines are almost silent on what conditions constitute serious emotional and physical harm. They do, however, provide several conditions that would no__At satisfy the requirement: Evidence that only shows the existence of community or family poverty, crowded or inadequate housing, alcohol abuse, or nonconforming social behavior does not constitute evidence that continued custody is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. 18 @ ~5 25 U.S.C. \u00a71912(e). 26 BIA Guidelines, \u00a7B.7.(d) at 67589. 27 BIA Guidelines, \u00a7D.4.

The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 10 Qualified Expert Witness Although the ICWA itself does not provide a definition of\"qualified expert witness\", the legislative history of the ICWA provides that\".., the phrase 'qualified expert witnesses' is meant to apply to expertise beyond the normal social worker qualifications. ''19 The Guidelines provide that persons with the following characteristics are most likely to meet the requirements for a qualified expert witness for purposes of Indian child custody proceedings: 0 A member of the Indian child's tribe who is recognized by the tribal community as knowledgeable in tribal customs as they pertain to family organization and child rearing practices. o A lay expert witness having substantial experience in the delivery of child and family services to Indians, and extensive knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearing practices within the Indian child's tribe. 0 A professional person having substantial education and experience in the area of his or her specialty. 2\u00b0 along with substantial knowledge of prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearing practices within the Indian community. -~ The testimony of the qualified expert witness may be provided to the Court by oral testimony or through an Affidavit signed by the qualified expert witness. See Appendix, Form B, Affidavit of Expert Testimony. The Guidelines recommend that the local agency enlist the assistance of the Indian child's tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs in locating persons qualified to serve as expert witnesses. The BIA is required by the federal regulations to provide this assistance. ~9 H.R. Rep. No. 1386, 95 (1978). zo BIA Guidelines, \u00a7D.4(b). The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 11 5. RIGHT TO 1NTER VENE The ICWA grants the parents, Indian custodian, and tribe the unqualified right to intervene at any stage of a foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding. Intervening in a case means that a tribe becomes a party to the proceeding. When a tribe intervenes, it is entitled to receive service of all motions and legal documents from that point forward. There is no timeliness requirement for intervention, this right can be exercised at any time. Because the right to intervene is an absolute, not discretionary, right, even oral requests to intervene may be allowed by the Court. @ 21 Minn. Dept. Human Services Regs. \u00a7XII at 3586; In the Matter of the Welfare of B.W., 454 N.W.2d 437 (Minn. App. 1990). The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 12 6. JURISDICTION OF TRIBAL COURT Right to Request Transfer to the Tribal Court A Tribal Court may request that a case be transferred to its exclusive jurisdiction at any time during a child protection proceeding. Only a parent has the fight to object to the transfer request. If a parent objects, the Court cannot transfer the matter. No other party has absolute veto power other than the Tribe itsel\u00a3 Parties other than the parent or Tribe must argue why \"good cause\" exists to not transfer the matter. Examples of good cause include: o The proceeding is at an advanced stage and the request to transfer is not timely. o The Indian child is over twelve years of age and objects. o The evidence necessary to decide the case cannot be adequately presented in Tribal Court without undue hardship on the witnesses. o Parents of a child over five years of age are not available and the child has had little or no contact with the Tribe. 22 The burden of showing good cause is on the party making the request. Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Tribal Court If an Indian child is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Tribal Court and the Tribe requests that the case be transferred to them, the state cannot refuse to transfer a case back to the tribe and must dismiss their petition. A child who is under the exclusive jurisdiction of a Tribal Court can only be removed if an emergency exists and immediate removal is necessary to protect the child, and the child is outside the Tribal Court jurisdiction. 23 Financial Implications qf Transfer qf Jurisdictio.n z2 BIA Guidelines, \u00a7C.3. at 67591. The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 13 In Minnesota, if the county that placed the child in an out-of-home placement later transfers jurisdiction of the case to a Tribal Court, another county, or even another state, the placing county remains financially responsible for the child's placement. 7. LEGAL STANDARDS In addition to the requirements of active efforts and expert testimony, ICWA cases require higher legal standards than non-ICWA cases in certain parts of the proceeding. Emergency removals A state agency may make an emergency removal of an Indian child in order \"to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. ''24 In Minnesota, this ICWA standard for an emergency removal is not significantly different from the standard for other cases. The legal proof necessary to subsequently determine that the child is in need of protection or services is by \"clear and convincing evidence\". In Minnesota, when an emergency removal of an Indian child occurs, the agency must demonstrate by affidavit at the initial emergency hold hearing, and at each subsequent Court heating, the following: That it has taken vigorous action to assist the parents or Indian custodians so that the child may safely be returned to their custody promptly; and That specific, emergent conditions continue to exist which threaten imminent physical damage or harm to the child. @ 23 25 U.S.C. \u00a71911(b). 24 25 U.S.C. \u00a71922. The Indian Child Welfare Act Page 14 Termination of Parental Rights Before a Court can order a termination of parental rights on an Indian child, the ICWA requires that the petitioner must establish, beyond a reasonabIe doubt, that the continued custody of the parents or Indian custodian would result in serious emotional or physical harm to the child. This evidence must be supported by expert testimony provided by a qualified expert witness. This is the highest legal standard possible, equivalent to the standard required for a criminal conviction. Section II: APPLICATION OF ICWA TO CHILD PROTECTION PROCEEDINGS A. EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION In all child protection proceedings, there are various points at which the ICWA requirements must be met. The remainder of this manual will set forth the basic steps in a child protection proceeding and the point during a proceeding that it intersects with ICWA requirements. ICWA requirements are indicated with a diamond bullet. B. POLICY OF THE HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE The Hennepin County Attorney's Office has adopted a policy on general practices and procedures regarding its implementation of the Indian Child Welfare Act. This policy has been instrumental in establishing compliance with the ICWA as a priority within this office. A copy of the policy is included in the Appendix. See Appendix, Form C, Policy on the Implementation of the lndian Child Welfare Act. @ Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 2 CHILD PROTECTION REPORT CHILD PROTECTION INVESTIGATION Each of the hundreds of phone calls received daily by social service agencies concerning possible abuse or neglect of children require further investigation to determine if the call is a credible report. In 1997 Hennepin County, Minnesota, in which the City of Minneapolis is located, received 72,000 calls. Of those calls, 5,716 calls reached criteria for investigation, 2,131 led to findings of maltreatment, and 800 were assigned to a child protection worker for a case plan and services. Three elements must be present to warrant a child protection investigation: 1. The reported act must violate a law; 2. The victim and perpetrator must be sufficiently identified for the agency to locate the parties; and 3. It must be a new report as the agency will not perform more than one investigation of an incident. DE TERMINATIONS When a Child Protection Social Worker investigates a report made to the agency, two determinations must be made: 1. Whether a finding of maltreatment is warranted; Maltreatment is defined as physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect or mental injury. 2. If maltreatment is found, whether protective services from the agency are necessary. o Protective services are needed if there will be a significant risk of maltreatment without protective intervention and the parent will not protect the child from further maltreatment. Possible findings of the investigation may include: o No maltreatment occurred and no need for protective services. o Maltreatment occurred but no services are necessary; in those situations, the agency may refer the parent to a community pro~am for voluntary services. o Maltreatment occurred and that protective services are needed. The agency usually consults with the County Attorney's Office regarding filing a petition to bring the family into the court process. The goal of bringing the family into the court process is to have a Court Order issued to require the parents to utilize services they are reluctant or refusing to use voluntarily. During this process, a Child Protection Social Worker will inquire whether the parent(s) or Indian custodian has any Native American heritage. Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 3 OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT VOL UNTAR Y PLA CEMENTS Removing children from the parental home is a tool used by an agency to protect children. The agency may ask if the parent wishes to voluntarily cooperate with an out-of- home placement. Agreements to voluntarily place a child must be used with great discretion by an agency because it can be very easy for the parent to feel forced to sign such an agreement if the parent feels the alternative is to go to Court. In some instances, an agency will go to Court even ifa voluntary agreement has been signed. If the voluntary placement continues more than three months, the Court must approve it. The ICWA attempts to protect a parent from a forced agreement by providing that the parent can have the child returned \"upon demand\". If a voluntary agreement is signed and the parents wish to have the child returned home, the parent must make the request in writing and have the statement notarized. The ICWA requires return of the child when \"practicable\"; Minnesota law requires return within 24 hours. INVOL U-NTAR Y PLA CEMENTS Any placement where the parent cannot have the child returned upon demand is a \"foster care placement\" and are subject to all ICWA requirements. Minnesota law requires that the agency send an ICWA Social Service Notice to the Tribal Social Service Agency if the parent or Indian custodian indicate they are members of a tribe, the possibility of out-of-home placement exists, and the child protection agency involvement will be longer than 30 days. Social Worker makes initial contact with the Tribe to determine Membership Status of the child and completes an Ancestry Form. 0 PLA CEMENT INFORMATION Financial Responsibility In Hennepin County, when an agency places a child in a relative foster home, the agency is responsible for foster care payments to the foster family. However, the foster family must be licensed for the placement to occur and for the payments to be made. If the Tribe authorizes placement in an unlicensable home, the agency may defer to the wishes of the Tribe but the agency is no longer responsible for foster care payments. In Hermepin County, non-custodial parents and Indian custodians are not considered relative placements and the agency does not pay foster care when children are placed in these settings. Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 4 When a transfer of custody to a relative occurs, foster care payments end. The relative with custody of the child may be entitled to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Medical Assistance, or a possible relative assistance subsidy. Long Term Foster Care placements require the agency to pay foster care subsidies to the foster family until the foster care placement ends. Families that adopt children are entitled to adoption subsidies if the child satisfies the state subsidy requirements. Interstate Compact Agreement The Interstate Compact is a law regarding the placement of children that has been mutually adopted by many states. This law provides guidelines for placing children from one state to another and determines which state bears financial responsibility for the child if the child is moved. Generally, the placement is determined by the licensing requirements of the receiving state. The agency sending the child is financially responsible for the placement unless the receiving state redirects the placement. The Interstate Compact does not apply to Tribes that are under the jurisdiction of the Federal government. However, the Compact does apply to Tribes that are under the jurisdiction of state court and where a state social service agency is responsible for the well-being of the Tribe's children and supervision of the proposed home. Application of lCWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 5 COURT PROCESS A. INITIATION OF A COURT HEARING In Minnesota, the first hearing of a child protection case is initiated in several different ways: 1. Police Health and Welfare Hold. A child can be placed on a 72 hour health and welfare hold by the police if they have been called to a home and determined that the family situation is unsafe for the child. The child is brought to a shelter and a child protection investigation is initiated. If the child is not returned to a parent or custodian and remains in the Court system, a hearing must be held within 72 hours from the time the child was picked up. If the 72 hour period expires with no hearing, the child must be released to the parent(s). The 72 hour period does not include weekends and holidays. The police can bar the parent(s) from contact with the child while the hold hearing is pending. 2. Order for Immediate Custody. If a social worker has investigated a child protection report and made a determination that: (1) maltreatment has occurred, (2) services are necessary, and (3) leaving the child in the care of the caretaker would place the child at serious risk of harm, the social worker consults with the County Attorney. If the evidence is sufficient to warrant imminent harm and danger to the child, a petition or affidavit is drafted with an Order asking the Court to order that the child be picked up by the Sheriffs' Department and placed in a shelter pending a hold hearing. Once the child is picked up, a hearing must be held within 72 hours, not including weekends and holidays. @ 3. Order to Show Cause. This is an Order requiring the parent to come to Court and tell the Judge why their child(ren) should not be removed from their care. This type of Order is generally requested when a parent has refused to cooperate with the investigation of a child protection matter and the social worker has been unable to complete a maltreatment assessment, or when a parent has been ordered to comply with a case plan and is failing to cooperate with it. Order to Show Cause hearings may result in the child(ren) remaining in the parents' home but with a commitment to cooperate with the social worker. 4. Protective Supervision. In lower risk situations, if a \"safety plan\" has been worked out between the social worker and the parents, the child(ren) may be returned to the parents' care but under protective supervision of the Court. This type of order allows the Court to have jurisdiction over the children but return them to their home and orders the parents to comply with certain conditions and cooperate with the social worker. The social worker monitors the family situation and periodically reports back to the Court. Application of lCWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 6 B. EMERGENCY PLACEMENT OR HOLD HEARING The first hearing of a child protection case is called the \"hold hearing\" or an \"emergency placement hearing\". o Every attempt is made to notify the Tribe of an emergency placement or hold hearing, usually by FAX or telephone call. At a hold or emergency placement hearing, the Court must determine two issues: 1. Whether there is probable cause that a child protection matter exists; that is, if the allegations in the petition were proven true, would they support a finding of CHIPS (Child in need of protection or services); and 2. Would the child be in imminent harm arid danger if the child(ren) were returned to their parents care. If the Court determines that n__9o probable cause exists, the petition is dismissed and the child(ren) are returned home. If the Court determines that probable cause exists but there is no imminent harm and to the child if returned home, the Court could order the child(ren) home under Protective Supervision. If the Court determines that both probable cause and imminent harm and danger exist, the Court may transfer interim custody of the children to the social service department and order the children into out-of-home placement. For ICWA cases, the Court must also determine whether active efforts have been made to prevent an out-of-home placement, and whether such efforts have been unsuccessful. Active efforts of the social service agency must be documented if the agency receives federal funding. This funding is often referred to as IV-E funding or 96-272 funding. If an agency has not documented active efforts, this funding will be in jeopardy or curtailed. In Minnesota, a separate social service notice must be sent to the Tribal Social Service office when a social worker determines that services will exceed 30 days and an out-of-home placement is possible for an Indian child. This is a different notice than the Tribal Notice that is required by the ICWA. ICWA placement preferences require a child to be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family, meets the special needs Application of lCWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 7 of the child, and is as close to the child's home as possible. the following order: 1. 2. . . Preferences are in Member of the Indian child's extended family. Foster home licensed, approved or specified by the Indian child's tribe. Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non- Indian licensing authority, or An institution for children approved by the Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which had a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs. A Court can determine that good cause exists to not follow the order of preference based upon one or more of the following factors: Request of a parent or request of a child of sufficient age. Extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by a qualified expert witness, or Unavailability of suitable families within a placement preference after a diligent search. C ARRAIGNMENT Formal ICWA Notice must be sent to the Tribe prior to arraignment of a petition. The arraignment cannot take place until the proper time for notice has elapsed. At the Arraignment, the parent(s) or Indian custodian admits or denies the allegations of the petition. If the allegations are admitted, the Court will adjudicate the children as CHIPS [Children in need of Protection or Services] and order the parent or Indian custodian to complete a case plan. Until the children are adjudicated CHIPS, the parent retains legal custody of the child(ren) and case plans are voluntary. Expert Testimony is required in an ICWA case before the Court can adjudicate a child as CHIPS. See Appendix, Form B, Affidavit of Expert Testimony. Often a Tribe will send a Motion to Intervene prior to the Arraignment hearing to put the Court and County on notice that it intends to participate as a party. Even if a motion is not formally served, the Tribe may be allowed to participate. O Application of lCWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 8 t) Placements of the child(ren) are discussed at the Arraignment to ensure that the placement preferences of the ICWA are being followed. See Section B above for placement preferences. State law will vary on placement requirements. In Minnesota, a relative must be licensable, as well as foster parents. Minnesota law also, however, defers to tribal judgment on the suitability of a particular home. Therefore, a relative who may not otherwise being licensable but is desired by the Tribe for placement is considered a possible placement. Kinship studies for the child must be initiated by the agency. Tribal Membership information is needed. D. PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE At the pre-trial conference, the parent(s) or lndian custodian have a second opportunity to settle the case. <> ICWA cases may combine the arraignment and pre-trial, as a parent in an ICWA case cannot be arraigned until the tribe has had the required notice period. If the allegations of the petition are admitted, the CHIPS trial is settled and the child(ren) will be adjudicated CHIPS and the parent or Indian custodian is ordered to complete a case plan. If the case is not settled, the parties discuss what issues are in dispute and attempt to narrow the issues for trial and set a trial date. Placements and progress on case plans may be discussed. Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 9 E. TRIAL At the trial, the Court hears all of the evidence presented by the parties and makes a determination as to whether the CHIPS petition was proven by the petitioner by clear and convincing evidence. An ICWA case cannot be adjudicated CHIPS without the testimony of a qualified expert. See Appendix, Form B, Affidavit of Expert Testimony. The scheduling of a CHIPS trial will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In Minnesota, a trial must be scheduled within ninety days of the arraignment in cases where the child is in out-of-home placement, or within 120 days if the child has been returned home under Protective Supervision, unless the parent has waived their right to a timely trial. The Court cannot continue out-of-home placement for an ICWA child for longer than ninety (90) days unless there is testimony from a qualified expert that \"continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\" Active efforts by the agency must be established. @ F. DISPOSITION REVIEW Issues to be addressed at the disposition are: How the children are doing in their placement. Case plan and proposed changes. Evaluation of progress on the case plan. Visitation. Projected reunification. In Minnesota, dispositional review hearings may be scheduled by the Court approximately every sixty to ninety days, as a way of making sure the case is moved along through the court system. A review of possible relatives for long-term placement is initiated if it appears that reunification may not occur. Active efforts by the agency continues. In Minnesota, children cannot continue in out-of-home placement for longer than twelve months without a permanency determination. Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 10 G. PERMANENCY Establishing a permanent custodial arrangement for the child is the goal of the permanency stage. It is the goal in Minnesota to have permanency established within twelve months of the out-of-home placement date. Minnesota has recently changed the permanency law which now calculates out-of-home placement time cumulatively. Any out-of-home placement made after August of 1995 counts against the total twelve month period. For example, if a parent had their child in placement for 4 months in June of 1996, the child was returned home and the petition dismissed and then a subsequent CHIPS action is inniated, the social service agency has 8 months until is must establish a permanent plan for the child. There are four permanency options for CHIPS children, in order of preference: 1. Reunification is retuming the children to their parent(s) or Indian custodian. The Court may retain jurisdiction through Protective Supervision. . Transfer of legal and physical custody to relatives or \"kin means that the custodian becomes the parent for the child(ren) and assumes responsibility for providing for the children both physically and financially. The natural parent or Indian custodian retain their right to visitation and maintain their legal status as parent. If circumstances change and they are able to assume responsibility for the child(ren), they may petition the appropriate Court for the return of the custody of their child(ren). Formal notice to the tribe must be sent for transfer of custody proceedings because this is a separate legal proceeding with new legal documents. Active efforts by the agency must continue. Expert testimony supporting the transfer is required. Placement preferences are sought from the tribe. Relatives or kin receive highest preference. . Termination of parental rights ends any and all parental rights of a parent and transfers guardianship to the State Commissioner of Human Services, at which point the child becomes a candidate for adoption. For ICWA cases, the standard of proof that must be shown by the petition is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", which is the highest legal standard and is equivalent to the standard required for a criminal conviction. This standard may also apply to proof of active efforts. Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 11 Once a TPR Order has been entered, it is absolute and final and the parent(s) or Indian custodian cannot change their mind, unless the termination had conditional terms. A conditional termination occurs very rarely because it creates more uncertainty for the child. A conditional TPR gives the parent or an Indian custodian the oppommity to revoke a voluntary termination if certain conditions are not met, such as an expected adoption by a particular person does not occur. A parent can voluntarily terminate their parental rights if the Court is convinced that the parent believes it is in their child's best interest to do so. Formal notice to the tribe must be sent for termination proceedings because this is a separate legal proceeding with new legal documents. Active efforts by the agency must continue. Expert testimony supporting the termination is required. The Tribe may make specific requests to the Court, such as adoption by a tribally approved home. . Long-term foster care is appropriate for children who cannot return home and for whom there is no one willing or able to take custody of or adopt the child. In Minnesota, long-term foster care may only be requested for children who are over the age of twelve or are placed in the same foster home with a sibling who is over the age of twelve. The Court must make the determination that the child is unlikely to return to the care of their parent or Indian custodian in the foreseeable future and it is in the best interest of the child to remain in long-term foster care. Although the parent or custodian may retain the right to visit, they must pursue the visitation through the social service agency. Court reviews are held once each year if a specific home has not been named. If the child is placed in a specific home, a written report is ordered once each year unless a disruption in the placement occurs and the matter returns to Court. The motion for long-term foster care is served upon the Tribe. Expert testimony supporting the long-term foster care is required. The Court must determine that active efforts have been unsuccessful. The agency is relieved of providing any further services to the parent or Indian custodian aimed at reunification. The Tribe may make specific requests to the Court, such as a specific placement of the child in a tribally approved home and that the agency be ordered to keep the Tribe informed as to the status of the children and their placements. @ Application of ICWA to Child Protection Proceedings Page 12 Application of ICWA to ChiM Protection Proceedings Page 13 EXPERT WITNESS Purpose: \"to provide the Court with knowledge of the social and cultural aspects of Indian life to diminish the risk of any cultural bias\" S.E.G., 507 N.W.2d 872, 844 (Minn.

Be clear about your fee, be sure to ask for reimbursement for any costs related to travel. Dress professionally and appropriately for Court. Keep in mind that court room attire for state court may be more formal than tribal court. Be prepared. Take the time to talk to the attorney who is calling you as a witness so that you are aware of the type of questions they may ask you, and ask about possible questions that may be asked by the opposing attorney. Ask to see the information from which you are being asked to draw your conclusions. For example, most ICWA experts will want to review the child protection social worker file, interview the parents, children and extended family members, and talk to other professionals who are working with the family.

The standard law enforcement and corrections policies alone were not having the impact on drug supply and demand that the proponents of the \"War Against Drugs\" had hoped. The drug court approach departed from the standard court approach by systematically bringing drug treatment to the criminal justice population entering the court system. In the past, courts had referred selected offenders \"out\" to treatment as a condition of probation. In the drug court, however, treatment is anchored in the authority of the judge who holds the defendant or offender personally and publicly accountable for treatment progress. Beginning as a grassroots initiative, drug courts have spread across the nation. Local teams of judges, prosecutors, attorneys, treatment providers, law enforcement officials, and others are using the coercive power of the court to force abstinence and alter behavior with a combination of intensive judicial supervision, escalating sanctions, mandatory drug testing, treatment, and strong aftercare programs. Native American and Alaska Native tribal courts expressed an interest in the drug court approach and have made significant progress in recent };ears. Therc arc now at Icast a dozen operational tribal drug courts and at least 30 more are being planned (A listing of these tribal drug courts is provided in Appendix A). Tribal drug courts, however, face critical issues and challenges not generally encountered by state drag court systems. The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Drug Courts Program Office (DCPO) determined early on that the drug court concept would need to be adapted significantly in order to meet the specific needs of Indian Nations. Consequently, in 1997, the DCPO developed a special program to assist Indian Nations that were federally funded to plan or implement drug courts within tribal governments. DCPO charged the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) with the task of creating a culturally sensitive training program that would meet the needs of the initial twenty-two Indian Nations who had been awarded drug court grants through the DCPO. NADCR in collaboration with DCPO, identified a group of individuals with expertise concerning tribal courts artS'or These professionals served as an informal advisory committee and as facilitators at the tribal drug court training sessions. The first of a series of tribal specific training sessions was held in Stillwater, Oklahoma in September 1997. These tribal drug court training sessions have served a vital role in explaining the drug court concept and in working with the tribal representatives from each community to adapt the drug court concept to meet the needs of their individual communities. At each session, represen- tatives from tribal courts, law enforcement, treatment providers, tribal government, Native communities, and others come together to develop an action plan for drug court development in their individual community. In September 1998, DCPO awarded two cooperative agreements in order to provide training and technical assistance for Indian tribes who are planning or implementing Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) is responsible for providing training programs. The Tribal Law\" and Policy Institute (TLPI) is responsible for providing on-site technical assistance and the development of tribal court specific resource materials. In addition, the Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistance Project at American University compiles and disseminates operational materials developed by both tribal and state drug court programs and compiles and publishes information on state and tribal drug court activity on an on-going basis. In December 1998, a formal Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed (A listing of the Tribal Advisory Committee members is provided in Appendix B). The purpose of the Tribal Advisory Committee is to take an active role in the development of a more comprehensive training and technical assistance program for the tribal drug courts. Development of tribal drug courts is proving to be a complex task. Tribal drug courts face many critical issues and challenges. Many of these are unique to tribal drug courts. Others are problems which are faced by all drug courts, but often present more substantial problems for tribal drug courts. These issues and challenges include the following: * Tribal courts must address the specific cultural needs of their individual communities, including the challenge of incorporating tribal custom and tradition into the tribal drug court. * The nature and high volume of alcohol abuse cases in most tribal courts present unique adaptation _ issues. * Tribal courts face jurisdictional barriers which complicate their ability to implement an effective drug court process. * Tribes seeking to establish drug court systems often face a broad range of other issues and challenges, including isolated rural locations, small community issues, lack of resources and services, and lack of funding. O The development of tribal drug courts has, therefore, required special strategies to address these and other issues that have emerged during the course of program planning and implementation. Because tribal drug courts are relatively new and evolving, they are continually adapting to meet the needs of their target populations and their communities. Unfique Role and Importance of Tribal Justice Systems In order to understand the critical issues and challenges facing tribal drug courts, it is critical to have a general understanding of the unique role and importance of tribal courts generally. There are approximately 300 tribal justice systems serving the more than 550 federally recognized Indian Nations. These tribal justice systems are the most important visible manifestation of tribal sovereignty. The United States Congress has repeatedly recognized the unique role and importance of tribal justice systems - most recently when Congress enacted the Indian Tribal Justice Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-176). The Indian Tribal Justice Act included the follov, dng specific Congressional findings: (1) there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and each Indian tribe; (9) the United States has a trust responsibility to each tribal government that includes the protection of the sovereignty of each tribal government; (3) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the exercise of administrative authorities, has recognized the self-determination, self-reliance, and inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes; (4) Indian tribes possess the inherent authority to establish their own form of government, including tribal justice systems; (5) tribal justice systerr~s are an essential part of tribal governments and serve as important forums for ensuring public health and safety and the political integri~, of tribal governments; (6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights; (7) traditional tribal justice practices are essential to the maintenance of the cultt~re and identity of Indian tribes and to the goals of this Act; _ (8) tribal justice systems are inadequately funded, and the lack of adequate funding impairs their operation; and (9) tribal government involvement in and commitment to improving tribal justice systems is essential to the accomplishment of the goals of this Act. Adapting \"Drug Court\" Term for Tribal Justice Systems As the tribal drug court programs began developing, it became apparent that a term other than \"drug court\" be used to describe the tribal drug court program. The term used needs to (1) clearly incorporate alcohol abuse cases since alcohol abuse is the predominant drug problem in most Native American and Alaska Native communities, and (2) allow the community to takc ownership of the drug court concept. Individual tribal courts have adopted various terms for their programs. These terms have included \"Wellness Court\", \"Healing Court\", \"Treatment Court\", and \"'Alternative Court\". Initially, tribal drug courts were referred to generally as \"Tribal Wellness Courts\". Some tribal drug court personnel, however, were concerned that the term \"wellness\" might imply that the participants had achieved wellness instead of still striving to achieve it. Ultimately, a tribal advisory group developed the idea of calling the tribal drug courts \"Healing to Wellness Courts\" to (1) incorporate two important Native concepts - both Healing and Wellness and (2) promote the program's efforts to achieve wellness for the participants. Although the names \"Healing to Wellness Courts\" or \"Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts\" are used as the generic terms for tribal drug courts, individual courts continue to develop individual names for their programs to address the specific needs of their individual communities. In fact, tribal courts are now increasingly using words from their Native languages for their drug courts. These words often mean healing, wellness, or other appropriate Native concepts in their Native language which summarize or identify the goal for their programs. The use of a Native language name allows the community to take ownership of the drug court concept as adapted to meet the individual needs of their communities. @ Defining Drug Courts The drug court concept involves leveraging the coercive power of the criminal justice system to achieve abstinence and alter criminal behavior through the combination of judicial supervision, treatment, drug testing, incentives, sanctions, and case management. A drug court is a special court docket given the responsibility to handle cases involving drug-using offenders through an extensive supervision and treatment program. Drug court programs bring the full weight of all intervenors (judge, prosecutor, defense counsel, substance abuse treatment specialists, probation of-ricer, law enforcement and correctional personnel, educational and vocational experts, community leaders and others) to bear, forcing the offender to confront their substance abuse problem. The design and structure of drug court programs are developed at the local level, to reflect the unique strengths, circumstances and capacities of each community'. Many sectors of the community are integrally involved in the planning and implementation process of a drug court system, including: criminal justice, substance abuse treatment, law enforcement, educational and vocational entities and community anti-drug organizations. Drug courts across the countD, rely on the capability to provide immediate responses to participant progress or lack of progress, lf a participant does not comply with program requirements (lbr example, the participant continues to use alcohol or drugs), sanctions are immediately applied. The most common sanctions typically include increased drug testing, increased court appearances, increased frequency of contact with the treatment provider, comnmnity service assignments, and/or short term incarceration. When a participant shows progress in becoming and maintaining sobriety, on the other hand, their accomplishment is also immediately recognized - with praise from the drug court judge and often accolades from others in the drug court program. The following is a listing of the ten key components identified for state adult drug court programs. A complete analysis of each of these components is provided in Drug Courts. The Key Components (OJP Drug Courts Program Office, January 1997). A committee of officials involved in the development of tribal drug courts are currently examining these \"key components\" to determine which might be adapted by Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts as well as what additional components should be added. KEY COMPONENT # 1 : KEY COMPONENT #2: KEY COMPONENT #3: KEY COMPONENT #4; KEY COMPONENT #5: KEY COMPONENT #6: KEY COMPONENT #7: KEY COMPONENT #8: KEY COMPONENT #9: KEY COMPONENT # 10: Drug courts integrate alcohol and other drug treatment services with justice system case processing. Using a nonadversarial approach, prosecution and defense counsel promote public safety while protecting participants'due process rights. Eligible participants are identified early and promptly placed in the drug court program. Drug courts provide access to a continuum of alcohol, drug, and other related treatment and rehabilitation services. Abstinence is monitored by frequent alcohol and other drug testing. A coordinated strategy governs drug court responses to participants' compliance. Ongoing judicial interaction with each drug court participant is essential. Monitoring and evaluation measure the achievement of program goals and gauge effectiveness. Continuing interdisciplinary education promotes effective drug court planning, implementation, and operations. Forging partnerships among drug courts, public agencies, and community based organizations generates local support and enhances drug court effectiveness. Defining Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are not simply tribal courts which handle alcohol or other drug abuse cases. Instead, a Tribal Healing to Wellness Court is a tribal justice system which incorporates and adapts the drug court concept to meet the specific needs of their individual community. It provides an opportuni- ty for a Native community to address the devastation of alcohol or other drug abuse by establishing more structure and a higher level of accountability for these cases through comprehensive supervision, drug testing, treatment services, immediate sanctions and incentives, and case management. Some Indian Nations are establishing adult drug courts. Other Indian Nations are establishing juvenile or family drug courts. Manv Indian Nations are planning to ultimately establish both adult and juvenile drug courts. The following are a series of definitions and descriptions of Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts provided by officials who have been involved in the training and development of Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts: \"The story goes that alvund the tw'n of the centuly a coat#ion of Hopi elders sent a young Hopi volunteer to the white man's boarding school as a spy to discover the white man's weaknesses and report back on how these lead- ers might wage war on the intruder. The young man went away for several years. He learned to read and write in English, he saw industrialized cities for the first time, and he saw many amazing modern things. When he returned home his message to his elders was that there were so many white people, and many of them were good people with good things to offer, and that the best strategy would be to pick and choose what could better the Hopi world and leave the rest behind. The elders\" were angry and banished the young man from the village. Over time, and amidst much controversy younger Hopis have begun to pick and choose from the offerings of the outside world to build the Hopi Nation. Despite colonization, piece by piece, generation by generation, Indian people have taken control of their futures as a people by merg- ing the old with the new, by finding the common human threads across cultures and using what works. It has never been easy. It has always been controversial, and the outcomes are never certain. However, the Indian people who engage in these efforts are dedicated to making their communities better. They are willing to be creative, to work hard, to take risks and to keep moving forward in the face of many obstacles. This is true for Indian people that are involved in the tribal drug court movement, and slow- ly but surely, they are making their communities well.\" -Pat Sekaquaptewa, Associate Director, Tribal Law and Policy Institute. \"Our tribal leaders are currently engaged in the process of nation building as well as fulfilling their traditional roles as wayshowers. As such, our leaders face enormous responsibilities and obligations in a time when reservations are undergoing rapid cultural, social, economic, and demographic changes. Modern nation-building necessarily entails incorporation of traditional concepts, and care- ful consideration and importation of successful modern tools which will move tribes forward in their efforts to ensure safe, healthy, tribal communities. At Hualapai, the Jiway Gwavo, or \"fight talk\", is a way of positioning the Tribe's efJbrts and ~(fensivelv J~ghting social problems - instead of simply responding to them once they man([est. At Hualapai, planning, developing, and implementing the drug court model utilizes the Jiwav Gwavo by adjudicating alcohol and drug related cases in a way which requires individual, family, community accountabilit)~ and responsibility.[br the wellness of individual community members. By tailoring and adapting the drug court model for tribal communities, our lead- ers are creating governmental forms that J~ght jbr the health and sa['eO~\" of our people.\" -Judge Joseph Flies-Away, Hualapai Tribal Court. \"For the Northern Paiute tribes whose traditional dispute resolution systems were destroyed in the late 1800's and early\" 1900\"s, I think the Drug Court grants project provided my tribe and others with the funding necessary to return, as nearly as possible, to a traditional way of resolving matters which come before their courts. Before non-law trained Indian Agents created what they believed were mirror images of state court systems in the late 1800 's in Nevada, called Court of lndian Offenses, Northern Paiute medicine men resolved not only the disputes at hand, but treated all individuals affected by the - dispute. Those Indian Agents, in writing the Commissioner of lndian Affairs, repeatedly said that our medicine men were much more than mere \"Indian doctors \", that the), were \"judges of civil and politi- cal disputes of the tribe and family disturbances.\" How splendid it is that mainstream society now not only embraces the concept of mediation, but the federal government now provides Drug Court funding to tribes to re-establish, in a general sort of way, the traditional means our medicine men used to resolve disputes and re-established harmony in our communities.\" -Judge Ronald Eagleye Johnny, Chief Judge, Duckwater Shoshone Tribal Court. \"A Drug Court is a council of responsible professional elders and their warriors of both genders com- ing together in harmony to do battle against both a visible and an invisible enemy - \"the disease of alcohol and drug abuse and dependence \". The tactic that this team~council~war party takes is to act as a legal and culturally sanctioned authority that meets the patient~client~tribal member where he~she 7 is at in relation to his~her abusive relationship with mood and behavior altering chemicals. It is under- stood that the relative has come before the Drug Court Council because it has been determined that the individual will continue to abuse without some sort of holistic intervention. The \"Drug Court\" basically uses the circle of helpers in assisting the chemically abusing~dependent relative to consider a path of health rather than a path of self-destruction.\" -Wilbur Woodis, Management Analyst, Indian Health Sen, ices Headquarters West 0 \"A Drug Court is an opportunity... B is an opportunity for oJJenders, the courts, support services, and the community, to develop a coordinated and responsive partnership Jbr addressing drug related crime.\" -Michelle Chino, Director of Research and Development, American Indian Development Center \"Drug Court is a partnership between all the proJessionals in a community who deal with drug~alco- hol offenders, judges, law enjbrcement, prosecutors, dejense attorneys, probation officers, treatment providers, etc. This team is developed by bringing together community resources, structured to meet the needs of the individual community, strengthened by communication and cooperation of the team members and maintained by a common goal. It gives a community the opportunity to address the dev- astation of drug~alcohol abuse by providing drug~alcohol offenders with a much needed structure and higher level of accountabili~ through education, treatment, case management, and supervision. This is accomplished with a judge or other official who monitors participants\" 'progress and imposes appro- priate sanctions and incentives.\" Janna Cooper Walker, Program Manager - National Association of Drug Court Profe O \"A Drug Court or a Wellness Court - is a system for bringing together the court, service providers and the community to address alcohol and other drug related offenses in a coordinated manner which pro- vides intensive treatment and supervision for offenders. In many ways, it involves using a ehild pro- tection team type of approach for alcohol and drug related offenses. The drug court concept is a flex- ible approach, which can be adapted to incorporate tribal customs~traditions and to meet the needs of an individual Indian community.\" Jerry Gardner, Executive Director, Tribal Law and Policy Institute (TLPI) and Administrator, National American Indian Court Judges Association (NAICJA). The Ro e of the Native Community and Triba Custom and Tradition For Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts to succeed, the program must be designed to meet the specific cultural needs of the individual Native community to be served. This process requires the involvement oft_he Native community. It also usually involves the incorporation of tribal custom and tradition into the Tribal Healing to Wellness Court development and implementation process. The process varies substantially from community to community depend- ing upon many factors such as individual historical issues, the land base and economy of each community, whether the community primarily consists of one tribe or is a confederated reservation involving more than one tribe, the specific customs and traditions of the individual tribe or tribes in the communiD', and the type of available resources. It is important to note that the drug court approach is a flexible concept generally consistent with traditional Native justice concepts and methods. The Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts return to a more traditional method of justice for Indian people by (1) creating an environment that focuses on the problems underlying the criminal act rather than the act itself and (2) stressing thmity, extended family, and community involvement in the healing process. In traditional Native societies, accountability to the community was a responsibility that was kept in balance through cultural norms and values. The Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are a modern revitalization of guiding Native principles of justice - truth, honor, respect, harmony, balance, healing, wellness, apology or contrition, restitution, rehabilitation, and an holistic approach. The Tribal Healing to Wellness Court concept can be adapted by Native communities to restore harmony and balance to the individuals, the families, and the communities which have been devastated by alcohol and drug abuse. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are addressing community and traditional issues in alll aspects of development and implementation. Among the specific methods being utilized are the following: . Involving Traditional People in the Planning and Development Process. Many Tribal Healing to Wellness Court programs are involving tribal elders, medicine men, and people with traditional knowledge in all aspects of planning and development in order to ensure that traditional values are respected and included in all aspects of the Tribal Healing to Wellness Court program. . Establfishing a Broad Based Community Development Process. Tribal Healing to Wellness Court programs are establishing a broad based community development process - including not just the court and treatnaent providers, but also tribal council, schools, community agencies, community resources, and community representatives - in order to ensure that the program builds the community support needed to succeed. ,..3\u00b0 language to name theft drug court program, often involving tribal elders in the identification of an appropriate term. The use of a Native language name allows the community to take ownership of the drug court concept as adapted to meet the needs of their individual communities. . Traditional Healing Processes and Treatment Modalities. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are incorporating a wide range of traditional treatment components into their treatment programs. Traditional healing practices have proven particularly effective in addressing Native alcohol and substance abuse problems. Involvement in traditional, cultural heritage and/or community activities has also proven effective in providing a productive focus in the lives of Native people who have been devastated by alcohol and substance abuse. These traditional treatment components may include traditional healing ceremonies, talking circles, peacemaking, sweats, sweat lodge, visits with a medicine man, sun dance, and vision quest. The specific traditional healing practices, traditional ceremonies, and cultural activities vary substantially from tribe to tribe depending upon the traditional practices of the individual Native community.. 5. Traditional or Community Based Sanctions. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are incorporating community based or traditional sanctions into their drug court programs, Some of these community based or traditional sanctions include community service requirements, spending time with elders or storytellers, and required appearances before traditional forums. 6. Traditional or Community Based Incentives. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are incorporating community based or traditional incentives into their drug court programs. Most of these community based or traditional incentives include involvement in community and cultural activities and community recognition of participant success in the program (for example, one program is planning to award Pendelton blankets to program graduates in a community ceremony). 7. Involving Extended Family and Community. Many Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are attempting to involve the participant's family, ex'tended t5.mily, and the community in all aspects of the program, including the decision to enter the program, the healing practices and ceremonies, the cultural activities, graduation, and aftercare. 8. Traditional Dispute Resolution Mechanisms. Many Tribal Healing to Wellness Court programs are~ incorporating traditional dispute resolution mechanisms. These dispute resolution mechanisms include peacemaking, family conferences, elders panels, appearances before traditional or religious leaders, and other traditional or community based dispute resolution mechanisms. Usually, the traditional dispute resolution mechanism is utilized as a program treatment component. Some tribes have been considering using the traditional dispute resolution mechanisms as the Tribal Healing to Wellness Court itself, but this has presented problems in that most of these traditional mechanisms function in more of a mediation role without the full coercive judicial authority required under the drug court approach. Other tribes are examining the possibility of using a traditional community leader or a panel of eiders - This approach is based on a view that drug court participants may be more likely to conform their behavior to avoid failure in front of a more traditional or community based forum. 9. Traditional or Spiritual Component. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are incorporating traditional or spiritual components in all aspects of their programs. Many programs, for example, are including invocations at all drug court hearings and group treatment components. Spirituality is central to Native life and a critical component of the healing to wellness process. 10 Addressing A coho and Drug Issues Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts must face a number of specific alcohol and drug issues which are often more complex and intractable than the issues faced by state drug courts. Some of the most important alcohol and drug issues Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts must address include: 1. Prevalence of AIlcohol Abuse. The arrest rate among Native Americans for alcohol related offenses was more than double that found among other races as reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in its publication American Indians and Crime. That study also found that 55% of all Native American victims of violent crimes reported that the offender committed the offense while drinking. As a result, Native Americans have the highest incarceration rate. Alcohol and/or substance abuse is involved in more than 90% of the criminal cases in most tribal courts, Alcohol abuse is the predominant problem in most Native American and Alaska Native communities. Although many of the current state drug courts address alcohol abuse, it is not the primary focus of most state drug courts. Handling alcohol abuse cases through a drug court approach requires the program to adopt different strategies such as creative approaches to alcohol testing programs and the need to address medical concerns related to alcohol detoxification. The drug court concept, however, presents a potentially effective mechanism for Native American and Alaska Native communities to address the devastating problem of alcohol abuse. 2. Dealing with ARcohol Prohibition. Alcohol abuse issues in Native communities have an added dimension in many Native American and Alaska Native communities which are \"dD'\" (the sale of alcohol and often mere possession is prohibited). In these communities, alcohol issues are more closely analogous to other drug issues where mere possession is illegal along with alcohol dealing or bootlegging. Programs in these communities must develop strategies for determining the difference between mere possession of alcohol and alcohol abuse which requires drug court processing. Furthermore, program staff on completely dry resern, ations are required to abstain from all alcohol use. 3. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). In many communities, the significant number of drug court participants with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is an issue which must be addressed. A June 1999 survey of operational tribal drug courts indicated that fully one third of tribal drug court participants suffer from FAS or FAE. Drug court participants suffering from FAS or FAE may not fully understand and comprehend the consequences of their actions. These participants may have added difficulties dealing with their substance abuse problem and conforming to the program expectations and requirements. Consequently, the court and program staff must be provided with gaining concerning FAS and FAE and develop an appropriate treatment strategy to force abstinence and alter the behavior of FAS and FAE participants. 4. Dealing with Abuse of Other Drugs. Most Native communities must deal with abuse of other drugs beyond alcohol. These problems are usually more serious in Native communities which are near major urban centers and/or near the borders with Mexico where smuggling problems are greater. In these communities, the issues related to specific drugs are more similar to those issues which the state drug courts must confront. 5. Inhalant Abuse. There is at least one additional drug abuse issue which presents special challenges for many Native communities. Many Native communities have substantial problems with toxic inhalants. In these communities, the program must develop appropriate and creative strategies for screening, testing, treatment, and dealing with critical issues such as the risk of permanent brain damage. 11 i,,, , ,,, - ,,,,i \" ,,,,, ....... Addressing Jurisdiction and Resource Issues Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts must face a number of jurisdiction and resource issues which are often more complex and intractable than the issues faced by state drug courts. The following are some of the most critical jurisdiction and resource issues: 1. Lack of Criminal Jurisdiction over Non-Indians. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that tribal courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians (Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U.S. 313, 1978). This ruling greatly limits the ability of tribal justice systems to address criminal offenses involving alcohol or substance abuse which are committed by non-lndians living on Indian reservations, including non-Indian family members. Many Indian Nations. however, have developed alternative methods of handling these cases, including the use of civil court processing, civil forfeiture, and exclusion. Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts must also use these alternative methods in order to handle alcohol and drug abuse cases involving non-Indians. 2. Public Law 280. Public Law 83-280 provided concurrent state jurisdiction over many criminal and civil actions on Indian reservations in selected states (that is, both state and tribal court may have jurisdiction). As a practical matter, it has also inhibited the development of tribal criminal justice systems on many reservations in Public Law 280 states. Consequently, many Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states face additional jurisdictional problems, including the necessity of processing criminal offenses involving alcohol and drug abuse as civil offenses and the risk that the offender may be subject to proceedings in both tribal and state court. These Public Law 280 issues can be addressed through strategies such as the development and enhancement of tribal criminal justice systems and improved coordination and cooperation between tribal and state court systems. 3. Sentencing Limitation in the Indian Civil Rights Act. The Indian Civil Rights Act limits tribal court sentencing authority to \"in no event impose for conviction of any one offense any penalty or punishment greater than imprisonment for a term of one year or a fine of $5,000 or both\" (25 U.S.C. 1302(7)). This sentencing limitation significantly limits the coercive power of tribal courts, especially when it comes to requiring drug court participants to complete a phased treatment program which may last more than one year. (Note: The more serious criminal charges are generally handled in the federal court system.) Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts have been developing creative procedures such as suspended imposition of sentences, consecutive sentencing, and the reliance upon community pressures to ensure participant completion of the treatment program. 4. Historically Strained Relationship with State Courts and State Agencies. Although it varies from reservation to reservation, many Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts have to address an historically strained relationship with nearby state courts and state agencies. Some of the Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts have already had success, however, in working together with state entities on drug court issues. For example, tribal drug courts have already successfully established cross deputization agreements with nearby state jurisdictions. There is even one community in which the tribal and state drug courts are being developed together in a closely coordinated manner. @ 12 5. Triba~ Members Charged with Off-Reservation Crimes. In many communities, especially those with a limited land base, tribal members are often charged with criminal offenses involving alcohol or drug abuse in off-reservation state court systems. Some Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts, however, have already had success in reaching agreements with the state courts which allow the Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts to handle these cases. 6. Lack of Funding for Tribal Justice Systems. When Congress enacted the Indian Tribal Justice Act in 1993 (Public Law 103-176), it included specific findings that \"tribal justice systems are inadequately funded, and that the lack of adequate funding impairs their operation\". The Act promised $58 million in additional funding annually for tribal justice systems, but Congress has yet to appropriate funds under the Act. In fact, tribal justice systems currently receive less Bureau of Indian Affairs funding than they received in 1993 (approximately $14 million annually for 300 tribal justice systems). The Drug Courts Program Office implementation grants, however, are providing significantly increased funding for Indian Nations who are implementing Tribal Healing to Wellness programs. 7. Lack of Staff, Resources, and often Jail Facilities. This lack of funding also results in a substantial lack of staff and resources. Many tribal justice systems also have no access to .jail facilities, or have to pay state jails at a daily rate to confine tribal offenders. Consequently, Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts must often rely on creative strategies, such as community pressure and sanctions, to encourage offenders to enroll in the program and to sanction non-compliance. The drug court approach, however, does provide a mechanism for making the most of the limited resources available in a community since it involves the realignment of resources in a more coordinated manner with more communication and accountability between agencies. 8. High Juvenile Population. Many American Indian and Alaska Native communities have high juvenile populations, often more than 50% of the reselw'ation population is under the age of 18. As a result, many Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are choosing to establish juvenile drug courts first. These juvenil e Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are already having significant success in establishing innovative programs to address the specific needs of tribal juvenile participants. 9. Addressing Rural and Small Communi~.\" Issues. Most Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are in small communities situated in isolated rural locations. Generally, these courts must address issues similar to other small and rural drug courts concerning lack of accessible resources and other increased barriers to coordination and collaboration. Strategies to address these issues are generally similar to those of other small and rural drug courts, including resource sharing and multiple roles for program staff. work together to present uniquely difficult problems for Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts in complying with the prohibition on handling violent offenders with federal drug court funds. Many Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts find that most defendants with alcohol and substance abuse problems come to the court's attention as the result of a violent act, especially domestic violence. Furthermore, tribal courts do not have the coercive authority of a state court system where many of the participants may be facing long jail terms if they fail to comply with the drug court program requirements. The Drug Courts Program Office, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, and the Tribal Law and Policy Institute are working with other federal agencies to develop possible strategies to address these issues. 13 Conclusion O The Justice Programs Office at American University reports that approximately 140,000 drug-using offenders have participated in drug court progams since their inception in 1989. In 1997, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) reported that 71% of all offenders entering drug courts since 1989 have either successfully completed their drug court program or are at the present time actively participating in the program. The Columbia University Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA, 1998) has concluded a definitive study of drug court research, evaluations, and literature, finding that drug courts provide the most comprehensive and effective control of the drug-using offenders; criminality, and drug usage while under the court's jurisdiction. Alcohol and/or substance abuse is involved in more than 90% of the criminal cases in most tribal courts. These cases have always been very difficult to handle. Often, the same people appear before the tribal court over and over again, and the court has very limited options and resources to effectively address these cases. Because the standard court process does not generally subject either the adult or juvenile substance abuser to intervention measures that provide the sanctions and services necessary to change their behavior, most of these people repeatedly cycle through the system. The drug court concept, however, has proven effective in addressing these difficult drug and alcohol cases. The drug court approach is a flexible concept which is consistent with traditional Native.justice concepts and methods. Moreover, it can readily be adapted to meet the specific needs of individual Native communities. Tribal courts have only recently adapted and implemented the drug court concept, but the Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are already achieving positive results. The dozen operation Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts are reporting successful results consistent with the state drug court findings. American University's OJP Drug Court Clearinghouse and Technical Assistant June 1999 which found that at least 259 individuals have already been enrolled in tribal drug court programs and at least 23 have already graduated from these programs (see attached survey for more findings). \u00ae In June 1999, the Drug Courts Program Office (DCPO) and the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) identified three Tribal Mentor Court sites as follows (each of these tribal mentor courts is described in more detail in NADCP's publication Tribal Mentor Courts): * Blackfeet Tribal Alternative Court (Browning, Montana) * Poarch Creek Indians Drug Court Program (Atmore, Alabama) * Fort Peck Community Wellness Program (Poplar, Montana) With adequate support and assistance, the drug court concept is already proving to be an effective tool for addressing criminal justice issues in Indian Country. 14 Where Do Ffind More Information?

COMMUNITY PROTECTIVE FACTORS: * Strong social neighborhood network 1) Communication, interaction and trust is high between neighbors. 2) Youth are an integral part of neighborhood interactions. 3) The community is proactive, not reactive. It is able to identify problems, develop and implement solutions in ways that involve everyone in the neighborhood. * All segments of the community feel like they belong, like they are a valued, involved part of the neighborhood. * Children and youth have appropriate supervision and access to constructive activities in their free time, including job oppommities for older youth. * Graffiti is removed quickly. The neighborhood shares in the responsibility of removing graffiti. * Youth have alternatives that provide positive leadership opportunities, a sense of belonging and a sense of competence and self esteem. ROLE OF NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS: * Provides setting for all members of the neighborhood to come together to decide on mutual concerns and united action to address the concerns. * Develops ownership for solving problems at the most basic level. * Builds and strengthens communication, trust and relationships at the block level. * Helps people overcome fears and discomfort about people who are different from themselves by encouraging them to do things together. * Recreates a social neighborhood network that helps everyone, but especially children and youth, feel that they are each an integral and valued member of the community. * Provides neighborhoods the opportunity to make conscious decisions about their lives and environment, both social and physical. * Provides opportunities for people to have fun together, do service projects, clean up projects and more. * Provides a united group to address concerns with the community council, city and government agencies when necessary. I,,\"~ ~'ql Crime Triangle (Guard~an~) Victim (Centrenlter~) Offender (NIanager~) Loca~e~ Much like combustion requires three things to occur: a heat source, fuel and oxygen, so too does crime require three things to be present in order for an offense to be committed. Crime requires a victim, an offender and a location. If something is done to remove any one of those elements, crime is eliminated. Each of these three elements have individuals whose presence and influence can remove or reduce the likelihood of a crime. Victims have protectors or guardians. An example might be that a child has parents, school teachers, and neighbors to act as guardians. Offenders have controllers. For example, a juvenile delinquent has a probation officer, parents, church leaders and others who could act as controllers. Locations have managers. Or if they don't, they may need them. Managers could include playground supervisors, street vendors, police officers or security guards and neighbors walking in the neighborhood. By examining the characteristics of a problem or crime, you can generally identify specific strategies using the crime triangle, guardians, controllers and managers to eliminate at least one element of the crime triangle and thus eliminate crime. Thoughts about Disruptive engagement: Theorems: # 1: Isolation increases an individual's and a community's risk of both victimization and criminal behavior. #2: Individuals moderate behavior based on their relationships-- the higher the level of bonding and attachment, the greater the conformity to community norms and standards of behavior. #3: Criminals adapt and modify behaviors and responses based on community environment. Law of physics: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So what's the law of human dynamics? If it is not equal and opposite, what is it? Disruptive Compassion: restorative justice, community corrections, community courts, etc .... Medical example: viral response to penicillin/antibiotics--survival response is mutation/adaptation How is it that criminal behavior adapts and mutates to enforcement and environmental factors? How do we stay ahead of the curve? \u00ae 2000 NationaR Training Conference for Crirninan Justice and Community Leaders Green Bay, Wisconsin October 25 - 27, 2000 Session Notes 2000 National Training Conference for Criminal Justice and Community Leaders Green Bay, Wisconsin October 25 - 27, 2000 Session Notes @ Q Q tD MINSON FAMILY CONSTITUTION We, the members of the Minson family, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain this FAMILY CONSTITUTION.

THE REST OF THE STORY: REINVENTING NEIGHBORHOODS By Colleen Minson, Dec. 1997 Getting tough on crime has been a politically popular thing to do for a long time. It's what the voters want. It's pretty simple and straightforward. It requires little or no personal or individual effort. So we build more prisons, put 100,000 more officers on the street and get tough with violent juvenile offenders, treating them as adults. Effective law enforcement and a speedy, fair justice system are core elements of a democratic society. But they are not the only elements that are necessary for democracy to flourish. As Paul Harvey would say, \"Here's the rest of the story.\" Things aren't like they used to be when we were kids. Social forces have been at work throughout the wor!d at a pace more rapid than at any time in the history of mankind. Those changes have had a significant impact on all of us, but especially on the way families and neighborhoods interact with children. A college professor I know regularly asks his freshman classes how many of them grew up in neighborhoods where other adults, besides their parents, would interact with them? He has found that generally individuals over the age of 25 answer yes and students under the age of 25 generally answer no. \"We are the most age segregated society in the history of the world. Children have less interaction with adults than any previous generation,\" Dr. Peter Benson The positive socializing influences of parents, extended family, caring neighbors, churches, schools and other institutions are reduced by changes in the number of children home alone after school, the amount and content of media viewed, legal liability, changing values, family stability, and other global issues. These changes may be global, but they affect us all, right where we live. Small towns, big towns, rich or poor, black, brown or white. Not all changes are bad. Many changes are healthy moves to a fairer, more democratic society. The key to change is how we handle it. Do we recognize the down side of change and find ways to reduce the damage? I have learned over twenty years of parenting and being involved in my community that each of us does have the power to shape the quality of life in our own families and neighborhoods. Not only do we have the power, we have the responsibility to consciously act in ways that strengthen society, ways that benefit all of us, but especially our most vulnerable citizens, our children. \"Whether this | Shaping the environment of our neighborhoods is not generation is a blessing or a something someone else can do for us, it's something we have curse to the history of to do for ourselves. No mayor, police chief, church or school mankind is up to us, each of can do what we can do. We act, each of us, to create our own us,\" Elie Wiezel. social environments through our individual and collective actions. Coercion is seldom effective. We increase our circle of influence through positive interactions, through building meaningful relationships with our neighbors, with children and young people. Let me give you some concrete examples. During a time of geat crisis in my neighborhood, we learned the hard way the price of losing touch with our children. In the early nineties we began seeing graffiti and other signs of gang activity. These were rapidly followed by drive-by shootings, many drive-by shootings. We were angry, we were frightened. Some people moved, some stayed in their houses, some found another way. O We worked with the police, courts, city officials and others to make changes in laws and enforcement. But the thing that changed the way our neighborhood felt and how it supported children had little to do with those things. We began holding weekly activities on our block: water fights, cultural events, service projects, read-a-thons, you name it. The only limitations were that it couldn't cost anything or take a lot of time to prepare and it had to be fun. Everyone was invited. Within a couple of weeks the walls began to come down. Young boys who were vulnerable to being recruited by gang members simply took a different path. The circle of the neighborhood opened up and took them in, instead of shutting them out. __ Rather than having several drive-by shootings every \"The government can hire more police officers, build more prisons, or try new rehabilitative techniques, but the worldwide rise in crime and drug abuse is the result of a profound cultural shift for which family life has not yet found a way to compensate. The burden we face is to strengthen the ties that bind and fortify us within the intimate precincts of family, friends and neighborhood so that the strain placed on those ties by modernity can effectively be checked.\" James Q. Wilson weekend, we no longer had drive-by shootings. Kids were playing basketball in driveways, able to safely walk down the street in their own neighborhood and have other people greet them by name and inquire about their sports or schoolwork. Young people were known, valued and interacted with. Adults did not avoid eye contact or conversation out of fear or discomfort. They knew them and were concerned about them. An hour a week was all it took to reconnect a besieged neighborhood. In a different setting, a retired couple in their seventies moved in to a new neighborhood, the only family without children on the block. Instead of being frustrated with the noise and children picking their flowers, they took a positive approach. At seven o'clock one evening they went up and down the street knocking on doors. Each time someone answered, they asked, \"Will you come out and play with me?\" Soon the whole neighborhood was in the street playing games together. This couple became the neighborhood grandparents and were immediately welcomed by families on that street. No one picked their flowers without asking and children looked to them for positive words and encouragement. Bea, a single woman in her sixties, has created a tradition in what many would call a high risk neighborhood. Every day after school the children on her street stop by her house for a piece of candy. The trade is one piece of candy for telling her something they've learned in school that day. No one will ever graffiti her fence or break into her car. She is the most valued grown up on the street. These examples all have something in common. They each demonstrate a proactive approach to creating safer, healthier communities. They focus on the voluntary, simple actions of a few individuals that have a profound impact on the quality of life in a neighborhood. i have found that a leader is the person who takes the first step when something needs to done. Then others follow. Responsible adults recognize that we cannot change others, we can only change ourselves, how we respond. But when we do, the results are almost magic. Our circle of influence expands to fill the emptiness. I challenge you to look at your own family, your own neighborhood, and determine what you could do that would make a difference. Practice the responsibilities of democracy, choose wisely, choose deliberately. 2000 National Training Conference for Criminal Justice and Community Leaders Green Bay, Wisconsin October 25 - 27, 2000 Session Notes i - CoE.M.EoNoTo- Gaming t Management The CEMENT concept was developed to be a tool for training and .~ guiding protective service decision makers, allowing the trainer to bring the trainee to the table with concepts that are understandable in a story ~\" % line format.

Compensation ducation Manpower quipment N etwo rki ng Teamwork C.E.M.E.N.T. The CEMENT concept was developed to be used as a tool for training and guiding protective service decision makers, in an easily read format. As training and guideline tools, the use of CEMENT as an acronym allows the trainer to bring the trainee to the table with concepts that are understandable in story line format. The best teaching tool is the use of stories and conceptual presentations of otherwise static information. An example of this is the presentation of the concept CEMENT: For a strong foundation of any gaming operation, it takes strong and uniform operational guidelines. A strong foundation starts with strong CEMENT. To have strong cement it requires an input of ingredients that mixes well. Also re-bar is used to reinforce the cement. The ingredients to the cement are the directives of the gaming operation, personnel and equipment. The re-bar for a strong cement foundation is the protective services, decision-makers and communication between all departments. When a strong CEMENT foundation is created, it will last for generations, and withstand deterioration from elements that want to undermine or destroy the foundation. This foundation was created to ensure gaming integrity is not compromised, and is understood by all gaming personnel decision-makers, that CEMENT is the backbone of the gaming operation. @ C.E.M.E.N.T. concepts can be used by any department. Compensation ~n the gaming protection environment, it is easy to overlook the protective services provided to the casino gaming operation. When things go right, problems are perceived to be under control and the first economic cuts or downsizing have been inherently put on the protective service staff, with the concept of saving bottom line doBlars. When reviewing this ongoing policy, it helps to keep in mind this simple concept, that will assist the decision makers in evaluating compensation for their protective services. The protective services for the gaming industry, work and perform their tasks 24-hours a day, 7~days a week including all holidays. The decision-makers in the gaming industry work and perform their tasks mostly during normal business hours, Monday through Friday. This is understandable, as normal casino business decisions are made during a normal business week. When the decision-makers leave the premises for the day or weekend, the keys to the multiple million-dollar asset gaming operation are given to $8.00/$10.00 Security and Surveillance staff. These departments are not only responsible for asset protection, but are also required to ensure that gaming integrity is not compromised by inside and outside forces. This scenario is repeated each week, without forethought, to the caliber of personnel protecting the gaming assets. Many Undian Gaming Casinos have already recognized this defective practice, and have adjusted compensation with the intent of hiring qualified and professional staff. Education Compensation will and does bring a higher qualified person to the employment table. With the higher qualified employee, development and self-improvement on a professional level, is made easier th~'ough training and specialized education. Service and task performance of duties is improved and continually upgraded. With concise training and evaluation of training, self worth of the employee is developed and enhanced. Self worth is a very motivating factor in performance, attendance and motivation. Lawsuits and litigation have become ever more common, when the litigants look at the protective services provided to them at our gaming facilities. One of the most detailed areas questioned in litigation is the protective service staff properly trained? Before this question is asked in litigation, decision- makers should ask the same thing of their protective services. Comprehensive training, with documentation, will make a decision maker sleep better at night, knowing those protecting the assets, have the knowledge and skill to protect the multiple-million dollar gaming operation. Another aspect of litigation consideration is proper staffing numbers. @ Manpower One of the most discussed operations of the protective service, along with compensation, is the actual physical manpower needed to provide protective service to the gaming operation. Numbers are developed through a process of actual requirements of one person overseeing an operation over a period of time. (Shift, Post, Service) A quick glance review of this process is shown below: The following scenario: On i:he day shift I need (5;) posts cov~red 7days a week. Such as; lot, Front door, 3) 181ack Jack, 4}) Slots, 5) CagefVa~It The above schedule is considered a baianced schedule. It will take 7 staff members to cover 5 post for seven days a week. When staff members are off on personal leave, sick etc, these posts must be filled by overtime or a shortage of protective coverage in other areas will occur to fill this post. Equipment Another aspect of protective service proficiency is the physical tools used in the performance of tasks required. Our protective systems following the CEMENT concept have covered compensation, education and manpower. When these areas are accomplished to an adequate level, equipment for these professionals should be considered as a critical element in the total picture of a professional, effective and proactive protection service. Shoddy, outdated or ill developed equipment procurement, is not only dangerous, but also detrimental to the professionalism of the protective services, rendered to the gaming operation. Equipment includes uniforms, protective devices, radios, jumpstart vehicles packs, first aid kits, fire suppression equipment, computers, software etc. When protective service is ill equipped, defective protection practices becomes a normal business practice. Any weak link in the CEMENT elements will affect each other element. @ A professional protective service department requires state of the art tools to accomplish their proactive protection mission. State of the art equipment and tools used to perform daily tasks, also gives the protective service confidence and pride in conducting their professional careers with dedication and motivation. Networking Networking is another element of the CEMENT concept that not only assists the professional growth of the protective service, but can also enhance the protective services in the protection of gaming integrity. Networking starts with the communication between departments in your gaming operation. Manageriai, supervisory and line employees need to operate with interdepartmental communication on a daily basis, with fresh and pertinent information, to ensure service to the gaming operation is conducted in a proficient manner. When in house communication is at the highest level, networking within an organization a~lows the flow of information to become smooth, concise, accurate and timely. The concept of networking is having a friendly working relationship with all departments, as each department operation is dependant on each other, more so with the protective services. When an organization communicates with effective information to their departments, the protection of that organization is enhanced. Detection and prevention of inside/outside forces that Want to commit a gaming integrity compromise at your facility can be shared with other Bndian gaming operations, which helps to mutually protect all of our respective gaming operations. This is networking at it's finest. Teamwork To accomplish the CEMENT program, it requires an all facility teamwork concept. The decision-makers should look at this working concept as a tool. The protective service decision-makers already use the CEMENT concept on a daily basis, in their duties to providing the best protective service available to the gaming operation. Protective services already require teamwork in the performance of their protective mission. Teamwork and Networking work hand in hand, providing goals, projections and sharing information, which can only enhance gaming operations. When all gaming decision making personnel understand the concept of the CEMENT, decision making can be done in a more proficient and proactive manner. Teamwork is made easier when the protective services have common ground to work from. As the professional protective services move forward, common ground opens communication avenues that are priceless. Open communication enhances and encourages teamwork, which improves performance and services to the gaming organization. @ 2000 Nationa~ Training Cenference ~o~ CHminaU Justice and Community Leaders Green Bay, Wisconsin October 25 - 27, 2000 $essien Notes 2000 National Training Conference for Criminal Justice and Community Leaders Green Bay, Wisconsin October 25 - 27, 2000 Session Notes @ Chang rac of ~ America: Implications |~ ~.-~~);)~ for Law Enforcement % Law enforcement has been the pillar of society stabilization for over f150 % years.
