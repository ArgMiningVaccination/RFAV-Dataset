This district is now called Nakasongola, after the name of its major town (figure I). Half a century ago, a report was published in the Lancet about skin ulcers occurring in that region [ I ].The authors called the causing agent of the skin ulcers Mycobacterium buruli [2]. Some years hereafter, refugees from Rwanda who moved to Uganda into a settlement located near a swampy area in the Nile river basin also developed extensive and crippling ulcers [3]. Earlier, in the 1950s, several reports came from Zaire -now DR Congo-, describing necrotizing skin lesions with large loads of acid\u00ad fast bacilli [4,5]. All of these reports addressed the disease now commonly called Buruli ulcer disease or Mycobacterium u/cerans infection. The first description in West Africa was from Nigeria in 1967 [6]. In 1971, two cases were reported from Ghana [7]. Since then the disease has emerged in western parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Reports have however come from over 30 countries around the world. The first report with a clear description of the clinical presentation and histopathology identifying the causative pathogen, dates back to 1948. In this report from Australia it was shown that a slowly growing mycobacterium could be cultured around 30\u00b0C, and that the subsequent inoculation of these bacteria in experimental animals caused similar pathology [8]. Cases of Buruli ulcer have also been reported from scattered foci in Asia and South America [9-11 ]. The micro-organism is generally believed to be an environmental mycobacterium residing in swampy, riverine areas in humid climates, but the reservoir is not fully understood [9]. Likewise, the exact mode of transmission is still unknown [ 12]; person-to-person transmission is however extremely rare [ 13]. Circumstantial evidence suggests that trauma introduces the etiologic agent into the skin and the subcutaneous tissue [ 14-17]. Mycobacterium u/cerans infection usually starts as a nodule, papule, plaque, or edema (figure 2-4). When the lesion breaks open, a typical painless ulcer with undermined edges appears (figure 5), which can progress to a large necrotic wound. Lesions predominate on the limbs, and children of school-going age, residing in remote areas, are most often affected. The disease can be self-limiting [9, 18, 19], but leaves patients often with large scars and deformities. Stigmatization is still common, and is one of the reasons for delay in reporting [20,21 ]. Even large lesions rarely cause pain or systemic symptoms, which is another source of delay in seeking treatment early [22,23]. Since its first description, different treatments have been investigated, but surgery has dominated. Even Albert Cook, who described lesions we now recognize as 12 Introduction -Drug treatment for Buruli ulcer typical for Buruli ulcer as early as 1897 [24,25], tried surgical removal of affected tissues. In Australia Maccallum et al. reported surgical treatment with subsequent healing [8]. In 1964 Lunn et al. concluded from several observational reports that 'in all these, chemotherapy alone was ineffective as a sole means of treatment, though varying degrees of activity against the causative mycobacterium have been demonstrated in vitro' [26]. In 1970, the Uganda Buruli Group reported that 'we do use antimycobacterial drugs for hospital patients, but it seems that the most important factor in healing is surgical technique' [27]. Surgery cannot completely remove all bacilli. Recurrence is common, with reported rates varying between 6% [28] and 47% [29].Although larger excisions might be more effective, the inherent tissue damage increases duration of treatment 0 50 100 150 200 ..,__,.. ____ of Uganda showing the high incidence of mycobacterial ulcers in de the Buruli area.

Many antimycobacterial agents show activity against Mycobaeterium u/cerans in vitro and in animal models [30-40]. As early as in the 1950s and 1960s, success was reported with clofazimine and with streptomycin for the treatment of early experimental infection in mice [26,41,42]. In 1972 the in vitro sensitivity of Mycobaeterium ulcerans to rifampicin was found to be similar to that of Mycobaeterium tuberculosis [43]. Heat therapy in combination with rifampicin yielded good results in the mouse footpad infected with Mycobaeterium ulcerans [44].Two randomized placebo controlled trials have been carried out using clofazimine and dapsone plus rifampicin. Neither of these trials showed a difference in rate of healing between groups [45,46]. Chemotherapy was generally disappointing. Extensive surgical debridement became the standard, with or without subsequent skin grafting. In 2003 a study in Ghana was conducted in patients with pre-ulcerative (nodular) lesions. The number of study participants was relatively small, and only 21 had their Mycobaeterium u/cerans disease confirmed by PCR testing. The study participants received variable periods of streptomycin plus rifampicin treatment.All lesions were surgically removed, and histopathology, PCR and culture was performed of all resected tissues. In some of the lesions Mycobaeterium ulcerans could be cultured, but in none of the tissues of affected individuals receiving drug treatment of 4 weeks or more, showing that Mycobaeterium ulcerans can be killed in human tissues by drug treatment alone [47]. Antibiotics were used erratically in regions 15 Chapter I where surgery was not easily accessible, with the imminent danger of developing resistance resulting from mono-therapy or sub-therapeutic dosage drug treatment [48].Therefore WHO issued preliminary guidelines for the drug treatment of Buruli ulcer disease in 2004, with 8 weeks of standard antibiotic treatment, with or without surgery [ 49]. In an observational study reported in 2007, promising clinical efficacy of the combination streptomycin and rifampicin was reported from Benin, where close to 50% ( I 02 out of 224) of the included Buruli ulcer patients were treated successfully with antibiotics alone. Of those, two recurrences were reported after one year. In the other patients it was judged necessary to add surgical treatment; in 113 successfully treated patients one recurrence was reported after one year [50]. Buruli ulcer disease is one of 19 neglected tropical diseases addressed byWHO in its Global plan to combat neglected tropical diseases 2008-2015 [51 ]. Here the organization describes Mycobacterium ulcerans infection as a disease for which there are no cost\u00ad effective control methods. This thesis addresses drug treatment for Buruli ulcer. Should antibiotics be given for Buruli ulcer? Does treatment using streptomycin and rifampicin given for 8 weeks, without the use of large debridement surgery, result in healing of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection without recurrence of disease? Is an oral regimen using clarithromycin instead of streptomycin during the second 4 weeks inferior compared to 8 weeks of injection therapy? In Chapter 2 we test the hypothesis that early (duration less than 6 months), limited (lesion cross-sectional diameter smaller than IO cm) Mycobacterium ulcerans infection can be cured with 8 weeks of antimycobacterial therapy, without adding debridement surgery. Studies in animal models showed that aminoglycosides -e.g. and amikacin -and rifampicin have strong The most harmful side effects of aminoglycosides are ototoxicity and renal toxicity [52-54], and administration is contra-indicated during pregnancy because of potential toxic effects on the fetus. In highly endemic areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa, hygiene is a concern as aminoglycosides can only be administered through injections [55-58]. We therefore tested a second hypothesis -i.e., whether switching injected streptomycin to oral clarithromycin after 4 weeks would be equally effective, or at least, non-inferior to the streptomycin-based therapy. Earlier, clarithromycin showed bacteriostatic and weak bactericidal activity in vivo when the study was designed [34,35]. 16 Introduction - Drug treatment for Buruli ulcer Clarithromycin Bunlli ulcer clarithromycin when treating Mycobaeterium u/cerans infection? What of the can result in significant drug-drug interaction.This can be so profound that a decrease to sub-therapeutic serum concentrations might result. Rifampicin is known to induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are responsible for the hepatic metabolism of many active drugs [59-61 ].As CYP3A4, one of those enzymes, is involved in the elimination of clarithromycin [61,62], a faster metabolism into its major -and, possibly also active -metabolite 14-OH clarithromycin will result [63]. Clarithromycin, on the other hand, is known to inhibit CYP450 enzyme systems [60,64,65]. Chapter 3 explores the drug-drug interaction between rifampicin and clarithromycin in a subset of patients that participated in the randomized trial described in chapter 2. The extent of the drug-drug interaction of these two drugs had not been studied earlier in this population and with the present prescription used (clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight, once daily; rifampicin IO mg/kg, once daily). Furthermore, in chapter 3, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin are determined for a and a Malaysian Mycobaeterium u/cerans strain. For 14-OH clarithromycin the activity against Mycobaeterium ulcerans has never been described, and it is unknown to what extent the antimycobacterial effects of the metabolite add to activity of clarithromycin itself. We hypothesized that despite the described drug interactions, effective inhibitory concentrations of both combined drugs would be achieved for at least some period of time [66], and that therefore no inadvertent mono-therapy would jeopardize the effectiveness of treatment with possible selection pressure allowing naturally occurring drug-resistant mutant organisms to repopulate Buruli ulcer lesions [48,67]. Response patterns to drug treatment of Buruli ulcer Why have antibiotics long been thought to be ineffective for the treatment of Mycobaeterium ulcerans infection? Is there evidence for a paradoxical response accompanying antimicrobial treatment for Buruli ulcer disease? When carrying out the randomized controlled trial described in chapter 2, we were struck by the fact that, overall, healing was slow. Moreover, in quite some patients it looked like healing set in after an initial worsening of disease had been noticed. This led to the hypothesis of a paradoxical reaction accompanying effective mycobacterial killing. In the past, paradoxical reactions might have been misunderstood as treatment 17 Chapter I failure [68,69]. This could, in part, explain why the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy for Buruli ulcer disease has not been recognized earlier. Paradoxical reactions are well known in other mycobacterial diseases, particularly tuberculosis [70-72]. After starting anti-tuberculosis treatment, immediate effect can be observed by a decrease in symptoms. Despite a possible paradoxical reaction, treatment is likely to be continued, as the phenomenon is recognized as such, and not misinterpreted as treatment failure. A paradoxical reaction in (pulmonary) tuberculosis might be less obvious than in a skin disease like Buruli ulcer, where treatment responses are observed continuously in case of non-ulcerative lesions, or whenever dressing changes allow observation of the lesion, as is the case in ulcerative stages of disease. Besides, initial improvement may be more subtle in Mycobacterium u/cerans infection, as the disease is not associated with systemic symptoms, unless secondary infection is present. Early surgical intervention might have biased results of clinical trials and observations on antibiotic treatment for Buruli ulcer. Chapter 4 describes disease response patterns after start of antibiotic therapy for Buruli ulcer disease in patients who healed on therapy, intending to find support for the hypothesis of paradoxical reactions accompanying antimycobacterial killing. Streptomycin for Buruli ulcer -ototoxicity screening in the field Can screening for aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity be reliably performed in the field? Measurement of hearing levels can be used as a screening method for developing hearing impairment as a result of streptomycin toxicity [52,73]. Chapter 5 addresses the feasibility and reliability of measuring hearing levels using portable audiometry in a field hospital setting. We hypothesized that this screening method can be reliably used in hands of inexperienced, briefly trained health personnel, preventing the need for sending patients to specialized centers for audiometry, which are often far away, and not easily accessible. Genetics and vitamin D in Buruli ulcer Does serum vitamin D concentration influence susceptibility to develop Buruli ulcer disease, or the response to antibiotic treatment? To what extent do genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor, or in other candidate genes, play a role in susceptibility to develop Buruli ulcer disease after Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, and do genetic polymorphisms play a role in response to treatment? Vitamin D has been considered as a treatment option in tuberculosis in the pre\u00ad antibiotic era, along with other supportive measures [74]. Later it was shown that 18 Introduction -Drug treatment for Buruli ulcer metabolites of this hormone-like molecule are essential in the antimicrobial immune reaction cascade, triggered upon contact with certain pathogens that enter the human body, like mycobacteria [75,76]. Vitamin D effects depend on the presence of adequate stores, best measured by blood concentrations of 25-hydox yvitamin D [77,78], and on the genetically determined susceptibility of the vitamin D receptor [79]. Most tissues and cells in the body have vitamin D receptors, and the majority of immune cells, notably monocytes and macrophages, have the ability to convert vitamin D into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [78]. In this way the supra\u00ad physiological concentrations of active vitamin D, necessary to modulate immune responses at the local level, can be reached [76]. Epidemiological evidence suggests there is a relation between vitamin D deficiency, as well as polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene, and susceptibility to tuberculosis [80-84]. Certain vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms have also been found to be associated with leprosy type (tuberculoid versus lepromatous) [85].A study that assessed outcome of tuberculosis treatment showed an association between vitamin D receptor polymorphism and time to sputum culture conversion during anti-tuberculosis treatment [86]. In a study that assessed the potential of vitamin D suppletion in tuberculosis patients, vitamin D receptor polymorphism was associated with time to sputum culture conversion as well [87]. In summary, there is evidence to suggest that host response after mycobacterial infection is related to vitamin D status and vitamin D receptor polymorphism status. In chapter 6 we therefore studied the hypothesis that vitamin D serum concentration and vitamin D receptor polymorphism is associated with Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, as well, and that response to treatment depends on vitamin D status and vitamin D receptor polymorphism. Only a certain percentage of individuals infected with Mycobacterium ulcerans develop overt clinical disease [88-92]. Like in tuberculosis and leprosy, a combination of environmental and inherited factors seem to determine this clinical response; apart from the vitamin D receptor gene, other genes are known to influence susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprosy [93-96]. For Mycobacterium u/cerans infection, the only published study on genetic susceptibility reported that a certain polymorphism in the SLC I I A I gene increased the chance of developing Buruli ulcer disease by 13% [97]. In chapter 6 we seized the opportunity to try confirm this finding, and apart from the SLC I I A I and the VDR gene, we studied the MBL (mannose binding lectin) gene. We tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms in these candidate genes are associated with Buruli ulcer disease in our population, and with response to treatment. 19 Chapter I Refere nces I.

These recommenda tions were based on observational studies and a small pilot study with microbiological endpoints. We investigated the efficacy of two regimens of antimicrobial treatment in early-stage M ulcerans infection. Methods In this parallel, open-label, randomised trial undertaken in two sites in Ghana, patients were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 5 years or older and had early (duration <6 months), limited (cross-secti onal diameter <IO cm), M ulcerans infection confirmed by dry-reagent-based PCR. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular streptomyc in ( 15 mg/kg once daily) and oral rifampicin (IO mg/kg once daily) for 8 weeks (8-week streptomyc in group; n=76) or streptomyc in and rifampicin weeks followed by rifampicin and clarithromycin (7 \u00b75 mg/ kg once daily ), streptomycin for study site and type of lesion (ulceration or no ulceration).The primary endpoint was lesion healing at I year after the start of treatment without lesion recurrence or extensive surgical debridemen t. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT0032 I 178. Findings Four streptomycin, one; 4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin, three). Since these four participants had healed lesions at their last assessment, they were included in the analysis for the primary endpoint. 73 (96%) participants in the 8-week streptomyc in group and 68 (91 %) in the 4-week streptomy cin plus 4-week clarithromycin group had healed lesions at I year (odds ratio 2 \u00b749, 95% Cl 0 \u00b766 to infinity; p=0 Fisher's exact test). No participants had lesion recurrence at I year.Three participants had vestibulotoxic events streptomycin, one; 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin, two). One participant developed an injection abscess and two participants developed an abscess close to the initial lesion, which was incised and drained (all three participants were in the 4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin group). ulcer? Interpreta tion Antimycobacterial treatment for M ulcerans infection is effective in early, limited disease. 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin has similar efficacy to 8 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin; however, the number of injections of streptomycin can be reduced by switching to oral clarithromycin after 4 weeks. Funding European Union (EU FP6 2003-INCO-Dev2-015476) and Buruli by Mycobacterium ulcerans.1 The name Buruli ulcer comes from a region near the Nile River delta in Uganda, named Buruli Cou nty, where the disease was high ly endemic in the I 960s.2 Today, the disease is emerging in west African coun tries with thousands of cases every year , mainly in childr en.34 A plasmid of M u/cerans is acquired near slow-flowing and stagnant water in tropical and subtropical environments. The natural reserv oir and mode of transmission of the infection remain largely obscu re and might differ between endemic foci around the world.78 However , skin injury9 and insect bites 10 have been proposed as modes of transmission. M ulcer ans infection usua lly starts as a nodule, papule, pla que, or oedema. When left alone, the lesion breaks open and a typical painless ulcer with undermined edges appears, which can progress to a large necr otic lesion. WHO has defined lesions with a cross-sectional diameter of less than 5 cm as category I, 5-1 5 cm as category 11, and mor e than I 5 cm, lesions on impor tant sites ( eye, breast, and genitalia), or multiple lesions as catego ry Ill. M ulcerans infection can be self-limiting, but scar tissue and contractures in joints leave patients with functional limitations and social stigma. 1112 The diagnosis can be made clinically but culture is the gold standard. Howeve r, this method is difficult and has low sensitivit y. 13413 Since the dev elopm ent insertion sequence 2404 (IS2404)-a repetitive oligonuc leoti de unit with mor e than 200 copies in the genome of of 19 neglected tropical diseases addressed byWHO in its Global plan to com bat neglected tropical diseases 2008-20 15.17 In this plan, the organisation descr ibes Buruli ulcer as a disease for which there are no cost -effective control methods. Since the disease's first description in 1948, 18 different treatments have been investigate d. Extensive surgical debridem ent, with or without subsequent skin grafting, is standard trea tment. However , surgery cannot comple tely remove all bacilli19 and recurrence is common, with reported rates varying between 6% and 47%.20-22 Although larger excisions might be more effective, they can increase chances of residual functional limitations. In the first of two randomised contr olled trials for M u/cerans infecti on, clofazi mine did not show a significant benefit comp ared with placebo.23 In individuals with small (<S cm), non-ul cerated lesions, recurrence- free healing without surgery was reported in five of eight participants who were treated 30 Should antibiotics be given for Buruli ulcer? with clofazimine compared with five of 17 who were treated with placebo. In ten patients with larger and ulcerated lesions, all except one (in the placebo group) needed surgery.A second study compared the effect of dapsone plus rifampicin with placebo. Of 41 randomised patients, 30 completed the 2-month trial. Rate of healing did not differ between groups. Uneven baseline characteristics might partly explain why patients assigned to active treatment had a larger reduction in lesion size than did patients assigned to placebo.24 Many antimycobacterial agents show activity against M ulcerans in vitro, and experiments in animals, such as the mouse footpad model, show that streptomycin in combination with rifampicin is highly bactericidal. In a pilot study sponsored by WHO, 31 patients clinically diagnosed with pre-ulcerative M ulcerans infection were treated with streptomycin and rifampicin for 0, 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks.25 All lesions were excised; M ulcerans infection was confirmed by PCR in 21 cases. In ten patients who were treated for 2 weeks or less, viable bacilli could be isolated from excised tissues, whereas M ulcerans could not be cultured from tissue taken from I I patients who were treated for 4 weeks or longer. Lesions either reduced or stabilised in size in all patients.25 On the basis of these findings, preliminary guidelines were issued by WHO recommending streptomycin in combination with rifampicin as standard treatment for M ulcerans infection, with or without additional surgical debridement or skin grafting.26When our study was designed, clarithromycin was believed to have only bacteriostatic activity in vivo. 327 We assessed the efficacy of antibiotic therapy with oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin given for 8 weeks for treatment of early M ulcerans infection in patients from Ghana. This regimen was compared with rifampicin and streptomycin given for 4 weeks, followed by an oral combination of clarithromycin and rifampicin for 4 weeks. Our aim was to identify an effective alternative treatment to extensive surgical debridement, and to explore possibilities to keep the use of injectable antimicrobial treatment to a minimum. Methods Participants The study design was partly based on discussions within a WHO expert group on Buruli ulcer that took place between 200 I, and 2003. Between April, 2006, and January, 2008, patients were recruited at two sites (Nkawie-Toase Government Hospital, Nkawie, and Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, Agogo) in Ghana. Patients clinically 31 Chapter 2 diagnosed with M ulcerans disease were recruited by active case finding. Patients were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 5 years or older, had a reported disease duration of less than 6 months, and had lesions with a cross-sectional diameter (indurated area) of IO cm or less. M u/cerans infection was confirmed by IS2404 dry-reagent- based PCR.28 Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, drug in-tolerance, and renal, hepatic, and acoustic impairment. The protocol and consent forms were approved by the Committee on Human Research, Publication, and Ethics of the School of Medical Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi (CHRPE/07/01/05), and by the Ethical Review Committee of Ghana Health Services (GHS-ERC-0 I /0 I /06).The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen, Netherlands, reviewed the protocol before ethics clearance in Ghana.Written and verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants aged 12 years or older, and from parents, carers, or legal representatives of participants aged 18 years or younger. Procedures After participants had given informed consent, we obtained demographic and clinical information and took blood samples. We undertook pregnancy tests in female participants aged IO years or older, and hearing tests in all participants (AS208 portable equipment; lnteracoustics,Assens, Denmark) to obtain baseline audiometric data. HIV antibody testing was done with cold-stored sera after completion of the study. Lesions were photographed and traced onto acetate sheets. Three 3 mm punch biopsy samples were taken under local anaesthesia; two swabs of ulcerated lesions were also taken. All samples were transported to the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine laboratory in Kumasi, Ghana, for done on Lowenstein-Jensen slopes at 32\u00b0C.13 One punch biopsy was reserved for histopatho logical examination. Participants started streptomycin ( I 5 mg/kg once daily intramuscularly) and rifampicin (IO mg/kg once daily orally) after the diagnostic procedures. After assessments and start of treatment at the hospital, most participants were treated as outpatients. Once a week, participants were given study drugs to take to the nearest health facility to receive directly observed treatment (DOT) for the subsequent days, with daily wound care. Only participants that had extensive oedema or lesions at difficult sites (joints, eye, or genitalia), or lesions with suspected secondary infection were admitted to hospital; participants who could not receive DOT or wound care at 32 Should antibiotics be given for Buruli ulcer? home were also admitted to hospital. DOT was recorded on forms by the health\u00ad care worker or helper who was observing the treatment. Participants were followed up at weekly intervals during the first 8 weeks. At these visits, clinical assessments and digital photographs were taken, DOT forms were checked, and participants were invited to report any adverse events. Once every 2 weeks, the size of the lesion was traced onto an acetate sheet and blood cell counts were taken; we also undertook liver and kidney function tests and hearing tests in all participants, and pregnancy tests in female participants aged IO years or older. Randomisation and masking Before the end of week 4, participants with M u/cerans infection confirmed by PCR were randomly assigned to receive streptomycin intramuscularly and rifampicin orally for 4 more weeks group) or rifampicin and clarithromycin (7 \u00b7S mg/kg once daily), both orally, for another 4 weeks (4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin group). Randomisation was done with minimisation for study site and type of lesion (ulceration or no ulceration).The study coordinator (WAN) forwarded the information of every enrolled participant by mobile telephone text messaging to a statistician OPS) at the Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, Netherlands. There, a computer -generated randomisation program was used, and the randomly assigned allocation was then sent by text message to the study coordinator. Individuals who were clinically diagnosed with M ulcerans disease but who did not have confirmation by PCR continued treatment with streptomycin plus rifampicin and were not randomised; these individuals were followed up and analysed separately.This was an open-label trial. Follo w-up and study outcomes After 8 weeks of antimicrobial treatment, missed doses were not supplemented. Participants were followed up at week IO and week 12 after start of treatment, and then monthly to week 36, and bimonthly to week 52. Study visits included clinical assessment with reporting of adverse effects, measurement of lesion size (if not healed) by tracing onto an acetate sheet, and photography of the lesion. Participants' travel costs were reimbursed and small monthly incentives (sugar, condensed milk, and cocoa powder) were offered for time spent in the study. Treatment failure was recorded if a participant's lesion had not healed by week 52, lesion recurrence occurred within I year, or lesion size increased to I 50% or more at any timepoint compared with baseline with surgical debridement undertaken as deemed necessary by the attending doctor in the hospital. The investigators who 33 Chapter 2 took measurements of the lesions were not masked to treatment assignment. The attending doctor in the hospital making the final decision for extensive surgical debridement was unaware of treatment allocation. Removal of necrosis and slough is part of normal wound care and skin grafting speeds up heeling but does not affect bacterial load. These interventions were therefore not regarded as evidence of treatment failure. The primary clinical endpoint was lesion healing (complete re-epithelialisation) at I year after the start of treatment without recurrence or extensive surgical debridement. Secondary outcomes were time to wound healing and time to complete wound coverage by a crust. Daily sterile dressings were only applied at the health facility if lesions were open and discharging. Before final healing occurs, lesions might turn dry with a crust. At this stage, participants could cover the lesions for protection at home, without visiting the health facility to receive wound care and sterile dressings. Since participants reported this stage of wound healing as beneficial, we also measured time to complete wound coverage by a crust without complete re-epithelialisation as a secondary endpoint. The safety outcome measure was occurrence of adverse events. Statistical analys is When the study was designed, there was no information available about healing rates for the proposed regimens; therefore, we assumed a healing rate of 80% in the 8-week streptomycin group.We calculated that a sample size of 148 randomised and fully assessable participants (74 in each group) would be needed to detect a difference in healing rate of 20% or more (<60% in the 4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin group) with a one-sided alpha of O -05 and a power of 80%. We calculated an odds ratio for the primary clinical endpoint by use of Fisher's exact test. Because secondary outcome data were interval-cen sored, we analysed the cumulative incidence of healing by use of actuarial life table analysis and weighted log\u00ad rank tests for interval-censored data, in particular the group proportional hazards model29 and a generalised Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test,30 which emphasises early events. We calculated the exact permutation p value for the scores of the group proportional hazards model and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and the non\u00ad parametric maximum likelihood estimate of the survival distribution function.31 Other secondary outcome measures were assessed by actuarial life table analysis.All analyses were by intention to treat. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 16.0, R version 0.7-5.5, and Stata version I 0.1. An independent data safety monitoring board reviewed the data for safety purposes 34 Should antibi otics be given for Buruli ulcer ? after inclusion of 57 and I 15 participants. Interim reports were discussed at the annual WHO meeting on Buruli ulcer in Gene va in 2007 and 2008, and presented at the 2008 com bined ICAAC/IDSA Ann ual Meeting in Washington, DC, USA.32 After the trial had been com pleted, two independ ent wound experts from University Medical Centre Gronin gen, who were masked to treatm ent assignment, assessed the primary study endpoint (heal ing at I year) using the digital photograp hs of the lesions taken during the trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalT rials.gov, numb er NCT0032 1178. Role of the funding source The spon sors of the study had no role in study design, data colle ction, data analysis, data interpr etation, writing of the report, or in decisions about submis sion of results for public ation. The corres pondin g author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibil ity for the decision to submit for publ ication. Results Figure I shows the trial profile. 180 eligible patients started treatm ent. 26 patients with suspected but unconfi rmed M ulcerans infection received streptomyc in and rifampicin for 8 weeks. Of 151 participants who were enrolled and randomised, eight had a clinical diagnosis with out confirmation of M ulcerans infection by PCR. Five of these eight participants had infection later confi rmed by one or more e, one; participants did not have diagnos is confirmed by any test. Table I shows baseline char acteristics of study participants. Lesions were more frequen tly seen on the right side of the body (64%) than on the left side (36%; p<0 -000 I ).Thr ee (2%) participants were HIV positive; these individuals had initial lesions and clinical prese ntati ons that were indiscer nible from those of HIV-negative participants. One participant in the 8-week streptomyc in group withdr ew from the study at week 6. In the 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarith romycin group, two participants moved out of the study area and were lost to follo w-up (week 32 and 36) and one participant, who later tested positive for HIV infection, died in week 16 of urosepsis. Since these four participants had healed lesions at their last assessment, they were included in the analysis for the prima ry clinical endp oint and in the analyses for time to heali ng. 35 Chapter 2 250 patients screened I 70 ineligible 18 lesion too large ... 16 too young ... 7 pregnant 2 hearing impairment 7 recurrent disease 20 doubtful diaJ!:nosis and PCR and AFB ne2ative .. 26 with clinical disease but without PCR confirmation* ... ,r 154 enrolled and started on treatment I 3 withdr ew/lost before randomi sation I I non-compliant ,, 151 randomised 143 with infection confirmed by PCR 5 confirmed with infection by other method$ 3 without confirmation of infection 76 assigned to streptomycin 75 assigned to streptomycin and rifampicin and rifampicin for 8 weeks for 4 weeks followed by rifampicin and clarithromycin for 4 weeks H I withdrew (in week 6)\u00a7 I died (in week I 6)t\u00a7 1---. 2 migrated (in week 32 and week 36)\u00a7 ,r ,, 76 assessed for primary endpoint I 75 assessed for primary endpoint Figure I: Trial profile AFB=acid- fast bacilli. *Patients not enrolled but given 8 weeks of treatment with streptomyc in and rifampicin. tParticipant died of cause unrelated to M u/cerans infection. $See text for details. \u00a7Healed at time of last assessment, included in the final analysis. 36 Should antibiotics be given for Buruli ulcer?

We obtained consistent findings when the four participants who were not followed up to week 52 were excluded from the analysis and when two wound experts masked to treatment assignment assessed the primary endpoint by use of photographs available at the different timepoints ( data not shown). Table 3 shows the actuarial life table for cumulative proportion of healing. The estimated cumulative proportion of patients healed at week 52 was O -99 (95% CI 0 \u00b794-1 -00) -024 to O -091) between groups. Figure 2 shows the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimates for healing in the intention-to-treat population. Neither the group proportional hazards model (p=O \u00b726; 99% CI O \u00b756--0 -64) showed a significant difference in time to healing between gr oups. The group proportional hazards model suggested a shorter time to healing in the 8-week streptomyc in group whereas the Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney test suggested that time to healing was shorter in the 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin group.Adjustment for study site and type of lesion (ulceration or no ulceration) did not affect the results (data not shown). Five participants received skin grafts, four in the 8-week streptomyc in group (at week 16, 24, 24, and 28), and one in the 4-week streptomy cin plus 4-week clarithromycin group (at week 20). Time to healing of category I lesions (median 18 weeks, 95% Cl 14-22) was significantly shorter than that for category II and Ill lesions (30 weeks, 95% Cl 26-34, p=O -002; data pooled for the two treatment groups; five participants with skin grafts not included).Time to complete wound coverage by a crust was also significantly shorter for category I lesions than category II and Ill lesions ( 14 weeks, 95% Cl had vestibulotoxic events, one in the 8-week streptomyc in group (aged 49 years, starting after 7 weeks of treatment) and two in the 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin group (aged 24 years and 38 years, starting after 4 weeks and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively) .Analysis of digital photographs showed that three participants had mild to moderate functional limitations at the end of the study: one had a contracture with substantial decrease in range of movement of the thumb and index finger (4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin Buruli ulce r? group); two had ulcers on the back of the hand and wrist that resulted in claw-hands ( one in each group). No liver or kidney function test abnormalities or audiological deterioration occurred that necessitated termination of streptomyc in treatment. One participant developed an injection abscess (4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin group) and two (both in the 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin group) developed an abscess close to the initial lesion which was incised and drained.

Some participants had additional diagnostic tests not specified in the protocol. Table 4 shows the characteristics of the five participants in whom M u/cerans was isolated by culture after treatment; all were in the 4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin group. Three of these five participants had treatment failure: in two, surgical debridement was done; in the third, multiple nodules ulcerated successively over 52 weeks before final healing. Two participants had lesion healing without further intervention within the study period. Discussion Our study has shown that early, limited M ulcerans infection can be safely and effectively managed by antimicrobial treatment alone, without surgical debridem ent. The drug regimen proposed by WHO, consisting of 8 weeks of streptomyc in and rifampicin, seemed effective and was not associated with deterioration requiring subsequent surgical debridem ent. Treatment with oral clarithromycin plus rifampicin 44 Should antibiotics be given for Buruli ulce r? during the second 4-week period resulted in similar outcomes to continuation of treatment with streptomycin and rifampicin. Our findings are important for patients with M ulcerans infection who live in remote, resource-poor areas in West Africa, where people often need to walk for several hours to reach health-care facilities, skilled personnel are scarce, and patients tend to refrain from treatment because of fear of surgery. Our results also support the use of antimicrobial treatment in individuals who are unable to receive streptomycin--eg, pregnant women or those who cannot tolerate aminoglycosides. With few reported side-effects, the treatment regimens used in this trial seemed well tolerated, although vestibulotoxicity remains a concern. The rate of lesion recurrence in our study at 52 weeks was lower than that reported in retrospective studies assessing the effect of surgery, in which rates of between 6% and 47% were reported.20-22 Time to healing was a median of 18 weeks for category I lesions and 30 weeks for larger lesions. The length of this healing period might have obscured the potential of antimicrobial treatment in earlier studies that either looked at healing after 2 months,24 or assigned participants to surgery when early healing was not seen during follow-up.23 HIV was not an important confounder; most case-control studies from West Africa report a low incidence of HIV in patients with M ulcerans infection.3334 One strength of this study is the large proportion of participants ( 147 of 151) who were followed up to week 52. Second, most participants ( 148 of 15 I) had laboratory\u00ad confirmed M u/cerans infection, which contrasts with previous trials that were partly undertaken before PCR-based diagnostic confirmation tests were available.2324 Finally, the sample size in our study was substantially larger than that in earlier studies. A potential weakness of our study is the open-label design. However, masking would have substantially increased costs, and a trial in which children can be assigned to placebo injections is not justified for safety reasons. Moreover, although only one injection abscess was recorded, intramuscular injections in rural Africa are not the preferred option Another limitation of our study is that no formal external monitoring was done. However, limited auditing was organised. Additionally, consistent results were obtained when two wound experts who were masked to treatment assignment reviewed all digital photographs available at the different timepoints. We therefore believe that the study was robust. One concern is that healing took a fairly long time.Additionally, we could not address the issue of prevention of disabilities in a formal way, although our analysis of digital photographs combined with clinical assessment showed that only three participants had mild to moderate functional limitations at week 52 (all three involving hand function). Contractures and functional limitations are common in ulcers that are 45 Chapter 2 close to joints.11 Future studies should assess prevention of disabilities, include all categories of lesions, and investigate oral drug regimens. Thus, antimicrobial treatment is highly effective for treatment of early, limited M u/cerans infection, and the number of intramuscular injections of streptomycin can be reduced without compro mising efficacy.

Grosset Chemother . 20 IO Sep;54(9):3 878-83 Chapter 3.1 52 Sum mar y In a randomized controlled trial in Ghana, treatment of Mycobaeterium u/cerans infection with streptomycin (SM)-rifampin (RIF) for 8 weeks was compared with treatment with SM-RIF for 4 weeks followed by treatment with RIF-clarithromycin (CLA) for 4 weeks. The extent of the interaction of RIF and CLA combined on the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds is unknown in this population and was therefore studied in a subset of patients. Patients received CLA at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg of body weight once daily, rounded to the nearest 125 mg. RIF was administered at a dose of IO mg/ kg, rounded to the nearest 150 mg. SM was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once daily as an intramuscular injection. Plasma samples were drawn at steady state and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with the MW/Pharm (version 3.60) program. Comedication with CLA resulted in a 60% statistically nonsignificant increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for RIF of 25.9 mg h/liter (interquartile ratio [IQR], 21.9 to 31.5 mg h/liter), whereas the AUC of RIF was 16.2 mg h/liter (IQR, 15.0 to 17.6 mg h/liter) in patients comedicated with SM (P = 0.09). The median AUCs of CLA and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin ( I 4OH-CLA) were 2.9 mg h/ liter (IQR, 1.5 to 3.8 mg h/liter) and 8.0 mg h/liter (IQR, 6.7 to 8.6 mg h/ liter}, respectively. The median concentration of CLA was above the MIC of M. u/cerans, but that of I 4OH-CLA was not. In further clinical studies, a dose of CLA of 7.5 mg/kg twice daily should be used (or with an extended-release formulation, 15 mg/kg should be used) to ensure higher levels of exposure to CLA and an increase in the time above the MIC compared to those achieved with the currently used dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily. Clarithro mycin for Burul i ulcer Introduction Although many antimycobacterial agents appeared to be effective against Mycobacterium ulcerans infections in in vitro and in animal models (4, 11, 27, 30), clinical evidence of the effective ness of antimicrobial treatm ent was predominantly based on a small study conduc ted with patients in Ghana ( 15). Conc eivab ly, using antimycobacterial agents results not only in preve nting bacilli from replicating and killing microorganisms but also in halting the production of the toxin mycolacto ne (36 ).This toxin that causes the tissue damage is produc ed by enzymes encoded by the pMU M00 I plasmid (33). Current WHO recommen dations suggest 8 or more weeks of treatment with rifam pin (RIF) plus streptomyc in (SM) for all clinical forms of active Buruli ulcer disease (BUD). Daily injections with streptomyc in are problematic, as most patients live in remote areas with limited health care facilities. Proper hygiene with these injections, as well as intrinsic ototoxicity and renal toxicity, is a concern. Ther efore, an oral treatm ent schedule is urgently needed to reduce the numb er of injections and to improve the tolerabil ity and safety of the proposed regimen. Pregnant women might also benefit from treatm ent without am inoglycosides. This problem was addressed by comparing 8 weeks of SM ( 15 mg/kg of body weight) and RIF (IO mg/kg) treatment (SSR arm) and 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifam pin treatment followed by 4 weeks of RIF plus clarithromycin (CLA; 7.5 mg/kg) treatment (4SR/4CR arm) in a randomized contr olled trial (the BURULICO trial) (26). CLA was chosen for inclusion in the treatment regimen because of in vitro data suggesting that this drug is active against M. u/cerans, for which the Ml Cs range from 0.125 to 2.0 mg/liter (30). In a pharmacokinetic (PK) study with adults who received doses of 500 mg twice daily , plasma CLA conce ntrations (5) were well above the MIC for most M. u/cerans isolates. The clinical effectiveness of macr olide s is onl y partly explained by pharmacokinetics, because these drugs typically accumula te in inflamma tory cells, especially macropha ges, at the site of infection (I). Although M. u/cerans infection has long been regarded a predominantly extracel lular infection (20), evidence has emer ged from animal models that M. u/cerans infection has an intracellular stage in which it multiplies inside macropha ges ( I 0, 34). These data taken togeth er suggest that the intramacr ophage CLA concentra tion might add to the beneficial effect of the drug to fight M. u/cerans infection and that CLA might exert its effect inside these immune cells without reaching inhibi tory drug conce ntrati ons in the bloodstream. On the other hand, if plasma CLA concent rations do not reach inhibi ting or mutant -inhibiting concen trations, at least in the extra cellular space where bacilli are present during later stages of the disease, inadvertent monotherapy with RIF 53 Chapter 3.1 alone would result. At the time that the present study was designed, the activity of the 14-hydroxyclarithromycin ( I 4OH-CLA) metabolite against M. u/cerans was unknown, and sensitivity to I 4OH-CLA therefore had to be determined. In mycobacterial infections, monotherapy has invariably resulted in the failure of treatment, as drug-resistant pathogens within the total microbial load might escape and repopulate the diseased lesions in the host (9). RIF is known to induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( e.g., CYP 3A4, involved in the elimination of CLA), while CLA is also known to inhibit the enzyme activity of CYP 3A4 (3, 18). The P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux transporter is also affected, as RIF induces and is the substrate of Pgp and CLA inhibits Pgp (7, 14). Earlier studies with patients with M. avium infections showed an induction of metabolism of CLA, but the data on I 4OH-CLA were not consistent between the two studies (28, 37). The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of this CLA-RIF interaction on the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) for the 4SR/4CR study arm and to compare thoseAUCs to theAUC for RIF in patients who were treated in the 8SR study arm. In addition, the average time that plasma drug concentrations were maintained in excess of the MIC was studied. Materials and methods The open-label prospective pharmacokinetic study described here evaluated the pharmacokinetics of RIF and RIF combined with CLA in the treatment of Mycobaeterium ulcerans disease in patients already enrolled in the BURULICO trial. The study was conducted at the Nkawie-Toase Governmental Hospital and at the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, both in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Study sub jects Patients IO years of age (male and female) were eligible for inclusion in this side study to assess the pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and rifampin when they were allocated to the 4SR/4CR arm and the pharmacokinetics of rifampin when they were allocated to the SSR arm. Exclusion criteria for the BURULICO trial were treatment with macrolide or quinolone antibiotics, antituberculosis medication, or immunomodulator y drugs (including corticosteroids) within the previous I month; current treatment with any drugs likely to interact with the study medication, e.g., anticoagulants, cyclosporine, phenytoin, oral contraceptives, and phenobarbitone; a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin, streptomycin, and/or clarithromycin; and an 54 Clarithromyc in for Buruli ulcer inability to take oral medication or the presence of a gastrointestinal disease likely to interfere with drug absorption. Drug administration Patients received CLA at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily, which was rounded to the nearest 125 mg. RIF was administered at a dose of IO mg/kg, which was rounded to the nearest 150 mg. The drugs were administered on an empty stomach, but the participants were allowed to take a light standardized breakfast after drug ingestion. Although food intake does not influence the AUC of CLA (8), it influences the AUC of RIF (39). By offering a standardized light breakfast approximately 30 min after drug ingestion, the effect on drug absorption would be minimized and equally distributed over both groups.The adherence to the treatment regimen was I 00%, as the participants were in a guided patient program. Pharmac okinetic assessment On the day of this PK study, a full pharmacokinetic curve was recorded at steady state after a minimum of 7 days of consecutive treatment with the same dose. Blood samples (2 ml, EDTA anticoagulant) were obtained before a dose of CLA-RIF or RIF was administered (time zero) and at 0.5, I, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 7.5, and IO h after administration of the dose. This schedule was based on earlier data ( 17, 29), with the restriction that the participants in the present study had to be able to return to their homes (often, in remote rural villages) on the evening of the sampling day. Plasma was separated and frozen at 20\u00b0C until it was processed. Analytical methods The plasma concentrations of RIF and 25-desacetylrifampicin (25DA-RIF) and of CLA and I 4OH-CLA were determined at the Laboratory for Clinical Toxicology and Drugs Analysis of the Department of Hospital and Clinical Pharmacy of the University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands, using a validated liquid pharmacokinetic parameters calculated using the KINFIT program (MW/Pharm, version 3.60; Mediware, Netherlands) (31 ). C!IUlZ was defined as the highest observed serum concentration, and Tmax was the time corresponding to C . C . was the serum concentration before intake of the dose. The AUC from max m,n time zero to 24 h (AUCo.-24) was calculated using the log-linear trapezoidal rule. 55 Chapter 3.1 The elimination half-life (t112) was calculated by 0.693/ke,. The apparent clearance of the drug (CUF) was calculated as the dose/AUC0--24, and the apparent volume of distribution (VIF) was calculated as the dose/concentration at steady state. For both treatment groups, a population one-compartment model with first-order absorption pharmacokinetics with lag time was generated using the RIF dose, the body surface area of the participants, and the observed RIF serum concentrations in an iterative two-stage Bayesian procedure (31 ). Pharmacokinetic parameters were assumed to be log-normally distributed. Residual error was assumed to be distributed normally with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.1 + (0.25 x q, where C is the serum rifampin concentration. Since the participants received RIF only orally, bioavailability could not be assessed and was fixed at a value of I, as the bioavailability of RIF is nearly complete. Bacteriologic assessment The Ml Cs of CLA and I 4OH-CLA were determined by the agar proportion method on Middlebrook 7H I I agar 6.6 supplemented 0% oleic acid-albumin\u00ad dextrose-catalase. For both drugs, 2-fold concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 8 mg/ml were tested using two different strains of M. u/cerans: strain I 059, a recent human isolate from Ghana (38), and strain 1615 (ATCC 35840), a well-characterized Malaysian human isolate ( 16). The strains were subsequently passaged in mice in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. These reference strains instead of test isolates from our patients were used, as isolation of M. ulcerans by culture has a very low yield (21 ). Bacillary suspensions adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0 were diluted to I o-s in phosphat e-buffered saline; and 0.5 ml of each of the I 0-1, I 0-3, and I o-s dilutions was inoculated onto plates with and without drugs. The plates were then incubated at 32\u00b0C, and the colony counts were read 2 and 3 months later.The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration inhibiting 99% of the colony counts on the control plates. Statistical methods Data are presented as median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Differences in age, body mass index, and the values of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the patients groups were assessed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test) for unpaired data.A sample size of IO was estimated to be needed to detect peak CLA concentrations of >0.5 mg/liter in 80% of the patients with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 5%.A sample size of five was estimated to be needed to detect a 20% increase in the RIF concentrations in the presence of CLA 56 Clarith romycin for Buruli ulcer compared to the RIF concentrations in the group treated with RIF and streptomycin with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 5%. Ethics The present study was a side study of a randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT0032 I 178).As for the main study protocol, written and verbal informed consent was obtained from participants of IO years and over and from their custodians if they were below 18 years of age. The protocol for the present study was also approved by the local institutional ethics committees of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Only individuals over age IO years were eligible for participation in the present study. All study participants gave informed consent after being given an appropriate amount of time to consider their participation; a small incentive in cash and kind was offered, and for participants aged between IO and 18 years, their parents or caretakers also gave written informed consent. Results Study sub jects Thirteen patients ( 12 females and I male) were included in the present study: 8 were in the 4SR/4CR arm and 5 were in the SSR arm. The baseline age, body weight, and body mass index characteristics were similar for the two groups. The patient characteristics are presented in Table I. Twelve of 13 patients had Buruli ulcer lesions, as confirmed by 1S2404-based PCR (21 ). The Buruli ulcer lesions of these 12 patients were completely reepithelialized within the time frame of the study (healing without a recurrence within I year after inclusion). The one unconfirmed lesion-a nodulin a patient treated with SSR was excised 2 weeks after the end of treatment because another diagnosis was suspected. After excision, that patient also tested 1S2404-based PCR positive. Bacteri ologic assessment The MICs of CLA were 0.25 mg/liter and 0.50 mg/liter for M. ulcerans I 059 and M. ulcerans 1615, respectively. The MICs of I 4OH-CLA were 4 mg/liter and 8 mg/liter for M. ulcerans I 059 and M. ulcerans 1615, respectively. For both strains, the MIC of I 4OH-CLA was 16 times higher than that of CLA. 57 Chapter 3.1 Pharma coki netic study The patients in both study arms received the same dose of RIF per kg of body weight.The patients in the 8SR study arm received RIF at a dose of 8.8 mg/kg (IQR, 8.6 to I 0.0 mg/kg) once daily , which was not significantly different from the RIF dose of 8.8 mg/kg (IQR, 8.4 to I 0.8 mg/kg) administered in the 4SR/4CR study arm (P = 0.70). The patients had received the study medication for a median duration of 50 days (IQR, 29 to 55 days) before blood samples were drawn.The RIF concentration\u00ad time curves of both arms are displayed in Figure I . The CLA concentration-time curve is displayed in Figure 2. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two treatment arms are summarized in Table 2. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.09), the median increase in theAUC0--24 value for RIF was 60% if theAUC0--24 of 25.9 mg h/liter (IQR, 21.9 to 31.5 mg h/liter) for the patients in the 4SR/4CR arm was compared to the median AUCa-24 value of RIF of 16.2 mg h/liter (IQR, 15.0 to 17.6 mg h/liter) for patients in the BSR arm. 25DA-RIF could be detected in only 5/ I 3 patients.The geometric mean AUC ratio of CLA to I 4OH\u00ad CLA was 0.33 (range, 0.22 to 0.39). Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that apparent clearance of RIF was (not significantly) reduced in patients who also received CLA but was due to interpatient variability in both groups (P = 0.17) (Table 3).The median AUC/MIC ratio of RIF was 52 (IQR, 44 to 63) in patients treated with CLA as well, which was 63% higher (P = 0.09) than the median AUC/MIC ratio of 32 (IQR, 30 to 35) in patients treated with RIF and SM.

Clarith romycin for Buruli ulcer Discussion The present study investigated the interaction between RIF and CLA in patients infected with M. u/cerans as part of a prospective randomized trial comparing two drug regimens. We obse rved that the median total RIF expos ure was increased 60% in patients receiving CLA compared to that in patients receiving RIF combined with SM.This may be explained by the inhibitory effect of CLA on the Pgp-med iated efflux of RIF and not by the inhibitory effect of CLA on CYP3A4, as RIF is not a CYP 3A4 subs trate. Our study had a relatively small sample size.and due to the high degree of variability in the results, only a trend toward significance could be shown.Al though the difference was not significant in our study , it might still be relevant for clinical practice, as the increased exposure to RIF could have contributed to the efficacy of the drug treatment because the RIF AUC/M IC ratio is one of the best parameters predicting the efficacy of treatment of infections caused by Mycobaeterium tuberculosis (23). No differences in the concentr ation of 25DA- RIF were seen between the treatment arms. Due to the low of level expos ure of 25DA-RIF in plasma, no addit ional bact ericidal effect can be expected. The only effect of this metabolite may be expected in hu man bile, in which it tends to accumula te (22). The effect of RIF on CLA is more difficult to ex plain, as the present study lacked a study arm without RIF. We obser ved that the level of exposure to I 4OH-CL A was significantly higher than that to CLA.The medi an I 4OH-CL A conce ntration-ti me curve (Fig. 2) is higher than the median CLA concen trati on-time curve for the time period observed. This indicates that the metab olism of CLA to I 4OH-CL A is induced by RIF, as the I 4OH\u00ad CLA conc entrati on-time curve is higher than the CLA concen trati on-time curve. This is consis tent with the findin gs of earlier studies (28, 37).The ratio of the parent drug to metabolite is, however , less than that reported earlier (28). The results of our study are in line with the obser vations of the interaction of CLA and rifabutin (RBN), which has been studied in volunteers infected with HIV. Rifabutin, like rifam pin, induc es Pgp and the CYP 450 system, but less profoundl y than RIF does (2). In the present study , the CLA -RBN interaction resulted in a significantly decreased AUC for CLA compared to that before the introduction of RBN, but the I 4OH-CL A concen tration increased significantly alon g with a significant increase in RBN drug concen trati ons ( 19). Our results are cons istent with earlier data that the ratio of the C of CLA to the max Cmax of I 4OH- CLA is reduced to a greater extent when CLA is combined with RIF (28) than when RBN is combined with RIF (37) and no ind ucer is coadministered. The major concern in the case of these drug-drug interactions is that the resulting 61 Chapter 3.1 antibiotic exposure is not efficacious due to the altered plasma concentrations. The decrease in CLA levels must therefore be compensated for by the increase in I 4OH\u00ad CLA level and can be expressed as the ratio of the CLA level/ I 4OH-CLA level. Whether the observed ratio is sufficient for efficacious treatment depends on the in vitro susceptibility of the targeted microorganism to both CLA and I 4OH-CLA. In our study we observed that the concentr ation of CLA in plasma was above the MIC of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/liter for M. u/cerans for a median period of at least 120 to 248 min.As the MIC for 14OH-CLA was 4 to 8 mg/liter, it was presumed that only CLA contributed to the bactericidal activity of the agent, as the level of exposure to I 4OH-CLA was always below the MIC. In other bacterial infections, CLA can be efficacious if the concentration is above the MIC for some part of the dosing interval (I). The time above the MIC for CLA therefore seems to be less important than it is for, e.g., beta-lactam antibiotics and is difficult to correlate with efficacy (I). In addition, the plasma concentration of CLA does not necessarily reflect its intracellular bactericidal efficacy, as efficacy depends on the distribution of the antibiotic into the tissue and cells (6). Although the CLA concentration in the interstitial fluid of the skin might be lower than that in plasma (35), the concentrations of CLA in cells are expected to be higher than those in plasma (32). The present study was limited by the fact that neither the distribution of the antibiotic into the tissue and cells nor the concentration in the interstitial fluid of the skin was determined. On the basis of the results of the BURULICO trial, both CLA and RIF exposures appeared to be sufficient for the treatment of M. u/cerans infection, as no significant difference (one-sided Fisher's exact test, P = 0.16) in the healing rate was observed between the 8SR (96%) and 4SR/4CR (91 %) arms (26). As 5 of the 75 subjects treated with CLA appeared to be positive for M. ulcerans as a result of the non-protocol-driven testing of samples by culture, there are still some doubts about the total antibiotic exposure.Although the coadministration of RIF resulted in a lower level of CLA exposure, it should be mentioned that CLA was given at a low dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily. During the design of the randomized controlled trial, concerns about the safety of CLA at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice daily resulted in the use of this dosage scheme. On the basis of these clinical results, it might be hypothesized that RIF was effective in reducing the M. ulcerans bacterial load or at least stopping mycolactone production, while CLA prevented the emergence of microorganisms resistant to RIF (25). The contribution of CLA is uncertain, however, and measuring the intracellular concentrations CLA would be the best method to assess the combined extra\u00ad and intracellular exposures of M. ulcerans to CLA. Animal (mouse) model studies 62 Clarithrom ycin for Buruli ulcer of M. ulcerans infection have evaluated only the correlates between dosages and the bacteriolo gical response and clinical effects, especially in the footpad model ( I I, 12, 24). Future animal studies should address PK aspects, along with these clinical and bacteriological responses, to develop PK/pharmacodynamic models for the prediction of outcomes. Table 3.

In further clinical studies, a regular CLA dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice daily or a CLA slow\u00ad release formulation at a dose of 15 mg/kg once daily should be used to ensure higher levels of exposure to CLA and increase the time above the MIC compared to those achieved with the currently used dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily, which appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Conclusion Combination of RIF and CLA resulted in a considerable but nonsignificant increase in plasma RIF levels compared to the RIF levels achieved with coadministration of RIF and SM.A decrease in plasma CLA levels and an increase in plasma I 4OH-CLA levels were observed, but the time that the concentrations of CLA in plasma were above MIC of M. ulcerans was reached for at least a part of the day.

Some concerns about the use of clarithromycin in Buruli ulcer need discussing. Treatment failure was higher in the 4-week streptomycin plus 4-week clarithromycin group than group. Mycobacterium spp carry many macrolide resistance traits in their chromosomes and can confer high resistance to clarithromycin after exposure to similar classes of drug.2 One study in a mouse model revealed that, when given at a daily dose of I 00 mg/kg ( equivalent to I g per day in human beings), clarithromycin had an obvious bacteriostatic activity: the growth of M ulcerans in mice treated with clarithromycin was significantly delayed compared with that in control mice. 3 However, since the activity was not bactericidal, one may question the potential practical value of clarithromycin in the treatment of M u/cerans infection in human beings.The high rate of treatment failure in the 4-week clarithromycin group in Nienhuis and colleagues' study could reflect this limitation. Moreover, it is now generally accepted that a major protective antigen present in the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is the so-called Ag85 complex which has 84% sequence identity and 91 % similarity with M u/cerans Ag85A proteins.4 Logically, then, BCG-vaccinated patients should recover more quickly from Buruli ulcer than non-vaccinated individuals.

Protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding antigen SSA from Mycobaeterium bovis BCG against Buruli 69: 5403-1 I . 71 Chapter 3.2 We appreciate and to a large extent share the concern of Dewan Billal about the role of clarithromycin in the management of Buruli ulcer disease.Although patients who switched to oral treatment with rifampicin and clarithromycin had a statistically similar beneficial response to treatment, assessment of the added effect (if any) of clarithromycin is impossible. Indeed, presently the duration of therapy necessary to switch off mycolactone production and allow the immune system to recover and clear residual bacteria is unclear. Basically, we added clarithromycin to include an oral drug that was tested in vitro' to prevent monotherapy with rifampicin and to limit the number of streptomycin injections. During the trial, in-vivo data were published that supported this choice.2 We used a dose of 7 \u00b75 mg per kg bodyweight, once daily, as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Our concern was that rifampicin co-medication might lower clarithromycin plasma concentrations by inducing cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Preliminary data from a substudy suggest that clarithromycin drug concentrations are lower than the 14-hydroxy metabolite of clarithromycin.3 Further more, preliminary results suggest that this metabolite does not con tribute to the antimicrobial activity against M u/cerans. Yet the median concentration of clarithromycin was above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)-between O \u00b75 and 2-0 mg/L for most M u/cerans strains tested.4 One should also consider accumulation of macrolide drugs in immune cells that might add to the clinical response seen, but the relatively short time above MIC for extracellular microorganisms is a concern if we are to consider testing a fully oral treatment schedule. Although we did not examine BCG scars in our study participants, most children in Ghana receive BCG vaccination in the first week after birth; the protection by BCG vaccination is short-lived and rather weak.5 BCG vaccination status is therefore unlikely to present a bias for the beneficial effect of antimicrobial treatment in both study groups. Eventually, a fully oral treatment would be highly desirable. Before a trial is undertaken, an extended-release formulation of clarithromycin combined with rifampicin, approved by the FDA and EMA, should first be tested.With this information, we can select the best possible rifampicin-based combination regimen for oral treatment, and compare it with the present WHO-standard regimen of 8 weeks of streptomycin injections plus rifampicin. We declare that we have no conflicts of interest. 72 Author reply Tjip University Groningen, PO Box 30 00 I, 9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands (TvdW, WN, JWA, YS); and Johns Univers ity, Baltimore, MD, USA (DA) Refer ences Bentoucha A, Robert J, Dega H, Lounis N, Jarlier V, Grosset J.

In vitro 9-26 Chapter 4 Summary Background Antimicrobial killing in mycobacterial infections may be accompanied by (transient) clinical deterioration, known as paradoxical reaction. To search for patterns reflecting such reactions in the treatment 1 of Buruli ulcer (Mycobaeterium ulcerans infection), the evolution of lesions of \u00b7I 76 patients treated with antimicrobials was prospectively assessed. Methods The lesion size of participants of the BURULICO antimicrobial trial (with lesions s IO cm cross-sectional diameter) was assessed by careful palpation and recorded by serial acetate sheet tracings. Patients were treated with antimicrobials for 8 weeks. For the size analysis, participants whose treatment had failed, had skin grafting, or were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus were excluded. For every time point, surface area was compared with the previous assessment. A generalized additive mixed model was used to study lesion evolution. Nonulcerative lesions were studied using digital images recording possible subsequent ulceration. Results Of 151 participants, 134 were included in the lesion size analysis. Peak paradoxical response occurred at week 8; over 30% of participants showed an increase in lesion size as compared with the previous (week 6) assessment. Seventy-five of 90 (83%) of nonulcerative lesions ulcerated after start of treatment. Nine participants developed new lesions during or after treatment.All lesions subsequently healed. Conclusions After start of antimicrobial treatment for Buruli ulcer, new or progressive ulceration is common before healing sets in. This paradoxical response, most prominent at the end of the 8-week antimicrobial treatment, should not be misinterpreted as failure to respond to treatment. Clinical Trials Registra tion ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0032 I 178. --\u00b7\u00b7 a devastating mycobacterial disease [1-3]. It is the third most common mycobacterial infection in immuno\u00ad competent humans after tuberculosis and leprosy, and BU even outnumbers these infections in some areas in West Africa. Although most commonly seen in children, all age groups can be affected. It starts as a nodule, papule, plaque, or edema. If progressive, the skin breaks down and a typical painless ulcer appears with a necrotic center and undermined edges, surrounded by an indurated area. Surprisingly few patients present with accompanying systemic responses such as fever and malaise, even though ulcers may cover a substantial part of the body. Treatment, until recently, has been wide surgical excision of affected skin and surrounding normal tissue. In the past, antibiotics have been largely abandoned on the basis of disappointing field observations [4]. In a pilot study with antimicrobial end points, combination therapy with streptomycin and rifampicin was effective, and subsequent case series showed a beneficial clinical response [S, 6]. In the BU RU LICO trial we showed that early, limited BU lesions heal with antimicrobial treatment alone, without surgical debridement, in .90% of cases [7]. An additional 3 reports have supported the beneficial effects of antimicrobial therapy, 2 of them including larger lesions as well [8-1 O]. In tuberculosis and leprosy, effective antimicrobial killing may be accompanied by (transient) clinical deterioration [ I 1-13]. In these diseases the deterioration is known as a paradoxical or a reversal (type I) reaction.A paradoxical reaction in tuberculosis is defined as a transient worsening of a preexisting lesion or the development of new lesions under appropriate therapy-some definitions incorporating initial improvement -affecting 2.4%-10% of individuals at time point 8-10 weeks (median) after start of treatment [ 12, 14, IS]. The incidence of paradoxical reactions, which has also been described in intracerebral tuberculomas [ 12, 16], is probably highest in lymph node tuberculosis [11, 17].These reactions have been attributed to increased exposure to mycobact erial antigens, a decrease in suppressor mechanisms, or improved host cell-mediated immunity following bactericidal therapy [ I I, IS]. In the BURULICO trial [7], participants were followed up by anal yzing serial surface area measurements of lesions and by digital imaging. Here we describe and compute responses compatible with a paradoxical reaction. 77 Chapter 4 Methods Study subjects In the present analysis we included a subset of participants of the BURULICO drug trial, a randomized controlled trial for the treatment of early (duration <6 months}, limited (cross-sectional diameter s IO cm) M. ulcerans infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the planned confirmation test for M. u/cerans infection, which was achieved in 95% of all participants. We compared 8 weeks of treatment with streptomycin and rifampicin, with 4 weeks of treatment with streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin. The primary outcomes of this trial have been reported elsewhere [7]. To study the lesion evolution during effective antimicrobial treatment, defined as healed by week 52, participants whose treatment had failed, had skin grafting, or were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were excluded. Treatment failure was recorded if a lesion had not healed by 52 weeks, lesion recurred within I year, or lesion size increased to 150% at any time point compared with baseline, with surgical debridement undertaken as deemed necessary by the attending doctor.The trial was conducted at 2 different hospital sites in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Study des ign To determine the pattern of healing in response to antimicrobial treatment, lesions were examined by inspection followed by careful palpation.The lesion circumference, as assessed by the above methods, was recorded on serial acetate sheet tracings, and digital images were made of each participant's lesion. Participants were treated for 8 weeks and followed up for I year after start of treatment. Acetate sheet tracings and digital images were made at start of treatment, and at week 2, 4, 6, 8, I 0, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44, and 52, until complete healing (defined as complete reepithelialization) occurred. For participants with more than I lesion, only the largest was measured. Methods of mea surements The members of the BU study teams that drew the lesions were instructed to palpate the extent of the indurated area around the visible skin defect and to include this induration in the tracing. Before treatment was started, from every non-ulcerated lesion 3 3-mm punch biopsies were taken under local anesthesia for diagnostic confirmation, including culture, microscopy, PCR [ 18], and histopathology. From ulcerated lesions, in addition to punch biopsies, diagnostic swabs were taken [7].The acetate sheet recordings were disinfected and stored in the patient record files. At 78 Resp onse patterns to drug treatme nt of Buruli ulcer the end of the study all sheets were scanned, and the surface area was calculated for every individual lesion at the different time points, using Adobe Photos hop (version CS3 Extended). Digital camera images were uploaded and stored in anonymized patient folders. Anal ysis of data Results of participants of the 2 antimicrobial regimens were taken together, as no significant differences were found for overall healing (healing at I year after start of treatment without recurrence or large debridem ent surgery) and time to healing. To precisely evaluate the effect of treatment, ongoing healing was recorded by comparing every lesion measurement to the preceding assessment and arranging them in I of 3 groups: (I) lesion size increased compared with last assessment, (2) size decreased compared with last assessment, and (3) lesion healed. Results were plotted over time. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) analysis [ 19] was used to create best-fitting curves for mean rate of healing over time, with allowance for group-specific and subject-specific smooth deviations and missing values. GAMM is a fixed-effects regression model with random-effect terms in addition to the fixed effects and with unknown smooth functions of some of the covariates making it appropria te for analyzing clustered-and therefore dependent\u00ad data sampled over time, with missing values and with a nonlinear course (smooth) of the dependen t variable with time. As basis functions, the truncated powers basis with 14 knots was used, with 90% confidence intervals (Cls) based on a bias-adjusted approximation of the covariance matrix. Lesions that were not measured because they were larger than the sheets used for drawing were analyzed as \"previous size measurement +I.\" Type of treatment combination, ulceration, and lesion category at inclusion were explored as possible influencing factors on lesion evolution. Category I comprises lesions <5 cm, category II lesions between 5 and IO cm, and category Ill lesions >IO cm, multiple lesions, or lesions at critical sites. Several definitions of a paradoxical increase in surface area were depicted and percentages of participants were calculated meeting these criteria for every time point and for the overall study period.The percentage of participants with non-ulcerative lesions that subsequently ulcerated was calculated. Data were analyzed and figures drawn using SPSS software (version 16.0, IBM SPSS) and R software (R version 2.13.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and Package Amer (additive-mixed models with lme4, R package version 0.6.10). 79 Chapter 4 Ethics The Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands, reviewed the protocol of the trial. The protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research, Publication, and Ethics of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi (CHRPE/07/01/0 5), and by the Ethical Review Committee of Ghana Health Services (GHS-ERC-0 I /0 I /06). Written and verbal informed consent or assent was obtained from all participants aged :2:: 12 years, and consent from parents, caretakers, or legal representatives of participants aged 18 years.

Overall, I 05 of 134 participants (78%) showed an increase in lesion size compared with the preceding assessment, at some point in time. Increase in lesion size in excess of size at start of treatment was recorded in 40 of 134 participants (30%). Increase in lesion size in excess of 150% was recorded in 19 of 134 participants ( 14%). According to the protocol, these 19 participants were discussed with the attending medical staff for possible debridement surgery, but as the overall clinical assessment was not unfavorable, with decrease in wound depth, edema, and necrosis, they were not operated on. Overall, healing was steady but slow. Table 2 shows the percentages of participants who met various exploring criteria that defined paradoxical responses in the pattern of healing. For example, when using an increase in surface area after a decrease in the preceding measurement, approximately 16% of participants met the definition at week IO (measured at weeks 8 and I 0) and week 12 (measured at weeks IO and 12). Using the stricter criterion of 2 consecutive increases after I decrease, 7.5% of participants met the definition at week IO (measured at weeks 6, 8, and I 0). 82 50 I 40 ! 30 I i 20 E treatment of Buruli ulcer category I - category II and Ill .. 10 20 30 40 50 week figure 3: Generalized additive mixed model analysis for mean lesion surface area, for lesion category subgroups (with smooth subject-specific deviations from group specific curves; see text for details).

Non-ulcerative lesions with subsequent ulceration before healing and new lesions Ninety-two of the 151 participants in the BURULICO anti-microbial trial had non\u00ad ulcerative lesions. From these, 2 had treatment failur e and 2 were HIV co-infected. Of the remai ning 88 participants, 15 ( 17%) never had ulcerati on; they subsequently healed.The other 73 (83%) developed ulcers after a med ian period of 6 (interquartile range, 2-8) weeks but none thele ss healed subseque ntly (Table 3). Sixteen of these 73 participants developed the ulcer after comp letion of antimicrobial treatment. Some participants reported increase of pain at the lesion site just before and at the time the lesion ulcerated. Disease -confi rmin g punch biop sies were taken from at least I lesion of all include d participants before start of treatment. Yet some participants had > I lesion ( only the largest lesion had a biop sy taken) or developed new lesions durin g or after treatme nt. Eleven participants had a total of 16 non-ul cerative lesions that were not biop sied. Ulcer ation likewise occu rred in 15 of 16 lesions that did not have earlier punch 83 Chapter 4 biopsies; all of these lesions healed after the ulceration. One lesion was excised in a non-ulcerative state. Thirteen of 151 participants (9%) had > I lesion at any point in time. Four participants had > I lesion at start of treatment. In 5 participants, the second lesion became apparent during antimicrobial treatment. From 4 of these participants, swabs were taken at time of ulceration; 2 were microbiologically confirmed to be M. u/cerans lesions- I by PCR and I by microscop y. In 4 participants the second lesion appeared after treatment completion; I of these also developed a third lesion. From 4 of these 5 lesions, swabs were taken when the lesion ulcerate d; 2 were confirmed by PCR and I by culture.All of these lesions, except for I that was excised, ulcerated spontaneously and healed subsequently without further intervention.

We show that during and shortly after anti-mycobacte rial treatment for BU, 23% (using 2 consecutive measurements with an increase after I measurement with a decrease) to 78% (using I measurement) of lesions increased in size, and 83% of non-ulcerated lesions progressed to ulcers. Six percent of the participants enrolled developed lesions that were not clinically present at start of treatment. Eventually, all of these lesions healed within a follow-up period of I year. The number of lesions that increased in size compared with the previous assessment peaked at weeks 8, I 0, and 12-just at the end of the 8-week treatment period. Paradoxical reactions in tuberculosis seem to appear around the same time [ 14, I 5]. Our results indicate that in BU, paradoxical reactions may be more common. It might also be thatlthe frequency of paradoxical reactions is comparable but more apparent in BU, because it affects the skin. Two studies that specifically looked at lymph node tuberculosis, in which paradoxical reactions are more objectively measurable than in pulmonary tuberculosis, reported transient enlargements in approximately 25% [ I I, 17], comparing more favorably with our results for BU.A recent publication on the efficacy of streptomycin combined with rifampicin in a study in Ghana also describes paradoxical responses, but not in the same frequencies as we describe [8]. Earlier observations in BU that lesions progress during antimicrobial treatment may have been misinterpr eted as lack of antimicrobial killing. Two reports from Australia have suggested that paradoxical reactions in BU occur [20, 21 ]. In a trial in Uganda, the study drug, clofazimine, was probably not active; therefore, possible paradoxical reactions cannot be evaluated [22].The paper, however, provides unique information on placebo-treated individuals-and those on clofazimine -that healed by virtue of their protective immune response without active drugs or surgery. Although participants had no disease confirmation, the spontaneous healing rate was 11 of 34 participants (32%). In participants with non-ulcerated lesions who received placebo, IO of I I participants progressed to ulcers before spontaneous healing occurred. In a drug trial for BU in which 2 months of rifampicin and dapsone were compared with placebo, lesion size was measured at 4 and 8 weeks after start of treatment [23]. Our results suggest that these time points may not be optimal to assess clinical success. 85 Chapte r 4 Table 3: Ulceration of non-ulcerative Mycobacterium ulcerans lesions after start of treatment in ultimately healed participants. Week New ulceration, No (%) 2 24 (27.3) 4 11 (12.5) 6 10(11.4) 8 12 (13.6) 10 7(&0) 12 7(&0) 16 2 (2.3) No ulceration 15 ( 17) Of 88 healed, non-human immunodeficiency virus-infected participants with a nonulcerative lesion at start of treatment, ulceration occurred in 73 (83%) at a median time of 6 weeks after start of treatment (25th-15th percentiles: 2-8 weeks). We hypothesize that the transient clinical deterioration of lesions seen in our study is a result of restoration of local and systemic immune responses [24-2 7]. The lesions that appeared and healed spontaneously during and after treatment probably reflect an inflammat ory response as well; the live microbe s-or microbial antigens of dead bacilli-already present in tissue initially failed to elicit a host immune response. Mycolactone, the exotoxin produced and secreted by M. u/cerans, has been proposed as the major cause of immune suppression [24, 26-29]. The immunosu ppressive signature appears to wane over time following effective antimicrobial treatment [30, 3 I], and we hypothesize that the pro-inflammatory response we describe as paradoxical response coincides with the wash-out of mycolactone from the lesion. This study is limited by the fact that 4 7% of participants missed at least I of the 15 scheduled assessments. The highest numbers of missing measurements occurred at weeks IO and 12, the time points that showed the highest increases in surface area. This means that the number of participants with paradoxical patterns might be larger than described. By using a GAMM, we were able to include participants with missing data in the analysis. Another limitation is that measuring surface area of Buruli ulcers, which have an undermined edge and often a large indurated area, is difficult and not validated. A certain percentage of measurements will show an increase in surface area at the subsequent drawing, only by chance. However, stricter definitions (eg, ;a:2 consecutive measuremen ts of increase in lesion size after an initial decrease) confirm paradoxical evolutions after start of treatment. We considered the possibility that the punch biopsies for disease confirmation may have elicited ulceration. We conclude from our study that ulceration is a common stage in the pattern of healing. Other lesions that were present at start of treatment 86 Response patterns to drug treatment of Buruli ulcer or appeared during or after treatment, and that were not biopsied, ulcerated as well. We assume that the ulcerative stage reflects the natural cour se of disease and is not necessarily related to the biopsy procedure. Isolating live M. u/cerans from such an ulcerating nodule does not necessarily imply failure of treatment. In the original report of the BU RU LICO trial [7], we described a patient who developed a nodule 8 weeks after treatment comp letion. This nodule ulce rated 6 weeks later , and M. ulcerans was cultured from this lesion. This lesio n healed without further interv ention. In conclusion, we describ e new and progressive ulceration and appearance of new lesions in M. u/cerans infection, reflecting paradoxical reacti ons follo wing antimicr These reacti common occu rred during and after antimicr obia l treatment.W e show evidence from the literature that they mirror an enhanced host immune response. The time cour se might be compatible with arrest in production and gradual decrease of mycolactone concentra tions in lesio ns, and possibl y systemic ally, with restorati on of the local and syste mic host immun e responses against mycobacterial antigens that were first suppr essed by mycolacto ne. The evolution of lesions after start of antimicr obial treatment could be detected by careful obser vation, avoidin g early referral for surgery . Further studies are requir ed to impr ove our under standing of mycolactone kinetics over time and to link such data with host response patte rns. Paradoxical reac tions in BU may earlier have gone unrecognized and been misin terpr eted as failure to respond to treatm ent.A precise definition of paradoxical response would be welcomed, before a clinical decision rule can be developed to differentiate this entity from treatment failure.

In the context of a trial with a potentially ototoxic drug (the aminoglycoside streptomycin), we assessed the validity and test\u00ad retest reliability of audiomet ric monitoring with battery-powered portable equipment. Methods For validity testing, readings of a portable conventional pure\u00ad tone audiometer (AS208; lnteracoustics, DK-5610 Assens, Denmark) were compared with readings of fixed, standard equipment, both in a sound-proof setting. In a field study the intra-and inter-observer reliability were tested. Results For comparison of standard and portable equipment, at least 96% of the repeated measurements in the 0.5 to 4 kHz range were within I 0 dB. For intra-and inter-observer comparisons, at least 94% and 96% of the repeated measurements in the 0.25 to 4 kHz range were within IO dB.At 6 and 8 kHz, repeatability was less. Mean ambient noise was high [SO dB(A)]. Concl usions To pick up changes in hearing (>IO dB) over time as a result of interventions, audiometric check-ups in the field with portable equipment are feasible, and reliable in the 0.25 to 4 kHz range.Absolute deviations from reference values should be interpreted with care, taking into account ambient noise. As aminoglycosi de-induced ototoxicity (AIO) affects frequencies higher than 4 kHz first, early detection of AIO with portable audiometry in the field is limited. Streptomycin ototo xicit y screening in the field Introd uction Hearing impairment is a problem worldwide.The WHO global estimate for disabling hearing impairment using a deficit >40 dB in the better ear in adults and > 30 dB in children, has more than doubled between 1995 and 2005, from 120 million people to at least 278 million people (reference note I). Of all deaf and hearing-impaired people, 80% live in low-and middle-income countries, and the number of children with hearing impairment is increasing [I]. Among the many causes of hearing impairment, acquired causes are more common in the less affluent rural communities [2,3]. Hearing impairment may be related to infections and treatment of infectious conditions. Aminoglycoside antimicrobial treatment has been an important cause of ototoxicity, especially among elderly patients with treatment of longer duration [ 4-1 O]. Some individuals are extremely vulnerable to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity (AIO) and have idiosyncratic toxicity due to mutations in the I 2S subunit of ribosomal mitochondrial RNA [ I I]. Several different mutations in this mitochondrial gene are associated with AIO, the most important being the A 1555G and 961 mutations [7,9, 12]. Up to 33% of patients with AIO may have such mutations. Information from African populations, where aminoglycoside use is more widespread than in any other continent, is left with a description of AIO within a South African family, associated with the A 1555G point mutation [13]. In Ghana, drugs were involved in only <2% of the causes of hearing impairment [2]. Because genetic testing identifies only individuals with idiosyncratic toxicity, and because pre-treatment genetic testing is not available, phenotypic testing must be used to demonstrate ototoxic effects [ 14]. Audiometry has been recommende d for this purpose [5,9]. For most inhabitants of rural areas in developing countries, facilities to test hearing are not accessible. There are only a few otorhinolaryngology and audiology centers with soundproof audiometry facilities.The challenge is to provide audiometry services to reliably identify and refer subjects with impaired hearing for further investigation, treatment and/or counseling. Pure-tone audiometry using portable equipment has been used in less affluent areas in Africa [15, 16].Although pure tone audiometry has been tested for reliability in standard conditions with low ambient noise [ 17-19],it has not been tested for reliability under field conditions. Pure tone audiometry is basically subjective, but it appears to be reliable in cooperative subjects under controlled conditions [20]. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the validity of pure-tone portable audiometry equipment by comparing readings in sound-proof conditions with standard equipment at the ENT department, Komfo-Ano kye Teaching Hospital, Ghana; and (ii) 95 Chapter 5 to determine intra-and inter-observer reliability of pure-tone portable audiometr y in the 0.25 to 8 kHz frequency range in a rural hospital setting. In addition, we specifically related our results to ototoxicity screening, as pursuing reliable screening for possible AIO in the field was the initial reason for designing this study. Methods Study participants Study participa nts for validity testing of the portable equipment were recruited among out-patients attending the ENT Department (head: GKA) and the tuberculosis unit of the Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi. Participants in intra-and inter-observer reliability tests were recruited at two rural hospitals in the Ashanti Region, Ghana -Nkawie-Toase Governmental Hospital and Agogo Presbyterian Hospital. Most of these study participants were Buruli ulcer patients who were also included in the BURULICO drug trial comparing 4 or 8 weeks of the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin as part of different drug combinations (trial registration number NCT0032 I 178) [21]. For this drug trial the participants had to undergo audiometry regularly, and these assessments were integrated in the present study. Most of the drug trial study participants were between 5 and 15 years of age. Older participants were recruited from the ward, most of them admitted because of tuberculosis treatment. Participants were enrolled prospectively, in a consecutive order, during times the study team was present. Recruitment was done between August, 2006, and November, 2006. For all tests, persons with a deficit of >90 dB hearing level (HL) for the worse ear and children under 5 years were excluded. Persons who were uncooperative or had difficulty in communicating were also excluded. Most of the volunteers did not speak English but rather Twii; English-T wii interpreters assisted by giving instructions during the instruction period and whenever necessary. Validity testing, standar d versus portable equipme nt, KAT H The equipment at the ENT department of Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital was chosen as reference standard, being the only available audiometry facility in the region. In the sound-proof room of the ENT department, one observer (GO: a trained audiology assistant) tested each individual study participant twice, using both fixed standard equipment and the portable equipment, in random sequence. 96 Strep tomycin ototoxicity screening in the field Intra- and inter-observer reliabili ty, field studie s For intra-observer reliability testing, participants were tested twice by the same observer (MMC: a Dutch medical student). For inter-observer reliability three different observers (MMC, WT and EA) performed the measurements by forming three different observer-pairs. Each participant was tested twice, one time by each of the observers of one observer-pair. The second observer was blinded to the results of the first observer. The sequence of the observers within the pairs was alternated to prevent sequence effects. The test room at Nkawie-Toase Governmental Hospital was an office in the public health department. In Agogo Presbyterian Hospital two test rooms were used. One was an isolation ward and the other was a room next to the consulting rooms near the outpatient department. Instrumentation In the audiometry unit in the Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital standard, fixed equipment was used (Kamplex AD27 Calibrated to ANSI (S3.6 -1969) standard) for comparison with the portable equipment. The portable equipment consisted of full-range air conduction diagnostic audiometers, a model I nteracoustics AS 208 Type 4 tone audiometer (for details and serial numbers see reference note 2 and 3) and matched circum-aural earphones with noise reducing Pelter mute cushions for air conduction. This equipment is powered with rechargeable batteries and designed for hearing testing in schools, industry, and primary care facilities. The audiometers were calibrated to ISO64, with biological calibration performed at frequent intervals. Ambient noise levels were measured with the Quest electronics model 2700 impulse sound level meter (for details see reference note 4), using slow meter response in A filter weighting. Since the human ear is not uniformly sensitive to all frequencies, this filter gives a weighted frequency response simulating the human ear. Audi ometry tests MMC was instructed and trained at the Otorhinolaryngology Department,Audiology Unit, at the University Medical Centre of Groningen; EA and WT were instructed by MMC; at the Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital, the trained audiology assistant (GO) tested the participants. The protocol for the present validity and reliability study was tested before study participants were enrolled. Both ears were tested, the right ear first. Only this audiogram was used for analysis, since testing the second ear of a participant would be influenced by the experience of the first ear already tested. Pure tone hearing level thresholds were obtained for each participant. Frequencies 97 Chapter 5 were tested in the following order: I, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0.5 and 0.25 kHz, using descending levels of intensity. Testing started with presenting a loud tone. From this level the intensity was decreased in steps of 5 dB until the tone was not heard anymore. The last tone still heard was the level of audibility of the first test run.Then the intensity was increased with IO dB before being decreased again in steps of 5 dB, until the tone was no longer heard (the second test run). If the results of the two test runs were not identical, the process was repeated until two identical levels of audibility were found. This level was considered the hearing threshold. Thus each frequency was tested at least twice. At the Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital, a different protocol was used, following local practice; thresholds were measured with ascending levels of intensity, starting at O dB. From this level the intensity was increased in steps of 5 dB until the tone was heard. This frequency was the level of audibility of the first test run. Then the intensity was decreased with IO dB before being increased again in steps of 5 dB, until the tone was heard again (the second test run). If necessary, the process was repeated until two identical levels of audibility were found. The same frequency order was used, and after studying the other frequencies, I kHz was re-tested. The portable audiometer is limited to a maximum of I 00 dBHL. 'No response' would be recorded as a I 05 dB hearing threshold.At least one hour, but no more than half a day (morning to afternoon), was scheduled between the first and the second test. No treatment was administered in between. Ethics The Committee on Human Research, Publications and Ethics, School of Medical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology, Kumasi, approved the study protocol and the consent procedure. From all participants > 12 years informed consent was obtained; parents, guardians or caretakers gave informed consent for all participants < 18 years. Information was provided about the purpose of the study and the extra time it would take to participate. Prospective participants were told that neither their enrolment in the study nor their refusal or withdrawal to participate would affect their health or treatment in any way.They were informed that the tests were an evaluation necessary for the study itself, and that the tests were not done because of suspected pathology. They were offered appropriate time to consider participation.A signature or a thumbprint confirmed verbal consent, as most of the participants were illiterate.All participants were offered a small incentive (food products). Travel costs were reimbursed. 98 Strep tomycin ototoxicity screening in the field Defi nitions In conventional audiometry, hearing impairment is classified by a pure-tone average of hearing thresholds over frequencies 0.5, I, 2 and 4.0 kHz as follows: slight ( 16 -25 dBHL), mild (26 -40 (41 severe (56 (71 -90 or profound (>90 dBHL) in the better ear [22]. An important concern about assessing hearing levels in the field is the influence of ambient noise. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has addressed this problem and specified maximum permissible ambient noise levels allowed in an audiometric test room to ensure that hearing thresholds obtained down to O dBHL will not be elevated due to masking by ambient noise. Maximum permissible ambient noise levels when testing in the 0.25 to 8 kHz frequency range, using a supra-aural earphone, are as follows: 39 dB at 0.125 kHz, 25 dB at 0.25 kHz, 21 dB at 0.5 kHz, 26 dB at I kHz, 34 dB at 2 kHz, 37 dB at 4 kHz and 37 dB at 8 kHz [23]. Data analysis and reporting For the validity study as well as the intra-and inter-observer studies, Bland and Altman plots were made [24].These plots are designed to show differences between two measurements over their range. For each participant two measurements were available for each frequency tested.The difference between these two measurem ents was calculated per frequency, as well as the mean of these two measurements, per frequency. Thereafter a plot was made per frequency for the validity study as well as the intra-and inter-observer studies, of the differences between the two measurements (vertical axis) against the mean of these two measurements (horizontal axis). Then the mean of all plotted differences and the standard deviation of this mean difference were calculated per test frequency, as was the percentage of measurements within a 5 and a 10 dB difference between the two tests, per frequency. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between the paired measurements for the three test locations (for the intra-observer reliability study), and for the three tester-pairs (for the inter-observer reliability study) for each frequency. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows\u00ae. We used the format as reflected in the STARD statement (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) to ensure appropriate and comprehensive reporting [25]. 99 Chapter 5 Results Overall, the plots for the validity and reliability studies showed no consistent relation between the mean of the repeated tests and the differences. This implies that the differences in hearing level observed in the two measurements did not vary in any systematic way depending on the (mean) level of hearing. The mean difference of the paired measurements was close to zero for all of the frequencies, i.e., the first measurement did not systematically affect the second. No ceiling effects were found; all of the participants had responded before reaching I 00 dBHL, the highest presentation level of the portable machine. Amb ient noise measurements The mean ambient noise in Agogo Presbyterian Hospital was 50 dB(A) (range 49 - 53 dB: 5 measurements); the mean ambient noise in Nkawie-Toase Governmental Hospital was 47 dB(A) (range 43 -49 dB: 12 measurements). In Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital no ambient noise was measured. Validity testing, stand ard versus portable equipm ent, KAT H For the validity study, 47 participants were included; 51 % of the participants were female. The age ranged from 5 to 79 years (median 36; IQR 29 to 45 years); 92% of the participants tested underwent the hearing test for the first time in their life. Mean hearing thresholds in this group (using the mean of the first and the second measurement for every participant) were 24, 28, 27, 26, 28, 34 and 32 dBHL for 0.25, 0.5, I, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz respectively. Figure I shows a plot of the differences between the fixed equipment and the portable equipment against their mean at I kHz. Such a plot was made for each test frequency. Table I summarizes the differences between the fixed and the portable equipment per frequency tested (kHz). One outlier, resulting from a test session with an elderly person, was ignored.Additionally, the mean differences, the SD of the differences and the percentage of difference falling within 5 and IO dB are presented in table I. In brackets, results are given including the outlier. The percentage of differences falling within 5 and IO dB also include the outlier. In the range 0.5 to 4 kHz, 96% of repeated measurements were within IO dB.At higher and lower frequencies, differences were larger. 100 .Strep tomycin ototoxicity screening in the field 20,-------------------, ca 15 ... 10... 5- 00 o -\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\"Oeoo\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7'O\"\u00b7\u00b7 80 100 mean of test and retest (dB) n Os 07 06 0 3 0 2 1 Figure I: Plot example of test-retest differences against their mean.

Intra-obser ver reliability, field study In Nkawie-Toase Governmental Hospital and Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, 51 participants were included; 60% of the participating volunteers were female. Median age was 23 years (IQR 9 -42 years); 34% of the participants tested underwent the hearing test for the first time in their life and the same percentage for the second time. Mean hearing thresholds in this group (using the mean of the first and the second measurement for every participant) were 22, 26, 25, 22, 23, 30 and 23 dBHL for 0.25, 0.5, I, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz respectively . One younger participant was withdrawn from the study during the assessments for not being able to cooperate. Figure 2 shows a plot of the differences between the two testing sessions of the observer against their mean for I kHz. Such a plot was made for each test frequency. Table 2 summarizes the differences between the two measurements of the observer, per frequency. Additionally the mean differences, the SD of the differences and the percentage of differences falling within 5 and IO dB are presented in table 2. Here, 94% of repeated measurements were within IO dB in the range 0.25 to 4 kHz. No significant effect of test location on the differences between paired measurements was found (p>0.

Inter-observer reliabilit y, field study In Nkawie-T oase Governmental Hospital and Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, 52 participants were included; 50% of the participants were female, median age 27 years (IQR 16 -47 years); 70% of the participants did the hearing test for the first time. Mean hearing thresholds in this group (using the mean of the first and the second measurement for every participant) were 20, 23, 23, 22, 25, 28 and 24 dBHL for 0.25, 0.5, I, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz respective ly.As for validity and intra-observer reliability studies, plots were made of the differences between the two testing sessions against their mean for each frequency. Table 3 summarizes the differences between the two measurements of an observer-pair, per frequency; here, two outliers were ignored. These outliers resulted from a test session with a 50 year old and a 9 year old participant. In addition, the mean differences, the SD of the differences, and the percentage of differences falling within 5 and IO dB are presented in table 3. In the range 0.5 to 4 kHz, 96% of recordings were within IO dB. In brackets, results are given including the outliers. The percentage of differences falling within 5 and IO dB also include the outliers. No significant difference was observed between the three different observer pairs in the differences of the paired measurements (p>0.3 for all of the test frequencies), and no significant effect of previous experience with the test on the difference between paired measurements was found (p>O. I for all the test frequencies). 104 Streptomyc in ototo xicity screening in the field Discussion Though pure-tone audiometry using portable equipment has been used in rural Africa, this is the first formal reported evaluation of audiometry using portable equipment in field conditions in less affluent countries. This study shows that the validity and the reliability of the portable audiometer were satisfactory, especially in the 0.25 to 4 kHz frequency range. At 0.25, 0.5, I, 2, and 4 kHz intra-observer test-retest repeatability was within IO dB for at least 94% of the measurements, and inter-observer test-retest repeatability was within IO dB for at least 96% of the measurements.At higher frequencies ( 6 and 8 kHz), measurements were less reliable. In clinical conditions, a pure-tone threshold measurement at a single frequency has a 90% chance to be repeated within IO dB of the first measurement, assuming that no real change in hearing thresholds has occurred [20].Though formal reliability studies of field portable audiometry have not been reported, Robinson ( 1991) examined audiometric repeatability in an industrial setting, in which the hearing level threshold at a single frequency was found to have a chance of 90% to be repeated within IO dB, even after an interval of several years [26].As part of a large national epidemiological study, Lutman et al. ( 1989) compared a manual and a computer controlled method [27].The thresholds measured were at 0.5, I, 2 and 4 kHz. Standard deviations of the test-retest differences with a 2 to 3 years interval were provided, and were similar to those found in our field study.Ambient noise levels were not measured.Altho ugh the test conditions, which were not ideal, were close to the current study, the time lapse between tests was considerably longer. With more time lapse between tests, SDs will become larger [28].Authors of both studies concluded that shifts were due to random measurement error rather than actual shifts in hearing thresholds. In another study where a group of individuals with sensorineural hearing impairment and a group of healthy individuals were tested twice, within two weeks, in standard sound proof conditions, SDs were lower than in the current field study [29].The short interval between the tests was similar to this field study.The sound-proof conditions were not comparable. SDs in the normal and the cochlear-impaired group were equivalent. Table 4 and figure 3 show the SDs of the described studies together with those of the current study. For all studies, highest SDs were seen in the 6 and 8 kHz frequencies. Generally, reliability of conventional pure-tone audiometry decreases at higher frequencies.At these frequencies, a different positioning of the earphones has a higher influence on changes in the ear canal resonance, and therefore results in a higher variability [30,31 ]. 105 Chap ter 5 - 9 -a 8 ......., C \u00b7,.:; 6 \u00b7s;: -a 5 -a C 2 0.25 \\ I I \\ I I \\ P....IJ. ), / .._..., , ' I ........ -a; 0 0 ... ,' I I 0.5 1 2 4 8 freque ncy (kHz ) * Lutman Jerlvall O Robinson inter obs. + intra obs. Figure 3: SDs ( dB) of the in the text described inter-observer studies together with the SDs of the present intra-and inter-observer reliability study. The reliability of hearing level thresholds measured with circum-aural earphones in the 0.5 to 16 kHz frequency range was evaluated by Schmuziger et al [ 18]. At each individual frequency in the 0.5 to 8 kHz test frequency range, test-retest repeatability was within IO dB for at least 99% of the measurements. SDs were not provided.That study was performed in sound-proof conditions, and this probably explains why the repeatability in the current field study was less. Besides the ambient noise levels, other factors like differences in educational level might in part explain differences in study results. The mean age of the participants was similar to the mean age of the participants in our study. This study has several limitations. The fairly high levels of ambient noise measured in the current field studies may have caused variability to become larger. Ambient noise levels were variable within one test session but also between test sessions, so the ambient noise did not cause a systematic error and therefore does not present a source of bias, but merely caused a reduction in precision. This means that levels of hearing impairment might be overestimated, but that changes over time can be reliably detected. Secondly, although the influence of this factor was kept as small as possible by starting with a short period of practice, the differences in experience of study participants might have affected test results. For intra-observer testing, 66% of the participants had done the test before; for validity and inter-observer testing only 8% and 30% respectively had done the test before. Although statistically we could not show this, and the Bland and Altman plots did not confirm a learning curve from the first to the second test, lack of experience with the test can be one of the 106 Streptomycin ototox icity screening in the field causes of the observed difference in test validity, intra-, and inter-observer reliability results. Apart from ambient noise and experience, variation in response strategy, motivation, attention and intelligence of the participants may influence test reliability. Most participants were young, and they clearly had difficulty concentrating.

To pick up changes >IO dB over time as a result of interventions, audiometric check-ups in the field with portable equipment are feasible, and reliable, especially in the 0.25 to 4 kHz range. As AIO affects frequencies higher than 4 kHz first, this study implies that early detection of AIO with portable audiometry in the field is limited. Absolute deviations from reference values should be interpreted with care, especially in relation to ambient noise. For this, studies comparing field and clinical audiometry are needed.

Methodology/ principal findings In a case-contr ol study we sought confirmation of our earlier finding that susceptibility to M ulcerans disease is associated with certain polymorph isms in the SLC I I A I gene. We also investigated polymorphisms in the MBL2 and the VDR genes because of their association with tuberculosis and leprosy. Because of its association with tuberculosis, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured to explore a possible relation to disease status. 179 Ghanaian M ulcerans patients and 180 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls were included. Susceptibility to develop M ulcerans disease appeared not associated with any of the polymorphisms studied. Serum vitamin D concentrations were lower in patients, compared to controls (65.9 vs 73.0 nmol/L; p<0.00 I). Conclus ions/Sign ificance In this sample size with a different ethnic background (i.e., other tribal origins than the previous study), we were unable to confirm the association with SLC I I A I gene polymorphisms for M u/cerans disease. We found a significantly lower vitamin D blood concentration in patients as compared to control subjects. This finding might either reflect increased consumption of vitamin D by cells of the immune system at the site of infection, or less likely, decreased exposure to sunlight resulting from covered skin or inability to participate in farming and other out-door activities, due to M u/cerans disease. 114 Genetics and vitamin D in Burul Author summa ry Buruli ulcer disease (Mycobacterium u/cerans infection) is a disabling, neglected disease, emerging around the world and notably in sub-Saharan Africa. Like tuberculosis and leprosy, environmental and inherited factors determine whether or not clinical disease follows after infection. We studied three genes, associated with tuberculosis and leprosy, among Buruli ulcer patients and matched healthy controls.We could not confirm our earlier finding of a strong association between polymorphisms in the SLC I I A I gene and Buruli ulcer, nor for the other genes (MBL2 and VDR) studied. The majority of our Buruli ulcer patients were immigrants from Northern Ghana who had farms in the Buruli ulcer-endemic area where our study was conducted. Perhaps a difference in genetic background compared to the previous study explains why this time we found no genetic associations. Vitamin D is important in the defense against mycobacterial infection such as tuberculosis. Vitamin D is essential for the production of the anti-mycobacterial peptide cathelicidin.We found lower serum vitamin D concentrations in Buruli ulcer patients compared to control subjects. We speculate that consumption of vitamin D at the site of infection might explain this. This new finding could be important in finding ways to improve disease management. Introd uction Buruli ulcer disease (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection) is an indolent, ulcerating and devastating disease of the skin [ 1,2]. If not diagnosed and treated early, it carries the risk of leaving patients with severe and permanent functional limitations [3]. It is the third most common human mycobacteriosis in immunocompetent individuals after tuberculosis and leprosy [4]. In the last decades Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) is emerging in dramatic numbers in sub-Saharan Africa. With an incidence in some areas surpassing that of tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli ulcer has an immense social and financial impact on individuals and on the public health system [S]. The WHO selected BUD as one of nineteen neglected tropical diseases [6]. Having its endemic places mostly in tropical countries in remote areas, Buruli ulcer is called a disease of the poor. Children are more often affected than adults.The mode of transmission and reservoir of the disease are yet unknown [7], but are not restricted to the tropics alone;Australia being the second continent burdened by this disfiguring disease [8]. There is no evidence for important person-to-person transmission. 115 Chap ter 6 Serological studies show that only a small proportion of M ulcerans infected individuals develop clinical disease [9, IO]. For tuberculosis and leprosy it is known that genetic predisposition plays an important role in the chance of developing disease [ I 1-14]. Support for this idea came from observations of familial clustering, high concordance rates in identical twins and clear racial differences in the risk of developing disease. Like in tuberculosis and leprosy, the genetic influence on developing disease is likely to be complex, with several different genetic polymorphisms playing each a limited role to explain the variance observed in the population at risk. Earlier, our group reviewed possible genetic host susceptibility factors for BUD, relevant in other mycobacterial diseases [IS]. Based on a limited sample of cases and healthy control subjects living in an endemic region in Ghana, it was shown that carrying the heterozygous GA genotype of the D543N polymorphism in the SLC I I A I (formerly Nramp I) gene may be associated with an increased risk of developing BUD [ 16]. In the present study we intended to confirm these findings. The SLC I I A I gene encodes a transport protein expressed in the membrane of late endosomes mainly in macrophages, regulating antimicrobial activity. The exact mechanism by which microbial replication is blocked is not entirely clear. Several association studies have indicated that polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with clinical tuberculosis and leprosy [ 17, 18], as well as leprosy type [ 19]. We selected two other candidate genes from the published review that have not been studied before in relation with BUD, i.e., the mannose binding lectin (MBL) gene and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. MBL is a liver derived complement activating serum protein [20], which can bind surface structures of several clinically important bacteria, yeast and viruses. It initiates complement activation and phagocytosis and induces inflammat ory cytokine responses. In general, MBL deficiency, which is mainly determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms, is common en predisposes to various infections [21 ]. Low serum MBL levels may also confer protection against some intracellular parasites like leishmaniasis, leprosy and tuberculosis [22-25]. The high prevalence of infections caused by intracellular pathogens in people of African descent may explain the elevated frequency of alleles causing low levels of MBL as compared to people from European descent [26,27]. Vitamin D enhances antimycobacterial activity in in vitro systems and restricts growth of M tuberculosis [28]. The effect of the active metabolite ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), is exerted by interaction with the intranuclear vitamin D receptor [29,30]. Epidemiological evidence suggests there is a relation between vitamin D deficiency, as well as polymorphisms in the VDR gene, and susceptibility to tuberculosis [3 1- 34]. In a study that assessed the potential of vitamin D suppletion in tuberculosis 116 Genetics and vitamin D in Buruli ulcer patients, VDR polymorphism seemed to be associated with time to sputum culture conversion [35].VDR gene polymorphism has also been found to be associated with leprosy type (tuberculoid versus lepromatous) [36]. The objective of this study was to investigate association of BUD with SLC I I A I, MBL and VDR gene polymorphisms, as well as with serum vitamin D concentrations, in patients and healthy controls coming from two regions in Ghana highly burdened with BUD. We hypothesized that the type of lesion, extent of disease, and response to antimicrobial therapy also may be determined by genetic host factors. Method s Participants: case ascertai nment and matched control selection Blood samples were collected and demographic and clinical information was obtained from patients who were participating in a randomised controlled trial to compare two different antimicrobial regimens [37]. This trial was conducted in two hospitals located in the Ashante Region of Ghana. BUD patients were included from April 2006 to January 2008. Participants were aged ;;.:5 years, had early, limited and 1S2404 PCR confirmed disease and were followed for one year from start of treatment. Detailed inclusion criteria for the randomised trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT0032 I 178. Patients that had clinical disease that could not be PCR confirmed were also treated and handled according to the same protocol. These were included in the present study too, as well as PCR confirmed patients that were not randomised for different reasons, but had blood samples taken. In June 2008, one or two matched community controls were enrolled per patient. Control subjects were preferably befriended with, and living close by the house of the BUD patient. We matched for age, as BUD is known to have a bimodal age distribution, with an increased incidence in young persons and in the elderly [38,39]. We matched for gender as some studies, as well as our antibiotic study population, show that women are more prone to develop BUD [37,40-42]. During patient recruitment for the antibiotic trial we were struck by the fact that the majority of BUD patients were not Akan, the dominant ethnic group where the study was conducted [37]. Therefore, we matched according to two major ethnic groups; Akan being individuals from the region where the study was conducted; and other, consisting of individuals mainly belonging to different ethnic groups from Northern 117 Cha pter 6 Ghana. If a study participant's parents were from different descent, we preferably chose the descent of the mother to select the matched control. Ethical consid erations The protocol and consent forms were approved by the Committee on Human Research, Publication and Ethics of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the KomfoAnokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi (CHRPE/07/0 I /05) and by the Ethical Review Committee of Ghana Health Services (GHS-ERC-0 1 /0 I /06). Informed consent and assent was given by all participants aged :2: 12 years and/or from parents, care takers or legal representatives of participants s 18 years. Genotyping Blood samples in EDTA tubes for buffy coat were centrifuged within 24 hours after collection, stored at -20\u00b0C and sent in frozen condition from Ghana to the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, until processed. Genomic DNA was extracted using QiaAmp 96 blood kit (Qiagen). We genotyped four polymorphisms in the SLC 11 A I gene: region of the gene.The 5'(CA)n microsatellite analysis was was designated \"200\" and variant genotypes (202, 204) were pooled as \"other\". We genotyped two polymorphisms on the MBL2 gene as well. Both are known to cause inter-individual variations in serum MBL levels. One of these, rs I 800451, is a point mutation on exon I at codon 57. Wild type is denoted as allele A. The minor C-allele is predominantly found in African populations. The second polymorphism, rs7096206, a base-pair substitution in the promoter region (G -> Cat position 221 ), changes the (most common) rs73 I 236 (Taq I), a in exon 9; 8; and rs7975232 (Apa I), a G-> T base change in intron 8. TaqMan MGB-probes and primers were obtained through the Biosystems assay-by-design service. Vitamin D seru m concentra tion Blood samples in clotted blood tubes for serum were cooled until centrifuged within 24 hours after collection, then stored at -20\u00b0C, and sent in frozen condition from 118 Genetics and vitamin D in Buruli ulcer Ghana to the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, until processed. Serum concentr ation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the primary indicator of vitamin D status, was determined in duplex for every sample by a radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN) [43].The mean of these two results was used for the analyses. Statistical analys is Baseline characteristics of the patient and the control group were compared using Mann\u00ad Whitney U, Pearson Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact test as appropriate. Genotype and allele frequencies of individual polymorphisms were determined by direct counting and expressed as percentages. Genotyping was checked by assessing whether polymorphisms of controls were in Hardy-W einberg equilibrium, using a x2 test with one degree of freedom ( dt). Association between BUD and the polymorphisms was studied using cross tabulation with x2 tests. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (Cl) were determined using binary logistic regression. To adjust for potential confounding: age, gender, study site, ethnicity, and profession were included in the model. Because association studies have linked farming activities with the chance of acquiring BUD, profession was divided in farming and other. To study whether type of lesion (nodule, plaque, ulcer, edema), lesion category (category I; lesions < 5 cm diameter, or category 11/111; lesions >5 cm and multiple lesions) or response to therapy (healing or failure) were associated with certain polymorphisms, cross tabulation was used with x2 tests. Heterozygote and homozygote variant alleles were combined when individual groups were too small to perform the test, with Fisher's Exact as appropriate. For these multiple testing, the significance level was adjusted according to Bonferroni. Comparison of vitamin D levels between patients and controls, and between the different VDR polymorphisms, was performed by Mann-Whitney U tests for two independent samples and by Kruskal-Wallis tests for more than two categories. The association analyses were done with SPSS (version 16.0; Chicago, IL, USA). Hardy\u00ad Weinberg equilibrium testing was performed in MS Excel. Unless stated otherwise, p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results Of the BUD patients, 151 were participants in the randomised antibiotic trial. The other 28 patients were not randomised but received standard antibiotic treatment, and were handled according to the same protocol. Of the 179 patients, 163 (91 %) had 119 Chapter 6 confirmed disease; 156 were at least PCR-confirmed; 7 were confirmed otherwise (Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli, culture and/or histopathol ogy). 12 patients provided two controls and for I I patients no control could be selected, which resulted in a total of 180 controls. Table I shows the baseline characteristics of the 179 BUD patients and the 180 controls included in the analysis.T hese characteristics were similar for both groups.

There was no suggestion of gross genotyping errors, as all polymorphisms in the control group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Missing data were less than 6% for all polymorphisms genotyped. None of the polymorphisms of the SLC I I A I, MBL andVDR genes studied were significantly associated with having BUD. Results did not change when only PCR confirmed patients were included, or when HIV-infected individuals were excluded from the analysis (data not shown). When using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the polymorphisms were not associated with stage of disease, with type of lesion, or with response to treatment (data not shown). In 345 individuals vitamin D concentrations could be obtained from serum, 14 individuals ( 12 patients and 2 controls) had a missing value. Table 5 shows median 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations for patients and for controls, grouped by gender. Serum vitamin D concentrations were different (p<0.00 I) in patients and controls, with for patients a median of 65.9 (25-75th percentile: 55.9-77.6) nmol/L and for controls 73,0 (63.1-84.1) nmol/L. In males the difference was larger than in females. 120 Genetics and vitamin D in Burul i ulcer Table 2: SLC I I A I genotype frequencies in Buruli ulcer patients and in controls Bun.

We show that vitamin D serum concentration is associated with M ulcerans infection. We speculate that the reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations that we found in patients compared to control subjects, is related to consumption of vitamin D at the site of infection. In tuberculosis, formation of activated vitamin D ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) from 25-hydroxyvitamin D mediated antimicrobial activity against intracellular M tuberculosis was found to be dependent on cathelicidin, via activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) on human monocytes and macrophages [48]. After infection with M tuberculosis, TLR activation results in conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, within human macrophages, at the site of infection [49]. Blockade of LL-37, the active peptide form of cathelicidin, results in increased growth of M ulcerans in human epidermal keratinocytes [SO]. It is probable that M ulcerans, like M tuberculosis, activates TLRs, resulting in the formation of cathelicidin via conversion of vitamin D.Another cause of lower serum vitamin D concentrations in patients might be less sunlight exposure, resulting from the stigma and functional limitations known to be associated with Buruli ulcer disease [51,52]. Thirdly, a pre-existing low vitamin D concentration -either as a result of reduced dietary intake, or less exposure to sunlight, might result in less protective immunity against M ulcerans, with a larger chance of developing clinical disease after infection. The very small difference in median serum vitamin D concentrations between patients and controls, and the overall high vitamin D concentrations make this explanation less probable. We realized that the different time period in which vitamin D serum samples were taken could have induced bias. Samples from patients were taken throughout the year, while samples from controls were taken in the month of June, during rainy season. The relatively cloudy weather in the rainy season would have favoured lower, not higher vitamin D concentrations; the bias would rather be in the opposite direction than what we found, and it is therefore not very likely that differences in sampling time between cases and controls explain our findings. 122 Genetics and vitamin D in Buruli ulcer Table 4: VDR genotype frequencies in Buruli ulcer patients and in healthy controls Bun.Iii ulcer controls crude odds adjusted odds patients (n= l80) ratio (95% 114 I I CIT 64 (38%) 51 (30%) 1.38 (0.87-2. 17) 1.36 (0.86-2. 17) TIT (1%) 7 (4%) 0.16 (0.02- 1.29) 0.15 (0.02- 1.21) missing 10 8 Taql TIT 93 (55%) 107 (62%) I I (0.40-2.67) missing 8 7 Bsm l TIT 77 (46%) 89 (51%) I I TIC 81 (48%) 67 (39%) I .40 (0.90-2. 18) 1.38 (0.88-2. 17) CIC 11 (6%) 17 (10%) 0.75 (0.33-1.69) 0.75 (0.33-1.70) missing 10 7 Apal TIT 91 (53%) 79 (46%) 0.53 (0.24- 1.19) 0.53 (0.23- 1.20) missing 8 6 Odds ratios are for comparison with the most common genotype for each polymorphism. bQdds ratios via binary logistic regre ssion analysis with gender , age, ethnicity and profes sion as covariates in the samples p <0.00 1 0.028 <0.00 1 Contrary to our earlier study [ 16], the present study could not confirm an important share of the SLC I I A I D345N polymorphism in acquiring clinical M ulcerans disease. Both studies were of the same sample size. In addition to matching for age and gender like the former study, in the present study we matched for ethnicity as well. As 75% of the Buruli ulcer patients that were included in the antimicrobial trial were from northern ethnic origin while the study took place in the centre of Ghana [37], we aimed at preventing confounding as a result of background genetic differences.As genetic studies in African populations are challenging because genetic information is 123 Chapter 6 highly diverse within confined areas, confounding as a result of ethnic differences in our study population cannot be excluded [53]. We matched according to two major ethnic groups -Akan and othe r.As other consisted of over 13 ethnic groups -mainly from the northern part of Ghana, this group was probably still diverse in genetic background. However , separate analysis of only Akan individuals, as the former study included probably mainly Akans, did not change results (data not shown). Susceptib ility to develop Buruli ulcer neither seems to be related to MBL and VDR polymorphisms in our population. The median serum vitamin D concentration was around 70 nmol/L. Possibly, VDR polymorphisms only play a major role when vitamin D serum concentrations are lower. In a study that looked at serum vitamin D concentrations in Asian individuals that migrated to London,V DR polymorphisms influenced susceptibility for tuberculosis only in the subgroup with deficient or undetectably vitamin D serum concentrations [31 ]. A limitation of the present study is the unpowered sample size. An association with the polymorphisms therefore cannot be excluded. As in the former study a significant association with one of the SLC I I A I polymorphisms was found with a relatively small sample size, we decided the sample size would be high enough for reproduction. Higher samples sizes are difficult to obtain for M u/cerans infection. Studies like this are nevertheless important as results might add to developing ways of preventing or managing disease. Further analysis of the mechanisms of action and the downstream cellular pathways of susceptibility and resistance genes of the host, may lead to new approaches to control disease. Likewise, it will be helpful in identifying individuals in endemic areas that have increased risk to develop disease, giving them the opportunity to protect themselves against behavioural risks and to be aware of, and recognize M ulcerans infection in an early stage. In these individuals other strategies to combat disease, like a newly produced vaccine, could be considered when living in an endemic area [54]. In conclusion, no appreciable influence of carrying one of the SLC I I A I, MBL and VDR polymorphisms was found on developing Buruli ulcer disease. Buruli ulcer patients had significantly lower serum vitamin D concentrations than controls, which we relate to local activation and consumption of vitamin D by cells of the immune system, possibly resulting in production of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Insight in the role of susceptibility genes and further analysis of the role of vitamin D, cathelicidin and other antimicrobial peptides is important to increase our understanding in the pathology and evolution of this disabling disease, aiming for novel tools to combat Mycobacterium ulcerans infection. 124 Genetics and vitamin D in Buruli ulcer Contributors TSvdW, YS and YS, WAN, PvdV and EvdV designed the study.

This thesis focused on the effectiveness of drug therapy to control infection. Chapter I provided a brief introduction into the history of treatment for Buruli ulcer disease, in which surgery dominated [4]. Disappointing results of chemotherapy were poorly understood, as in laboratory experiments antibiotics appeared effective against the causative organism Mycobaeterium u/cerans. The clinical effectiveness of combined therapy with streptomycin and rifampicin - with or without surgery, as advised by WHO from 2004 on [5], was not studied in a well-designed clinical trial with robust follow-up and pre-defined clinical end-points [6]. Chapter I described the scope of the thesis and outlined the hypotheses that were tested in the following chapters. In chapter 2 we unambigu ously showed the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of Buruli ulcer disease, defined as clinical cure at time point 52 weeks after start of treatment [7]. In a non-inferiority design, we compared standard streptomycin and rifampicin for 8 weeks with a schedule of rifampicin for 8 weeks and streptomy cin for only 4 weeks, with a switch to oral clarithromycin for a further 4 weeks. Of the 154 participants with early, limited Buruli ulcer lesions that were included in the trial, 151 were randomized. Four were lost to follow-up before the primary end-point -complete healing at one year after start of treatment -was reached; but these four participants had healed lesions at the time of their last assessment, and were included in the analysis. Randomization was done remotely in the Netherlands with help of cell-phone text messaging. Five participants needed extensive surgery, and of six participan ts lesions were not healed at time point one year. 73 (96%) participants in the 8-week streptomycin group and 68 (91 %) participants in the 4-week streptomyc in plus 4-week clarithromycin group had healed lesions at one year (odds ratio 2 49, 95% Cl 0 \u00b766 to infinity; test). No participants had lesion recurrence at I year. Five participants received skin grafting. Few side effects were reported; three participants had vestibulotoxic events, three reported abdominal discomfort, one developed an injection abscess and two developed an abscess close to the initial lesion, which was incised and drained. It can be concluded from this study that antimycobacterial treatment for Mycobaeterium u/cerans infection is highly effective in early, limited disease. As both study arms had similar efficacy, the number of injections of streptomyc in can be reduced, by switching to oral clarithromycin after 4 weeks. 132 Summar y In chapter 3 we discussed the complex bidirectional pharmacokinetic interactions involved when combining rifampicin and clarithromycin in the treatment for Mycobacterium u/cerans infection [8]. We showed that adding clarithromycin to rifampicin resulted in a 60% non-significant, but possibly relevant, increase in plasma rifampicin concentration. In addition, we found that the exposure to the drug metabolite 14-hydroxyclarithromycin [9] was significantly higher than that to clarithromycin. This is probably an effect of rifampicin co-medication, inducing the clarithromycin metabolism in the liver [ I 0-12]. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 14-hydroxyclarithromycin for Mycobacterium ulcerans was studied by DeepakAlmeida at the mycobacteriology laboratory of Professor Grosset at the Johns' Hopkins, Baltimore. The MIC appeared too high to expect any additional antimycobacterial effect on Mycobacterium ulcerans. The median time above MIC for the Ghanaian Mycobacterium ulcerans strain [ 13] (0.25 mg/I) was about 4 hours per 24 hours. In all eight patients, blood concentrations remained above MIC for at least some period of time. However, for the Malaysian Mycobacterium ulcerans strain [ 14], two patients did never reach the MIC (0.5 mg/I). Neo-macrolide antibiotics, like clarithromycin, have different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than other antibiotic classes [ 15]. This class of antimicrobial agents is characterized by a combination of low serum concentrations and high concentrations in phagocytes, while there is debate about actual soft tissue concentrations [ 16-18]. As Mycobacterium ulcerans has an intracellular -stage [19-21], clarithromycin might particularly be effective during this phase of infection [22]. Nevertheless, we concluded that, to ensure higher levels of exposure and time above MIC, a dose of 7.5 mg/kg should be given twice daily-or an extended release formulation once daily -, as the dose which was used presently appeared to be well-tolerated. In this way, the chance of inadvertent mono-therapy as a result of drug-drug interaction can be brought to minimum, reducing the chance of inducing drug resistance for rifampicin as well as for clarithromycin. In chapter 4 we supported our hypothesis on paradoxical reactions accompanying effective treatment for Mycobacterium ulcerans infection by describing three observational phenomena in the evolution of disease after start of therapy: (i) transient increases in lesion size; (ii) ulceration of non-ulcerative lesions; and (iii} development of new lesions [23].The three response patterns were observed during therapy, as well as after the 8 week antimicrobial therapy had ended. For the lesion size analysis 134 Buruli ulcer patients were included; these were participants of the randomized trial described in chapter 2. To be able to show response patterns during effective antimicrobial treatment, included for the lesion size analysis were 133 Chapter 7 participants that healed on treatment. Participants that failed on treatment, were HIV co-infected, or had skin grafting were excluded. Peak 'paradoxical response' occurred at week 8, when over 30% of patients showed an increase in lesion size as compared to the previous (week 6) assessment. To strengthen the analysis, we performed a sensitivity analysis by varying the definitions of paradoxical response, e.g. two consecutive increases or an increase after a decrease in surface area, which, likewise, confirmed the presence of the phenomenon we describe as paradoxical response.A total of 90 participants had non-ulcerative lesions at time of inclusion; 75 (83%) of these lesions ulcerated after start of treatment. Nine participants developed new lesions during or after treatment.All lesions subsequently healed.We concluded from this analysis that, after start of antimicrobial treatment for Buruli ulcer, new or progressive ulceration is common before healing sets in. Moreover, the chapter emphasizes that this paradoxical response should not be misinterp reted as failure to respond on treatment [24,25]. In chapter 5 we showed that early detection of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity in a field setting by means of a portable audiometer -with no soundproof audiometr y facilities -is limited (manuscript submitted). Though aminoglycoside\u00ad induced ototoxicity affects the higher frequencies first [26,27], intra-and inter\u00ad observer measurements were less reliable at 6 and 8 kHz. However, in the normal hearing range (0.25 to 4 kHz), the intra-and inter-observer reliability of the portable audiometer was satisfactory. The study showed that a portable audiometer can be well operated in the field by different observers with minimal training, which is useful in general daily practice. Levels of hearing impairment might be overestimated as a result of ambient noise, but changes over time can be reliably detected. In chapter 6 we describe a patient-control analysis in which significantly lower vitamin D blood concentrations were found in the 179 Buruli ulcer patients as compared to the 180 matched control subjects (65.9 vs 73.0 nmol/L; p<0.001) (manuscript submitted). Possible explanations for the lower vitamin D serum concentrations are increased consumption of vitamin D by cells of the immune system at the site of infection [28-30], or less likely, decreased exposure to sunlight resulting from covered skin or inability to participate in farming and other out-door activities, due to Mycobacterium ulcerans disease. This new finding could be important in finding novel ways to improve disease management. We were unable to confirm the earlier established association of SLC I I A I gene polymorphisms with susceptibility for Buruli ulcer disease [31 ]. The sample size was 134 Summary similar to the previous study, but the population presently studied had a different ethnic background (i.e., other tribal origins), which could be a possible explanation for the conflicting results. In our patient population, we were unable to detect polymorphisms in the VDR gene or in the MBL gene that were associated with developing Buruli ulcer disease. 135 Chapter 7 Refer ences I. van derWerfTS, Stienstra Y,Johnson RC, Phillips R,Adjei 0, et al.

Genes lmmun 7(1466-487 9;3): ion and future pers pect ives Chapter 8 With the study described in chapter 2 [I], we intended to make the first step towards developing a fully oral regimen for the treatment of Mycobacter ium u/cerans infection. Although a switch to oral drugs after four weeks of standard streptomycin injection-based treatment is advantageous in reducing potential additional infectious risks associated with the injections, as well as in reducing logistic challenges incurred by injection therapy in rural Africa [2-5], a fully oral regimen would be the preferred treatment [6-1 0]. The findings of the present trial led to the preparation of a new trial, addressing the question whether a fully oral treatment is non-inferior to the standard streptomycin and rifampicin treatment. Apart from finding new and better antimycobacterial treatment combinations, the minimal duration of antimicrobial therapy to cure infection should be another focus of investigation. We hypothesize that antimicrobials shut down mycolactone synthesis so as to allow the immune system to recover and initiate an immune response adequate to fight Mycobacterium ulcerans [ I 1-17]. Once this adaptive immune response is established, infection might be controlled without additional antimicrobial treatment. Support for this hypothesis comes from our observation of ultimately healed lesions in which living bacteria were found after the 8 week antimicrobial treatment had been discontinued [I]. Besides, an unknown but considerable proportion of individuals is able to spontaneously clear pre-clinical or clinical infection, without active treatment, which supports the major importance of an adequate immune response in defense for this particular mycobacterium [ 18-26]. The virulence of Mycobacterium u/cerans depends on its formation of mycolactone [27-31].Arresting the mycolactone synthesis machinery by interfering with (post-) translation of the mycolactone synthesis genes on the plasmid and the cellular genome, the immune system might control the infection. In this view, even single-drug treatment would possibly be adequate in treating Mycobacterium u/cerans infection. No resistant Mycobacterium u/cerans strains have been cultured from human tissues to date. Indeed, the risk of spreading resistant mycobacteria is much smaller in Mycobacter ium u/cerans infection than in e.g. tuberculosis, in which, unlike Buruli ulcer, humans are the reservoir of the infectious agent. In fact, unpublished information shows that Buruli ulcer has been treated with rifampicin alone in many endemic areas in the seventies and eighties of the twentieth century [IO]. WHO discourages the use of mono-therapy for Mycobacter ium u/cerans infection. One might argue that even a more wide-spread policy of mono-therapy of an assumedly environmentally acquired infection would probably not be associated with an appreciable risk of drug resistance. The most important concern is however that such treatment 140 General discussion and future perspectives might be associated with recurrence or persistent infection, especially in immune\u00ad compromised hosts. Further, aspects of local treatment, like type of dressing materials [32], frequency of dressing changes, the role of skin grafting as well as the role of limited surgical excision of necrotic tissue in larger lesions [33] should be studied, intending to fasten the slow pace of healing shown in the present study.Topical use of autologous blood products like platelet gel or fibrin sealant [34-38] could be suitable to fasten wound healing as preparation is simple and therefore applicable in resource poor circumstances. The role of mycolactone, which could have an important role in the slow pace of wound healing, should be another focus of research. The kinetics of mycolactone in tissue and blood should be studied [39]. Ways to halt or decrease mycolactone production, to increase or stimulate its tissue washout, or products that have the ability to degrade the molecule should be developed and tested in vitro. Apart from its antibacterial effects, clarithromycin is known to have short-and long\u00ad term anti-inflammatory effects [40-43]. lmmunomodulation might result in faster healing, fewer or less intense paradoxical reactions, or other anti-inflammatory benefits. In the present study we were not able to find support for this, but when clarithromycin is given from start of treatment this positive impact on inflammation might become obvious. Strikingly, the majority of our patient population presented with lesions on the right side of the body, an observation that has been reported previously in Ghana as well [44,45]. This confirmed finding could be an important additional clue in unraveling the mode of disease transmission. Treatment of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection might become superfluous if transmission could be prevented. Despite large and intense research efforts, neither the reservoir nor the transmission to humans has been elucidated [46].The study of reservoir and transmission is complicated by the fact that transmission can vary over time [ 4 7-49]. Possibly several different modes of transmission occur in different endemic foci [46]. For the first years to come, the main focus of research should be improving patient treatment. In the absence of adequate prevention, early diagnosis and prompt and adequate treatment should prevent large lesions with subsequent important sequelae and functional limitations [50-52]. Future clinical antibiotic studies for Buruli ulcer treatment should be accompanied by more extensive pharmacokinetic and -dynamic studies, to confirm drug intake, 141 Chapter 8 and to confi rm adequa te drug concen trati ons in blood and especially in affected tissues. Limited tissue samplin g tech nique s combined with minim ally invasive finger prick blood specimens air-dried on filter paper which simp lify transport conditions could be help ful to study drug-exposure in a larger num ber of patients [53], and mycoba cterial drug resistance testing should be carried out when possi ble [54,55] . Cost-benefit analyses could strength tment for Buruli ulcer; mor e atte ntion to this important factor should be given in future trials, as well as to the prevention of disability. Disa bilities are obvi ously less when surgery is brought to a mini mum, but without surgery , lesions on or close to joints are still prone to heal with functional limitations [56] . Pro vidin g appropria te tools and specialized personnel in the field of preve ntion of disabilities should be an integrated part of Buruli ulcer treatment, and importantly in future clinical trials mone y should be budgeted for this, which should impr ove quality of life for affected individuals. In the analysis of paradoxical wor senin g of disease under antibiotic trea tment, we could not link the wound surface area ents with biomar kers or our observations gical phenomena that might explain our findin gs. Sinc e we first reported our obser vations of paradoxical responses after start of antibiotic treatm ent at the WH O meeting on Buruli ulcer in Gene va 2009, case repor ts that com bine d clinical and histopathological findin gs on this phenomenon were subsequ ently reported [ 14, 16]. To study the phenomenon in a large clinical trial , biomar kers obtai ned in repeated blood sam ples in this respect is a more patient friendly way than obtai ning consec utive multiple histo-pa tholo gical speci on exploration of biomar kers to differenti ate paradoxical responses from treatm ent failure, as a paradoxical response is a reason to continue antibiotic treatm ent or wait -and-see, while treatment failure would be a reason to switch antibiotic trea tment, or to proceed to more costly and potentially disfigurin g surgical intervent ions. No studies have addressed the question how paradoxical reac tions should be prevented or managed. The imm unosuppr essive drug prednisone has been used for treating paradoxical, immu ne-med iated responses in tuberculo sis, but no association was found between the use of ster oids and the duration of the reacti on [57]. Steroids might be efficacious especially when the central nervous system is involved; they might reduce symptoms by controllin g disease associa ted edema [58]. The 'immun e reconstitution inflamma tory syndrome ' (IRIS) is a paradoxical response 142 General discu ssion and future perspectives following immune recovery in the context of starting antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection [59,60]. IRIS is associated with inflammation in response to an infectious agent, sometimes to dead bacillary antigens, and may present as the unmasking of an initially subclinical co-infection, or as a deterioration of a co-infection under treatment [61,62]. In paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS, the use of steroids has been addressed in a randomized clinical trial [63]. Prednisone provided benefit as it reduced the need for hospitalization and therapeutic procedures, hastened improvements in symptoms and quality of life, despite a higher risk of nonsevere opportunistic infections. Case reports and series describe NSAI Ds, thalidomide and leukotriene receptor antagonists as potentially beneficial; and TNF-a inhibitors, chemokine receptor antagonists, vitamin D and statins have been suggested to prevent IRIS or its complications [60]. These agents might have a possible beneficial role in treating or preventing paradoxical responses in Mycobaeterium ulcerans infection as well. To explore poss ible genetic Buruli ulcer,response to reaction-, pharmaco-genetics as well as pharmacokinetics and -dynamics, future studies should enroll larger patient populations. Whole Genome Analysis could be a next step to gain more knowledge on these issues, to be able to use this knowledge to improve treatment strategies.An international bio bank could be set up, which provides the opportun ity to strengthen collaboration in Buruli ulcer research and to merge small databases and scattered patient information. The interesting finding of serum vitamin D concentrations, which were lower in untreated Buruli ulcer patients as compared to healthy controls [64] should be followed by a confirmation study. This study could also incorporate vitamin D measurements after treatment has finished and at the momen t patients are healed, to differentia te pre-existing differences in vitamin D status from vitamin D consumption by cells of the immune system or a decrease in sunlight exposure resulting from covered skin, stigma, or the impossibility to work outside. Furthermore, our proposed possible role of cathelicidin [65], a peptide that is related to vitamin D dependent antimicrobial effects should be investigated, which might give clues to fight Buruli ulcer disease in different ways. Finally, supplementing vitamin D might be worth studying, as has been tried in tuberculosis [66,67]. In conclusion, the randomized trial we performed has clearly answered the question whether patients with Mycobaeterium u/cerans infection should have antimicrobial 143 Chapter 8 treatment:the evidence base is sufficiently strong for a high grade of recommendation [7].All-oral schemes should be developed, ways to fasten healing should be provided and the newly introduced phenomenon of paradoxical response to treatment should be studied and explored with the intention to provide definitions, criteria and treatment recommendations to optimize treatment for Buruli ulcer. 144 Gener al discussion and future perspectives References I.

She followed secondary education at 'het Lauwers College' in the same town, and started studying medicine in 1996 at the University of Groningen. After completing her internship in the Medic al Center of Leeuwarden, in 2002 she conducted a doctoral research in The Leprosy Mission Hospital Purulia, West\u00ad Bengal, India, concerning measuring impairment caused by leprosy: inter- tester reliability of the WHO disability grading system, supervised by Dr Ruth Budin and Dr Wim van Brakel. Here, she discovered that by performing clinical research she could combine her love for medicine and her wish to improve patient care on a larger scale. She presented the results of the study in New Delhi (India). She received her Master of Science and graduated as medical doctor in 2003. After I \u00bd years of residency in 'het Scheper Ziekenhuis Emmen' (Dr Frank van der Kleij), from 2005 to 2008 she coordinated a randomized controlled trial on Drug treatment for Buruli ulcer disease in Ghana, supervised by Prof Dr Tjip van der Werf and Dr Ymkje Stienstra. This study -with combined side studies -resulted in this thesis. She presented results of the studies in Cotonou (Benin) and at the WHO Bur uli ulcer conference in Geneva (Switzerland). In 2009 she started her specialization internal medicine at the Medical Center of Leeuwarden supervised by Dr C Halma and later Dr L de Heide. From September 2012 she will continue the specialization at the University Medical Centre of Groningen under supervision of Prof Dr ROB Gans. 176 "}
