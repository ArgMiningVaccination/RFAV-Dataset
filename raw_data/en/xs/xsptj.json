Deep relaxation that is used to help people become more aware of their inner thoughts and to develop ways to help them manage their situation. Why use it Hypnotherapy can improve mental wellbeing and quality of life. It can help to overcome mental blocks that prevent people dealing with issues such as anxiety, fear, low self-esteem, pain, insomnia and unwanted habits such as smoking. What to expect A trained therapist will take a case history and discuss your reasons for having hypnotherapy. They will then lead you into a deeply relaxed state, known as an altered state of consciousness. Being in a relaxed state allows your subconscious to focus on your treatment goals, which then become more achievable for your conscious mind. What is the evidence? Hypnotherapy has been clinically tested with good results for helping people cope with pain, anxiety, fatigue, hot flushes, nausea and vomiting related to cancer treatment.
