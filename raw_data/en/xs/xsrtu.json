More than ever before, cancer program leaders are challenged to invest their limited resources in the right services \u2014ones that will both attract new patients and improve the patient experience. Survey Background To assist our cancer program members, we d eveloped and administered a national survey to answer the following questions: When cancer patients chose a cancer provider, which factors weigh most heavily in their decision? Which cancer program services and features are most valued by patients? How do cancer patients define quality? Where do they look for quality information? We collected data from over 600 respondents, including cancer patients undergoing treatment and survivors diagnosed within the past five years. Survey Methodology Our survey incl uded: Demographic questions Quality -related questions MaxDiff questions MaxDiff analysis is a technique commonly used in market research to determine which product features matter most to consumers and which matter least. Respondents are shown a list of f eatures and asked to indicate the best and worst (or most and least important). Respondents are asked the question multiple times, but each time they choose from a slightly different list of features. By analyzing the responses, it is possible to quantify the relative value respondents place on different features. See the graphics below for an example of how MaxDiff analysis could be used in designing the perfect family car and how to interpret the resulting utility scores. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 5 advisory.com Survey Respondents We colle cted respondents' demographic information, including age, gender, tumor type, race, education, income, location, insurance status, and provider type. While there was fairly even distribution across most factors, there were some predictable biases. For exam ple, the sample skewed toward younger patients and patients with breast and skin cancer. Unfortunately, the sample was not racially diverse \u201491% of respondents were Caucasian. A note on the survey's limitations: This research is attitudinal in nature, not behavioral. It does not ask respondents about their historical choices; rather, it asks them about their stated preferences and hypothetical choices \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 6 advisory.com Survey Results MaxDiff #1 For the first MaxDiff question in The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey, respondents were asked to indicate which feature is most and least important to them when deciding where to go for their cancer care. They were shown five features in one screen and were asked this question 12 times. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 7 advisory.com MaxDiff #2 For the second MaxDiff question, respondents were asked to indicate which service offered by a cancer center would have been most valuable and least valuable to them throug hout their experience. They were shown five services in one screen and completed this question 14 times. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 8 advisory.com Quality Questions We also asked cancer patients a series of questions to understand how they think about quality in cancer care. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 9 advisory.com . \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 10 advisory.com #2: Making It Easy to Be a Cancer Patient Having cancer is never easy, but cancer programs can take steps to improve the experience for patients and families. To help you decide where to invest your limited resources, we asked approximately 600 cancer patients about their preferences for cancer pr ogram services and discovered what they care most about \u2014 convenience and coordination. Cancer patients want convenient, coordinated care In The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey , we asked patients which services would have been most and least valuable to them during their care. Out of 19 services included in our survey, four stood out: Underlying the top factors are the themes of convenience and coordination: #1 service: \"All of my care takes place in one building (e.g., imaging, doctor's visits, treatment)\" was the top rated feature with 37% of respondents ranking this #1 overall. These data confirm what many health care executives have long suspected: co -location of ser vices is important to patients and consequently has the potential to be a powerful market differentiator. Of course, not every cancer program can afford to build a new facility that houses all cancer -related services. But every cancer program should consid er where patients must go to access care (e.g. laboratory, imaging, infusion, clinic) and take steps to ameliorate the burden for them. For example, MD Anderson added a large tree sculpture to help mark the way to the hospital's diagnostic center, pharmacy, chapel, and blood donation services. #3 service: \" One point of contact to answer my questions and help me understand my care\" ranked third overall. Nearly 11% of respondents ranked this #1 and 57% of respondents ranked it within their top five. These data reflect the fact that cancer patients often have questions during and after treatment , but they don't know where to turn for answer s. Moreove r, many are hesitant to contact their physicians for fear of \"bothering them.\" But allowing patients ' questions to go una ddressed can lead to confusion and distress, or , \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 11 advisory.com even worse, complications that could have been avoided. Consequently , it's essential to provide e very patient with a single point of contact. #4 service: \" Multidisciplinary care clinics or meetings where my entire team discusses my case\" was the fourth most valuable service overall. Over 10% of respondents ranked it as the most valuable, and nearly 50% ranked it within their top five. Although many cancer patients aren't familiar with the term \"multidisciplinary clinics,\" they want every member of the care team, including support staff, to be knowledgeable about their particular case. As one cancer pa tient told us, \"Team -based care is so important \u2014I want everyone to be talking about me and on the same page about how they're handling my care.\" Related R esources For help with facility planning, see Patient -Centric Service Flow from Redesigning Cancer Care Delivery for the Era of Accountability and Hospitals take design cues from malls, airports Resources on navigation include Maximizing the Value of Patient Navigation and Elevating the Patient Experience For information on multidisciplinary care, see Elevating the Patient Experience , Next-Generation Tumor Site Strategy, Volume 1 , Next-Generation Tumor Site Strategy, Volume 2 , and Multidisciplinary Care Coordinators For best practices on phone triage, see Urgent Care for Cancer Patients and Good call: Oncology practice's phone triage curbs ED visits . \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 12 advisory.com #3: A New Generation of Cancer Care Consumers Beginning to E merge Although the majority of cancer patients defer to their physicians when choosing a provider or treatment, a new type of cancer care consumer is emerging \u2014one who is more active in his/her care, more likely to challenge his/her providers, and more interested in having a seat at the decision -making table. Read on to see how consumerism is taking shape in cancer care. The next generation of cancer patients will act more like consumers Traditionally, cancer patients have not acted like consumers \u2014they tend to be deferential to their physicians, report high le vels of satisfaction with their care, and are unlikely to switch cancer providers - even if they experience service failures. (A recent article, Is It OK to Fire My Oncologist? , demonstrates th is mindset.) Nevertheless, patients are starting to play a more active role in their health care choices. This shift has been triggered by several factors: The media, which is constantly scrutinizing the health care industry The interne t, which provides consumers with readily accessible information about their disease and providers Health plan cost shifting, which is increasing patients' financial responsibility Although cancer patients are largely considered the most deferential patie nt population, we found evidence of a shifting mindset in The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey : Patients aren't relying solely on their doctor's recommendation. When we asked patients which feature is most important when deciding where to go for care, \"recommendation from my doctor\" ranked fifth. Only 32 respondents selected this as the most important feature overall. In contrast, almost five times as many respondents (147) selected \"cancer center is in -network for my insurance\" and eight times as many (261) chose \"doctor who specializes in my particular cancer\" as the most important feature. Patients under 55 placed less importance on \"recommendation from my doctor\" than older patients, indicating they are more likely to be self -directed. Patients are looking for information about cancer providers online . 38% of survey respondents indicated that they had read provider reviews online, and 28% looked at quality performance websites. Younger patients are more willing to change cancer providers if they are dissatisfied with their care. Almost 8% of respondents switched cancer programs because they were dissatisfied with their care. Of those \"switchers,\" 72% were under 55 years old. Patients want to play a n active role in their health care decisions . As shown in the graphic below, \"switchers\" were allowed to write in the reason they changed cancer providers. The written responses ranged in reasoning, but many of them referred to a lack of shared decision making. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 13 advisory.com The next generation of cancer patients h as high expectations for their care . When asked what the most important factor is when deciding where to go for care, patients aged 18 -54 scored non - clinical features, like customer service, patient support services, and facility and amenities, higher than older patients . Throughout their care, younger patients tend to value non -treatment -related services, like survivorship, financial counseling, and complementary and alternative medicine, more than their older counterparts. Essential for cancer programs to meet th e demands of cancer care consumers Cancer programs need to be aware of the priorities of younger patients and make every effort to meet those priorities since this population is more likely to be self -directed when selecting a cancer provider. Once they're in your system, it's critical to meet their expectations since they will be more willing to change providers if they are dissatisfied with their care. For help implementing patient support services, refer to the following resources: Urgent Care for Cancer Patients Oncology Distress Screening and Management Cancer Patient Financial Navigation The Survivorship Challenge Integrating Palliative Care into Oncology Practice \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 14 advisory.com #4: Cost Matters \u2014More T han You T hink As price transparency and patient cost shifting increase, the public's concern over the cost of their health care grows. But as Steven Brill attests , patients' perspective changes when they are diagnosed with a life - threatening illness, such as cancer. So it's unclear what \u2014if any \u2014role cost plays in cancer patients' decision making proces s. The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey suggests that costs might play a bigger role than you think. \"Cancer center is in -network for my insurance\" influences patients' choice of provider When we asked respondents which feature was most important to them when selecting where to go for cancer care, \"cancer center is in -network for my insurance\" was the 4th most important feature overall. Compared to other respondents, patients aged 55 -64 ranked in -network status significantly higher \u2014equal to \"clinical quality.\" In fact, over 24% of respondents said this would be the most important factor in their decision. The only feature that more respondents ranked at the top was \"doctor who specializes in my particular cancer\" - 43% of respondents preferred this over all other features. In contrast, only 5% of cancer patients said that \"recommendation from my doctor\" would be the most important factor. Although \"cost\" ranked significantly lower, it was still the 8th most important feature out of 15. Respondents placed more importance on cost than location, availability of appointments, and customer service. Patients value financial counseling services We also asked survey respondents which cancer program services would have been most valuable to them during their experience with cancer. Financial counseling ranked 7 out of 19 total services, and nearly 30% of respondents scored it within their top five. As shown in the graph below, financial counseling was the most valuable among all non -treatment -related services. Financial counseling also ranked 4th among newly diagnosed patients and 5th among cancer patients between 18 and 54 years of age. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 15 advisory.com Few cancer patients associate low cost with low quality One of the survey questions also aimed at uncovering how cancer patients connect cost and quality. Half of the survey participants were asked, \"When it comes to cancer care, do you think that higher -quality cancer care comes at a higher cost, or is there n o real relationship between the two?\" The other half were asked, \"When it comes to cancer care, do you think that lower -quality cancer care comes at a lower cost, or is there no real relationship between the two?\" Overall, only about 15% of cancer patien ts believe that \"lower -quality cancer care comes at a lower cost.\" Low-cost providers shouldn't be concerned that patients will automatically assume they provide lower -quality care. However, about 33% of cancer patients believe \"higher -quality cancer care comes at a higher cost,\" indicating that patients are more likely to believe that higher cost equates to higher quality. When we compare the responses of cancer patients to those of patients who have had an MRI within the past year, there are some interest ing differences. Imaging patients are more likely to believe that higher cost correlates to higher quality. In contrast, cancer patients are more likely to think there is no real relationship between cost and quality or that \"it depends.\" This suggests tha t cancer patients, who likely have more experience with the health care system, better understand the complexity of health care costs. Cancer providers must develop robust financial navigation programs As cancer costs and patient responsibility for those costs continue to climb, providers need to be ready to talk about costs, explain insurance benefits, and help patients manage their finances. Make sure you're prepared by reading Cancer Patient Financial Navigation . \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 16 advisory.com #5: Meet Your Cancer Patient Researchers The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey revealed that a growing number of cancer patients are researching providers online. To attract this population of self -directed patients, it's critical to know who they are and what they're looking for in a cancer program. Many cancer patients are activel y looking for quality information online When asked if they had looked online for quality performance data or reviews of cancer providers, 41% of survey respondents indicated that they had. We've dubbed this group of patients \" the researchers .\" As seen in the graphic below, they tend to be young and educated. Searching high and low for provider information Overall, 38% of survey respondents indicated that they had read provider reviews online, and 28% looked at websites with quality performance data. As shown in the charts below, researchers looked at multiple websites in each category \u2014suggesting they're searching for as much information as they can get when making a decision about where to go for their care. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 17 advisory.com Researchers care more about accreditation, ranking, and support services When we asked patients which features were most important when selecting a cancer provider, both researchers and non -researchers ranked the same five features at the top. But, there were key differences in how s trongly researchers valued certain features compared to non -researchers. While non -researchers clearly distinguish the top five features from the rest, the distinction is not as sharp for researchers. In particular, researchers place significantly less importance on \"recommendation from my doctor,\" suggesting that they are more likely to act independently than other patients. In contrast, researchers care significantly more about: Accreditation (e.g., accredited by the American College of Surgeons' Co mmission on Cancer) Patient and support services (e.g., someone to help coordinate my care, nutrition management) Ranking (e.g., ranked by US News and World Report, featured in a \"top doctors\" report) Availability of clinical trials Recommendation from my family and friends Cancer programs that are ranked, accredited, or offer a wide array of support services should make this information easy for researchers to find \u2014we know they're looking for it. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 18 advisory.com Researchers want holistic support We also asked surv ey respondents which cancer program services they would value most and found that researchers' priorities differed from non -researchers. Compared to non -researchers, researchers are more interested in holistic support, placing significantly more value on: Survivor support services for me after I finished treatment (e.g. counseling, support groups, rehab services) Social and mental health services for me during treatment (e.g., patient support groups, counselors) Complementary and alternative medicine se rvices (e.g., acupuncture, yoga, massage) or referral to such services Support services for my family members (e.g., counselors, family support groups, cancer resource center) Religious and spiritual services (e.g., chaplain, prayer services, onsite cha pel) Related Resources : The Survivorship Challenge Oncology Distress Screening and Management Cancer Center of the Future \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 19 advisory.com #6: How Well Do You Know Your Younger Cancer Patients? You know younger cancer patients differ from older patients. But what are they looking for in a cancer provider? And which services do they value most? Younger patients more likely to be self -directed, value accreditation and ranking When deciding where to go for their cancer care, younger patients (18 -54) place less importance on clinical features, like physician specialization, technology and treatment options, and clinical quality. They also place significantly less importance on \"recomm endation from my doctor,\" indicating that they will act more independently when selecting a cancer provider. In comparison to patients over 55, younger patients place significantly more importance on: Accreditation (e.g., accredited by the American Colleg e of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer) Patient support services (e.g., someone to help coordinate my care, nutrition management) Ranking (e.g., ranked by US News and World Report, featured in a \"top doctors\" report) Facility and amenities Customer service Availability of clinical trials In fact, younger patients believe \"ranking\" is more than twice as important as patients 55 and over. Younger patients value comprehensive support services during treatment Throughout their experience with cancer, younger pat ients also place significantly more value on a number of services than their older counterparts. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 20 advisory.com #7: How to Attract \u2014and Retain \u2014Breast C ancer Patients Breast cancer pati ents are often the most engaged and vocal consumers of cancer care. And because breast tends to be the highest volume tumor site, cancer program leaders need to understand how to appeal to this population , both when they are choosing cancer treatment providers and during the course of their care. The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Surve y reveals that breast cancer patients are unique \u2014they care about a wider range of program features than other cancer patients and they are the most likely to change providers when dissatisfied with their care. Breast cancer patients care about accreditation and ranking When asked which features were most important when selecting a cancer provider, breast cancer patients ranked five features at the top: Doctor who specializes in my particular cancer Technology and treatment options Clinical quality (e.g., survival rates, infection rates) Cancer center is in -network for my insurance Recommendation from my doctor As shown in the graph below, breast cancer patients place importance on a wider range of features compared to other patients. In other words, they are more likely to indicate that every feature is important to them. While other cancer patients clearly prefer the top five features, the distinction is less clear for breast cancer patients. In particular, breast cancer patients place significantly more importance than other cancer patients on: Location (e.g., how close the cancer center is to my home or work) Patient support services (e.g., someone to help coordinate my care, nutrition management) Recommendation from a family me mber or friend Ranking (e.g., ranked by US News and World Report, featured in a \"top doctors\" report) Accreditation (e.g., accredited by the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer) \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 21 advisory.com In fact, breast cancer patients value \"accreditation\" (utility score of 7.6) almost as much as \"recommendation from my doctor\" (utility score of 8.0). To attract self -directed breast cancer patients, cancer programs should highlight the features that matter most to them in marketing efforts and on the cancer program website. Breast cancer patients want support for themselves and their families When asked which services would be most valuable to them during their cancer experience, breast cancer patients ranked the same top four services as other cancer patients. However, compared to other respondents, breast cancer patients place significantly more value on: Financial counseling (e.g., help understanding my bills, help managing my insurance, help finding financial aid) Survivor support services for me after I've fin ished treatment (e.g., counseling, support groups, rehab services) Support services for my family members (e.g., counselors, family support groups, cancer resource center) Social and mental health services for me during treatment (e.g., patient support gro ups, counselors) Complementary and alternative medicine services (e.g., acupuncture, yoga, massage) or referral to such services \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 22 advisory.com Breast cancer patients more likely to change cancer providers The importance of meeting breast cancer patients' needs is underscored by the fact that they are more likely to change providers if they are dissatisfied with their care. Over 61% of survey respondents who switched cancer centers at some point during their care were breast cancer patients.

But they are also motivated to choose a top -notch provider. As cancer patients begin to take more active roles in selecting providers, cancer programs should pay particular attention to the preferences and priorities of one group of patients \u2014the newly diagnosed. Who are the newly diagnosed? The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey defines newly diagnosed patients as respondents who were diagnosed within two months of taking the survey. When compared to the overall respondent profile, the 47 newly diagnosed patients are more likely to be young, female, breast cancer patients. What do newly diagnosed patients want from a cancer care provider? When asked what is most important when deciding where to go for their care, newly diagnosed can cer patients care significantly more about five features: Accreditation (e.g., accredited by the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer) Patient support services (e.g., someone to help coordinate my care, nutrition management) Ranking (e.g., ranked by US News and World Report, featured in a \"top doctors\" report) Location (e.g., how close the cancer center is to my home or work) Recommendation from a family member or friend \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 24 advisory.com What are the implications for cancer care providers? Announce accreditation and ranking front and center . Because newly diagnosed patients care significantly more about accreditation and ranking, cancer program should display this information prominently on their websites . Ensure awareness of support servic es. Cancer programs should also include clear and comprehensive information on patient support services on their websites. Furthermore, everyone in the cancer center should be prepared to describe these services and their value to prospective patients. Which services do newly diagnosed patients value? Newly diagnosed patients' prioritization of support services begs the question: which services do they value most? According to The 2015 Patient Experience Survey , five services top the list: 1. Specialized sym ptom management services (e.g., help managing my pain, fatigue, nausea) 2. All of my care taking place in one building (e.g., imaging, doctor's visits, treatment) 3. Survivor support services for me after I finished treatment (e.g., counseling, support groups, rehab services) 4. Financial counseling (e.g., help understanding my bills, help managing my insurance, help finding financial aid) 5. Multidisciplinary care clinics or meetings where my entire care team discusses my case \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 25 advisory.com As shown below, their priorities differ s ignificantly from patients who are in active treatment or who have completed treatment. This suggests that patients' preferences change over time. Cancer programs need to ensure that their message and services resonate with patients during each phase of ca re. Use the following resources to excel in the areas cancer patients prioritize: Attend one of our national meetings . Leverage the Commission on Cancer Accreditation Crosswalk to achieve accreditation . Use best practices from Oncology Marketing Strategy to advertise to patients and referring physicians alike . \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 26 advisory.com #9: Cancer Patient Preferences Shift as They Move Across the Continuum The type of treatment a patient receives can h ave a significant impact on his/her experience. For example, undergoing surgery is very different from receiving chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a mix of all three. Consequently, the treatmen t modality greatly impacts what matters to cancer patients \u2014both when they're choosing a provider and during their care. Drivers of choice vary across treatment modalities When deciding where to go for their care, patients receiving surgery cared more about the following features than patients who receive d radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy : Doctor who specializes in my particular cancer Technology and treatment options Clinical quality (e.g., survival rates, infection rates) Recommendation from my doct or Cancer center is in -network for my insurance Availability of appointments Compared to patients receiving surgery and/or radiation therapy, chemotherapy patients care significantly more about the following features: Patient support services (e.g., someo ne to help coordinate my care, nutrition management) Accreditation (e.g., accredited by American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer) Ranking (e.g., ranked by US News and World Report, featured in a \"top doctors\" report) In contrast, patients who rec eived radiation therapy care d most about location when choosing a provider. As shown below, the importance of location correlated with frequency of appointments. Patients who have surgery see their care team much less than patients receiving chemotherapy o r radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may require visits on a weekly or biweekly basis, while radiation therapy patients typically receive treatment every day for many weeks. \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 27 advisory.com Improving the patient experience during treatment The services that patients would value most also varied according to treatment modality. Patients receiving surgery care more than radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy patients about: All of my care takes place in one building (e.g., imaging, doctor's vi sits, treatment) One point of contact to answer my questions and help me understand my care Multidisciplinary care clinics or meetings where my entire care team discusses my case A phone line I can call at any time to talk to a nurse about my symptoms (e.g ., nausea, pain) Chemotherapy patients valued the following services than other patients: Financial counseling (e.g., help understanding my bills, help managing my insurance, help finding financial aid) Survivor support services for me after I've finished treatment (e.g., counseling, support groups, rehab services) Complementary and alternative medicine services (e.g., acupuncture, yoga, massage) or referral to such services Support services for my family members (e.g., counselors, family support groups, c ancer resource center) Extended hours of operation (e.g., cancer center is open late Monday -Friday, cancer center is open on weekends) In particular, financial counseling was highly valued \u2014it was the 5th most important service to chemotherapy patients. For best practices on helping cancer patients manage the cost of care, see Cancer Patient Financial Navigation \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 28 advisory.com Patients who received radiation therapy also valued a number of services more than chemotherapy and/or surgery patients: All of my care takes place in one building (e.g., imaging, doctor's visits, treatment) Multidisciplinary care clinics or meetings where my entire ca re team discusses my case Survivor support services for me after I've finished treatment (e.g., counseling, support groups, rehab services) Support services for my family members (e.g., counselors, family support groups, cancer resource center) Patient edu cation services (e.g., chemo class, stress management) Find guidance on developing and marketing a survivorship program, see The Survivorship Chal lenge . \u00a92015 The Advisory Board Company 29 advisory.com #10: Everything Matters to Someone The 2015 Cancer Patient Experience Survey showed that the majority of patients place the highest value on services that improve coordination and convenience . But to be truly patient -centered, cancer programs need to consider the wide range of patients' preferences \u2014and the truth is that every service matters to some of your patients. Maximum utility scores show range of patient preferences Most of our survey an alyses compare average utility scores across features and services. (Utility scores quantify the relative value patients place on any one service.) But we can also analyze the maximum utility score for each service \u2014that is, the highest score any one respon dent gave to a particular service. When the data are presented this way, as in the graph below, it becomes clear that average scores mask real differences among patients. For example, while some patients would never use complementary and alternative medici ne, others highly value this service. Taking a closer look at your patients' needs Cancer program leaders need to assess what matters most to their specific patient population. Even though \"help with nutrition\" scored last in the survey, many cancer programs have discovered high demand among their patients for nutrition counseling. Others have surveyed their patients and found that they want extended complementary and alternative medicine offerings.
