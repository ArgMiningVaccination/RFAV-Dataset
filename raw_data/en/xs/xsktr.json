E-mail: [mukesh.doble0@gmail.com](mailto:mukesh.doble0@gmail.com); [mukeshd@iitm.ac.in](mailto:mukeshd@iitm.ac.in) First published on 8th June 2021 The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by a novel strain of coronavirus namely, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Researchers are working around the clock to control this pandemic and consequent waves of viral reproduction, through repurposing existing drugs as well as designing new vaccines. Several countries have hastened vaccine design and clinical trials to quickly address this outbreak. Currently, more than 250 aspirants against SARS-CoV-2 are in progress, prompting effector mechanisms such as cells/molecules, which target quickly replicating pathogens and neutralize their toxic constituents. Vaccine-stimulated immune effectors include adjuvant, affinity, avidity, affinity maturation, antibodies, antigen-presenting cells, B lymphocytes, carrier protein, CD4+ T-helper cells. In this review, we describe updated information on the various vaccines available over the last two decades, along with recent progress in the ongoing battle developing 63 diverse vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The inspiration of our effort is to convey the current investigation focus on registered clinical trials (as of January 08, 2021) that satisfy the safety and efficacy criteria of international wide vaccine development.

Mumps, like measles infections, are caused by an RNA based virus from the Paramyxoviridae family. Moreover, measles and mumps belong to the genus Rubulavirus, it is a human disease with no animal reservoirs. Generally, the MMR vaccine exhibits side effects of a painful arm from the shot, minor rashes, generally in teen/adult women who have no earlier immunity; then the rubella vaccine component can result in joint and tendon stiffness. This vaccine is also associated with the minor threat of seizures/jerking instigated by fever, but is not connected with any enduring effects. The threat of febrile seizures increases as infants get older, hence this vaccine is recommended at a young age. Some people may experience cheek/neck inflammation, impermanent low platelet counts that generally do not require treatment and are also not life threatening. [9b](#cit9b) In 1955, Jonas Salk initiated an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), after that, Albert Sabin further developed the live, OPV. Even though poliovirus has three serotypes, both vaccines are trivalent and offer good resistivity against poliomyelitis, a limited number of countries have continuously provided IPV. Sabin's OPV vaccine is underused in most countries due to minimising oral management, but it advances immunity in the intestine, which is capable of spreading to others, and is associated with lower cost. [9c](#cit9c) Live-attenuated. Inactivated. Toxoid. Conjugate. Subunit. of non-viral distributed nucleic acid-supported vaccines, which imitate live microorganism infection- or immunization. This leads to T-helper cellular immune responses. In addition, this vaccine development [9e,f](#cit9e) is harmless and consumes less. It does not require extreme infectious organisms, so is safe from infectivity through live transmittable agents and the discharge of harmful pathogenic organisms. These vaccines fill the gap between a virus outbreak and design of a desirable vaccine, wherein they are classified as DNA/RNA based pentose-carbon sugar motif. The remarkable growth of RNA-associated vaccines resulted in the growth of mRNA based vaccines. It is quite significant to note that mRNA vaccines provide many valuable benefits when compared to viral vectored- and DNA Medicines Vaccine (IPV)||IPV provides serum immunity to each poliovirus (three types) and defence against any ensuing paralysis causative disease (poliomyelitis). The mucosal immunity level in the intestine is less than that afforded by OPV, this difference may slightly show in the pharyngeal mucosal lining.

CD8+ T cells do not inhibit infection but work to minimize, regulate, and remove intracellular pathogens through: (a) direct destruction of infected cells (discharge of perforin - a pore forming cytolytic protein present in cytotoxic (NK) proteases cytoplasmic granules inside cytotoxic T cells and NK cells); (b) destroy infected cells with antimicrobial cytokine release. CD4+ T cells do not inhibit infection, however they contribute in the minimization, regulation, and refinement of extra- and intra-cellular pathogens with their control and cytokine-development capabilities. The main examples of CD4+ T cells are: (a) Follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells yielding predominantly interleukin (IL)-21 providing assistance to B-cells; (b) T-helper 1 (Th1) effector cells yield interferon (IFN)-, (TNF)-/TNF-, IL-2, and provide a major role in controlling intracellular pathogens e.g., viruses and bacteria such as M. tuberculosis; (c) Th2 effector cells generate IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and such as bacteria and helminths; (d) Th9 effector cells generate IL-9 and also Th17 effector generate IL-17, IL-22, and IL-26 and participate in mucosal protection (for example against, S. pneumoniae, B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis). The main target of immunization through vaccination is to inhibit specific infections and their unavoidable difficulties. The best vaccine is the one which concomitantly accomplishes the following criteria such as: (a) Actively inhibit the infective disease or else minimize the adverse effects of the disease; (b) Offer a strong and continuing defence against a specific disease; (c) Improves immunity through a minimum quantity of administrations; (d) Deliver abundant antigens to afford wide-ranging safety against infection; (e) Never results in side effects, or keeps them to a minimum; (f) Remains stable under storage conditions, preferably mild storage conditions, for its shelf-life; (g) Can be produced on a huge scale; (h) Should be economical and easily available. Herein we consider the COVID-19 pandemic, the main resolution of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are: (a) Inhibition of characteristic clinical symptoms so hospitalization is avoided, and reduces severe infectivity; (b) Prevention of disease spreading before the corresponding antibodies are produced (sero conversion) (c) Producing a strong neutralizing immune response able to link with the viral protein spike (S) that must prevent it from attaching to human cells. From this perspective, the various immunological response effects which neutralize antibodies and CD8+ T cells are most significant. The antibodies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 alert the host organism's immune response to the presence of the virus; such antibodies are immunoglobulins, which are appropriately split into IgA, IgM, IgG, and less frequently IgD. Prior serological antibody model responses to viral infections have usually proven the subsequent sequence of these antibodies resulting from virus infection: the antibodies of IgA are primary, which are followed by IgM, IgG-type continues at high levels for a longer time than the preceding ones (IgA and IgM). For certain viruses, sometimes the antigen (the virus itself) co-occurs with antibodies, particularly with the antibodies of primary IgA and IgM. Further, viruses have a \"serological window,\" i.e., a period between the initial arrival of the antigen (in the blood) and the antibody response, thus phase intervals of infection occur. Eventually, IgG-type antibodies are specific to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and can be examined through chemiluminescence immunological routes, which is an automated laboratory process using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with higher arrangement. The examination mostly identifies the body's immune response to SARS CoV-2 infection. Initially, the taxonomy of coronaviruses are split in to three groups, on account of genetic and serological interactions, the first set (Group-1) comprised several viruses including the porcine epidemic the previously identified coronavirus of HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. Whilst the second combination (Group-2) consists of (ECoV). In a similar pattern, the third group (Group-3) contains the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Turkey coronavirus (TCoV). Now, the SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) cannot be associated with any of these representative groups, however they possess some similarities along with the second group coronaviruses. [91a](#cit91) The battle between scientists and viral infections is a perpetual process and thus the identification of specific potential drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity is a continuous aim. Globally, this is the first time, that scientific researchers, diplomats, politicians, and capitalists have convened to work towards a common objective. The FDA approved drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to be utilized in critical illness cases, but clinical practices were still becoming overwhelmed by CoV cases. The suggestion to employ extensive use of these antiviral drugs was not sufficient. Certain polymerase nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors are promising agents. Favipiravir a selective viral RdRp inhibitor, has been tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Furthermore, the antiviral drugs lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, nelfinavir, serine rosovastatin, alpha inhibitors, interleukin 1 receptor antagonists; Janus kinases (JAK) as well as monoclonal antibodies, tocilizumab, baricitinib and ruxolitinib etc., along with their combinations and other antiviral components, are also under investigation in clinical studies to combat COVID-19. In the future, researchers are requested to accumulate their results to provide more knowledge to repurpose significant drugs appropriately, and provide cheap drugs with the minimum toxicity profile. [91b,c](#cit91b) [Table 3](#tab3) and [4](#tab4) provide a comprehensive overview of the current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, their mode of action, their utility and the name of the manufacturer. [99](#cit99) More than 10 vaccines have almost reached the approval stage, while many are in the preclinical stage. [Fig. 4](#imgfig4) portrays the number of vaccine aspirants which are under clinical (63 drug aspirants) and preclinical (172 drug aspirants) stages against nCOVID-19. [99a](#cit99a) Protein-based techniques seem to be the most popular among the various mechanisms (see https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines). |Fig. 4 nCOVID-19 vaccine aspirants at the clinical (63 drug aspirants) and preclinical (172 drug aspirants) stage.| | | |ID||Vaccine division acronym||Vaccine sector description||Vaccine category composition||Characteristic nature of vaccination||Producers||Clinical phases||Vaccine utility for other viruses||Ref.| | | It is important to discuss here that \"effectiveness\" and \"efficacy\" are different. [100b](#cit100b) Efficacy states how a vaccine performs in ideal lab circumstances, like those present in clinical trials. Whereas, effectiveness means how the vaccine works in normal, non-controlled conditions. For example, in a clinical trial, 90% efficacy refers to 90% lower disease rates in the group getting the vaccine compared with the sample group. But, the members in a group selected for a clinical trial have to be in good health and young and they usually have no underlying health conditions. Besides, medical researchers will not generally consider some demographics in these clinical research studies like children/pregnant women. Thus, once a vaccine is able to prevent disease in clinical trials, we may observe the effectiveness drop when directed to different demographics. Vaccines do not necessarily need high effectiveness to protect several thousands of lives from disease. For instance, the vaccine for flu [100c](#cit100c) has 40-60% effectiveness according to CDC data. During 2018-19, this vaccine prevented millions of influenza cases and its associated illness, but determining the exact effectiveness rate is challenging. Dosages can also increase effectiveness for some vaccines. The two doses of a vaccine can give a protection boost, nevertheless this advantage is sometimes limited to only certain groups like children/organ transplanted people. The booster dosage may not provide an advantage in people aged 65 years. Through comparing vaccines, like the ones for polio and measles, we see heavy dosages are needed to realize effectiveness. Polio vaccines [100d](#cit100d) should be up to 100% effective. According to the CDC, \"Two inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) dosages have 90% effectiveness; 99-100% effective.\" The IPV vaccine prevents poliomyelitis (poliovirus), which can activate infection in the brain and spinal cord leading to paralysis. The MMR vaccine [100e](#cit100e) defends against measles, mumps, and rubella, which tends to have up to 97% effectiveness at inhibiting measles once directed in two dosages. A single dose is around 93% effective, as reported by the CDC. They suggest to give the initial dose at \"12-15 months of age, followed by the second dose at 4-6 years.\" In order to determine the similarities and differences between previously available vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis is provided as one more example; it confers a wide range of immunity against other infections, and it also may minimize the intensity of COVID-19. Moreover one epidemiological analyses provided universal connections between the vaccinations of BCG and COVID-19 mortality: the suggestion of BCG vaccination results on COVID-19 fatality are dominated by socio-economical and demographical variations between countries. In the wake of reducing the manifold distracting factors, many substantial connections between the BCG vaccination and decreased COVID-19 fatalities were perceived. Obviously this investigation emphasizes the necessity for an intrinsic mechanism of studies supporting BCG vaccination effects on COVID-19, and also for clinical evaluation to control the COVID-19 pandemic. [99b](#cit99b) COVID-19 is a serious respiratory related disease, so the scientific and medicinal community are working hard across the globe to develop a vaccine. Presently, around sixty vaccine candidates are on trial in many countries. Now, nearing twenty candidate vaccines are in phase 3 clinical trials. Gratifyingly, seven vaccines have been approved in many countries. Similarly, different demographics may necessitate the need for designing vaccines with different mechanisms of action. The time required for the various stages of clinical trials needs to be shortened (without compromising on the ethics and safety) to achieve the desired goal in a short period of time. [154b](#cit154b) Finally, manufacturing such large quantities of the vaccine or vaccines, quickly (without compromising on the quality, purity and efficacy) and distributing them to all parts of the world is another problem which the present planners have not faced before. This requires sufficient manufacturing capacity, availability of raw materials, logistics and several other factors. Also, as all resources are diverted towards SARS-CoV-2, epidemiologists and public health organizations should not lose track of their fight against other viruses. [155](#cit155) The current assemblage of vaccine developers [156a](#cit156) may reward researchers with increased capability, as numerous basic, transformational and preclinical statistical data have become available during coronavirus exploration. These factors combine together as a substantial promising source for rapid vaccine development. [156b](#cit156b) Since, December 2020, some new vaccines have emerged and also have been approved by certain national regulatory authorities for use against COVID-19. Amongst these, as per the universal expectations of the WHO EUL/PQ assessment, the Pfizer vaccine and some other candidates have been approved. More studies on vaccine aspirant efficacy and safety results, [157](#cit157) including on the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccine, therein have been widely reported, and AstraZeneca have published their results in well reputed journals. Thus we are eagerly expecting more potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates will be offered to governing authorities for approval in the coming years. Gratifyingly, the growth of many efficient COVID-19 vaccine aspirants under clinical trials is fascinating. When the vaccine candidates are proven to be benign and efficient, they need to be acknowledged by the governing authorities, produced to the necessary standard, and distributed. WHO is collaborating all over the world to assist with the roles in this process, which includes facilitating reasonable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for everyone. |This journal is \u00a9 The Royal "}
