Public health surveillance, as de ned by the World Health Organization, includes the systematic collection, collation, and analysis of data coupled with the timely dissemination o f information for assessment and public health response. Inte gral to its public health mandate, the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) is committed to sharing valuable information obtained through its active surveillance of rare diseases and uncommon conditions in Canadian children and youth. Ke y results o f CPSP multi-year studies and one-time surveys are published in this annual, bilingual report. These results highlight important ndings and inform health professionals, researchers, and policy makers in developing strategies to improve the health of children and youth in Canada .

Ottawa , 2018www.cpsp.cps.caExamp le: Medical assistance in dyingCPSP Surveillance in Action Survey results were shared with the Council of Canadian Academies providing critical evidence to inform the inde pendent report to Parliament . Survey results were central to the Canadian Paediatric Societ y Position Statement on MAID. Survey results garnered signi cant national and local media coverage. Public health surveillance is an essential tool that involves the detection , deduction , and dissemination o f information regarding emerging issues a ffecting children and youth . Deduction Paediatricians re ported explorator y discuss ions about an d explicit requests for MAID from both min ors and parents on behal f of minor child ren. Discuss ions an d explicit requests from parents outnumbered those b y minors by more t han 5:1 . A large proportion o f discussions and re quests for MAID from parents involved an infant or neonate.The CPSP issued a one-time survey to 2,700 participating paediatricians and subspecialists asking how often Canadian paediatricians engage in exploratory conversations about or receive explicit requests for MAID.DetectionFollowin g the Carter v. Canada decision (Supreme Court of Canada, 2015 ), Bill C-14 was passed in June 2016 allowin g medical assistance in dyin g (MAID ) for competent adults under speci c circumstances. An independent review o f mature minors and their potential eligibility for MAID was commissioned by Parliament. There were no Canadian data on the demand for MAID b y mature minors .

C., M.P . The Government of Canada is comm itted to support ing child health. That's why I'm prou d that the Public Health A gency of Canada collaborates with the Canadian Paediatric Societ y to support the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram. Monitoring rare an d emer ging childh ood diseases, conditions, and public health issues is fundamental to ou r ability to advance ear ly detect ion an d treatment to support the health of young Canadians across the country . The evidence and data produced b y the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram provides health professionals, researchers, and polic y makers with the crucial in formation they need to do their work in improvin g the health and well-bein g of our children. It is also a trusted and valued public health resource within the federal health portfolio. I'm impressed b y the leadership that the Canadian Paediatric Society has shown in advancing children's health through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program fo r more t han 20 years. I wou ld like to t hank paediatricians an d paediatric subspecialists for their e fforts in producin g this annua l resu lts report.Chief Public Health Of cer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam Surveillance s ystems contribute vital in formation for describing and understan ding health conditions as well as providing a foundation for evidence- based decision-ma king for prevention and treatment. The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) continues to play a key role in monitorin g for less common paediatric disorders and emerging conditions. In the over 20 years o f its operation, the CPSP has advanced our knowledge of these conditions and contr ibuted to researc h and pract ice, improv ing health outcomes for young Canadians . The CPSP is uniquely able to levera ge the collective intelli gence and insi ght of paediatricians and paediatric countr y, which facilitates timel y identi cation o f new and emer ging threats and risks to child health. Extending its co llaborative approac h across borders, the CPSP also partici pates in the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units, which provides a platform for Canada and other countries to share and bene t from each other's ex periences . As Chief Public Health Of cer of Canada, I am proud to present the Canadian Paediatric Societ y's Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram 2017 Results report. This re port demonstrates how e ffective and fl exible the CPSP is in capturin g diverse and complex mental and physical health issues, including menta l health issues such as serious sel f-harm requirin g hospital admission; commun icable diseases disease an d congen ital Zika syn drome; an d chronic diseases suc h as type 2 diabetes. I would like to thank the Canadian Paediatric Societ y and its network o f paediatricians and paediatric sub-s pecialists across the countr y for their support and dedication to the ongoing success of the CPSP . Your work supports us all as we work to gether to maintain and improve the health o f Canadian children and youth. 4 CPSP 2017 RE SULTSPresident of the Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Michael Dicki nson As the President of the Canadian Paediatric Societ y (CPS) in 2017 - 2018, I had the opportun ity to see rsthand how data generated from the CPSP pla yed an important role in the formation o f policies, educational material, and recommendations from both the CPS and public health authorities. If we look at the one-time surve ys the CPSP conducted in 2017, surve illance resu lts are imme diately taken into action. The results o f the survey on providin g care to children and youth from military familie shighligh ted that professional develo pment activities are needed to increase awareness o f the unique issues facing this population. A new online educational module for clinicians was developed b y the CPS, in partnership with Militar y Famil y Services, to provide this much-needed information. The surve y results on vaccine hesitanc y and vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs ) showed that res pondents feel that 35 % of the vaccine hesitant parents the y have encountere d, whose c hild had contracte d a VPD, wou ld still choose not to vaccinate in the future. We have a lon g way to go in reassurin g parents that vaccines are sa fe and effective, and survey ndin gs will be used to in form public education programs and educational modules for health care providers. In the survey on me dical canna bis use by children and youth, 68 % of respondents who reported havin g encountered paediatric patients using cannabis for medical purposes, stated that less than hal f of their patients had bene ted from its use. These results will be used to advocate for investments in research on the sa fety, ef cacy, dosin g, and potential indications for medical cannabis in the paediatric population. None o f this work would be possible without the collaboration and support o f the Public Health A gency o f Canada and the 2,700 paediatricians and subs pecialists who dedicate t ime to diligently report cases an d comp lete the detailed clinical questionnaires. On behalf of the CPS and the Board o f Directors, I would like to sincerel y than k you for your commitment to helpin g us advance knowled ge on rare paediatric diseases .CPSP Chair Dr. Jonat hon Maguire As 2017 was drawin g to a close, I found myself refl ectin g that the CPSP has once a gain had an impress ive year. The CPSP Steering Committee and invest igators wor ked hard to launc h ve new studies on the followin g topics: con genital Zika syn drome, complex re gional pain syndrome, in fantile and later-onset Pompe disease, type 2 diabetes, and self-harm requiring I CU admissions. The foundation o f the pro gram remains solid and our fruitful collaboration with the Public Health A gency of Canada is stron ger than ever. Not only do we continue to monitor for acute fl accid paral ysis to ensure Canada remains polio - free, and to monitor for serious and li fe-threatening adverse drug reactions, but the CPSP demonstrated fl exibility respons iveness to emer ging issues including congenital Zika syndrome and the use o f medical cannabis in children and youth. Over the past year, under the excellent leadership o f Dr. Charlotte Moore He pburn, a balance was struck between surveillance o f rare diseases and severe com plications o f more common ones. As we all know from ex perience, lac k of information on rare diseases or severe com plications is challen ging for individual patients and their families. Bein g able to offer knowledge gained through CPSP surveillance helps families to better understand these conditions and provides evidence for ph ysicians on appropriate evaluation and treatment. We have also advanced CPSP knowled ge translation activities throu gh inte gration with CPS workin g groups an d policy experts. We hope t hat you en joy the new format of this report which was desi gned to make CPSP results easie r to understand than ever. So, does your participation in CPSP surveillance make a difference ? The answer is a resoundin g YES! For many conditions, the CPSP is the onl y available source of reliable information. The dedication and faithful reportin g of more than 2,700 paediatricians an d paediatric subspecialists have produced important data that cont inues to lead to important chan ges in clinical practice and public health policy. A bi g thank you is extended to members of the CPSP Steering Committee, new and seasoned CPSP investi gators, and paediatricians and subs pecialists across Canada. None of this would be poss ible you! 5 CPSP 2017 stren gth of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram is its commitment to improve the health of children and youth in Canada and around the world. This focus would not be possible without the partici pation of Canadian paediatricians, subspecialists, and other health care providers in the monthl y collection o f information on rare paediatric conditions, the principal investigators who design studies an d analyse the data to prov ide knowledge an d educational solutions, or t he guidance of the Steering Committee members. We thank them all . We also thank IMPA CT (Immunization Monitorin g Program A CTive) centres for r role in veri fying the acute fl accid paralysis study data and for their support o f the CPSP. The strong partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Public Health Agency of Canada allows the program to grow in Canada and to take a leadership role on t he internat ional scene . Fundin g for the CPSP is required to support pro gram mana gement. The surveillance program is funded throu gh a combination o f government support and unrestricted grants from Canadian charities, research institutions, hospitals, and corporations. All funding is provided to maintain and expand the program .

The CPSP gathers data from over 2,700 paediatricians an d paediatric subspecialists eac h mont h to mon itor rare diseases and conditions in Canadian children. Objectives Maintain an act ive nat ional surve illance system t hat mon itors low- frequency, hi gh-impact conditions and diseases in Canadian children and youth Involve paediatricians, paediatric subspecialists, an d other me dical professionals in related disci plines in the surveillance o f rare conditions that are o f public health and medical im portance Generate new knowled ge into rare childhood disorders to facilitate improvements in treatment, prevention, and health-care plannin g Respond rapidly to public health emergencies relevant to Canadian children an d yout h by initiating rapid one-t ime surveys an d new stu dies Participate in international paediatric surveillance e fforts throu gh the International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INOPSU) Surveillance The full surveillance process is summarized in Fi gure 1 and includes the 3Ds o f surveillance: detection , deduction , and dissemination. Health surveillance can be de ned as: the tracking o f any health event or health determinant throu gh the continuous collection o f high-quality data (detection ); the inte gration, analysis, and interpretation of the data (deduction ) into surveillance products; and the dissemination of those surveillance products to those who need to know (dissemination ). Process Study teams from across Canada are encouraged to submit proposals fo r new studies or one-time surve ys that meet the \"criteria for website at www.cpsp.cps.ca /apply-proposez . The CPSP Steerin g Committee then reviews the proposals on a biannual basis and selects those o f highest medical and public health importance. Proposa ls are eva luated against set cr iteria and are su bject to comprehensive feedback from the multidisciplinary Steerin g Committee, composed of representatives from the Public Health A gency of Canada, the Canadian Paediatric Society, former CPSP investi gators, academic clinicians from diverse specialties, and communit y paediatricians. Each month, CPSP participants from across Canada receive a form listin g the current conditions under study. Participants notify the pro gram i f they have seen any cases or have \"nothin g to report. \"About the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program Did you know? The CPSP celebrated its 2 0th anniversar y in 2016. The CPSP is com prised of over 2,700 dedicated paediatricians an d paediatric subspecialists. Since its ince ption, the CPSP has studied 69 rare conditions /diseases and initiated 46 one-t ime surve ys. Over 60 peer-reviewed manuscri pts on y/surve y results have been published in high-impact journa ls. The avera ge monthly response rate is 80 %. The avera ge detailed quest ionna ire res ponse rate varies between 80 to 90 %. By December 2017, 78 % of participants committed to receivin g their monthly forms electronicall y.CPSP Quick Facts Figure 1 - Surveillance process summary 8 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS Partici pants who have seen a case are sent a detailed clinical questionnaire to com plete and return to the CPSP. The completed clinical questionnaire is stripped o f all unique identi ers and sent to the principal investigator o f the study for data anal ysis. It is important to note that CPSP studies use anonymized data from patient charts; the study investi gators have no direct contact w ith individual patients. The study team is responsible for data analysis, and for ensuring that a solid knowledge translation plan is in place to disseminate the results in a timely and e ffective manner. Study results are published annuall y and acted upon to improve the health of Canadian children and youth. For example, CPSP study results help to warn of emergent public health issues, identify safety hazards, mobilize knowledge on rare diseases /conditions, and inform new policies and guidelines. Response rates The CPSP's average national monthly response rate is 80% and the average detailed questionnaire completion rate varies between 80 to 90 %.

The networ k provides a success ful and easil y accessible plat form for international surveillance. No other networ k enables international comparisons o f demo graphics, dia gnosis, treatments, and outcomes for rare childhood conditions. Established in 1998, IN OPSU now includes 16 paediatric surveillance units amon g its membership. Full member countries are Australia , Canada , Netherlands , New Zealand , Switzerland , United Kingdom, and Wales. Af liate members are: Germany, Belgium, Scotland, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece /Cyprus as well as the British Ophthalmology Surveillance Unit, the British Neurology Surveillance Unit, and the UK Obstetrics Surveillance System . Incredibly, many o f the paediatric surveillance units have been collectin g data on rare childhood conditions for 20 years or more. Over 300 rare conditions have been studied to date, includin g rare infectious and vaccine-preventable diseases, mental health disorders, c hild injuries, an d immuno logical conditions. The networ k encompasses approx imate ly 10,000 c hild health care providers who voluntaril y contribute data on these rare diseases ever y month . The CPSP is looking forward to the next IN OPSU meeting in 2020. During IN OPSU meetings, member countries have the opportunity to highlight their surveillance program activities, explore innovative study ideas o f interest to the network, discuss knowledge translation and joint publication opportunities, as well as strategize on how best to maintain active engagement o f participants. 10 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS Question Did Canada maintain its polio-free status in 2017 ? Importance Acute fl accid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is the cornerstone of monitorin g for polio, in li ght of on going transmission of wild poliovirus in a few countries around the world. Canada conducts AFP surveillance in children under 15 years of a ge, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and standards o f practice . Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition Acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis characterized as fl accid (reduced tone ) without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma ) in a child less than 15 years of a ge. Transient weakness (e.g., post-ictal weakness ) does not meet the case de nition . Unique to this study Cases are captured throu gh both the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) and Canada's Immunization Monitorin g Program A CTive (IMPA CT) based in 12 tertiary care paediatric centres . Results - January to December 2017 Note: Due to reportin g delay, this report represents a snapshot as o f February 5, 2018 for cases that occurred between January 1, 2017 and December 31 , 2017 . Con rmed cases In total, 32 cases of AFP were reported to the Public Health A gency of Canada: 13 (40%) cases were reported throu gh the CPSP network and 19 (60%) cases were reported throu gh IMPA CT. All AFP cases were adjudicated a gainst the national AFP and polio case de nitions . At the time o f analysis, 20 cases were con rmed as meetin g the AFP case de nition; none were assesse d to be polio. The avera ge time from case onset to reportin g was 55 days (range: 8 to 189 ). Demographics There were 11 (55%) males and 9 (45%) females. Cases ran ged in a ge from youn ger than 1 year to 14 years, with a mean of 6.3 years (95% CI 3.9-8.8 ) and a median of 4.8 years.Surveillance Studies in 2017 Acute fl accid paralysis Ongoing study since January 1996 Principal investigator Robert Pless, MD, M Sc, Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases, Public Health A gency o f Canada; robert. pless@canada.c a SULTSPresentation Hospitalization: All 20 (100%) cases were hospitalized and len gth of stay ran ged from 1 to 24 days with a mean of 11 days (95% CI 7.3-14.8 ) and a median of 10 days . Vaccinations: 13 (65%) cases were u p-to-date for their vaccinations. Dia gnoses: 12 (60%) cases were Guillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome. remainin g eight cases hy. No stool sam ples were positive for polio. Treatment and outcomes Of the 13 (65%) cases that had outcome documented at the time o f initial re port, all had part ially recovere d with residual weakness. Nine (45%) cases had the clinical outcome re ported at least 60 da ys after the onset o f paral ysis or weakness; all o f these cases had either fully or partiall y recovered . Study limitations As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, includin g under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups of children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as the y may be less likel y to receive timel y specialist care. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as pendin g test results or travel and immunization histor y, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore ma y be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that allow Canada to maintain its polio-free status. Stool samples in patients with AFP are sometimes dif cult to obtain due to the nature of the patient's symptoms, including constipation. Additionally, rapid availability o f advanced dia gnostic testin g often identi es the dia gnosis prior to the collection o f the stoo l sam ple. Conclusions There was suf cient evidence to suggest that no polio cases occurred in Canada even though Canada did not meet the WH O performance indicators for national AFP surveillance in 2017 . Anticipated study impact Canada's polio-free status remains intact . In its efforts to continue to support the Polio End game Strategy and stren gthen AFP surveillance, Canada is updatin g the protocol fo r the investi gation o f AFP and the national case de nition for polio . Acknowled gement s The investi gators would like to thank everyone who participated in collectin g the data. They would also like to acknowled ge the excellent work of Shalini Desai, Anada Silva, Jenne Cunliffe, Susan Squires, and Marc-Andr \u00e9 Beaulieu .TABLE 1 - Measure of Canada's performance a gainst WH O AFP surve illance performance indicators in 20171 Number 20% 45% * Target is 1.0 AFP case per 100,000 population in those less than 15 years o f age Target is at least 80 % of con rmed cases have adequate stool sampling Target is at least 80 % have follow-up examination for residual paralysis at least 60 days a fter onset 1.

Presentation The 29 cases were classi ed as serious accordin g to the followin g criteria (more than one cause for classi cation was provided in 11 re ports): 7 cases were considered to be life - threatening, 19 cases required hospitalization, fewer than 5 cases reporte d disability, and 12 cases were cons idered to be medicall y important (de ned as a case that ma y not be immediately life-threatenin g or result in death / hospitalization but ma y jeopar dize the pat ient or requ ire intervention to prevent one o f these other outcomes from occurrin g). Fewer than ve deaths were re ported . The majorit y of the adverse reaction reports described skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. This nding is cons istent w ith the tren d seen w ith all reports rece ived throu gh the CPSP since 2004 . The majority o f the reports described reactions generally documented in the approved Canadian product monograph (CPM) or other drug information references . Treatment and outcomes The outcome was known in most of the 29 cases, with the majority of patients (20/29, 69% ) having fully recovered. Study limitations All adverse reactions (ARs) to health products are considered sus picions as a de nite causal association often cannot be determined. The true incidence of ARs is unknown because ARs remain under-re ported and total patient ex posure is unknown . As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, includin g under-representation o f ARs in the population. It is possible that some groups o f children were missed, for examp le those w ho live in rura l or remote areas, as t hey may be less likely to rece ive timely spec ialist care. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as laboratory investigations, pre-existing medical conditions, and relevant components o f the diagnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore ma y be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understandin g of serious and li fe-threatenin g paediatric adverse drug react ions. Conclusions The class of health product most frequently suspected of causin g adverse reaction (s) reported in 2017 was antibacterials fo r systemic use, followed b y antiepileptics. Since the implementation of the CPSP surveillance for adverse reactions in 2004, these two classes, along with psychoanaleptics, have been the most frequently associated with suspect products.TABLE 1 - Suspect health products in 201 7 Class of health produc t Name o f for s ystemic use iximab Muscle relaxants Rocu ronium Natural health product s Oil of winter green Other therapeutic a gents Deferiprone, diazoxide Vitamins Vitamin D * Combination product containin g two or more active in gredients14 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS Amoxicillin and carbamazepine continue to be the most frequently reported suspect dru gs in the antibacterial and antiepileptic classes respectively. Althou gh no reports o f psychoanaleptics that met the study criteria were received in 2017, methylphenidate remains the most frequently reported dru g in this class based on cumulative data from previous years. Anticipated study impact Health Canada reco gnizes the need to stren gthen information related to paediatric health, as the use of medications to treat children is increasin g, and the sa fety and e f cacy o f these medications may be si gni cantly di fferent in paediatric patients than in adult patients.1, 2 The on going sharin g of safety in formation throu gh voluntary reportin g of adverse dru g reactions from various sources such as the CPSP is valuable to Health Canada as it contributes to ongoing monitoring of the bene t-risk pro le of health products used in children and can thus result in the implementation o f risk mitigation measures.

Importance ARFID is an eatin g disorder rst described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th editio n(DSM-5) associated with signi cant medical and psychiatric comorbidity . ARFID presents with the key clinical features o f avoiding or restricting food intake without distorted cognitions about weight and shape as seen in patients w ith anorex ia nervosa . Incidence estimates o f ARFID ran ge from 6 to 14 % in tertiary care paediatric eatin g disorder centres; however, there are no data on the incidence o f ARFID in community settings . Limited in formation exists on the diagnosis, clinical features, course, and treatment o f ARFID in children and adolescents. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition Any child or adolescent from age 5 up to the patient's 18th birthday, seen in the previous month with a newly diagnosed eating o r feedin g disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eatin g or food, avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food, concern about aversive consequences of eatin g), as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and /or ener gy needs associated with one (or more ) of the following: Signi cant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children ) Signi cant nutritional de ciency Dependence on enteral feedin g or oral nutritional supplements Marked inter ference with psychosocial functionin g Exclusion criteria The feedin g or eatin g disturbance is: A r esult of lack of available food A result o f culturall y sanctioned practice Attributed to anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa Associated with abnormalities in the way in which the young person perceives his/her body weight or shape Explained by another medical or mental disorder, so that i f treated, the feedin g or eatin g disturbance will go awa y Results - January 2016 to December 2017 Con rmed cases At the time o f analysis, 180 cases were con rmed over 24 months.

Norris, MD, FR CPC, Children's and @cheo.on.ca Co-investigators Spettigue SULTS The avera ge age was 13.0 years (SD = 3.2 ). The number of children (%) in each a ge ran ge was as follows: 23 (13%) 5 to 8 years, 83 (46%) 9 to 12 years, and 74 (41%) 13 to 17 years . Geographic location was reported as follows: 44 (24%) cases from Western Canada, 128 (71%) cases from Central Canada, and 8 (4%) cases from Atlantic Canada. The majority of cases, 142 (79%), were White; 10 additional population groups were reported . Presentation The avera ge length of illness prior to dia gnosis was 34 months (SD = 40.5 ). The most common abnormal eatin g behaviours reported were: 148 (82%) cases with food avoidance, 129 (72%) cases with a loss of appetite or little or no desire to eat, 126 (70%) cases with an apparent lack of interest in eatin g or food, 160 (89%) cases were eatin g but not eatin g enou gh, 128 (71%) cases were eatin g but avoidin g certain foods, and 129 (72%) cases were not initiatin g eatin g or seekin g out food as expected . Cases presented with clinical si gns includin g: 116 (64%) with marked interference with psychosocial functionin g, 104 (58%) with signi cant wei ght loss, 103 (57%) with failure to achieve expected wei ght gain, 60 (33%) with dependence on enteral feedin g or oral nutritional supplements, 52 (29%) with faltering growth, and 47 (26%) with signi cant nutritional de ciency . The most common psychiatric comorbidities seen among reported cases were: 87 (48%) with anxiety, 24 (13%) with attentio n de cit h yperactivit y disorder, 19 (11%) with depression, 16 (9%) with autism spectrum disorder, and 13 (7%) with obsessive - compulsive disorder. Treatment and outcomes At the time of the report, ARFID cases were receivin g the followin g treatments: 151 (84%) medical monitorin a dietician, 94 (52%) psychoeducation, 94 (52%) family therapy, and 61 (34%) individual therapy. Hospitalizations had occurred in 71 (39%) cases. Of those hospitalized, the most common reasons for hospitalization were: 16 (23%) for medical instability, 16 (23%) for wei ght or growth concerns, and 9 (13%) for food refusal . Study limitations As with any voluntary reportin g surveillance system, the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) reco gnizes that reportin g on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, includin g under-representation o f the disease in the population. It is possible that some groups o f children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as they may be less likely to rece ive timely spec ialist care. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as social history, past psychiatric illness, and relevant components o f the dia gnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point of care and there fore may be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understanding of Canadian-speci c epidemiology on ARFID in children and youth. Paediatricians may lack awareness of and comfort with applying the D SM-5 criteria to a relatively newly recognized eating disorde r in children and adolesce nts. Conclusions At present, a si gni cant period o f time elapses between the onset o f symptoms and receivin g a dia gnosis o f ARFID. Improvements in the identi cation o f ARFID are necessar y to accelerate access to appropriate treatment . Each of the D SM-5 dia gnostic criteria for ARFID was reported in this study. The majority o f patients with ARFID were female; however, a hi gher percenta ge of males with ARFID was reported than is found in older adolesce nts and adults with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

Importance Lyme disease is a mu lti-system illness cause d by the tick-borne bacter iumBorrelia bur gdorferi. Symptoms often present in the weeks followin g a tick bite with the characteristic erythema mi grans rash, or later, with heart, joint, skin, or nervous system illness represent ing dissem inated Lyme disease . Accurate estimates of the burden of illness in Canadian children are not available. The incidence of Lyme disease is expected to increase as the vector tick populations s pread further into parts of southern Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Manitoba. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition A patient less than 16 years o f age with Lyme disease, meetin g the followin g criteria : Con rmed L yme disease - Patient ful lls one of two conditions: 1.

A ge ran ges were reported as follows: 34 (35%) a ged 0 to 5 years, 35 (37%) a ged 6 to10 years, 26 (27%) aged 11 to 15 years, and in 1 (1%) case a ge was unknown . No signi cant gender difference was seen. Where sex was recorded, 47 (49%) were male and 40 (42%) were female. Sex was not recorded for nine (9%) cases. Eighty-one percent of cases were from two provinces: 40 (42%) from Nova Scotia and 37 (39%) from Ontario. Nine (9%) cases were reported from Quebec and the remainin g 10 cases were from British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Presentation Most dia gnoses (66, 69% ) were made durin g the main May to October tick activity season . Manifestations of Lyme disease were as follows: 25 (26%) cases were early Lyme disease (i.e., a sin gle erythema mi grans [EM] lesion ), 15 (16%) cases were early disseminated Lyme disease (i.e., multiple EM, neurolo gical and /or cardiac symptoms ), and 56 (58%) cases were late disseminated L yme disease (arthritis ). Treatment and outcomes Sixty-four (67%) cases recovered followin g one course of antibiotic treatment (the most common included amoxicillin, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone ). In 13 (14%) cases a second course of antibiotics was given . In 19 (20%) cases treatment and outcome were unknown or not indicated. Study limitations As with any voluntary reportin g surveillance system, the CPSP reco gnizes that reportin g on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, includin g under-representation o f the disease in the population. It is possible that some groups o f children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as they may be less likely to receive timely specialist care. Lower than expected reportin g of Lyme disease occurred, potentially due to the dia gnosis bein g made by non- CPSP practitioners. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, includin g exposure risk, were not ava ilable in many cases. This may be due to t he delay between pat ient consu ltation an d quest ionna ire comp letion as we ll as the delay between in fection exposure and the development o f clinical mani festations o f Lyme disease. Data elements missin g from the charts are absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an im portant purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow us to better understand the Canadian-speci c epidemiolo gy and the impact of childhood Lyme disease. Conclusions Over the three year study period, 96 cases of Lyme disease were reported from ei ght provinces with 81% of cases from Nova Scotia and Ontario . The median a ge of reported cases was 7 years . Late disseminated L yme disease (arthritis ) was a common presentation in this cohort of Canadian children. This ma y be due to the fact that consultant paediatricians are more likely to see later mani festations o f Lyme disease than acute Lyme disease, which would be handled in the acute care sett ing. Anticipated study impact Study results will lead to a better understandin g of the spectrum of clinical presentation of Lyme disease amon g children in Canada, as we ll as the diagnost ic met hods and treatments use d. Study results allow for further identi cation of geographical risk areas for Lyme disease, and permit tar geted disease prevention strate gies in those re gions where front-line medical practitioners most need in formation on the appropriate dia gnosis and treatment of L yme disease .

What are the pathways o f referral, clinical presentation, diagnostic interventions, and recommended interventions by paediatricians and pain specialists ? Importance CRPS is a chronic severe pain condition that involves peripheral, central, and autonomic nervous s ystem and immune s ystem mechanisms. It results in greater functional impairment and symptoms than other chronic pain conditions. The persistent and severe pain results in psycholo gical, physical, and neurolo gical structural and functional chan ges. CRPS is a rare condition and few interventions have been formall y evaluated in the paediatric population. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance. Case de nition A patient presenting between the ages of 2 and 18 years (up to the 18th birthday ) with a new diagnosis of CRPS, meeting the following International Association for the Study of Pain clinical diagnostic criteria: 1. Continuing pain, which is disproportionate to any inciting event 2.

Demographics As per CPSP polic y, case numbers and data for ve cases or fewer cannot be presented . Presentation, treatment, and outcomesWhile speci c information on this stud y cannot be presented at the current time due to the small number o f cases, available literature on CRPS suggests the followin g: A diagnosis of CRPS relies on history and clinical examination; there is no de nitive diagnostic test or pathognomonic ndings . Patients present with unusual features such as spontaneous pain, altered sensation resultin g in pain (e.g., allodynia and hyperalgesia ), and pain outside the distribution of a peripheral nerve. Pain is often not responsive to opioids or nonsteroidal anti-in fl ammatory drug (NSAID) medications . ysiotherap y is the cornerstone of treatment for CRPS. Study limitations As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, including under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups of children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as they may be less likely to receive timely specialist care. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts following the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as social history or special investi gations, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore may be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understanding o f the Canadian-speci c epidemiolo gy and the impact of CRPS. Conclusions At the time of anal ysis, fewer than ve cases of CRPS were con rmed . Anticipated study impact Study results will help determine the minimum incidence of CRPS and highlight current resource needs in Canada. The study will help identify patient demo graphics, tri ggers, or risk factors associated with CRPS. Results will be used to promote early recognition and treatment to bene t patient recovery .

Importance In October 2015, an increased incidence of microcephaly was noted in northeastern Brazil. Further investigations noted an increase in severe microcephaly and other neurological disorders among newborns born to mothers with Zika virus in fection . While severe microcephaly was the rst major con genital anomaly linked with Zika virus in fection durin g pregnancy, a wide ran ge of congenital anomalies have been described. As a result o f the spectrum o f clinical mani festations and abnormalities seen in in fants born to Zika virus-in fected mothers, the term congenital Zika syndrome has been developed. Importantly, some newborns born to mothers in fected with Zika virus have neurolo gical abnormalities with a normal head circum ference . Surveillance for CZS in Canada through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) started in March of 2017. This project is complementar y to the CPSP surveillance for severe microcephal y. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition An infant less than 12 months o f age who presents with the following criteria: Microcephaly, de ned as head circum ference less than two standard deviations for gestational a ge and sex accordin g to the standardized re ference percentile* OR Other con genital anomalies and malformations consistent with con genital Zika syndrome includin g malformations of the central nervous system, such as intracranial calci cations, structural brain or eye abnormalities, or other con genital central nervous system - related abnormalities (not explained by another etiolo gy) AND Amaternal history y that includes an epidemiologic linkagey to Zika virus OR a positive or inconclusive Zika virus laborator y test OR Aninfant with a positive or inconclusive Zika virus laboratory test *If there is a case o f severe microcephaly suspected to be associated with Zika virus then a questionnaire for the severe microcephaly study an d the congenital Zika syndrome study should be completed (i.e., if the case meets both case de nitions ). Other etiologies that should be considered include assessment o f potential genetic and other teratogenic causes o f the congenital anomalies should also be considered. Epidemiological linkage means: travelled to, or resided in, an area with active Zika virus transmission during her pregnancy; OR had unprotecte d sex durin g pregnanc y with a partner who resided in, or traveled to, an area with active Zika virus transmission. Unique to this study There is currently a CPSP study underway examinin g the incidence and epidemiolo gy of severe microcephaly in Canada. For cases of severe microcephaly suspected to be associated with Zika virus, CPSP participants are asked to report usin g both the severe microcephaly questionnaire AND the CZS questionnaire. There is cross-representation of principal and co-investi gators on the research teams to ensure that all cases are appropriately identi ed and analyzed .Principal investigators Shaun Morris, MD, Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Sick Children; shaun.morris @sickkids.c a Alex Demarsh, PhD (c), of Canada; alex.demarsh @canada.c a Marianna marianna.ofner @canada.c a Co-investigators Bitnun A, Miller S, Moore C, yn J Shaun Morri s23 CPSP 2017 - March to December 2017 Con rmed cases Since data collection was initiated , fewer than ve cases of CZS have been identi ed in Canada. Demographics As per CPSP policy, case numbers and data for ve cases or fewer cannot be presented. Presentation, treatment, and outcomesWhile speci c information on this stud y cannot be presented at the current time due to the small number o f cases, available literature demonstrates that CZS consists of : Severe microcephal y in which the skull has partiall y collapse d Decreased brain tissue with a speci c pattern o f brain dama ge, includin g subcortical calci cation s Dama ge to the structures o f the eye, includin g but not limited to macular scarrin g and focal pi gmentary retinal mottlin g Congenital contracture s Hyperton ia Studies show that amon g completed pre gnancies with laboratory evidence of infection with Zika virus, about 6% of fetuses or infants had evidence o f Zika-associated birth de fects. Amon g pregnant women with Zika virus in fection in the rst trimester, about 11 % of fetuses or infants had evidence of Zika-assoc iated birth defec ts. Study limitations As with any voluntary reportin g surveillance system, the CPSP reco gnizes that reportin g on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, includin g under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups of children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as the y may be less likel y to receive timel y specialist care. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, for example pendin g test results, parental travel history, physical examination, and relevant components o f the diagnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore ma y be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow us to better understand the Canadian-speci c epidemiolo gy and impact o f Zika virus. Conclusions CZS is rare in Canada. Accordin g to the Public Health A gency of Canada, as of December 1, 2017, 544 travel-related cases and 4 sexually transmitted cases of Zika virus infection have been reported in Canada since cases started bein g detected in Octobe r 2015. A total of 37 cases have been reported amon g pregnant women. Thus far, fewer than ve cases of CZS have been reported in this CPSP study . This CPSP study will continue until February of 2019 with data analyzed quarterly to identify any key epidemiologic ndings. Anticipated study impact While CZS has been rare thus far in Canada, this study will provide valuable clinical and epidemiolo gical information on cases that may occur following maternal in fection via travel, sexual transmission, or other modes. These data w ill supp lement any ot her data co llected via prov incial or terr itorial grams .24 CPSP 2017 RE SULTSIncidence trends of type 2 diabetes, medication- induced diabetes, and monogenic diabetes in Canadian children June 2017 to May 2019 Question What are the minimum incidence and the 10- year minimum incidence trends of non-t ype 1 diabetes mellitus (NT1DM ) and its subtypes (type 2 diabetes [T2D], medication induced diabetes [MID], and monogenic diabetes ) in Canada ? What are the childhood-onset T2D risk factors, clinical characteristics, and diabetes-related com plications, as well as di fferences in approaches to treatment across Canada ? Importance Childhood-onset T2D is on the rise. With access to Canadian data on T2D incidence in children and youth from 2006 to 2008, this second Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) surveillance study will provide national incidence trend data over a 10-year period.

Unique to this study To produce the most accurate incidence estimate of childhood-onset T2D, this stud y will also use data from the Canadian Primar y Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) to identify new cases of childhood-onset T2D seen by participatin g primary care providers (e.g., family physicians ) that would not be reported by paediatricians or paediatric endocrinolo gists. Reporting physicians have the option o f accessing free specialized pancreatic autoantibody testing accessed via the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (Denver, Colorado ) if they feel that the additional testing would help with the classi cation of diabetes subtype, and they do not have access to this testin g via their provincial laboratory services. This part o f the study is not conducted throu gh the CPSP and requires patient consent . Results - June to December 2017 Con rmed cases At the time o f analysis, 108 cases were con rmed for the rst six months o f reporting. Demographics There were 57 (53%) females and 51 (47%) males. Population groups were indicated for 105 cases with the majority o f cases being from the followin g groups: 40 (38%) Indigenous, 25 (24%) White, and 10 (10%) South Asian (Ban gladeshi, Punjabi, Sri Lankan, Indian) . The provincial /territorial breakdown was as follows: 53 (49%) from Western Canada, 46 (43%) from Central Canada, and 9 (8%) from Atlantic Canada. Presentation Based on the 98 cases where the reporting physician made a clinical diagnosis o f diabetes subt ype, 70 (71%) cases were T2D, 15 (15%) were MID, and 4 (4%) were con rmed or suspected mono genic diabetes. There were 9 (9%) cases where the dia gnosis o f a diabetes subtype was unknown or uncon rmed . Fifty-six cases were gned a nal classi cation o f diabetes subtype by the research team. Of these 56 cases, 82% were con rmed as T2D, 7% were MID, and 11% o f cases were classi ed as 'indeterminate'. Polyuria was present at dia gnosis in 45 (44%) cases were as ymptomatic. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was described in 10 cases. Fewer than ve cases each presented with a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HSS) or combined DKA and HH S. Treatment and outcomes At this early stage in surveillance, treatment and outcome data cannot be reported . Study limitations As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that all new cases of paediatric NT1DM in Canada may not be captured; there fore, a minimum incidence estimate for NT1DM and its subtypes will be calculated. The case capture for this study will be optimized by reviewin g CPCSSN electronic medical record data from primary care physicians across Canada and identifyin g any new cases of childhood-onset T2D that were not reported via the CPSP. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient medical charts following the clinical encounter; therefore, some data elements not collected as part o f routine care ma y be absent from the surveillance totals and, in some cases, insu f cient clinical in formation is provided to accurately assi gn a dia gnosis o f diabetes subtype. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understandin g of Canadian-speci c epidemiolo gy and the impact of T2D, MID, and monogenic diabetes in Canadian children .26 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS Conclusions The second CPSP surveillance stud y for NT1DM has been successfull y operationalized. In the rst six months, 22 cases have been reported, on average, per month. I f reporting rates remain the same, it is expected that approximately 550 cases o f NT1DM will be reported by the end o f the surveillance period, with the majority o f these cases being childhood-onset T2D. Anticipated study impact Study results will provide minimum incidence rates and trends in childhood-onset NT1DM and its subt and geograp hic istics. Results will hel p de ne childhood-onset T2D risk factors, clinical characteristics, and diabetes-related com plications, as well as differences in a pproaches to treatment across Canada . By largely replicating the rst CPSP study on NT1DM, this subsequent study can help determine whether the 'face' of childhood- onset T2D is changing related to demographics, clinical presentation, and severity \u2014 in formation that is critical to designing prevention and treatment programs that meet the speci c needs o f the populations a ffected .

What are the minimum incidence and minimum prevalence o f infantile-onset and juvenile-onset paediatric Pom pe disease in Canadian children and adolescents ? Importance The main mani festations in con genital and adult-onset Pompe disease have been characterized, but it is critical to delineate the symptoms and clinical characteristics o f infantile and juvenile-onset paediatric Pompe disease to facilitate prompt mana gement and treatment o f these uni que conditions . The incidence and prevalence of infantile and juvenile-onset paediatric Pompe disease in Canadian children and adolescents are unknown. Raisin g awareness amon g Canadian paediatricians about infantile and juvenile-onset Pompe disease in Canadian children and adolescents is important to ensure that the disease is considered appropriately in the di fferential diagnosis for children presenting with proximal weakness, hypotonia, respiratory insuf ciency, and /or high serum creatine kinase.

Demographics As per CPSP polic y, case numbers and data elements for ve cases or fewer cannot be presented . Presentation, treatment, and outcomesWhile speci c information on this stud y cannot be presented at the current time due to the small number o f reported cases, available literature demonstrates that: Children with Pompe disease have a de ciency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). The clinical spectrum ranges from the severe, in fantile-onset form, to the milder juvenile phenot ype that presents later in childhood . Infants with Pompe disease exhibit severe hypotonia, weakness, cardiomyopathy, poor feeding, and respiratory failure. Many pat ients w ith later-onset Pompe disease exper ience long delays in diagnos is. Enzyme replacement therapy can improve essential function and quality o f life and support longer survival for patients with both infantile and later-onset Pom pe disease. Study limitations As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates, and in this study prevalence rates, can have limitations, including under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups o f children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as they may be less likely to receive timely spec ialist care . Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts following the clinical encounter. Data elements, for example signs and symptoms prior to dia gnosis, laboratory results, and relevant components o f the dia gnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore ma y be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow us to better understand the Canadian-speci c epidemiology and the impact of infantile and later-onset Pom pe disease. Conclusions To date, fewer than ve cases have been re ported to the CPSP. Anticipated study impact Study results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal . Followin g analysis o f the data, nal results may be distributed to all provinces and territories. Study results will be disseminated to key stakeholder or ganizations, includin g the Canadian Association of Pompe and Muscula r Dystroph y Canada, to help inform their efforts.

What maternal and perinatal risk factors are associated with early- versus late-onset listeriosis in Canada ? What factors are associated with more severe outcomes (i.e., neonatal intensive care unit admission and /or death )? Importance Listeriosis is assoc iated with high morbidity an d morta lity, espec ially in the new born per iod. The epidemiologic factors associated with early-onset in fection are well characterized, but those contributing to late-onset in fection of the newborn are not well de ned. Currently, empiric antibiotic covera ge is the standard of care for neonatal listeriosis. The a ge at which Listeria is no longer a r isk, and when em piric ant ibiotics to cove r Listeriaare no longer necessary for suspected sepsis, are not clear. Knowled ge of evidence-based criteria for choice o f antibiotics for Listeriadurin g early li fe is essential to developin g evidence-based treatment gu idelines an d advanc ing ant imicrobial stewar dship. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition New patient less than six months o f age, meetin g the followin g criteria : 1) De nitive P ositive culture of Listeriafrom a usuall y sterile site, such as blood, CSF or pleural fl uid; or P ositive culture of Listeriafrom the placenta in the presence of compatible clinical features of listeriosis (sepsis, menin gitis, respirator y distress, etc. ). 2) Probable Positive P CR for Listeria from a usuall y sterile site or the placenta in the presence o f compatible clinical features o f listeriosis (sepsis, menin gitis, respiratory distress, etc. ). Unique to this study Since there is on going surveillance for invasive listeriosis within the Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control Branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the role of PHA C in this project is to provide an aggregated national number of paediatric cases reported to PHA C throu gh routine surveillance durin g the period of study. The national case count provided by PHA C excludes any cases in the province of Quebec; due to legal restrictions, Quebec is not currently participating in the ongoing national surveillance program. If the number of paediatric cases per year reported throu gh the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) does not match the number of cases reported to PHA C through ongoing routine surveillance, the principal and co-investigators have access to othe r existin g networks, includin g the Paediatric Investi gators Collaborative Network on Infections in Canada (PICNIC) and other informal networks of health professionals in Canada, to identify missin g cases . Together, this overlapping approach ensured complete coverage of the entire newborn population in Canada over the years of the stu dy.Principal investigators Julie Bettinger, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vaccine Evaluation Center; jbettin ger@bcchr.ubc.ca Robert Bortolussi, MD, FR CPC, Universit IWK Health Centre; bob.bortolussi @iwk.nshealth.c a Tobias Kollmann, MD, PhD, FR CPC, Professor of Pediatrics, Universit y of British Columbia, Head, Division of Infectious Diseases, B C Children's Hos pital; Tobias R. Kollmann30 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS Results - May 2015 to April 2017 Con rmed cases Over the 24 months of the study, eight cases of laboratory-con rmed listeriosis were reported in newborns and infants . Demographics Due to the small number of con rmed cases, no clear association with race /ethnicity, birth mode, or feedin g mode has been detected. Presentation Of the ei ght cases of neonatal listeriosis reported, six were early-onset . The early-onset cases presented as septic on the day of birth (median time at presentation: 0.5 hours, range: 0-2 hours of life ). All early-onset cases had bacterem ia. Earl y-onset cases were associated with maternal fever in almost all cases . Late-onset cases presented between day o f life 9 and 20. None o f the late-onset cases had obvious risk factors captured b y the stud y questionnaire. Treatment and outcomes All of the early-onset cases needed intensive care unit (or neonatal intensive care unit ) admission. Mortality was reported in fewe r than ve cases. No mortalit y was associated with reported cases o f late-onset listeriosis . Study limitations Considering the low number of cases reported, risk factors and outcomes for late-onset cases could not be described . As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, including under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups of children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as the y may be less likel y to receive timel y specialist care . Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts followin g the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as pendin g laboratory results or components o f the diagnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore may be absent from the surveillance totals. However, our overlappin g approach to surveillance should have captured most cases; surve illance as out lined in this stu dy serves an important purpose an d prov ides rich clinical data that will allow us to better understand neonatal listeriosis. Conclusions Based on the Canadian birth cohort of ~370,000 per year, and the reported incidence of neonatal listeriosis in the United Kingdom and the United States (5/100,000 live births and 8.6 /100,000 respectively ), a total of 19 to 30 cases of neonatal listeriosis were expected per year in Canada. The fact that only ei ght cases were reported over the 24 months of this CPSP surveillance study (con rmed throu gh PHA C's surveillance pro gram) su ggests that the incidence of neonatal listeriosis in Canada is much lower than expected (~1/100,000 live births ). Given the small number of cases to date, it is dif cult to draw rm conclusions about underlying risk factors or outcomes of late listeriosis. Findings are in keeping with the published literature for early-onset listeriosis . Because s poradic food-born Listeria outbreaks may continue to occur, on going surveillance and re-evaluation o f early-onset Listeria sepsis should cont inue. Anticipated study impact The ability to capture cases throu gh the CPSP and PI CNIC and compare counts with those obtained throu gh PHA C's routine surveillance (invasive listeriosis is a nationall y noti able disease ) indicates that current measures to capture cases in Canada are workin g well. This model of surveillance may be useful for other, rare neonatal and /or paediatric infections . The data from this study su ggest that empiric therapy for neonatal listeriosis may bene t from re-evaluation in the face of lower than expected incidence. In addition, empiric therapy for listeriosis for infants older than 4 weeks o f age may not be required as no cases of listeriosis were detected in this a ge group over the study period.

What are the patterns of presentation, includin g demo graphics and psychiatric and medical history, encountered in these cases ? Importance Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Canadian youth (15 to 19 years of age ), representing almost 30% of all deaths in this age group in 2014. For ever y adolescent that dies b y suicide, it is estimated there are 20 to 40 suicide attempts. However, there is little in formation ava ilable regarding the suicide attempts. Youth who make near-fatal suicide attempts - such as those requirin g ICU level care - may closely approximate those who die by suicide, highlighting the need to further understand these suicide attempts. Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition A new patient less than 18 years of age (up to the 18th birthday ) meeting BOTH o f the following criteria: 1. A con rmed or suspected self-harm or suicide attempt (any form of self-poisoning or self-injury regardless of the degree of intent to die ) AND 2. Admitted to an intensive care unit at any time during a hospital admission (for any duration ) Exclusio n criteria Accidental poisoning (e.g., intoxication ) or injury Results - January to December 2017 Con rmed cases At the time o f analysis, 52 cases were con rmed. Demographics The mean age of the con rmed cases was 15.41 years (range: 11.17 - 17.92 years of a ge). Almost three quarters of these adolescents were females. There were 37 (71%) females and 15 (29%) males . The majorit y of cases were White 61% ) and born in Canada (34/52, 65% ). Seventy percent of the youth were living with their biological parent (s): 22/51 (43%) with one parent and 14 /52 (27%) with both parents .Principal investigator Director, Children's Integrated Mood and Body (CLIMB ) Depression Pro gram, Psychiatrist, The Hospital for Sick Children, Assistant Professor, University of Toronto; da phne.korczak @sickkids.c a Co-investigators Ani C, Cyr C, Irvine J, Joffee A, Mitchell R, Skinner R, Stang A, Won g S Daphne Korcza k32 CPSP 2017 SULTS Most cases three provinces: 17 (33%) from Ontario, 16 (31%) from Quebec, and 9 (17%) from Alberta. Fewer than ve cases each were re ported from British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland an d Labrador, and the Northwest Territories. Presentation Althou gh the majority o f cases reported were females, the majority o f the deaths were of males (71%). Among females, the most common method o f self-infl icted injury was overdose ingestion (70%) compared with hanging among males (33%). The most common precipitating events associated with suicide attempts (both fatal and non-fatal ) were the following: in 28 /51 (55%) cases it was family confl ict, in 13 /51 (26%) cases it was confl ict with peer (s), and in 12 /51 (24%) cases it was loss of a romantic relationshi p. In 14 (27%) cases, the parents /caregivers were aware that their child was considering suicide . Of those with a previous suicide attem pt(s), 91% (20/22) were female. Treatment and outcomes Overall, there were seven deaths in the sample, with six as the result of hanging . Of the 45 surviving cases that were discharged from the I CU, 31 (69%) were referred for follow-up with a psychiatrist and 35 (78%) with a mental health professional. Five cases or fewer received no follow-u p. Females were more likely than males to have received a psychiatric diagnoses (26/31, 84% ) and to be under the care of a psychiatrist or other mental health professional (24/27, 89% ) prior to I CU admission . Of those cases that received treatment during the I CU admission, 23 /51 (45%) received ventilation, 12 hemod ynamic support, and 14 /51 (28%) used an antidote as part of treatment. Fewer than ve cases each required dial ysis or surgery . Study limitations As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, including under-representation o f the disease in the population. It is possible that some groups o f children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas or adolescents treated in adult settings. Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts following the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as psychiatric or family histor y, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore ma y be absent from surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an important purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understanding o f medically serious self-harm in youth requiring I CU admission. Conclusions These ndin gs are consistent with epidemiolo gic data that observe a gender paradox in youth suicide in which females demonstrate a hi gher rate o f suicide attempts, while males display a hi gher rate o f suicide mortality.

Importance Rh sensitization occurs when women whose red blood cells are Rh (D)-antigen ne gative develop anti-Rh (D) antibodies either durin g a previous pregnancy in which the fetus is Rh (D) positive or by exposure to Rh antigens from blood products /transfusion. Neonates born to Rh-sensitized mothers ma y present with severe jaundice, anemia, and death from acute or chronic bilirubin encephalopathy or brain damage resulting from severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . Several recent studies have found severe h yperbilirubinemia to be associated with other developmental dela ys such as autism, speec h delay, an d global developmenta l delay, cere bral palsy. considered rare in countries where Rh proph ylaxis is used and the blood t ype and Rh sensitization status o f the mother is usually known at the time o f a delivery . Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance . Case de nition Any infant 60 days of a ge or less with Rh (D) sensitization ful lling ALL of the followin g criteria : Mother is Rh negative (D-negative ) Mother has positive antibod y screen due to anti-D. (This must be a maternal allo-anti-D, not passive anti-D from Rh (D) immunoglobulin (RhoGAM)) Cord or infant blood group is Rh positive (D-positive ) Results - January to December 2017 Con rmed cases At the time o f analysis, 15 cases were con rmed . Demographics Con rmed cases were from British Columbia , Alberta , Ontario , Quebec , Nova Scotia , and Newfoundland . Maternal country of birth was reported as Canada in ei ght cases. The remainin g cases were born to mothers from South and West Asia or the maternal countr y of birth was unknown . Presentation The avera ge gestational a ge was 36.5 weeks (range: 35-40 ). The average age at presentat ion was 2.8 hours. The average hemoglobin at presentation was 133.8 g /L (range: 65-192 g /L). The outcomes The average number o f phototherapy hours was 129 .

However, surveillance serves an im portant purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow us to better understand Rh sensitization. Conclusions Rh disease continues to exist in Canada . Despite current public health measures in place across Canada, additional work must be done to prevent Rh disease, noting factors including changes in immigration patterns, Rh immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) refusal, and Rh sensitization prior to 28 weeks gestation . Anticipated study impact The study will identi fy risk factors associated with severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, including the contribution o f Rh disease to severe neonatal h yperbilirubinemia in Canada .

Importance Congenital microcephaly is an anomaly of the central nervous system that begins in utero. It is a condition in whi ch an infant's head is signi cantly smaller than the heads o f other children o f the same a ge and sex at the time o f birth . In earl y 2015, there was an increase in the number o f microcephal y cases reported in Brazil. The increased incidence in Brazil, followed b y similar experiences in other countries, was subsequentl y linked to an outbreak o f Zika virus. Given the frequent travel of Canadians to Zika endemic re gions, it is critical to monitor for microcephaly in Canada, both to establish baseline rates and understand the potential association with Zika virus in fection. Surveillance for severe microcephaly in Canada throu gh the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP) started in June o f 2016. This project is complementary to the CPSP surveillance for con genital Zika syndrome (CZS). Methodology The com plete protocol can be accessed at www.c psp.cps.ca/surveillance .

Parallel studies are ongoing in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, and multi-national data will be collated and com pared at the com pletion o f this surveillance project. This partnershi p represents the largest international research collaborative investi gating the epidemiolo gy of severe - January to December 2017 Con rmed cases At the time o f analysis, 31 cases o f severe microcephal y were con rmed . Demographics There were 17 (55%) females, 13 (42%) males, and 1 (3%) was not speci ed. Age groups were reported as follows: 26 (84%) were 6 months or less and the remainin g cases were greater than 6 months or the age was unspeci ed. Seven (23%) cases were from Western Canada, 18 (58%) from Central Canada, and the remainin g cases were from Atlantic Canada or location was uns peci ed.

The average head circumference at birth for all infants was 28.8 (\u00b1 1.2 ) cm. Treatment and outcomes The suspected causes of microcephaly were varied and included: 11 (36%) genetic causes, 15 (48%) other /unknown causes, and the remaining cases were due to ischemia or in fection . To date, fewer than ve cases o f Zika-associated microcephal y have been reported. Study limitations The case de nition o f severe microcephal y is restrictive and there fore onl y the most serious cases o f the condition are captured. This stud y captures onl y live-born in fants which ma y underestimate the impact o f severe microcephal y. As with any voluntary reporting surveillance system, the CPSP recognizes that reporting on minimum incidence rates can have limitations, including under-representation of the disease /condition in the population. It is possible that some groups of children were missed, for example those who live in rural or remote areas, as the y may be less likel y to receive timel y specialist care . Case level surveillance data are extracted from patient charts following the clinical encounter. Data elements, such as pending laboratory results or components o f the diagnostic assessment, may not have been available at the point o f care and there fore may be absent from the surveillance totals. However, surveillance serves an im portant purpose and provides rich clinical data that will allow for a better understanding of the Canadian-speci c epidemiology (including etiology, when known ) of severe microcephal y.

Importance Cannabis use for medical purposes has gathered growing interest from the public through reports of its purported bene ts. Since 2001, Health Canada allows health practitioners to authorize cannabis for medical purposes, regardless of the patient's age . The Canadian Paediatric Societ y's 2016 Position Statement Is the medical use o f cannabis a thera peutic o ption for children ?reports there is insu f cient data on the e f cacy and sa fety o f cannabis use for the paediatric population, and recommends only potential exceptional therapeutic use in speci c cases b y skilled clinician s. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The survey tool can be accessed at www.cpsp.cps.ca/surveillance . Results The surve y response rate was 31% (877/2,816 ). Paediatricians' experiences In the year precedin g the survey, half (50%, 419/835) of respondents had encountered patients who had used cannabis for medical purposes, e ither aut horized or not aut horized. The vast majority o f respondents who encountered a child or youth using cannabis for medical purposes in the preceding yea r reported having seen ve or fewer cases. Amon g respondents who reported havin g seen patients a ged 12 years and older who used unauthorized cannabis for medical purposes in the precedin g year, a substantial number (22%, 45 /204) saw more than ve cases . Amon g respondents reportin g havin g encountered paediatric patients usin g cannabis for medical purposes in the past year, 68% (218/321) reported that less than half of their patients had bene ted from its use, and 15% (47/318) stated that the majorit y of their patients had ex perienced adverse e ffects. More than one third (38%, 316/835) of respondents had been asked b y a parent or b y an adolescent patient to authorize cannabis fo r me dical purposes w ithin the prior year . Only 34 respondents reported havin g authorized cannabis for a child or youth in the past year . Provider awareness Just over half (51%, 441/874) of respondents reported bein g aware that Canadian physicians can authorize cannabis use for medical purposes for a child and 61% (534/873) for youth .Principal investigators Richard B \u00e9langer, MD, FR CPC, Department of Paediatrics, Centre m ger@chudequebec.c a Christina Grant, MD, FR Division of Adolescent Medicine, De partment of r B \u00e9langer38 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS A clear majority of respondents said they had no knowled ge or minimal knowled ge regardin g topics: 76% (636/837) on wh y cannabis ma y be authorized for medical purposes to a child /youth (conditions, reasons, expected bene ts), 89% (744/834) on what cannabis products may be authorized for medical purposes to a child /youth (formulations, dosa ges), and 90% (752/832) on how cannabis can be authorized for medical purposes to a child/youth (provincial policies, monitoring for ef cacy and side effects, information to provide ). Personal beliefs Nearl y half (46%, 403 /873) of respondents believe that there are appropriate indications to support the authorization of cannabis fo r medical purposes for children and youth. Amon g respondents who said they believe that there are appropriate indications to support the authorization o f medical cannabis in children and youth, the majority identi ed the following indications, almost exclusively for refractory symptoms not responding to rst-line 50% (180/360) spasticity. The conditions receivin g the least support by paediatricians as indications for authorizin g cannabis attention de cit h yperactivit y disorder . Respondents reported the followin g as the most common factors that may lead them to re frain from authorizin g cannabis use for medical purposes to children /youth: 82% (685/828) re gardin g the lon g-term impact of its use, and 62% (517/828) concerns for abuse and dependence . Survey limitations The majority of respondents were urban and academic paediatricians, a group of health care providers that mana ge the most comp lex an d severe health issues in children an d youth. The survey response rate was 31%; the survey results may under or over represent the knowled ge and /or experiences of Canadian paediatricians. Some ndings are limited due to incomplete responses from the survey respondents for certain data elements. Denominators in the report may vary accordin g to the number o f survey respondents who replied to each question . This survey data was gathered prior to the publication of the pivotal study evaluating the use of cannabidiol (CBD) to treat epilepsy amon g children w ith Dravet syn drome reporte d in theNew En gland Journal o f Medicin e in the sprin g of 2017 .1 Conclusions Paediatricians in Canada frequentl y encounter questions about cannabis use for medical purposes, and certain patient populations emplo y cannabis, both authorized and unauthorized, for medical use . Not surprisin gly, Canadian paediatricians have little knowled ge about authorizin g cannabis use for medical purposes for children and youth. Paradoxically, they have a fairly positive view regarding cannabis use for medical purposes for certain conditions, despite the lack o f solid scienti c evidence re gardin g its sa fety and e f cacy . Of concern are the results showin g a signi cant proportion of paediatricians are willin g to consider a number of indications fo r medical cannabis without current evidence for ef cacy and sa fety. This may re fl ect paediatricians encountering very di f cult clinical situations where there are limited thera peutic o ptions available for their patients . Expected le galization o f cannabis for non-medical purposes is likely to in fl uence personal and medical views o f cannabis and the ex periences o f clinicians who res ponded. Anticipated survey impact Survey results will be used to hi ghlight the need for trainin g and continuin g medical education for paediatricians on cannabis use fo r medical purposes amon g children and youth . Survey results will also be used to inform public education efforts about what is known re gardin g cannabis for medical indications . Survey results will be used to advocate for investments in research to investi gate the safety, ef cacy, dosin g, and potential indications for cannabis for medical use in children and youth.

Importance Chemical skin injuries associated with the use of chlorhexidine gluconate solutions (both alcohol and aqueous based ) for skin antisepsis prior to invasive procedures in neonatal patients have been reported to forei gn regulatory a gencies. However, no Canadian cases were found in either the Canada Vigilance Database (CVD) or in the medical literature. Antisepsis prior to invasive procedures is mandator y in all patients. Antisepsis is especiall y important in premature in fants, where nosocomial in fections and septicemia are leadin g causes o f death. National guidelines concerning the type o f antiseptic that should be used in preterm and term in fants younger than 2 months o f age are lacking. Data are needed to help guide the potential development o f national guidelines for antisepsis in this population and to in form possible future re gulatory risk miti gation measures. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The surve y tool can be accessed at www.cpsp.cps.ca /surveillance . Results The survey response rate was 30% (829/2,741 ). Respondents Respondents reported the followin g 462 (56%) neonatologists ), and 13 (2%) did not specify. Of the total number of respondents, 308 (67%) general paediatricians and 178 (50%) subspecialists indicated that their practice involved hos pitalized neonates. The majorit y of respondents whose practice involved hospitalized neonates, (321/486, 66%) practised in urban centres. Use of CHG solutions Of the 486 respondents who saw neonates in hospital, 366 (75%) reported that they used CHG antiseptics prior to procedures. Fort y-six percent (223/486) did not know what t ype of CHG solutions the y used and the others reported use of both alcohol and aqueous solutions in both single and multi-use formulations of CHG. There was no predominant use o f any sin gle product. Chemical skin injuries Given the nature of res ponses, it is estimated that a maximum of 128 cases of serious chemical skin in juries due to CHG were seen by respondents over the last ve years. (One-time survey methodology does not allow for ruling out duplicate cases) .Principal investigators Maria Faraci , MDCM, FRCSC, Medical Of cer, Health Products and Food Branch Health Canada ; maria.faraci @canada.ca Ron Tam, MD, FR CPC, Medical Of cer, Health Products and Food Branch, Health Canada; ron.tam @canada.c a Margaret Zimmerman, B Sc, Patient Safety Section, Marketed Health Products Directorate, Health Canada; @canada.c a Margaret Zimmerma n40 CPSP 2017 RE SULTS It is estimated that a maximum of 66 cases of serious chemical skin injuries due to CHG were seen over the last 12 months. Clinical details of the 66 cases seen over the last 12 months were re ported as follows : - Seventy-seven percent (51/66) of injuries occurred in neonates less than 32 weeks gestation and 77% (43/56) of birth wei ghts were between 500 to 1,000 grams . - Ei ghty- ve percent (52/61) of neonates involved were less than 2 weeks old . - Use of CHG alcohol solutions was reported in 39% (22/56) of cases versus aqueous CHG in 27% (15/56) of cases. Respondents did not recall the t ype of solution used in 34% (19/56) of cases. - The formulations of CHG as . - Ninety-two percent (48/52) of cases required wound care and pain control while ve cases or fewer involved either skin graftin g or o t her invasive therapeutic procedures. - There was no interruption in care in 77% (27/35) of cases, but 29% (10/35) of cases reported either sepsis or prolon gation o f hospitalization. - A fatal outcome was re ported in fewer than ve cases . Support for national guidelines Of the 816 who responded to the question on guideline development, 277 (34%) said they would deem guideline development usefu l. Of note, of the general paediatricians who answered this question, 44% (202/462) deemed that guidelines would be useful compared to onl y 21% (75/354) of subspecialists . Survey limitations The one-time survey did not allow for the collection o f speci c details o f cases per year, there fore trends cannot be determined . Survey participation is voluntary and subject to recall bias. Therefore, the full extent of these injuries in neonates in Canada could not be ascertained. However, until this surve y, none had been reported to Health Canada. Some ndings are limited due to incomplete responses from the survey respondents for certain data elements. Denominators in the report may vary according to the number o f survey respondents who replied to each question . Conclusions Althou gh no cases of skin burns in neonates had previously been reported in Canada, the respondents of this survey reported a maximum of 128 cases . The majority o f the cases that occurred in the last 12 months were in preterm in fants, less than 32 weeks gestation, and within the rst two weeks of life. Both alcohol and aqueous-based, as well as sin gle and multiple-use CHG solutions, were implicated in these injuries. There is some interest in treatment guideline development for antisepsis use in neonates. Anticipated survey impact Survey results will increase the awareness of the occurrence of this risk followin g antisepsis in neonates, and thus hopefully prevent or minimize its occu rrence. Survey results provide initial evidence to guide development and implementation of risk minimization measures.

Importance Over 64,000 children and youth in Canadian militar y families experience unique circumstances such as frequent relocations within and across provinces, parental deplo yment, and family separation. This set o f stressors may ne gatively a ffect access to, and continuity o f, health care because military family members must access health serv ices t hrough prov incial and territorial health care systems . Reports by the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces Morale and Welfare Services identify concerns with military families' access to medical and mental health care. The recent Canadian Paediatric Societ y position statement Caring for Children and Youth from Canadian Militar y Families: Specia l Consideration s (2016 ) highlighted issues relevant to this population and this survey provides new data on Canadian paediatricians' experiences caring for children /youth from military families . Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists throu gh the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Pro gram (CPSP). The surve y tool can be accessed at www.cpsp.cps.ca /surveillance. Results The surve y response rate was 28% (774/2,799 ). Respondents Respondents reported the following areas 418 (54%) general paediatricians, 345 /no res ponse . Practice settings reported included (some participants practice in more than one setting ): 603 (78%) urban, 134 (17%) suburban, and 91 (12%) rural /remote . Provider awareness A minority of respondents (17%, 127 /773) correctly responded that the federal military health care system does not provide health care to children /youth from militar y families; 83% were incorrect or unsure. Nearly half of paediatricians (48%, 368/770) reported not having cared for a child/youth from a military family in the preceding year, and 21% (163/770) were unsure. The majorit y of respondents (87%, 671 /773) did not routinel y inquire as to whether a parent was in the militar y, and 23% (180/776) said that ndin g out a parent was in the military would not in form that child's care any di fferently . Needs assessment More than half of respondents (57%, 430 /755) did not feel adequatel y prepared to care for children and youth from militar y families .Principal investigators Heidi Cramm, PhD, OTReg Alyson Mahar, y, Assistant Professor, Universit y of Manitoba; alyson_mahar @cpe.umanitoba.c a Anne Rowan-Legg, MD, FR CPC, Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ottawa; annerl @cps.c a Linna Tam- all respondents (98%, 753 /766) said they had not received any speci c trainin g related to carin g for military families . A si gni cant proportion (74%, 563 /764) expressed interest in expandin g their knowled ge of health-related risks for children and youth in military families and 47% (356/764) were interested in accessin g information and resources on services available to military families. Survey limitations Children /youth from military families may have dif culty accessin g paediatricians, and hence may not be seen by the surveyed group. Many Canadian paediatricians do not practise primary care, and may not be aware of the challen ges that military families face access ing health care . The survey response rate was low at 28 %, and hence may not be an accurate representation o f the knowled ge or experience o f Canadian paediatricians . Some ndin gs are limited due to incomplete responses from the survey respondents for certain data elements. Denominators in the report may vary accordin g to the number o f survey respondents who replied to each question . Conclusions The majorit y of Canadian paediatricians are unaware that children and youth in militar y families receive health care in the provincial or territorial health care s ystems, and 21 % were unclear whether the y had provided health care to a child from a militar y family in thei r pract ice in the prev ious year. The vast majority o f paediatricians have not received any special training or education on caring for children and youth in military families. Improved military family literacy among Canadian paediatricians is needed. Anticipated survey impact The Department of National Defence is currently developing a new national Comprehensive Military Family Plan to inform the delivery of services to militar y personnel and their families. Survey results, in conjunction with other published data, could contribute to national polic y recommendations on health care access for militar y families . Survey results will help inform professional development activities to increase awareness of the issues facing children and youth in militar y families and identi fy the need for resources available to militar y families . An on-line educational module for clinicians is alread y under development at the Canadian Paediatric Societ y in partnership with Militar y Famil y Services .

What contributed to vaccine hesitancy amon g parent (s) with a child who had contracted a VPD ? Are paediatricians usin g a formal strate or vaccinations for siblin gs with vaccine-hesitant parent (s) caring for a child who had contracted a VPD ? Importance Despite decades o f accumulated scienti c evidence supporting the sa fety and e ffectiveness o f vaccines, surveys have shown that a small proportion of the Canadian public is not con dent in routine childhood immunization. This phenomenon has been termed \"vaccine hesitancy\" by the World Health Organization and its prevalence poses an ur gent threat to public health. At present, there is limited knowledge regarding e ffective interventions to address vaccine hesitancy. Methodology A one-time survey was sent to paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). The surve y tool can be accessed at www.cpsp.cps.ca /surveillance . Results The surve y response rate was 33% (925/2,798 ). Respondents reported the followin g areas of the majority were general paediatricians (522, 56% ), 42% were paediatric subs pecialists, and 2 % identi ed as \"other\" or did not indicate their area o f practice . VPDs Of the 925 respondents, 196 (21%) reported that they had seen a patient in the precedin g 12 months who was dia gnosed with a VPD whereby the pat ient or a s ibling was not vacc inated or vacc ination was delayed by parenta l choice. Of the paediatricians who indicated that the y had seen a patient with a VPD, 77% (150/196) had seen between one and three o f these patients in the precedin g 12 months. The most commonly Fourteen percent (27/196) of respondents reported having seen more than one of the VPDs listed on the survey. The vast majorit y (94%) of paediatricians indicated that the VPD (s) was not acquired outside of Canada. Vaccine-hesitancy The child's vaccination status against the VPD prior to contracting the VPD was reported as follows: 81% (156/192) had no immunization and 19% (36/192) had dela yed immunization. The top three reasons for parental vaccine hesitancy expressed to participatin g physicians were: 44% (75/171) worried the risk of the vaccine was greater than the risk of the disease, 36% (61/171) were concerned about \"too many vaccines,\" and 32% (54/171) cited the risk o f a weakened immune s ystem.Principal investigators Kate Allan, M SW, PhD Student, University of Toronto; kate.allan @mail.utoronto.c a Barbara Fallon, M SW, PhD, Associate Professor, Associate Dean, Research, Universit y of Toronto; barbara.fallon @utoronto.c a Dat Tran, MD, Sc, Public Health @state.or.u s Kate Allan44 CPSP about intervention strate gies, 23% (41/181) of respondents reported that they had used a formal strate gy or structured approach to discuss vaccination with the vaccine-hesitant parent (s) priorto the patient contracting a VPD. Fifty-seven percentr (101/178) reported that a formal strategy was used after the patient contracted the VPD.r Res pondents indicated that their im pression was that 35% (64/183) of vaccine-hesitant parents would in (60/183) of res pondents were unsure. Seventy-nine percent (147/186) of respondents reported that they were aware of existing tools to manage vaccine hesitancy (e.g., Canadian Paediatric Societ y Practice Point Working with vaccine-hesitant parent s). Of those who were aware of existing tools, 69% (100/145) had used the tools . Survey limitations Acquiring speci c information about the outcome o f each case is not possible in a one-time survey . Many Canadian paediatricians do not practise primary care therefore not all children acquiring VPDs will be treated by a paediatricia n or paediatric subspecialist. The cases presented in this surve y include onl y children with VPDs who were seen b y a paediatrician. Children with VPDs that are rare in the paediatric population (e.g., measles, meningococcal infection, and pertussis before the age of one ) are most often treated by paediatricians. For VPDs that are more common among children (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia, varicella, and rotavirus ), generally only the most severe cases are re ferred to paediatricians for treatment. The surve y response rate was 33% and hence, the results ma y not refl ect the experience of all Canadian paediatricians. Bias ma y be present, as those who had seen a case of a VPD in a child of vaccine-hesitant parent (s) may be more or less likel y to respond to a survey on this subject. In addition, case characteristics including vaccination history and reasons for vaccine re fusal were not independentl y veri ed and ma y refl ect respondent bias and recall error . Some ndings are limited due to incomplete responses from the survey respondents for certain data elements. Denominators in the report may vary according to the number o f survey respondents who answered each question . Conclusions Despite sustained e fforts to increase public awareness on the evidence o f vaccine e f cacy, one fth of paediatricians who responded to the survey had seen at least one case of a child with a VPD and vaccine-hesitant parent (s) in the precedin g 12 months. Structured approaches to guide paediatricians in conversations with vaccine-hesitant parents exist; however, the survey results demonstrate that a substantial number of respondents are either unaware of these tools (21%, 39 /186) or are not usin g them (31%, 45 /145). Anticipated survey impact Adequate vaccine covera ge is critical to avoidin g the spread o f vaccine-preventable disease and protectin g vulnerable individuals from in fection. Vaccine hesitancy poses a threat to acceptable vaccine covera ge rates and there fore is a si gni cant public health concern. E ffective interventions are critical to addressin g this phenomenon. These ndin gs, particularly those re gardin g the speci c concerns o f vaccine-hesitant parents, may be used to in form public education pro grams an d to ass ist health care prov iders, including paediatricians. These results will encoura ge continued interdisciplinary collaboration on the subject o f vaccine hesitancy, focusin g on enhanced communication skills, includin g awareness and use o f evidence-based structured approaches to care in these challen ging situations.
