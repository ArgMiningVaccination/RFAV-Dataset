MIND BODY INTERVENTIONS. SUB TYPES OF ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM OF INDIA: AYURVEDA SIDDHA UNANI AND TIBBI HOMEOPATHY NATUROPATHY HYDROTHERAPY YOGA In Sanskrit , the word Ayurveda consist of the words ayus , meaning \"life\" and veda , meaning \"realted to knowledge ,or science\" Evolving throughout its history ,Ayurveda remains an influential system of medicine in south Asia .The earliest literature of Ayurveda appeared during the vedic period in India . The Sushruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita were influential works on traditional medicine during this era . Ayurvedic practitioners also identified a medicinal preparations and surgical procedures for curing various ailments and diseases. AIM OF samhita (an ancient ayurveda text) ayurveda has two main objectives 1st is 'swasthasya swastha rakshanam\" i.e. to help the healthy person to protect & maintain his swasthya ( wellness). 2nd is \"aaturasya vikar prashamanam\" i.e. to help a diseased person to become healthy & to stay healthy forever.

Alternative Ayurvedic treatments and self help regimens include :nutrition , herbal remedies , aromatherapy , lifestyle recommendations ,massage treatments ,color /sound therapy ,meditation ,panckarma (etoxification ),yoga .Ayurveda empowers the individual to take control of their own health and well being . CORE PRINCIPLES The knowledge of Ayurveda was passed on orally through a lineage of sages in India until it was collated into text more than five thousand years ago. The oldest known texts on Ayurveda are theCharaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and the Ashtanga Hrudaya. These texts detail the affect that the five elements found in the cosmic system - earth, water, air, fire, space - have on our individual system, and expound on the importance of keeping these elements balanced for a healthy and happy life. According to Ayurveda, each person will be influenced by certain elements more than others. This is because of their prakriti, or natural constitution. Ayurveda categorizes the different constitutions into three different doshas: Vata dosha, in which the air and space elements dominate Pitta dosha, in which the fire element dominates Kapha dosha, in which the earth and water elements dominate DIFFERENT AYURVEDIC THERAPIES: Ayurvedic Treatment can grossly be divided into Shodhana and Shamana i.e. purificatory and palliative therapy respectively. The shodhana therapy includes procedures that eradicate the vitiated techniques that pacify the doshas or bring them back to normalcy e.g. deepana (carminative), pachana (digestive), upavasa (fasting) etc SIDDHA The siddha medicine is a form of south Indian Tamil traditional medicine a and part of the trio Indian medicines ayurveda, siddha and unani , The system is believed to be developed by the 9 nath and 84siddhas in the north and 18siddhas in the south called siddhar. Siddharas were given the concept that a healthy soul can only be developed through a healthy body . So they developed methods and medication that are believed to strengthen their physical body and thereby their souls . Men and women who dedicated their lives into developing the system were called Siddharas The normal equilibrium of three humors (vatha ,pitha and kapha )is disturbed , disease is caused. The factors which assumed to affect this equilibrium are environment , climatic conditions ,diet ,physical activites , and stress . According to the siddha medicine system ,diet and life style play a major role not only but also in curing diseases . UNANI UNANI :As an alternative form of medicine ,unani has found favour in Asia especially India . In India these Unani practitioners can practice as qualified doctors ,as the Indian government approves their practice. Unani medicine is very close to Ayurveda . Both are based on theory of the presence of the elements (in unani , they are considered to be fire ,water ,earth ,and air ) in the human body . According to followers of unani medicine , these elements are present in different fluids and their balance leads to health and their imbalance leads to illness . HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy is a medical science developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician. According to this theory, the right medicinal substance for a particular set of symptoms is the one that naturally produces those symptoms in healthy people. . It is based on the principle that \"like cures like\". In simple words, it means that any substance, which can produce symptoms in a healthy person, can cure similar symptoms in a person who is sick. This idea is referred to as the \"Law of Similars\", and was understood by Aristotle and Hippocrates and mentioned in ancient Hindu manuscripts. It was Hahnemann, however, who turned it into a science of healing. Here are examples of this principle: . An onion is a substance which makes your eyes water and your nose burn. If you are having an attack of hay fever with watering eyes and a burning nose, a homeopathic remedy made from onion can relieve it. Homeopathic medicines consists of plants, animals & minerals extracts that are diluted in water or alcohol and vigorously shaken. . It is a system of therapy based on the concept that disease can be treated with drugs (in minute doses )which are capable of producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself . Eg .Thyroidinum (thyroid hormone) . o Based on concepts that (treat the cause rather than effect) o Avoid use of medicine. o Focus on nutrition (natural foods), light, warmth ,massage, fresh air, regular exercise, hydrotherapy,& (recognition of inherent healing ability of the body.) STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE- Describes connection between posture & both physical & emotional problems. Therapy uses body awareness ,movement to bring the posture & body back into balance . Therapy is helpful to those with chronic back pain & back disorders. HYDROTHERAPY Hydro- and hydrothermal are traditional methods of treatment used for treatment of disease and injury by many cultures. The recuperative and healing properties of hydrotherapy are based on its mechanical and/or thermal effects. Generally, heat quiets and soothes the body, slowing down the activity of internal organs. Cold stimulates and increases internal activity. Water also has a hydrostatic effect. It has a massage-like feeling as the water gently kneads the body. Water, in motion, stimulates touch receptors on the skin, boosting blood circulation and releasing tight muscles. Hydrotherapy and hydrothermal therapy are chiefly used to tone up the body to stimulate digestion, the circulation, and the immune system and to bring relief from pain. YOGA Yoga derived from Sanskrit word meaning \"To Bind\". It is unity of all the powers of body, mind and spirit based on Hindu spiritual treatises.

But due to industrial revolution the accumulation of toxins (food additives ,chemicals anaesthetics and residue of pharmacy drugs , pesticides and heavy metals )surpasses its elimination NURSING THEORY PROVIDING CONTEXT Alternative/complementary modalities performed from within a context of a nursing theory/model take on meaning from within the theory. E.g. Roy adaptation model, deals with the concept of focal, contextual and residual stimuli. Nurse working within the context of this, assesses the stimuli and takes action to promote the client's adaptation in physiologic needs, self-concept, role function, and relations of interdependence nursing health and illness. Nursing Diagnosis/concern Nursing Intervention(s) Rationale Impaired Comfort Acupressure, TT to decrease perceived pain Disturbed Sleep Pattern Massage to promote relaxation, rest Impaired Communication Art therapy to facilitate expression Impaired Coping Humor to facilitate appreciation of that which is funny, to relieve tensions Spiritual Distress Spiritual support to facilitate a sense of inner peace EVIDENCE A 2017 study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements bears this out, as it studied the use of ashwagandha root extract for improving memory and cognitive functions in 50 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).4 MCI is a slight decline in cognitive abilities that's associated with an increased risk of developing more serious dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Participants received either ashwagandha root extract or a placebo for eight weeks. Those who took ashwagandha had significant improvements in a number of areas compared to the placebo group. This included greater improvements in: Immediate and general memory Executive function Sustained attention Information-processing speed The researchers pointed to ashwagandha's sedative properties as a potential mechanism behind the memory benefits, noting they \"may be indirectly involved in improving memory and cognition in human subjects, as stress, anxiety and sleep disorders can affect normal cognitive function YOGA: Greenlee and her colleagues conducted the study to update clinical guidelines for the Society for Integrative Oncology. Greenlee is past president of the society. She said that past research indicates that as many as eight in 10 people with cancer turn to complementary or integrative therapies at some point. The study looked at complementary and alternative therapies, defined as those outside the range of conventional treatments. Complementary treatments are those used along with conventional care, she said. Alternative treatments are often used instead of conventional care. She prefers the term integrative therapy, which describes the use of non-conventional treatments in conjunction with conventional care. The researchers limited the study to integrative therapies for breast cancer patients. Use of these treatments is popular among women with breast cancer, and there is evidence for some treatments. The integrative therapies were graded. An A grade indicates there is strong evidence in favour of that treatment, and B is moderate. C represents preliminary evidence. D means the evidence suggests the treatment is not effective. H means the treatment has the potential to be harmful. Meditation got an A. This therapy was found to have the strongest evidence, recommended for lessening anxiety, improving depression and quality of life. Yoga and music therapy got a B for lessening anxiety and improving mood. Yoga also got a B for improving quality of life. Yoga, acupuncture and hypnosis got a C on fatigue improvement ACUPUNCTURE Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (New York, USA) and University of York (York, UK) researchers conclude that acupuncture is \"more effective than both usual care and sham acupuncture\" for the treatment of chronic pain. The researchers state that their conclusion is based on \"robust evidence from high-quality trials on acupuncture\" with a sample size of approximately 18,000 patients. Specifically, the researchers find acupuncture effective for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, headaches, and migraines They add, \"Acupuncture was also found to be better than standard medical care for all of these chronic pain conditions.\" Moreover, the researchers find acupuncture a cost-effective treatment modality for the alleviation of both knee pain and depression. The researchers note, \"Our research also provides a valuable basis for considering the potential role of acupuncture as a referral option in health care and enabling providers and policy-makers to make decisions based on robust sources of evidence.\" TAI CHI The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that tai chi leads to significant improvements in sleep health in breast cancer survivors with insomnia, with the additional benefits of improving depressive symptoms and fatigue. Furthermore, both tai chi and cognitive behavioral therapy show similar rates of clinically significant improvements in symptoms or remission of insomnia. Both tai chi and CBT showed enduring benefits over one year. ROLE OF NURSE In interest of safe & effective practice, nurses are expected to maintain current knowledge base and obtain ongoing education in areas of practice. In using any therapy a nurse must observe the Code of Professional Conduct ,as well as the requirements of legislation.. The individual nurse is responsible to judge whether her /his qualification education and or experience in use of complementary therapy has brought her /him to a level of competence to use that skill. Nurses practicing complementary therapies must be cognizant of the limits to their practice and should refer to other health professionals as necessary. The informed consent of the individual or his /her guardian is essential prior to the provision of any therapy. Therapeutic interventions should be supported by written policies and protocols which are endorsed by the employing facility. Practice of complementary therapies should be incorporated into the total care of the individual. ROLE OF NURSE CONTD.... Multidisciplinary team approach should be used where relevant The practice of complementary therapies should be appropriately documented. Practice of complementary therapies should be incorporated into the total care of the individual The practice of complementary therapy should be supported by quality assurance activities. Nurses should comprehend well to client 's that when to seek conventional therapies or complementary therapies. Nurses should know client religious & cultural view points so that to determine which complementary therapies would be more appropriate with client believes & values SUMMARY: Introduction of complementary and alternative medicine.
