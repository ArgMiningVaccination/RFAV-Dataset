Thefocus is primarily on materials for elementary and secondary students butalso includes publications of interest to the general public. Sections areorganized by culture area--General, Southwest, Northwest Coast, California,Plateau, Arctic, Plains, Great Basin, Subarctic, Northeast, andSoutheast--and each area is further organized by tribe and then divided intononfiction, fiction, biographies, and traditional stories. Within eachsection, entries are listed alphabetically by author and include publisher,publishing date, and number of pages.

[FOREWORD]To a Future Free of BiasDo you remember reading or hearing phrases such as: \"Sit a of wild Indians,\" and \"don't be an Indian giver\"when you were a child? How about learning to count by enumerating \"Ten Little Indians\" and learningto read by reciting \"I is for Indian\" or \"E is for Eskimo?\" These examples, personally observed by thisChoctaw mother, teacher, and student, as well as by most of America's schoolchildren, are still used inschools today. They set the stage for a lifetime of misinformation and cultural bias about AmericanIndians, objectifying them in a way that undoubtedly would not be tolerated or accepted by any otherethnic group.3 6/25/99 11:47 AM Bibliography of North American Indians http://nmnhwww.si.edulanthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibliogr.html 2 of 4Today, over 500 years since the arrival of Columbus to the shores of the Americas, schoolchildren,teachers, and society are continually inculcated with myths and misinformation about American Indiansand Alaska Natives. Ethnocentric histories, written and edited by the \"discoverers,\" reflect stereotypesand cultural bias in classrooms, textbooks, media, and curriculum, changing or excluding criticalinformation to justify a nation's stance in history.For example, John Smith and Miles Standish are often portrayed as heroes or role models (as Smith is inDisney's popular movie, Pocahontas). These men were far from heroic. History records they wereactually \"browbeating native leaders, robbing Indian food caches, and obtaining food for their bickeringcomrades by trade or extortion.\"1 Similarly, Christopher Columbus's \"discovery\" of America is stillstudied, celebrated, and dramatized in schools. Children do not learn of Columbus's mistreatment,exploitation, and betrayal of the native people he and his men encountered.Children's history books use terms such as \"westward expansion\" and \"Manifest Destiny\" to describewhat would be more accurately called ethnic genocide. These books alternately portray Indians as \"noblesavages,\" \"faithful Indian guides,\" or \"glory and honor\" of takingland and oppressing native people for European purposes that are portrayed as holy and valid.History books are not the only sources of misinformation and stereotypes. Arts and crafts books ofteninclude projects such as making Indian masks or headdresses. However, headdresses represent positionand valor in many native cultures, and the masks of some cultures are considered sacred. Makingconstruction paper and crayon replicas trivializes the important cultural meanings that these objects hold.More appropriately, teachers can educate students about native cultures by studying cultural artifacts andmaterials (in an art class, for example), as well as biographies and histories, for a more well-roundedstudy.The history of Thanksgiving, too, is often misrepresented in books for children: The Pilgrims wereunhappy, because the English king refused to let people go to the church of their choice. To gainreligious freedom, the Pilgrims loaded up all their belongings and sailed for America. They met afriendly Indian named \"Squanto\" who helped them plant crops. After the first harvest, GovernorBradford invited the Indians to a huge feast. Chief Massasoit and ninety braves came and for three daysate their fill of turkey, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin pie. After the first Thanksgiving they lived happilyever after.This familiar version of Thanksgiving obviously omits many important facts. Teachers and parents mustsearch carefully for books that relate this event more accurately. As we know, the Western Hemispherewas not a \"New World,\" but rather the homeland of ancient civilizations and many diverse cultures.Regarding the events of the original thanksgiving, the Indians had held ceremonies of thanks for harvestand other gifts of the Creator for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Europeans. At the feast, infact, the Indians brought most of the food, as they had traditionally done in their own giveawayceremonies. And far from the idyllic scene of two cultures in harmony with which we are oftenpresented, contact with Europeans and the diseases they introduced decimated entire native populations.A few years ago, I was one of several instructors who taught a Smithsonian Institution workshop forlocal elementary school teachers on teaching about American Indians. Some questions asked repeatedlywere: \"What books should I use for teaching children?\" \"Which books are accurate, which are not, and ifnot, why not?\" These sincere questions and twenty-five years of experience as an educator developingand analyzing curricula support my firm belief that teachers do not deliberately use poor teachingmaterials. In the area of American Indian studies, however, misinformation is so pervasive that findingappropriate material can be difficult even for the specialized teacher.This bibliography, compiled by the Anthropology Outreach Office of the Smithsonian's NationalMuseum of Natural History, is a response to these and other teachers' concerns about choosing culturallysensitive and historically accurate books for children about American Indians and Alaska Natives.Parents and the general public may also find it to be a valuable resource for making informed choices4 6/25/99 11:47 AM Bibliography of North American Indians http://nmnhwww.si.edulanthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibliogr.html 3 of 4about books. The antibias guidelines and critiques found here can help readers develop an ability tocritically evaluate books and teaching curricula and provide a foundation by which to assess the value ofmaterials about any culture or ethnic group.As teachers and as parents, we are responsible for what and how we teach our students and children.This publication can help guide educators in becoming personally responsible for their own ethics ofeducation. Creating caring classroom communities that nurture the human spirit regardless of ethnicityor other perceived differences is the beginning step in building an educational environment that isculturally sensitive to all students. Embrace our diversity, for it truly is our greatest strength.Linda SkinnerEdmond, OklahomaSeptember 1996 IT. J. Brasser, \"Early Indian-European Contacts,\" in Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 15, Northeast. Bruce G.Trigger, ed. (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution): 82, 83, 89, 95. PREFACEImages of Native Americans are all around us. They appear in movies, television, books, and sports; areused as symbols and logos for tires, butter, the environment, carpeting, and automobiles; and show up atdifferent times of year as Halloween costumes, in Boy Scout and Campfire Girl rituals, and as guests atThanksgiving feasts. Few of these images have any basis in reality, drawn as they are from one of themost closely held beliefs of American mythology. Indeed, even Indians themselves sometimes have adifficult time separating the reality of their lives as human beings from the fantasy expected of them bythe rest of America.The only arena where some progress has been made in combating this onslaught has been in children'sliterature. The past ten years or so have seen an increase in both the volume and quality of books aboutAmerican Indians for children. Several excellent nonfiction series have appeared (most notably, ChelseaHouse's \"Indians of North America\" and Lerner Publications' \"We Are Still Here\" series; titles from bothare reviewed in this bibliography), and Native authors and artists are finally seeing print with majorpublishers. Fiction has not fared so well, as authors' \"creative license\" is often used as an excuse forstereotypical flights of fancy masquerading as multicultural literature.Nevertheless, it is in books where the greatest potential exists for bringing Americans in touch with theAmerican Indian of reality, not fantasy. With the emphasis on multicultural literature from children'sbook publishers these days, how does one sort out which titles have been rushed into print or repackagedto meet the demand for books on \"diversity\" from sensitive and accurate works that avoid stereotypes?Several bibliographies and guides have been published in recent years, some of them mere booldists of\"Indian\" books without any analysis (often appearing as chapters in guides to \"multicultural literature\").Some are annotated bibliographies that simply describe the storyline and content. The most usefulguides, however, are those that critically evaluate the images, descriptions, and portrayals of Nativepeople, such as this bibliography. The accuracy of the portrayal of the Indian character(s) is the focalpoint of these annotations. This is important. Books are usually reviewed by the major review journalsfor their literary accomplishment, reading level, appeal to young readers, and attractiveness ofillustrations. Almost never do these mainstream reviews consider the accuracy of the portrayals ofNative cultures, or, for that matter, of any other cultures. A book may have a riveting and excitingstoryline, but appalling depictions of Indian characters.The annotations in this bibliography address all of these concerns. Like the best of its peers, it containscritical annotations and evaluations---not just plot summaries---of Indian books. Both positive and5 6/25/99 11:47 AM Bibliography of North American Indians http://nmnhwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibliogr.html negative depictions are described, and the editors are not hesitant to point out controversial titles anddisagreements about specific books. There is good balance and fair treatment in these reviews.So how does a well-meaning parent or teacher or librarian decide which of the many books on themarket to spend her money on? Using this bibliography and others like it is an excellent starting point.When choosing books, look at the authors---are they Native people or do they have experience withAmerican Indian culture and history? How are Indians portrayed in the book? This bibliography coversthese topics, as well as providing a list of sources for additional evaluations. It may be helpful to look inmore than one source for reviews of books on Native Americans. Ask your local Indian center for helpin evaluating and recommending which books to buy. Almost every city and many towns have such acenter. And of course, those living in states with reservations have excellent resources there, too. Finally,the more you read books about Indians, paying attention to all of these issues, the more familiar you willbecome with the subtleties and complexities of accurate portrayals of Indians. It takes time andawareness. Be patient; after all, you have a lifetime of learning to undo!Lisa A.

Teachers andlibrarians are responding to this fact by actively seeking books and other resources that reflect multipleperspectives. Teachers and school administrators are revising existing curricula to correct longstandingmisinterpretations of American history by incorporating materials that present the voices andexperiences of women, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, and AmericansIndians and Alaskan Natives.At the National Museum of Natural History, the Outreach Office of the Department of Anthropologyreceives thousands of requests each year from all over the world for information on AmericanIndiansfrom educators, students, American Indians, and the public at large. The 500th anniversary ofColumbus's arrival in America and interest in environmental issues and American Indian spirituality, aswell as the general trend toward multiculturalism mentioned above have led to a proliferation of books,movies, and educational materials about American Indians. In light of these new resources and inresponse to requests for educational materials, the Outreach Office began compiling a comprehensive,annotated bibliography on American Indians for elementary and secondary students.We began by making an informal inquiry of local schools and libraries to learn what materials werealready available and which ones teachers were using in their classrooms. We discovered that teachers'knowledge of American Indian cultures varied greatly; their emphasis was often on Indians of the pastrather than the present. The next step was to organize a Smithsonian symposium, \"Teaching AboutAmerican Indians,\" held in March 1991. Prominent Indian and non-Indian educators and scholars fromaround the country introduced local elementary school teachers to new curricula, taught them how toidentify stereotypes, and suggested new approaches to teaching about Indians. Teachers had theopportunity to speak with Indian people about whom they were teaching but with whom they had little ifany contact. Symposium participants agreed that there was a need for a critical bibliography thatteachers could use not only as a resource but also as a tool for learning to evaluate reading material onAmerican Indians.Many consultants---Indian and non-Indian school and museum educators, tribal representatives,librarians, and scholars---played a part in the development of this project. Bibliographies by BeverlySlapin and Doris Seale, Barbara Kuipers, Gloyne Byler, Jon C. Stott, andHap Gilliland, among others, also proved invaluable. Dedicated to guiding teachers in choosing booksthat reflect thoughts, beliefs, and experiences of American Indians past and present, these publicationsare listed below.This bibliography focuses primarily on materials for elementary and secondary students, although it hasgrown to include publications of interest to the general public. We have indicated broad reading levelcategories: lower elementary, upper elementary, secondary, and adult (used when a book containssexually explicit material or language). Sections are organized by culture area and tribe, and are furtherdivided into non-fiction and fiction, biographies, and traditional stories. Readers will note that somesections are much longer; some cultures are more widely represented in the available literature. We haveincluded several scholarly works that contain maps, timelines, or other information (usually cited in theannotation) useful for teaching .The bibliography concludes with an author and title index.We have made an intensive effort to review books published by both large and small presses---especiallythose committed to American Indian authors. Many excellent publications by native writers, sometimes 7 6/25/99 11:58 AM N.American Indians Biblio: Introduction http://nmnhwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibintro.html 2 of 6from little known publishers, provide new perspectives on the values, struggles, and aspirations of nativepeople, or relate traditional stories that vividly describe the creation of the world or the attributes ofliving creatures.Finally, the bibliography contains many books that we found to be questionable in content andquality---examples of the misinformation and stereotypes that are, regrettably, found in many books onAmerican Indians for both children and adults. Balance is an important factor to consider in reviewingbooks. We found that some books that were strong in certain aspects were weak in others. For example,a well-written book might contain poor or inappropriate illustrations. Or some books that are consideredclassics reflect attitudes and language of their time, which may be considered inappropriate or offensivetoday. Including the disappointing with the excellent provides an opportunity for teachers and studentsto learn the difference between poorly researched and carelessly written books and those that provideaccurate and culturally sensitive material.The questions listed below provided the framework for our evaluations of books on American Indians.They were developed and adapted from our readings and from sources listed below. We encouragereaders to consult these and other sources to develop their own methods of evaluation.1. Is the book's cultural information accurate?2. Is the historical information accurate?3. Does the book contain accurate or preferred word usage and spellings?4. Are loaded or offensive words used, e.g. \"squaw,\" \"brave,\" \"primitive\"?5. Does the book lump all American Indian people together rather than referring to individual groupsor tribes? Are tribal differences recognized?6. Does the book promote or present a stereotypical \"Hollywood\" version of American Indians?7. Do the illustrations depict stereotypical images of American Indians?8. Does the book refer to American Indians as though they belong to the past? If so, is it made clearthat this is intentional?9. Do American Indians initiate actions based on their own values and judgements rather than onlyreacting to outside factors?10. Are Indians presented as stoic, one-dimensional, unfeeling characters or as real human beings withstrengths/weaknesses, joys, and sorrows?11. When the dominant group is non-Indian, is that group always shown in a more favorable light?12. Is equal respect shown to male and female roles?13. Are American Indian groups presented as heirs to rich historical traditions going back topre-Contact days?14. Are American Indian groups/nations presented as dynamic, evolving communities that can adaptto new conditions and control their own destinies?15. Are American Indian contributions to Western civilization recognized?16. Are claims that a particular person occupies a position of leadership in political or ceremonialaffairs validated by most members of the claimants' culture?17. Does the book cite sources for its facts?AccuracyIt is important to seek out books that are historically and culturally accurate. This can be a complexissue. Cultures are constantly changing and no one person or source can speak for an entire group.History is interpretive and sometimes subjective depending on the perspective and methods of thoserecording it. Cultural perspectives vary widely on subjects such as religion and cosmology, origin andcreation, and warfare and other aspects of history. For example, scientists support the evidence hasshown that the ancestors of American Indians arrived in what is now Alaska from Asia thousands ofyears ago, yet Indian cultures often have very different beliefs about their origins---many believe thatthey originated on this continent. Many books reflect a single perspective on complex ideas or events, orcontain at least some historical or cultural inaccuracies, either in text or illustrations. In some cases, abook containing errors can still be a useful teaching resource if parents, teachers, and librarians areaware of its errors and are careful to avoid perpetuating misinformation.8 6/25/99 11:58 AM N.American Indians Biblio: Introduction http://nmnbwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibintro.html StereotypesStereotypical representations of American Indians are ubiquitous---in the media, in toys, and in books,many of which are found in school libraries and classrooms. Common examples of stereotypes weencountered are described below.***Indians share a common culture, language, and/or physical type.On the contrary, there is wide diversity among American Indian peoples. Tribes have distinct histories,cultures, beliefs, languages, and physical characteristics. However, some books oversimplify, combinedisparate traits, or fail to identify the cultural affiliation of their characters. For example, AmericanIndian characters are often shown wearing feathered headdresses, hunting buffalo, living in tipis, andriding horses---that is with characteristics of Plains Indians that many people associate with all Indians.This image has been perpetuated for decades by the press, advertising, and Hollywood. The typical\"Hollywood Indian\" might also be a one-dimensional (either good or bad) character who uses brokenEnglish, wears a buckskin breechcloth and a feather in his hair, and expresses little if any emotion. He ismore an \"Indian\" than he is a Sioux, a Comanche, or a Cheyenne.This tendency to combine characteristics or discount differences is also prevalent in descriptions andillustrations of American Indian material culture. Some authors fail to research their subjects, preferring,for example, to show their characters traveling in birchbark canoes while living in tipis, or paintingSouthwestern-style pots while sitting beside totem poles.***Indian cultures are dead or dying.Often the most subtle stereotypes are the most insidious. Many books, both fiction and non-fiction, arewritten in the past tense, perpetuating the idea that all Indian cultures are of the past, have died out, orare almost extinct. One variation of this stereotype is writing that concentrates on pre-reservation Indianlife, with no recognition of the vital, flourishing, and constantly changing cultures that exist today.Ironically, many times, even in otherwise well-written books, cultures are described as being\"destroyed,\" or having their \"spirits crushed.\"Fortunately, in recent years, many books have focussed on contemporary Indian cultures---expressingtheir vitality, resilience, and independence. These books describe the gains made by native people inrevitalizing their own traditions and demonstrate the challenges of living in a country where Europeanvalues predominate.***Indians are primitive and incapable of initiating action or controlling their own fate.In many books with both Indian and non-Indian characters, it is often the non-Indians who rescue theIndians, teach the Indians \"superior\" technology, or \"save the day.\" Indian cultures were thriving forhundreds of years prior to the arrival of Europeans, but this is rarely acknowledged, especially in booksfor children.***Indians possess spiritual powers and a magical connection to the natural world.It is ironic given high rates of mortality, disease, and poverty, and the lack of educational opportunityexperienced by a large number of native people that Indian culture is often romanticized by non-Indians.New-agers and spiritual hucksters, with limited understanding and no authority have tried to co-opt andexploit aspects of native spirituality for their own gains. Some of the books we have reviewed, productsof misplaced ignorance and idealism, insult and demean native ceremonial spiritual values.LanguageMany books contain loaded words that reflect bias or prejudice. \"Squaw,\" \"primitive,\" \"buck,\" \"brave,\"and \"papoose\" are examples of words that American Indians consider degrading, insulting, patronizing, 3 of 6 9 6/25/99 11:58 AM N.American Indians Biblio: Introduction http://nmnhwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibintro.htm1 or generalizing. Books often describe \"battles\" won by U.S. soldiers but \"massacres\" carried out byIndians. In addition, Indian warriors are often \"fierce,\" \"cruel,\" or \"bloodthirsty,\" while U.S. Armysoldiers or cavalry are \"courageous,\" \"daring,\" or \"heroic.\" These stereotypes are often reinforced inillustrations showing, for example, Indians sneaking up to a homesteader's cabin or an Indian grasping apioneer woman's neck and wielding a tomahawk.A Note About This BibliographyMany, many books on American Indians are being published today, and it is impossible to review themall. By the time this bibliography is printed, hundreds of other books will be on bookstore and libraryshelves, and some we have reviewed may be out-of-print. Our hope is that this bibliography will assistteachers and parents in making more informed choices for their students and children, whether theychoose titles from our list or do their own evaluations of books we haven't seen.In the annotations, we have indicated \"no tribe identified,\" when the cultural affiliation of a story is notstated. We have given the author's cultural affiliation when it is noted in the book, however, publicationsoften do not include this information. The terms \"Native American,\" \"Indian,\" and \"American Indian\"are individual preferences and all acceptable. For this and other cultural word usages and spellings,however, we have followed the Smithsonian's Handbook of North American Indians, which uses theterm \"American Indian.\"Our reviews note books' strengths and weaknesses. Books that we found exceptional were given a star,indicating that they are highly recommended; those we found questionable were given a question mark,indicating that they are not recommended. Books we found to be acceptable but not exceptional---forinstance, books with accurate information but a cumbersome writing style or format, or books withbeautiful and sensitive illustrations but a lack of substantial information---were given no marks. Werealize, of course, that all reviews, including those in this bibliography, are subjective.Recommended Reference Series:Handbook of North American Indians. Sturtevant, William C. general editor.

Abel is an American Indian of mixedheritage: Pueblo, Hispanic, and perhaps Navajo through his unknown father. The novelchronicles Abel's unraveling after the war, from his drunken return to his commission of amurder---then a sentence in jail, and a stint in Los Angeles, after being relocated there bythe government.

New York, NY: Gordon Press; 1977. 301 pages.(secondary).This novel centers around the lost \"magic\" of a Southwest American Indian tribe referred toas the \"Nag'-a-pah\" (presumably Navajo) and the attempt of young Kay'-yah to retrieve thismagic from their neighboring enemy tribe, the \"To-to'-me.\" A foreword states that the storyis an ancient legend, but no sources are cited. The prologue explains that\"superstition...more than all else, governed the life and conduct of our American Indiansbefore the coming of the white man\" and the story has the protagonist consistentlyovercoming these \"superstitions\" in his quest to survive his enemy pursuers and retrieve themagic. Kay'-yah admits that \"...something within him, something that he had never voicedto others, always spoke against the idea that any power or virtue could come out ofincantations, weird chants, and sand paintings....\" It seems ironic that this skepticalcharacter is later chosen to be the next medicine man.Nunes, Susan; Himler, Ronald, illus.

The editor attempts to provide a more realistic view of American Indians than wascurrently available from popular literature; the resulting collection is uneven. Most of thestories present the culture from the inside; two drawn directly from American Indiansources are particularly successful. Others may leave the reader more confused thaninformed. Some of the attitudes and concepts are outmoded. The introduction, by A.L.Kroeber, refers to the cultures described in this collection as representing \"a ladder ofculture development...in...order of advancement,\" and speaks of an anthropologist and \"hisIndians.\" Notes on the various tribes give 1922 statistics, and accompanying bibliographieshave not been updated.Paulsen, Gary.

The first chapter discusses traditional Plains lifeways, with much of thefocus on men's activities.

Indianresistance, eventual defeat, and removal to reservations is sometimes movingly described.Though the book is overtly sympathetic to the plight of the Indians, \"asides\" throughoutseem to assume that the reader relates more to white interests: \"Best of all [the whites']hunting rifles had telescopic sights that allowed them to knock a brave out of the saddle ahalf mile away.\" The term \"brave\" is used several times in the book. In one episode, Kiowaspirituality is belittled: \"The Kiowas could easily have wiped out the small caravan...hadtheir medicine man not heard an owl, his spirit helper. An owl had hooted, meaning, he said,that they must attack only the second group of whites to come along the road that day.

The author balances these scenes withdescriptions of equally horrendous atrocities perpetrated by Mexican soldiers. In the end,the author does make a judgement when the protagonist realizes that \"I could never be trulyan Apache.

The bookfocuses on housing, subsistence, the potlatch, and Southwest and California Indianreligions. The effort to cover so much material in such a limited book results in broadgeneralizations with little attempt to explain underlying structure. For instance, NorthwestCoast Indians are characterized as \"wasteful,\" without context or explanation of theimportance of the potlatch as a means of redistributing wealth within the society. The bookdeclares, \"Strangely, all the California Indians lived off the rich land without making anyeffort to develop it into farms,\" but does not explain why the Indians of that area had noneed to farm in order to flourish.

(secondary).The book describes lifeways (social organization, economy, religion) of selected tribes fromthe four culture areas along the Pacific Coast (Arctic, Subarctic, Northwest Coast, andCalifornia) during the period 1500--1700. Nine of the eighteen descriptions are followed byfictional stories intended to illustrate the spirit and essence of the people. The author runs arisk inherent to fictionalizing about past societies---that of attributing thoughts and actionsto the characters that may be alien or unlikely for people in that society. In one story, ayoung Kwakuitl girl questions the violence of one of her tribe's rituals. This pairing offictional opinion with fact might lead the reader to feel that all aspects of the story areculturally accurate. Unfortunately, this combination of lists of facts with fictional storiesfails to coalesce into a comprehensible introduction to the many cultures described.

The book is based on a variety ofsources, mainly recollections and impressions from the author's childhood, supplemented bystories overheard from French and Hudson Bay traders and exploring parties. Published in1906, the book is a prime example of the racism toward American Indians inherent in the19th century. Almost every page contains an offensive characterization of the people, andthey are constantly objectified. Women are described as \"short, squatty creatures, with atendency to grow fat and wrinlded when they could get enough food to grow fat on....\" Thechildren are described as \"odd-looking creatures.\" The interior of a cedar house is describedas looking like \"a witches' cave\" pervaded with \"the smell, the awful smell of the Indianlodge.\" Every custom not understood is looked at as weird, meaningless, and an example ofirrationality. In discussing traditional medicine and the Natives' attitude about death: \"Oneof the most pathetic characteristics of all Indians on the Pacific Coast was their submissionto what seemed the inevitable.\" On their hunting and fishing practices, the book describes\"...in mere love of slaughter [the Indian children] would frequent the streams and maim andkill the salmon coming up to spawn.\" This book could be used as an example of the worstkinds of stereotyping about Indians. 75 14 of 15 6/25/99 12:17 PM North American Indian Bibliography: Northwest Coast http://nmnhwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibNW.htm I Go back to Main Page for North American Indian Bibliography. 7 615 of 15 6/25/99 12:17 PM North American Indian Bibliography: California http://nmnhwww.si.edu/anthro/outreach/Indbibl/bibcalif.html Anthropology Outreach Office Smithsonian Institution0 A CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY ON NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS, FOR K-12 CALIFORNIACALIFORNIA TRADITIONAL STORIESBierhorst, John ed.; Curtis, Edward S., photog.

The effort to cover so much material in such a limited book results in broadgeneralizations with little attempt to explain underlying structure. For instance, NorthwestCoast Indians are characterized as \"wasteful,\" without providing context for understandingthe importance of the potlatch as a means of redistributing wealth within the society. Thebook declares, \"Strangely, all the California Indians lived off the rich land without makingany effort to develop it into farms,\" but does not explain why the Indians of that area had noneed to farm in order to flourish. No information on contemporary Indian culture is given.Baylor, Byrd; Ingram, Jerry (Choctaw), illus. They Put on Masks. New York, NY: Charles Scribner'sSons; 1974. 47 pages.

Indian 1985. 30 pages.(lower elementary) ?This book briefly describes the festivals of American Indians in the Eastern Woodlands(Iroquois, Algonquian), Southeast (Muskogee), Plains, Southwest (Pueblo), California, andNorthwest Coast regions. Inaccuracies, generalizations, and stereotypes are used throughoutthe book, as are potentially offensive words such as \"braves.\" \"The Indians who lived inCalifornia did not hunt or farm,\" the book declares. \"They lived entirely on acorns that weregathered from trees. But while their lives were easy and peaceful, their festivals were almosttotally concerned with death.\"Brown, Dee. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West. New York,NY: Holt & Co.; 1991; c1970. 512 pages. * (secondary).The Western tribes' displacement from their lands, confinement to reservations, and theconsequent destruction of traditional culture are carefully and compassionately recounted inthis compelling and highly readable history (1860--1890). Unlike other histories coveringthese topics, the book presents the events as experienced by the victims. The main sourcesfor the history are official records of U.S.-Indian treaty councils and meetings. Thereasonableness and humanity expressed by the American Indian spokesmen during theseencounters, as recounted here, do much to counter the stereotype of \"ignorant,\" \"savage\"Indians, and the courageous spirit they reveal evokes admiration and respect. Chapters arearranged chronologically, each devoted to a particular tribe or campaign. The final chapterdescribes the growth and significance of the Ghost Dance movement and the Battle ofWounded Knee.

Nine of the eighteen descriptions are followed byfictional stories intended to illustrate the spirit and essence of the people. The author runs arisk inherent to fictionalizing about past societies---that of attributing thoughts and actionsto the characters that may be alien or unlikely for people in that society. In one story, ayoung Kwakuitl girl questions the violence of one of her tribe's rituals. This pairing offictional opinion with fact might lead the reader to feel that all aspects of the story areculturally accurate.

The first chapter discusses traditional Plains lifeways, with much of thefocus on men's activities.

Indianresistance, eventual defeat, and removal to reservations is sometimes movingly described.Though the book is overtly sympathetic to the plight of the Indians, \"asides\" throughoutseem to assume that the reader relates more to white interests: \"Best of all [the whites']hunting rifles had telescopic sights that allowed them to knock a brave out of the saddle ahalf mile away.\" The term \"brave\" is used several times in the book. In one episode, Kiowaspirituality is belittled: \"The Kiowas could easily have wiped out the small caravan...hadtheir medicine man not heard an owl, his spirit helper. An owl had hooted, meaning, he said,that they must attack only the second group of whites to come along the road that day. ThusGeneral Sherman kept his red hair thanks to a restless owl.\" These examples indicate atendency to perpetuate an \"us-and-them\" mentality rather than seeking to bridge gaps inintercultural understanding.

(secondary)The book describes lifeways (social organization, economy, religion) of selected tribes fromthe four culture areas along the Pacific Coast (Arctic, Subarctic, Northwest Coast, andCalifornia) during the period 1500--1700. Nine of the eighteen descriptions are followed byfictional stories intended to illustrate the spirit and essence of the people. The author runs arisk inherent in fictionalizing past societies---that of attributing thoughts and actions to thecharacters that may be alien or unlikely for people in that society. In one story, a youngKwakuitl girl questions the violence of one of her tribe's rituals. This pairing of fictionalopinion with fact might lead the reader to feel that all aspects of the story are culturallyaccurate.

In oneepisode, Kiowa spirituality is belittled: \"The Kiowas could easily have wiped out the smallcaravan...had their medicine man not heard an owl, his spirit helper. An owl had hooted,meaning, he said, that they must attack only the second group of whites to come along theroad that day.

The protagonist, Damn Talmage, joins the volunteers to avenge thedeaths of his family killed in a Cheyenne raid. The battle and subsequent siege are the focusof much of the story, which abounds in familiar stereotypes. There is no attempt to explainthe reasons behind the Cheyenne War of 1868 from the Indian perspective (encroachmentby whites onto Indian hunting grounds, etc).

A moving portrait of Black Elk emerges. He believed he should use hisvisions and special powers to help the Lakota return to a good life, similar to the one theyenjoyed before the arrival of the whites. Yet he could find no way to make this dream areality, and Neihardt emphasizes Black Elk's mournful recognition of this failure. However,since Neihardt intended his book as a work of art rather than an anthropological oral history,he felt free to add thoughts of his own and to omit the more optimistic side of Black Elk'sviews---the Lakota belief that the past can recur and so the restoration of the good life forthe Lakota is still possible.

The bookfocuses on housing, subsistence, the potlatch, and Southwest and California Indianreligions. The attempt to cover so much material in such a limited book results in broadgeneralizations with little attempt to explain underlying structure. For instance, NorthwestCoast Indians are characterized as \"wasteful,\" without context or explanation of theimportance of the potlatch as a means of redistributing wealth within the society. The bookdeclares, \"Strangely, all the California Indians lived off the rich land without making anyeffort to develop it into farms,\" does not explain why the Indians of that area had no need tofarm in order to flourish.

(lower elementary) ?.In this story, set in Manhattan Island in the 17th century, a young American Indian boy(tribe not indicated) sees non-Natives for the first time and attempts, unsuccessfully, tomake friends with them. While the book's basic intent is a good one---to introduce childrento the idea of the gradual displacement of Native Americans by Euroamerican settlers---it ismarred by an unrealistic story. For instance, Indians and non-Indians are shown able tocomniunicate verbally with each other upon initial contact, and the Indians are familiar withthe handling of guns without prior knowledge of their existence, according to the story.Illustrations are inaccurate and stereotypical, such as showing the boy's father wearing aPlains warbonnet.Bruchac, Joseph Publishing, 1993. 317 pp. (secondary)This fictional story is based, in part, on oral traditions of the Abenaki, the Iroquois, andother Native peoples of the Northeastern U.S. The novel's protagonist, Young Hunter, ischosen by a \"far-seeing one\" to undertake a dangerous journey to confront \"that which iscoming towards us,\" an undefined force that is endangering Young Hunter's people, theOnly People. Set long before the arrival of Europeans in North America, the villains aregrey-skinned giants, a race of people encountered in many native stories as cannibalisticgiants who hunted and ate humans. Young Hunter's journey is both spiritual and physical.He encounters violence and depravity and responds with compassion and bravery. Heultimately triumphs as he slays a black creature and the giants. In the novel's introduction,the author explains some of Native traditions and views evident in the story; for example,Native child-rearing practices, the importance of dogs, and the strong tradition ofredemption among northeastern Native peoples. There is a rape scene and some graphicdescriptions of violence that make this unsuitable pages.

(secondary).Reprinted from the original 1922 edition, this book includes twenty-seven fictionalnarratives, written by anthropologists, about various North and Central American Indiancultures. The editor attempts to provide a more realistic view of American Indians than wascurrently available from popular literature; the resulting collection is uneven. Most of thestories endeavor to present the culture from the inside; two that are drawn directly fromAmerican Indian sources are particularly successful. Others may leave the reader moreconfused than informed. Some of the attitudes and concepts are outmoded. Theintroduction, by A.L. Kroeber, refers to the cultures described in this collection asrepresenting \"a ladder of culture development ...in...order of advancement,\" and speaks ofan anthropologist and \"his Indians.\" Notes on the various tribes give 1922 statistics, andaccompanying bibliographies have not been updated.Speare, Elizabeth.

The final sentence: \"Butthe vision [of Pontiac]...ignited a hatred between white men and red that would burn formore than 100 years---until the last western Indian surrendered to the white invaders.\" Thisseems to imply that Pontiac alone was responsible for the non-Indian animosity.

They were captured.\" In describing the death of Osceola, the book recounts,\"Osceola became ill and died in 1838.
