Children who receive vaccines on the recommended schedule protect themselves and their communities while also decreasing future health care costs. Most children receive the recommended vaccinations, but disparities remain. - During the COVID-19 pandemic, children have missed routine well-child care and related vaccinations. If vaccination rates decline below levels required to maintain herd immunity, dangerous outbreaks of preventable diseases could follow. - It is urgent that children and adolescents catch up on missed vaccinations now to protect themselves and their communities before they return to school, camp, sports, and other in-person settings. Immediately addressing missed routine vaccines may also help streamline the widespread implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination strategy for children and adolescents. - Public education campaigns about the need to catch up on missed vaccinations as well as their safety and efficacy, together with close coordination between state and local health departments, schools, and other partners, can help increase childhood vaccination rates quickly. - At the federal level, improvements to the Vaccines for Children program would help the program work more efficiently and reach additional children with vaccines at no cost, consequently narrowing gaps in vaccination rates by race, ethnicity, family income, and insurance status. Introduction Vaccines are a safe and effective method of reducing the burden of infectious disease. On an individual level, they prevent severe illness, death, and long-term consequences of disease such as neurological disorders. On the community level, they forestall dangerous outbreaks of infectious disease and save money that would otherwise be spent on treating preventable illnesses.\u00b9 Children who receive vaccines on the recommended schedule protect themselves and their communities while also decreasing future health care costs.\u00b2 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides a list of recommended vaccines that guide immunization schedules for children, adolescents, and adults.\u00b3 The negative impact of COVID-19 on well-child visits and routine childhood vaccination threatens to exacerbate the spread of preventable diseases and requires urgent attention. By 2019, an estimated 70.5 percent of children born in 2016 and 2017 were up to date on the seven-vaccine series recommended by ACIP for young children.4 However, this rate varied by race and ethnicity, poverty level, and insurance status (see Figure 1). Black, non-Hispanic children were the least likely to receive all vaccines in the series (65.8 percent), while Asian, non-Hispanic children were the most likely (75.1 percent).5 Compared to 76.9 percent of privately insured children, only 65.7 percent of children covered by Medicaid were up to date, a disturbing disparity that is perhaps partially explained by socioeconomic barriers.6 Only 62 percent of children below poverty had received the recommended vaccines, while 74.1 percent of all other children had received the full series.7 In 2019, under-vaccinated communities contributed to measles outbreaks across the United States (U.S.), leading to the highest number of cases seen nationwide since 1992.8 Figure 1. Vaccination Coverage Rates by Selected Demographic Characteristics A decrease in vaccination rates could result in fewer communities reaching herd immunity for preventable diseases. A locality achieves herd immunity when the spread of an infectious disease is unlikely because a certain percentage of the population is immune to the disease. The percentage necessary to achieve herd immunity for each disease varies based on the level of infectiousness; these estimated thresholds guide vaccination requirements to ensure every community remains healthy (see Table 1).
