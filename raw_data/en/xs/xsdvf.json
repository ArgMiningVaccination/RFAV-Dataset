Because cats require different concentrations, flavors, and dosing protocols than humans, we spent many weeks researching criteria that would ensure a reliable and effective list of the best CBD oils made for cats. Most importantly, our research showed that CBD oils for cats were best tolerated when made from organic small-batch or industrial hemp. The lack of potential contaminants in organic CBD oil is greatly minimized, ensuring cats aren't exposed to any chemicals or heavy metals that could hurt their sensitive systems. We also considered products that struck a good balance between weight, age, and size categories. This factor was important because cats can experience different levels of sedation when given CBD oil based on the amount they weigh. For this reason, we looked for brands that could customize their products to fit your pet's individual needs. Finally, we used flavor options as a major factor in our research. Cats have very sensitive palates, and only products with natural CBD hemp oil flavoring that blends seamlessly into meals or oils that have an irresistible flavor cats love were considered. How to Pick the Best CBD Oil for Your Cat The inability of cats to communicate their needs in a clear, comprehensive way makes choosing a reliable CBD hemp oil especially hard. Add in that wellness issues can fluctuate based on pet age, weight, and size and you have a tall order to fill when it comes to maintaining your cat's best quality of life. But that doesn't mean buying CBD oil for Kitty is impossible; it just means you need helpful tips from the millions of people who love CBD oil for cats. Choose a CBD concentration to match cats' weight and wellness needs Like humans, cats can overdo it on CBD oils, triggering minor side effects. While some of these side effects are common to CBD use, others may result from your cat's ability to physically process a large dose of CBD quickly. For this reason, picking a CBD concentration formulated to your cat's specific weight or size will do wonders for maximizing benefits, minimizing adverse reactions, and solidifying CBD oil as a positive experience in your cat's mind. While specific dosing guidelines will vary from brand to brand, CBD oil concentrations below 75mg are suitable for cats weighing up to 5 lbs. Pet CBD oil drops made for use by cats and concentrated between 150mg to 250mg are suitable for medium cats weighing up to 10 lbs. Concentrations exceeding 300mg are suitable for large cats exceeding 10 lbs. and, in small, measured doses, may also be ideal for supporting chronic or intense wellness needs in cats of all sizes. Don't get sucked in by \"greenwashing\" The wellness industry has helped millions of pets find a better quality of life, but it can also be a playground for marketing gimmicks and grandiose claims. Greenwashing is a type of marketing that capitalizes on vague terminology and imagery to simulate an environmentally or health-conscious brand when in reality, the product is full of synthetic additives. A particularly egregious example of this deceptive marketing practice is with brands heavily promoting sustainable farming methods for their hemp plants. The idea created is that sustainable hemp plant farming must mean the entire product is made with cGMP and other environmentally and health-conscious practices when in truth, harsh solvents, synthetic fillers, and unsafe manufacturing processes can slip into the end product. It's important to be aware of these marketing tactics, going beyond the sustainable or organic CBD oil aspect of the product and looking at the process throughout the entire stage. Only this way can you be sure you get a safe, high-quality pet CBD oil that promotes the best quality of life. To that end, always check lab reports before buying CBD for cats, as they will be the best indicator of a sustainable, organic product free from contaminants and made with the best quality control practices. Fast-acting vs. long-lasting; figure out which you need The hair-trigger behavior issues cats can display without warning means owners need to be prepared for a sudden onset of stress or aggressive behavior. To combat this, many pet parents seek out fast-acting CBD oils that will quickly calm their cats down and reduce the negative effects of sudden issues. On the other hand, long-term wellness that lasts while you are away at work or sleeping is also key for cat owners. Giving a single dose in the morning and having it still be effective at night is vital for cats that might experience chronic issues like anxiety or joint pain. If your goal is to promote fast effects that can calm acute triggers from loud noises, new visitors, or unfamiliar animals in the area, look for CBD cat tinctures blended with MCT oil. This coconut-derived multi chain triglyceride enhances CBD oil absorption and provides a natural mood boost for fast wellness effects that calm, relax, and relieve. Long-lasting wellness for chronic issues, night zoomies, separation anxiety, and age-related conditions are best found in CBD cat tinctures blended with hemp seed oil. Like MCT oil, this bioavailable ingredient maximizes absorption but keeps endocannabinoid saturation working steadily for hours and hours of comfort and relaxation. Benefits of CBD Oil for Cats Denying that [CBD oil for cats](https://www.chicagomag.com/promotion/cbd-oil-for-cats-5-cbd-products-to-relieve-pain-and-stress/) has benefits would be like denying the sun shines. The list of information available from pet owners and veterinarians is amazing in its scope and accuracy, showing a wide array of wellness gains cats can experience when using CBD oil as part of their care routine. Stress management & mood regulation Neural activity and brain composition in cats are similar to humans, so it follows that cats can suffer from the [same neurological issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9261448/), including anxiousness and racing thoughts. However, cat brains don't really progress in function beyond that of a typical two-year old human, making them more sensitive to change, fear, and stress than their owners. Fortunately, ongoing research is looking for concrete ways to support theories that CBD interacts with endocannabinoid receptors responsible for modulating mood, reducing stress levels, and calming anxious behaviors. For cats in high-stress situations like vet visits or long trips, CBD oil may provide the comfort they need to stay calm and focused. CBD hemp oil for cats specifically acts as the perfect medium for stress management and mood regulation, as it promotes CBD's best calming effects faster than other types of products. As a result, you don't have to worry long about your cat's zoomies or behavioral outbursts to stress-inducing situations. Pain & inflammation management Chronic pain and inflammation are prevalent issues in cats, resulting from their active lifestyle, rapid metabolism, and unique skeletal structure. Unfortunately, cats can't tell us what's wrong when pain flares up, so their owners have to use a mixture of observation and intuition when searching for solutions. Based on thousands of studies, much research has confidently theorized that CBD is a potent [anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023045/#:~:text=Acting%20through%20the%20PPAR%CE%B3%20receptor,elevated%20by%20CBD%20%5B92%5D.), antagonizing CB2 receptors for a coordinated response to reduce inflammation and ease pain symptoms. Add in the fact that CBD also works to relax the body physically, and you have a natural way to provide acute and long-term physical relief for your cat. CBD oil is an excellent choice for this purpose as its rapid absorption helps direct CBD's anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties into the system quickly and efficiently. As a result, cats can find relief from age-related hip pain, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. Immune system support The immune system is the cornerstone of health in both humans and cats, so it's vital that we provide our feline companions with the best chance at wellness every day. A healthy immune system does more than keep illness and disease at bay; it also promotes better nutritional uptake, enhanced organ function, and prevents the build-up of toxins in the body. Research has pointed to CBD's potential role as an immune system modulator that helps stimulate the endocrine system while promoting better overall homeostasis in the body. By encouraging restful sleep cycles, providing anti-inflammatory properties, and increasing gut health, CBD oil has been shown to provide immunity benefits that support the body for long-term wellness. CBD oil is a great way to consistently get appropriate doses of CBD into your cat's system, as it can be administered directly or added to food and treats. With regular use, cats may experience better immune health protection from environmental factors like pollen and dust mites. Increased appetite & digestion Picky eaters aren't the only appetite issue cats face. Sometimes, the lack of desire to eat food or drink water can be due to underlying health issues like nausea and stomach cramps, environmental changes, or even unseen external irritations. As a result, cats can find themselves in a place of malnourishment and dehydration, leading to more severe health concerns. Comprehensive CBD profiles are well known for stimulating a range of appetite and digestion issues, helping to trigger food cravings, soothe cramps, and reduce nausea. Additionally, with CBD [antagonizing CB2 receptors in the gastrointestinal system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17906675/#:~:text=CB2%20receptors%20represent%20a%20braking,immune%20activation%20and%20motility%20dysfunction.), cats experience faster nutrient uptake and better gut health for increased energy levels and mood stability. CBD oil is ideal for addressing these issues in cats as it often comes in irresistible flavors. From wild Alaskan salmon to natural chicken, beef, or bacon flavors, you can easily find a taste your cat won't stop bothering you for. And because these deliciously flavored CBD oils blend seamlessly into food, you can turn once-overlooked meals into a fancy feast your cat will devour. Other Types of CBD for Cats While CBD oil tinctures are an excellent way to get your cat reliable, consistent wellness benefits fast, they aren't the only way to support a better quality of life. In fact, by using other forms of [CBD for cats](https://www.phillymag.com/sponsor-content/best-cbd-for-cats-5-products-to-relieve-pain-and-anxiety/) in addition to oil tinctures, you can better target different aspects of your cat's health and increase the quality of CBD's effects. CBD soft chews These are soft, bite-sized treats made from natural ingredients and infused with premium CBD oil. They are always deliciously flavored and formulated with essential minerals and nutrients cats need to stay strong and healthy. CBD soft chews for cats don't work as fast as CBD oil and are usually best reserved for planned separation, post-surgery care, and long trips. However, the delayed onset of effects is well worth it considering the more extended relief CBD edibles bring, usually 6 to 8 hours. Most choose CBD oil for daytime use and soft chews for a hassle-free way to relax your cat all night. The CBD oil will give you fast effects, so you don't have to worry about your cat's wellness when running late, and the CBD soft chews will offer prolonged effects when you want to ensure long-term comfort and relaxation. CBD cat food If your cat already has a pretty established eating routine, you probably don't want to do too much to mess it up. This is where mixing low-dose CBD cat food into their regular meals can be useful. CBD cat food is designed to combine all the flavors cats love and health benefits from natural CBD oils, giving your pet a delicious meal they can enjoy anytime. The best part is that CBD cat food helps ensure consistent daily dosing of CBD for better long-term results, helping to keep your cat calm and regulated throughout the day or night. CBD cat food makes a great substitute when your regular oil tincture is finished and the new bottle hasn't arrived. It also makes a great way to get acute and long-term wellness needs, as you can always top up your cat's CBD levels with fast-acting tinctures if needed. CBD cat creams Like human-grade topicals, hemp CBD oil cat creams are designed to be applied directly onto the skin. In cats, this can relieve soreness, itchiness, and dryness associated with allergies or skin infections. CBD cat creams work by providing direct relief in the area of application and offer powerful anti-inflammatory benefits. This can be especially useful for cats that suffer from long-term skin conditions like psoriasis or eczema. Topicals and the [best CBD oil for cats](https://www.amny.com/sponsored/best-cbd-oil-for-cats-5-products-to-relieve-stress-pain-and-more/) work synergistically as the former relaxes external pains, and the latter calms the fear and anxiety brought up by the injury or irritation. For many cat owners, there is no better way to provide all the love and care they need to stay healthy and happy. How Much CBD Oil Should I Give My Cat? Some would argue that it's trickier to dose cats correctly with CBD, given their picky eating habits and high sensitivity to any type of supplement or medication. Going with the instructions on the package will be the best option for many cat owners familiar with the dosing process, but not the effects of a new CBD oil. For first-time dosing or CBD use in general, there are a few tips that can help clarify vague dosing verbiage on how much CBD oil to administer and ensure a positive experience for your pet: - Start small and slow. Cats only require a few milligrams of CBD per 10 lbs. of body weight. Often this amount of CBD oil is available in a few drops rather than the entire dropper. By starting with a few drops at a time, you can monitor the effects and adjust as needed. - Be consistent in dosing practices. Always give your cat the same amount of CBD in the same way as often as your schedule allows. The sustained effects of a few milligrams of CBD over time can offer better stability to your cat's overall well-being and keep them calm and relaxed more consistently. - Split doses for more balanced effects. If you think the single-serving recommendation is too much to take at once, consider splitting the dose throughout the day. This is really great for small cats who require a fraction of the recommended dose and become less overwhelmed by CBD's effects when taken in microdoses. - Trial and error is the best dosing method. Over time, you will learn a lot about your cat's specific needs and be able to adjust dosages as needed. This will also help you identify any issues that may arise with product ingredients and recommend better options for future buying decisions. Ultimately, when figuring out how much of the [best CBD for cats](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/sponsored/2023/06/cbd-for-cats-5-best-cbd-balms-and-cbd-oils-for-cats) to give, the answer lies in finding what works best for both of you. Be patient and consistent with your dosing practices, and soon enough, your cat will find their sweet spot in CBD's effectiveness. Frequently Asked Questions 1. Will CBD oil make my pet sleepy? No, CBD oil won't make your pet sleepy. While it may provide enhanced relaxation and relief from stress, it won't directly induce drowsiness. However, as the oil builds its way into your cat's system, you may notice Kitty maintaining a more regular sleep cycle which can be alarming if they've always been overly active. 2. What is the best CBD oil for cats? Premium CBD oil for cats is made from industrial hemp plants grown free of pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants. The oil should also be extracted with CO2 or other safe methods to ensure purity. Lastly, ensure the product contains no essential oils, as these common wellness ingredients harm a cat's health. 3. Is CBD for cats safe? Hemp CBD oil for cats is considered a safe product when used in moderation. Consult with your veterinarian before beginning a course of CBD oil, and always use pet-grade products designed specifically for cats. This will help ensure safety and maximize the health benefits of hemp CBD oil. Only the Best CBD Oil for Cats Will Do Your cat deserves the best, and that includes CBD oil. With so many products on the market, finding the best CBD oil for cats can be a challenge, but when equipped with the knowledge and recommendations from our experts and cat CBD aficionados, you can be sure to make the right decision for your feline friend's health and wellness.
