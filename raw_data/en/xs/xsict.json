It has been known that human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the primary causative agent of cervical cancers [ [2](#B2)]. Recently, to control the outburst of HPV related cervical cancers, two types of vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) have been licensed for use in young boys and girls [ [3](#B3), [4](#B4)]. These preventive vaccines are based on the induction of neutralizing antibodies against major protein such as L1 of HPV and the vaccine shows significant safety profile and clinical efficacy against HPV genotypes contained within the vaccine formulation [ [3](#B3)- [5](#B5)]. However, HPV are highly diverse with respect to their DNA sequences of L1 [ [6](#B6)] and no protection has been anticipated against the strains not included in the vaccine formulation. Moreover, these vaccines are too expensive for widespread use in the developing world, where cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death in women [ [1](#B1), [4](#B4)]. [3](#B3)]. E6 and E7 are HPV proteins that are expressed during early phases of viral infections. These proteins have been found to be expressed stably in HPV related carcinomas and also are essential for the induction of cell transformations [ [7](#B7)]. Thus, it is believed that targeting these proteins on cell surface can modulate the course of infection and development of transformed cancer cells. Several approaches have been tried to induce E6/E7 specific immune responses [ [8](#B8)]. Peptide based vaccines have been found to be safe, stable and easy to produce. Moreover, administered E6/E7 peptides have been found to induce antigen-specific T cells in animal subjects [ [8](#B8)- [11](#B11)]. However, the poor immunogenicity of peptide-based vaccines has limited the widespread development of E6/E7 peptides as vaccine candidates. [12](#B12)- [15](#B15)]. Taking these observations into consideration, in this study, we demonstrate that intranasal co-administration of E6/E7 peptides with FlaB potently induced strong antigen-specific immune responses in vaccinated animals. Furthermore we show that co-administration of FlaB and E6/E7 peptides induced protective antitumor activity in mouse challenge model. Materials and Methods Peptides [16](#B16)] were synthesized by the AnyGen company (Gwangju, Korea) with the purity of >97%. Purification of a recombinant flagellin, V. vulnificus FlaB, and evaluation of its TLR5 stimulatory activity Cell line [17](#B17)]. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) and [8](#B8), [12](#B12)] under anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection of 100 \u00b5L of PBS containing 2 mg of ketamine and 0.2 mg of xylazine) at an interval of 5 days. Five days after the final immunization, spleen and cervical lymph nodes were collected from five mice per group to assess CTL responses and interferon- (IFN-) production. Five immunized mice per group were subcutaneously challenged with 5\u00d7105 TC-1 cells each in 200 \u00b5L PBS injected into the right mid-flank. Tumor growth and mouse survival were monitored every 3 days. The tumor volume was calculated as follows: tumor volume (mm3) = (L\u00d7H\u00d7W)/2, where L is the length, W is the width, and H is the height of the tumor in millimeters [ [18](#B18)]. CTL assay [7](#B7), [19](#B19)]. Briefly, to obtain the effector cells, splenocytes from vaccinated animals were stimulated in vitro with 1 \u00b5g/mL each of E6/E7 peptides and 25 IU/mL of interleukin-2 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 5 days. TC-1 cells were treated with 1 \u00b5g/mL cisplatin for 24 hours and then used as the target cells. The CTL assay was performed with effector (E) and target (T) cells mixed at various E:T cell ratios (25:1, 50:1, and 100:1). After 5 hour incubation at 37, 50 \u00b5L cell supernatant was collected to using CytoTox96 to the manufacturer's instructions USA). Measurement of IFN- production by ELISPOT assay [20](#B20)]. After the incubation days at 37 in 5% CO2, antigen-specific IFN--producing cells were quantified using an ELISPOT kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The spots represent individual IFN--producing cells as spot-forming cells (SFCs) on the membrane. The SFCs were measured using a CTL-Immunospot Analyzer and analyzed with the ImmunoSpot Professional Software version 5.0 (Cellular Technology, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The responses were considered positive above 50 SFC/well and when at least double the numbers of SFCs were obtained in comparison to cells cultured in the culture medium alone. A non-specific negative peptide was included as an additional control [ [8](#B8)]. Statistical analysis Results FlaB potentiated antigen-specific CTL responses [7](#B7), of FlaB on TC-1 cell-specific CTL responses in vitro. As can be seen [Fig. 1](#F1), the lytic activity of E6/E7 peptide-specific CTLs against TC-1 tumor cells in P+F group was significantly higher than the peptide only group (P). This result indicated that FlaB significantly the ( [Fig. 2B](#F2)) of P+F was significantly higher than peptides only (P) group (p=0.006 and p=0.027, respectively). These results are consistent with the CTL activity result described above. FlaB potentiated protective antitumor activity in a TC-1 cell challenge model [Fig. 3A](#F3), three weeks after the challenge the tumor volume was increased to 1,048\u00b1191 mm3 in PBS (control) group. The tumor volume in the FlaB only (F) group (786\u00b1143 mm3) and the peptide only (P) group (913\u00b1146 mm3) was comparable to that in PBS group (p>0.05). However, the co-administration group (P+F) showed significantly reduced tumor sizes (172\u00b1112 mm3) compared to the P group. In some animals in P+F group, tumor development was not observed at all. [Fig. 3B](#F3)). Interestingly, P group enhanced the survival of mice till 48 days after which a sudden fall in the survival rate was observed. These results indicate that FlaB potentiates E6/E7-mediated protective antitumor activity and serves as a potent adjuvant to the peptides even through the mucosal vaccination. These challenge study results correlated closely with the CTL activity and IFN- production. Discussion [1](#B1), [2](#B2)]. An ideal preventive cervical cancer vaccine should be able to prevent infection and at least eliminate symptoms of preexisting infections, if not totally eradicate the related disease. Moreover, it should be safe and cheap enough for the widespread use amongst masses. E6/E7 peptide-based anticancer vaccines have been proposed and tested by many groups. Some of the advantages of these vaccines include safety and the ease of production and stability [ [8](#B8)- [11](#B11)]. However, the E6/E7 peptides themselves are not often antigenic enough to induce an effective antitumor immune response. Adjuvant must be administered simultaneously [ [8](#B8), [9](#B9), [11](#B11)]. [12](#B12)- [14](#B14)] and via TLR5 [ [21](#B21), [22](#B22)]. In previous studies, we have found that FlaB could efficaciously potentiate protective immunity when administered intranasally as a mixture with either tetanus toxoid, influenza antigens (trivalent influenza vaccine) or fused with PspA [ [12](#B12)- [14](#B14)]. So, we hypothesized that intranasal co-administration of E6/E7 peptides as a mixture with FlaB should be more effective in stimulating the protective immunity compared with E6/E7 peptides alone. To test our hypothesis, we intranasally co-administered HPV-16 E6 and E7 peptides along flagellin of V. vulnificus origin [ [12](#B12)]. The results clearly showed that the mice that received E6/E7 peptide along with FlaB manifested a strong antigen-specific CTL activity and the levels of antigen-specific-IFN- producing cells in spleen and cLN were significantly higher as compared to the group that received peptide only as antigen. These results led us to check if animals immunized with the FlaB-adjuvanted peptide vaccine could withstand the challenge with tumor cells. For this we immunized the animals with various peptide preparations (for details see methods section) and challenged with TC-1 cells as reported earlier [ [8](#B8), [23](#B23)]. We found that P+F immunized animals had 80% protection from tumor while animals in other groups died over the duration of the study. These results went well in parallel with protective CTL and IFN- production. Even though, the protection rate in peptide only group also remained marginally significant till 48 day, protection efficacy in P group was drastically decreased in long term observation. These results suggest that flagellin helps not only the antigen-specific CTL responses but also the maintenance of a significantly sustainable cellular immune responses. [24](#B24)- [27](#B27)]. According to the studies, those researchers demonstrated that flagellin itself has significant antitumor activity [ [24](#B24)- [26](#B26)]. In the present study, we found that FlaB alone does not induce antitumor activity in TC-1 cell implantation model. These results are in contradiction to previously published reports where direct activation of TLR5 on tumor cells has been demonstrated to mediate flagellin specific anti-tumor effects [ [26](#B26)]. It is likely that TLR5 expression pattern on the tumor cells might have led to different outcomes obtained in our study and the previous studies (data not shown) [ [26](#B26)]. Nonetheless, these results converge at one point that FlaB has strong immunomodulatory effects and that flagellin could be used as an adjuvant to increase the efficacy of concomitantly administered weak antigens in a preventive cancer vaccine model.
