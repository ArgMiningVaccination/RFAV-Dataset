Their properties are highly beneficial and can be introduced via massage when blended with a carrier oil which is a very nourishing Ayurvedic practice. Often specific Ayurvedic oils - for example, those that are Pitta reducing - and herbs are used. Bringing balance through colour With colour aromatherapy, essential oil blends can be chosen according to their unique colour vibration. Each dosha is comprised of different elements eg Pitta dosha is 90% fire, so more cooling colours as with lavender and chamomile would be beneficial. Essential oils may help muscular tension, headaches, insomnia and other many stress-related conditions. Massage & Essential Oils The term \"aromatherapy\" usually refers to an holistic treatment which includes massage to introduce essential oils. into the tissues. This helps to rebalance the nervous system and induce a sense of well-being to mind, body and emotions. N.B. JANICE IS NOT CURRENTLY OFFERING MASSAGE but highly recommends one of the therapists at White Willow. Please contact White Willow Natural Therapies in Eastbourne to make an appointment with one of our massage therapists. https://www.whitewillowtherapies.co.uk/therapists/hayley-hitch Essential Oils Essential oils are the \"essence\" of the flower, herb, resin or fruit and can have an instant effect upon our mood when inhaled. The molecules of an essential oil travel via the nose to the olfactory bulb and limbic system of the brain. The limbic system is involved with our sense of smell, memory, appetite and behaviour. Therefore essential oils can have quite profound effects on the body, mind and emotions as the limbic system is directly related to those areas of the brain controlling stress levels, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and hormonal balance. The Inner State of The Body The skin reflects the inner state of the body and is affected by diet, exercise, sleep, stress, medication, emotions and health in general. All essential oils are antiseptic and help to protect the skin from bacteria and pollution. They are readily absorbed and have cell-regenerating properties, encouraging healthy and youthful skin. They have proven effects of uplifting, calming and balancing the mind and emotions. Each essential oil has specific effects depending upon its natural chemical components. The vast range of essential oils are naturally made up of an array of vibrant colours. Colour and aroma are both forms of energetic healing and clearly indicate their properties. When knowledge of their properties is combined with awareness of colour, an even more accurate and effective blend is created. Bergamot (Citrus bergamia) uplifts the spirits due to its linalol (alcohol) content, acting as a tonic through its high percentage of limonene. It is useful during convalescence due to its restorative effects upon the nervous system. It can help with mood swings, especially when linked to the menstrual cycle or menopause as well as anxiety and depression. Bergamot has a green vibration connecting it to the heart chakra and is often used for grief and bereavement. Rose (Rosa centifolia) is high in the alcohols geraniol and nerol and like bergamot, geranium and jasmine it reduces stress by strengthening the parasympathetic nervous system. It increases vitality and promotes a sense of well-being. The deep pink vibration of rose opens the heart to feel compassion and is often used as an anti-depressant and to enhance femininity for infertility. Mandarin (Citrus reticulata) is high in refreshing esters and the monoterpene limonene. It is very beneficial in the treatment of insomnia, nervous tension and stress due to its calming and soothing effect. Mandarin has an orange/blue vibration and has a releasing affect on areas that feel stuck, being useful for the digestive and lymphatic systems. Bio Energetic Synchronisation Technique (B.E.S.T.) Bio Energetic Synchronisation Technique can help you to become free from the subconscious emotional memory overload (SEMO) that keeps you stuck in the past, often affecting the body's ability to fully heal and preventing you from living your most fulfilling life. B.E.S.T. is a very gentle, non-forceful treatment that is used by many Doctors of Chiropractic and therapists all over the world. Its background and principles are sound. It was developed by Dr. M.T. Morter Jnr. who received a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' for his service to humanity. Dru Ayurveda Create the life you love through making simple but effective lifestyle changes.
