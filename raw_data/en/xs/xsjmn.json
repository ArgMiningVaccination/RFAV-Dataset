Our integrative approach to veterinary treatment incorporates both traditional Chinese and western medicines. We treat companion animals, as well as exotics and farm animals. Click on the \"i\" in the image to the right to watch a video about acupuncture. Services - Acupuncture - Acupuncture is a form of medicine using small sterilized needles inserted in specific points to treat many disorders. Each point has a specific action to help the body heal itself. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves, increase blood flow, relieve muscle spasm, and release endorphins. The use of acupuncture in animals has been widely studied and proven to help all systems of the body. Because the needles are so small, patients rarely feel them and have even fallen asleep during treatment. - Rehabilitation - Our rehabilitation service has state-of-the-art equipment to treat a variety of orthopedic and neurologic conditions. Our treatments include aquatic therapy (underwater treadmill), electric stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound, and exercises. An exercises program using some or all of these modalities will be tailored to your pet and their condition. Your pet will also be prescribed at-home exercises to maximize their recovery. - Herbal Therapy - Food Therapy - Tui-na (Chinese acupressure and massage) [Hyberbaric Oxygen Therapy](/vetmed/veterinary_hospital/hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy.php) - Shockwave - Pulse Electronic Magnetic Field therapy (PEMF) - Therapeutic Laser What to Expect - You do not need a referral, but please call your veterinarian to send over any previous records and radiographs they have for your pet. - A questionnaire will be emailed to you prior to the first appointment. Please fill that out and bring it with you. If you do not have access to print it out, please arrive early for your appointment time to fill it out. We will not be able to begin assessment without it. - Because we are a teaching hospital, you will be greeted by a student who will get a thorough history of your pet. The student will then have you return to the waiting room while your pet is taken into the hospital and evaluated by our veterinary team. Please do not leave during this assessment unless prior arrangements have been made. We will not be able to proceed with any treatment without your consent. - Once the assessment is complete, our veterinarian and student will return to talk with you about their findings and recommendations. This may include acupuncture, rehabilitation, herbal supplements, and other therapies. - We would love to treat your pet at the first visit. Please make sure you indicate that you are interested in pursuing Integrative Medicine treatment when you make your initial appointment. This will indicate to our receptionists to schedule the allotted time needed for treatment. - Once the assessment has been completed, we will make recommendations on frequency of visits. Usually, we see patients once or twice a week. - The first visit may take up to two hours for the exam and consultation. Treatment will take an additional 45 minutes - 2 hours, depending on what treatments are performed. Our veterinarian and student will discuss the time involved when they go over the treatment options with you.
