VWG focused on: - Considering approaches to generate and evaluate safety and efficacy data for vaccine candidates - Creating a collaborative framework to share insights into natural immunity and vaccine candidate-induced immune response - Identifying regulatory pathways for vaccine authorization, approval, and access during a public health emergency - Harmonizing efficacy trials to enable analysis of correlates of protection across vaccines Featured Publications May 11, 2020 [](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc5312) A strategic approach to COVID-19 vaccine R&DScience September 4, 2020 [](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2020076) Accelerating Development of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines \u2014 The Role for Controlled Human Infection ModelsNew England Journal of Medicine Donate Donate to the FNIH today to support medical research that saves lives Partner With Us Work with the FNIH to accelerate medical breakthroughs for patients "}
