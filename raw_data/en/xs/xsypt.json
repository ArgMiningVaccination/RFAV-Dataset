The groups in this theme focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms which regulate development, maintenance, repair and regeneration of tissues. We use a variety of experimental models, including mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, pathogens. Studies on individual cells/organisms are complemented by population studies in an effort to understand the evolutionary drivers of gene selection. Strong links with groups in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Engineering support the development of novel, interdisciplinary approaches that take advantage of cutting-edge technological advances to address challenging biological questions.
