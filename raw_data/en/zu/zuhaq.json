Upon approval by the Board, the recommendations of this Department shall be sent to the Administrator, or his designated representative, for approva l or disapproval. (6) Where alternative compliance schedule provisions are contained elsewhere in the air pollution control regulations, those provisions shall supersede the requirements in this section. (L) Emergency Provisions (1) An \"emergency\" mea ns any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, in which a situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology -based emission limitation under the permit due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintena nce, careless or improper operation, or operator error. (2) An emergency may be documented through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs and other relevant evidence that verify: (a) An emergency occurred and the owner or operator can identif y the cause(s) of the emergency; (b) The permitted source was, at the time the emergency occurred, being properly operated; (c) During the period of the emergency, the owner or operator took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that e xceeded the emission standards or other requirements in the permit; and (d) The owner or operator gave a verbal notification of the emergency to the Department within twenty -four (24) hours of the time when emission limitations were exceeded, followed by a written report within thirty (30) days.

(4) A newly constructed or modified source issued a federally enforceable final construction permit will not require an additional public comment period and/or hearing to obtain an operating permit, unless the source proposes a change in the or iginal construction and/or operational plan, prior to commencing construction, which the Department determines would require an additional public comment period and/or hearing. (5) Any proposed new or modified stationary source required to undergo a publ ic comment period shall not commence any construction until all public participation procedures of this section are completed, and the source has received an effective construction permit from the Department. 37 | Regulation 61 -62.1 (6) Maintenance activities, repairs, and repl acements which the Department determines to be routine for that source category shall not, by themselves, be required to undergo the public participation procedures of Section II(N). (O) Inspection and Entry Upon presentation of credentials and other do cuments as may be required by law, the owner or operator shall allow the Department or an authorized representative to perform the following: (1) Enter the facility where emissions -related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the co nditions of the permit; (2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit; (3) Inspect any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under this permit; and (4) As authorized by the Clean Air Act and/or the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, sample or monitor, at reasonable times, substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring com pliance with the permit or applicable requirements. SECTION III - EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND EMISSIONS STATEMENTS (A) General (1) An emissions inventory is a study or compilation of pollutant emissions. The purposes of emissions inventories are to locate air pollution sources, to define the type and size of sources, to define the type and amount of emissions from each source, to determine pollutant frequency and duration, to determine the relative contributions to air pollution from classes of sources and of individual sources, to provide a basis for air permit fees, and to determine the adequacy of regulations and standards. The requirements of this section notwithstanding, an emissions inventory may be required from any source at any time. (2) An emissi ons statement is a less detailed statement which focuses on emissions estimates for pollutants associated with a nonattainment designation. (B) Emissions Inventory Reporting Requirements (1) Beginning with the effective date of this regulation, sources must submit an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year by March 31 at a frequency as outlined below: (a) Type A Sources are Title V Sources with annual emissions greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for Type A Source s in Table 1 below. Type A Sources must submit an emissions inventory every year. Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 2500 Potential 38 | Regulation 61 -62.1 Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 VOC 250 Potential NO X 2500 Potential CO 2500 Potential Pb 0.502 Actual PM 10 250 Potential PM 2.5 250 Potential NH 3 250 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, inclu ding air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in th e source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year. 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach tak en for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. (b) All other Title V Sources with annual emissions less than the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 above must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. (c) Nonattainment area (NAA) Sources are sources located in a NAA with annual emissions during any year of the three (3) year cycle greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for NAA Sources in Table 2 b elow. These sources that are not also Type A Sources must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three -year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 100 Potential VOC 100 (moderate O 3 NAA ) Potential 50 (serious O 3 NAA) 25 (severe O 3 NAA) 10 (extreme O 3 NAA) NO X 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential CO 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential 100 (all CO NAA) Pb 0.50 Actual PM 10 100 (moderate PM 10 NAA) Potential 39 | Regulation 61 -62.1 Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three -year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 70 (serious PM 10 NAA) PM 2.5 100 Potential NH 3 100 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, inclu ding air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in th e source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year. 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach tak en for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. 3 Special point source reporting thresholds apply for certain pollutants by type of NAA. The pollutants by nonattainment area are: Ozone: VOC, NO X, and CO; Carbon Monoxide: CO; and Particulate mat ter less than 10 microns: PM 10. (2) Other Requirements (a) Unless otherwise indicated, all emissions inventories must be submitted to the Department by March 31 following the year of inventory. All applicable information must be recorded in the curren t format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. (b) All newly permitted and constructed Title V Sources which have obtained or are in the process of obtaining a Title V permit and all newly permitted and constructed NAA Sources must co mplete and submit to the Department an initial emissions inventory for the source's first partial calendar year of operation and an emissions inventory for the source's first full calendar year of operation. (i) The partial year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department no later than March 31 of the year following the source's partial year of operation and must include an emissions inventory from the source's operation start date through December 31 of the same year. (ii) The first full calendar year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department by March 31 of the year following the source's first calendar year of operation. (iii) Sources must submit future emissions inventories on the schedule as described in paragraph (B)(1)(a), paragraph (B)(1)(b), and paragraph (B)(1)(c) of this section. (c) Any existing sources that are determined by the Department to be subject to Regulation 61 -62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, and/or NAA Sources must complete a nd submit to the Department an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year within ninety (90) days. These sources must then submit 40 | Regulation 61 -62.1 future emissions inventories on the schedule as described in paragraph (B)(1)(a), paragraph (B)(1)(b), and paragraph ( B)(1)(c) of this section. (d) Submittal of emissions inventories outside of the schedules in this section will be accepted and reviewed only if a modification has occurred that required issuance of an air quality permit since the last emissions inventor y submittal by the source. This modification must alter the quantity or character of the source's emissions. These sources may submit a new emissions inventory following the first full calendar year of operation after the modification. These sources must t hen submit future emissions inventories on the schedule described in paragraph (B)(1)(a), paragraph (B)(1)(b), and paragraph (B)(1)(c) of this section. (e) Information required in an emissions inventory submittal to the Department must include the follo wing: (i) Information on fuel burning equipment; (ii) Types and quantities of fuel used; (iii) Fuel analysis; (iv) Exhaust parameters; (v) Control equipment information; (vi) Raw process materials and quantities used; (vii) Design, no rmal, and actual process rates; (viii) Hours of operation; (ix) Significant emission generating points or processes as discussed in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department; (x) Any desired information listed in 4 0 CFR Part 51 Subpart A (December 17, 2008) that is requested by the Department; (xi) Emissions data from all regulated pollutants; and (xii) Any additional information reasonably related to determining if emissions from an air source are causing standards of air quality to be exceeded. (f) A source may submit a written request to the Department for approval of an alternate method for estimating emissions outside of those methods prescribed by the Department. Such requests will be review ed by the Department's emissions inventory staff on a case -by-case basis to determine if the alternate method better characterizes actual emissions for the reporting period than the Department's prescribed methods. (g) Emission estimates from insignific ant activities listed on a source's permit are required only in the initial emissions inventory submitted by the source. If emissions from these insignificant activities have not been included in a past emissions inventory submitted to the Department, the source must include these emissions in their next required emissions inventory submittal. (h) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions inventories as required in this section must be retained by the owner/operator at the source for a mini mum of five (5) years. (C) Emissions Statement Requirements (1) Sources in areas designated nonattainment for an ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) must submit to the Department by March 31 for the previous calendar year an emissions statement which includes emissions estimates for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO X) beginning with the effective date of this regulation. 41 | Regulation 61 -62.1 (2) The statement must contain a certification that the information contained in the statement is accurate to the bes t knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. (3) All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. (4) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions statement s as required in this section must be retained by the owner or operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. SECTION IV - SOURCE TESTS (A) Applicability (1) This section shall apply to the owner, operator, or representative of any source whic h conducts: (a) A source test required under an applicable standard or permit condition; or pursuant to a judicial or administrative order, consent agreement, or any other such binding requirement entered into after the effective date of this standard; or (b) Any o ther source test from which data will be submitted to the Department for any purpose including but not limited to: determination of applicability of regulatory requirements, development of emission factors, establishment of parameters for compliance assura nce monitoring, continuous emission monitor performance specification testing, and Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). (2) The Department may, on a case -by-case basis, exempt from the requirements of this section source tests which are performed for de velopment of emission factors or for determination of applicability of regulations. (B) Submission and Approval of a Site -Specific Test Plan (1) Prior to conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that: (a) A written site -specific test plan, including all of the information required in Section IV(C) below, has been developed and submitted to the Department. If the Department has previously approved a site-specific test plan, the owner, operato r, or representative may submit a letter which references the approved plan and which includes a thorough description of amendments to the plan; and (b) Written Department approval of the site -specific test plan or amended test plan, methods, and proced ures has been received. (2) All test methods included in the site -specific test plan must be either EPA Reference Methods described in 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M; or 40 CFR Part A; CFR Part 61, B; or 40 CFR Part 63, Appendix A . If an applicable air regulation or permit provides for a choice of test methods, the selected method must be approved by the Department. If an applicable air regulation or permit does not specify use of an EPA standard reference method, the alternative t est method to be used must be approved by the Department. (3)(a) The owner, operator, or representative of a source proposing to use alternative source test methods shall ensure that the alternative source test method is either validated according to EPA Reference Method 42 | Regulation 61 -62.1 301 (40 CFR Part 63, Appendix A, December 29, 1992) and any subsequent amendments or editions, or approved by the Department. (b) The owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that requests for approval of alternative source test methods are submitted to the Department along with the site -specific test plan, and that the submission contains all of the information required by Section IV(C) below. (4) The Department shall determine whether any source test method proposed in the si te-specific test plan is appropriate for use.

Sources conducting tests for substances listed in Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 8, shall submit site -specific test plans or a letter which amends a previously approved test plan at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed test date. (b) If the only amendments to a previously approved test plan are to facility information included in Section IV(C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) below, the requirement in Section IV(B)(5)(a) above will not apply. The owner, operator, or representative however, shall submit the amendments at least two (2) weeks prior to the proposed test date. (6) Within thirty (30) days of site -specific test plan receipt, the Department will notify the owner, operator, or repres entative of site -specific test plan approval or denial or will request additional information. (7) The owner, operator, or representative shall submit any additional information requested by the Department necessary to facilitate the review of the site -specific test plan. (8) Approval of a site -specific test plan for which an owner, operator, or representative fails to submit any additional requested information will be denied. (9) Neither the submission of a site -specific test plan, nor the Departmen t's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Department's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall relieve an owner, operator, or representative of legal responsibility to comply with any applicable provisions of this section or with any other applicable federal, state, or local requirement or prevent the Department from enforcing this section.

Submission of a site-specific test plan or amendments to a previously approved test plan does not consti tute notification. Requirements for a complete notification include the following: (a) Facility name, permit number, mailing address, physical address, and contact name and phone number; (b) Source(s) being tested, source identification number(s), a nd pollutant(s) being tested; (c) Proposed test date and start time for each source being tested; and (d) Approved test plan being used to conduct the test identified by Department approval date. (2) In the event the owner, operator, or representat ive is unable to conduct the source test on the date specified in the notification, the owner, operator, or representative shall notify the Department as soon as practical by telephone and follow up in writing within thirty (30) days. Telephone notificatio n shall include a description of the circumstance(s) causing the cancellation of the test, and a projected retest date. The written follow -up report shall include a description of the condition(s) which prevented the source test from being conducted, and w hen applicable, what corrective action was performed, or what equipment repairs were required. (3) Rescheduling of canceled source tests must meet the two -week notice requirement. However, shorter notification periods may be allowed subject to Department approval. (4) All tests shall be conducted by or under the direction of a person qualified by training and/or experience in the field of air pollution testing or, where required by federal regulation, meeting the minimum competency requirement s for air emissions testing as specified in ASTM D7036 -04, Standard Practice for Competence of Air Emission Testing Bodies. 46 | Regulation 61 -62.1 (5) Unless approved otherwise by the Department, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that source tests are conduct ed while the source is operating at the maximum expected production rate or other production rate or operating parameter which would result in the highest emissions for the pollutants being tested or as otherwise specified in a relevant federal or state re quirement. Examples of the operating parameters that may affect emission rates are: type and composition of raw materials and fuels, isolation of control equipment modules, product types and dimensions, thermal oxidizer combustion temperature, atypical con trol equipment settings, etc. Some sources may have to spike fuels or raw materials to avoid being permitted at a more restrictive feed or process rate. Any source test performed at a production rate less than the rated capacity may result in permit limits on emission rates, including limits on production if necessary. (6) When conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative of a source shall provide the following: (a) Department access to the facility to observ e source tests; (b) Sampling ports adequate for test methods; (c) Safe sampling site(s); (d) Safe access to sampling site(s); (e) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and (f) Equipment and supplies necessary for safe testing of a so urce. (E) Source Test Method Performance Audit Program (1) The Department may request that samples collected during any source tests be split with the Department for analysis by an independent or Department laboratory. Any request for split samples will be made in advance of the source test. (2) Performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test if a PA sample is commercially available. (a) PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider (AASP) and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. (b) An \"accredited audit sample provider (AASP)\" is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body. (3) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each tes t method used for regulatory compliance purposes. (a) No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of Appendix A-2 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A -4 of 40 CFR Part 60; Method 18 of Appendix A -6 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A -7 of 40 CFR Part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 63. 47 | Regulation 61 -62.1 (b) If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. (c) Upon request, the Department may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if the Department determines that an audit sample is not necessary. A waiver of the performance audit requirements to conduct a PA for a particular source does not constitute a waiver of performance audit requirements for future source tests. (d) \"Commercially available\" means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for pu rchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is an AASP that can supply an audit sample for that method. (e) If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. (f) When ordering an audit sample, the source, operator, or representative shall give the AASP an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitt ed by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the Department. (g) The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample alo ng with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the Department and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the Department first and then report to the AASP. (h) If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the Department is present at the testing site. The source owner, operator, or representative may request in the test protocol a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the Department must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. (i) The final test report shall document any attempt to obtain an audit sample and, if an audit sample was ordered and utilized, the pass /fail results as applicable.

SECTION V - CREDIBLE EVIDENCE (A) The Department promulgated Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and developed the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan to provide enforceable emission limitations; to establish an adequate enforcement program; to require owners or operators of stationary sources to monitor emissions, submit periodic reports of such emissions, and ma intain records as specified by various regulations and permits; and to evaluate reports and records for consistency with the applicable emission limitation or standard on a continuing basis over time. The monitoring data collected and records of operations would serve as the basis for a source to certify compliance, and could be used by the Department as direct evidence of an enforceable violation of the underlying emission limitation or standard. (B) The purpose of this section is: (1) To clarify the st atutory authority of Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , whereby non -reference test data and various kinds of information already available and utilized for other purpos es may be used to demonstrate compliance or noncompliance with emission standards; 50 | Regulation 61 -62.1 (2) To eliminate any potential ambiguity regarding language that has been interpreted to provide for exclusive reliance on reference test methods as the means of certifyin g compliance with various emission limits; and (3) To curtail language that limits the types of testing or monitoring data that may be used for determining compliance and for establishing violations. (C) The following are applicable in the determination of noncompliance by the Department or for compliance certification by the owners or operators of stationary sources: (1) Enforcement - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann . Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in the plan; and (2) Compliance Certifications - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , the owner or operator may use any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed for the purpose of submitting compliance cert ifications. 51 | Regulation 61 -62.2 April 22, 1983 296 7 4 May 24, 1985 457 9 5 June 25, 2004 2872 28 6 February 24, 2012 (Errata) 2872 36 2 September 28, 2012 (Errata) 2872 36 9 December 27, 2013 4387 37 12 61-62.2 Prohibition of Open Burning 52 | Regulation 61 -62.2 OPEN BURNING IS PROHIBITED EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW: SECTION I - Exceptions A.

The a ppropriate episode stage will be declared on a regional basis, as dictated by air quality monitoring. Adverse air quality need not be regionwide to trigger control actions; the appropriate episode stage will be declared for an entire Air Quality Control Re gion when any monitoring site within the region records ambient air quality in excess of that designated in the criteria. In making this determination, the Commissioner will be guided by the criteria listed below: 1. FORECAST - This level will normally b e activated when an Air Stagnation Advisory (ASA) is issued for any part of South Carolina by the Columbia Forecast Office of the National Weather Service. If continuous air monitoring equipment indicates an upward trend in pollutant concentrations, the Commissioner may request that the National Weather Service issue an ASA, even though meteorological factors do not appear critical. In the absence of an ASA, the Commissioner may, at his discretion, declare this level when it is in the best interest of publi c health and welfare. 2. WATCH - This level will be activated when continuous air quality monitoring indicates that one of the following pollutant concentrations has been reached: PM 10 - 350 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), twenty -four (24) -hour av erage; SO 2 - 400 \u00b5g/m3 (0.15 parts per million (ppm)), twenty -four (24) -hour average; or O3 \u00b5g/m3 (0.2 ppm), one (1) -hour average; and meteorological conditions are such that the pollutant concentrations can be expected to remain at the above levels for twelve (12) hours or more, or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to recur within the next twenty -four (24) hours unless control actions are taken. 3. ALERT - This level indicates that air quality is continuing to deteriorate and that additional control actions are necessary. An alert will be declared when monitoring indicates that one of the following pollutant concentrations has been reached: PM 10 - 420 \u00b5g/m3, twenty -four (24) -hour average; SO 2 twenty (24) -hour average; or \u00b5g/m3 (0.4 ppm), one (1) -hour average; and meteorological conditions are such that pollutant concentrations can be expected to r emain at the above levels for twelve (12) h ours or more, or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to recur within the next twenty -four (24) hours unless control actions are taken. 4. EMERGENCY - The primary objective of this plan is to prevent this level from ever being reac hed; however, should this level be reached the most stringent control actions are necessary. An emergency will be declared when monitoring indicates that one of the following pollutant concentrations has been reached: PM 10 - 500 \u00b5g/m3, twenty -four (24) -hour average; 56 | Regulation 61 -62.3 SO 2 - 1600 \u00b5g/m3 (0.6 ppm), twenty -four (24) -hour average; or \u00b5g/m3 (0.5 ppm), one (1) -hour average; and meteorological conditions are such that this condition can be expected to continue for twelve (12) hours or more, or increase, or in the case of ozone, the situation is likely to recur within the next twenty - four (24) hours unless control actions are taken. 5. TERMINATION - Once declared, any level reached by application of these criteria will remain in effec t until the criteria for that level are no longer met. At such time, the next lower level will be assumed. SECTION II. - EMISSION REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS Operators of plants emitting one -hundred (100) tons per year or more of a single pollutant, and loc ated in a nonattainment county or a county with a nonattainment area, are required to submit written plans for meeting the required reductions of pollutants for which the county is in nonattainment. These plans must identify the air pollutant source, the a pproximate amount of reduction of pollutants and a brief description of the manner in which the reduction will be achieved during each level. Sources of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide have been subject to this requirement since 1972 and sources of volatile organic compounds since July 1, 1980.

DEFINITIONS The following words and phrases when used in this regulation shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them: 1. Hazardous Cond itions (or hazardous levels) - Conditions created by the release or discharge into the ambient air of one (1) or more air contaminants which because of the characteristics and/or quantity of material involved may pose an imminent threat to the health of an yone who might come in contact with the material through this release as well as involving substantial risk of injury, to include injury to property or plant and animal life. This includes the indirect threat to human life and property by the creation of t raffic hazards. 2. Traffic Hazards - Impairment of visibility whenever the concentration of dust, fumes, condensed vapor, or any other substance is such that the horizontal visibility at or near ground level is reduced to 2400 feet or less. B. GENERAL The owner or operator of any source, in addition to complying with all applicable regulations and standards, shall take all steps necessary to protect human health and welfare and otherwise minimize the effects of unintended, short -term or other releases of air contaminants and other substances which produce unintended hazardous conditions. C. TRAFFIC HAZARDS The emission of smoke, dust, fumes, condensed vapor, or any other substance which creates a traffic hazard on public roads by impairment of visib ility, or intensifies an existing condition to the extent that a traffic hazard is created is prohibited. D. EMERGENCY ACTIONS In the event that releases of dust, fumes, smoke, gases, mists, vapors, or other substances occur in such quantity as to creat e imminently hazardous levels, the owner or operator of the source shall take all necessary emergency acts to cause the release to cease, to notify nearby residents and occupants, to assist in evacuation if deemed necessary, to notify the Department immedi ately, and to take such other action as responsible officials deem advisable. E. CLEANUP If releases to the atmosphere of air contaminants result from spillage and cause such concentrations as to produce an imminently hazardous level, clean up activitie s shall begin as soon as possible and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. F. NOTIFICATION The affected public, the Department, the South Carolina Disaster Preparedness Agency, and all law enforcement officials having jurisdiction shall be notified promptly by the owner or operator of the source in the event of releases of material which may cause imminently hazardous levels. If traffic hazards are created, notification shall be made to appropriate state or local agencies of the po ssible existence of such a condition and of the corresponding need for posting of appropriate signs, warning devices, or flagmen. 63 | Regulation 61 -62.4 When the concentrations of materials are reduced sufficiently as to no longer present an imminent hazard, public announcement will be made, and normal operations may resume. 64 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 1 February 25, 1983 - 7 2 May 24, 1985 457 9 5 April 22, 1988 970 12 4 February 24, 1989 868 13 2 June 26, 1998 2244 22 6 October 26, 2001 2648 25 10 May 27, 2011 4130 35 5 May 25, 2012 (Errata) 4130 36 5 September 28, 2012 (Errata) 4130 36 9 June 27, 2014 4388 38 6 June 26, 2015 4481 39 6 September 23, 2016 4650 40 9 61-62.5 Standard No. 1 Emissions from Fuel Burning Operations 65 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 1 SECTION I - VISIBLE EMISSIONS A.

Appendix A Toxic Equivalency Dioxins/Furans Residence Time Calculation Guidance The review of all incinerators shall include verification of the residence time stated on the application. This guidance shall be followed to assure that these calculations are handled i n a uniform manner. STEP 1. Estimate the total heat input to the system: Total system heat input (Btu/hr) = [Maximum waste firing rate (lbs/hr) x Maximum heating value (Btu/lb)] + Average primary burner heat input + Average secondary burner input. NOTE: Use the average burner inputs required after the onset of waste burning. Use a waste heating value of 8,500 Btu/lb. STEP 2. Estimate the system heat loss (prior to heat recovery): 129 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 3.1 System heat loss = Shell loss + Sensible heat in ash + Sensible heat in unburned carbon + Latent heat. The heat loss may be assumed to be 20 percent of total heat input. STEP 3. Calculate the net heat available (Q) to raise the temperature of the products of combustion: Q (Btu/hr) = (Total system heat in put) - (System heat loss). STEP 4. Calculate the weight of product of combustion (M): M = Q/ {Cp x (To - Ti)} Cp = Average specific heat (Btu/lb degrees F), assume a value of 0.28. To = Exit temperature (degrees F), use the design temperature of 2000 degrees F as To. Ti = Ambient air temperature (degrees F), assume the ambient temperature to be 70 degrees F. STEP 5. Calculate the volume of product of combustion (F): F (scfs) = M d x 60 x 60 d (lb/ft3) = Density of exhaust gases at 70 degrees F, use a value of 0.075. Fl (acfs) = F x (To + 460) 530 Fl design temperature = F x 2460 530 scfs = standard cubic feet per second acfs = actual cubic feet per second STEP 6. Calculate the volume of secondary chamber. STEP 7. Residence time = chamber volume Fl For a minimum 1 second (sec) secondary chamber residence time an d design temperature 2000 degrees F, Secondary chamber volume m = > 1 Fl 130 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 4 February 25, 1983 - 7 2 June 24, 1983 314 7 6 May 24, 1985 457 9 5 April 22, 1988 970 12 4 February 24, 1989 868 13 2 June 26, 1998 2244 22 6 October 26, 2001 2648 25 10 May 25, 2007 3069 31 5 May 27, 2011 4130 35 5 December 28, 2012 (Errata) 4130 36 12 April 26, 2013 4330 37 4 June 27, 2014 4388 38 6 June 24, 2016 4590 40 6 September 23, 2016 4650 40 9 61-62.5 Standard No. 4 Emissions from Process Industries 131 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 4 SECTION I - GENERAL A.

(2) Applicability procedures. (a) The requirements of this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (B)(32)) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341. (b) The requirements of paragraphs (J) through (R) apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationar y source, except as this section otherwise provides. (c) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraphs (J) through (R)(5) apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major st ationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (d) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (A)(2)(d)(i) through ( A)(2)(d)(vi). (i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(2)(e), and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (B)(30), a project is a major modification for a regulated New Source Review (NSR) pollutant if it ca uses two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (B)(50)), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (B)(34) and (B)(49)). The project is not a major modification if it does not caus e a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (ii) The procedure for calculating (before beginning a ctual construction) whether a significant emissions increase ( that is , the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (A)(2)(d)(iii) through (A)(2)(d)(vi). The procedure for calcul ating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source ( that is , the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (B)(34). Regardless of any such precon struction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase. (iii) Actual -to-projected -actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions u nits. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(41)) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (B)( 4)(a) and (B)(4)(b)), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(49)). (iv) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s). A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the basel ine actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(4)(c)) 198 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(49)). (v) [Reserved] (vi) Hybrid test for projects that involve mult iple types of emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (A)(2)(d)(iii) and (A)(2)(d)(iv) as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds, the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(49)). (e) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under Section (AA). (B) Definitions. For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(a) Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (B)(1)(b) through (B)(1)(d), except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a sig nificant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under Section (AA). Instead, paragraphs (B)(41) and (B)(4) shall apply for those purposes. (b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different tim e period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selec ted time period. (c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual e missions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) Adverse impact on visibility means visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Class I area. This determination must be made on a case -by-case basis taking into account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Class I area, and (2) the frequency and timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility. (3) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally en forceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; 199 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (b) The applicable State Implementation Plan emissions l imitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (4) Baseline actual emissions means the rate of emissions, in ton s per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (B)(4)(a) through (B)(4)(d). (a) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five (5) -year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The D epartment shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable durin g the consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period. (iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period for which there is inadequate in formation for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (B)(4)(a)(ii). (b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions mean s the average rate, in tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding either the date th e owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Department for a permit required under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator, whichever is earlier, except that the ten (10)-year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty -four (24) -month period selected is appropriate. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limita tion that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period. 200 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (iii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source mu st currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that th e Administrator proposed or promulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the State has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirement s of 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(G). (iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all the emissions unit s being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (v) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (B)(4)(b)(ii) and (B)(4)(b)(iii). (c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit. (d) For a PAL for a stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calcu lated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(4)(a), for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(4)(b), and for a new emissions un it in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(4)(c). (5)(a) Baseline area means any intrastate area (and every part thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under Section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Clean Air Act in whic h the major source or major modification establishing the minor source baseline date would construct or would have an air quality impact for the pollutant for which the baseline date is established, as follows: Equal to or greater than one (1) microgram(s) per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) (annual average) for SO 2, NO 2, or PM 10; or equal or greater than 0.3 \u00b5g/m3 (annual average) for PM 2.5. (b) Area redesignations under Section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or 107(d)(1)(A)(iii) of the Clean Air Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major stationary source or major modification which: (i) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or (ii) Is su bject to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166 and would be constructed in the same state as the state proposing the redesignation. (c) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM 10 increments, except that such baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Department rescinds the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with paragraph (B)(31)(d). 201 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (6)(a) Baseline concentration means that ambient concentration level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor source baseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for each pollutant for which a minor source baseline d ate is established and shall include: (i) The actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (B)(1), representative of sources in existence on the applicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (B)(6)(b); and (ii) The allowable e missions of major stationary sources that commenced construction before the major source baseline date, but were not in operation by the applicable minor source baseline date. (b) The following will not be included in the baseline concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable increase(s): (i) Actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (B)(1), from any major stationary source on which construction commenced after the major source baseline date; and (ii) Actual emissions increases a nd decreases, as defined in paragraph (B)(1), at any stationary source occurring after the minor source baseline date. (7) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of physical on -site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on -site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. (8) Best available control technology (BACT) means an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum deg ree of reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmenta l, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of BACT result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61. If the Department determines that technol ogical or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall prov ide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (9)(a) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the pollutant -emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adja cent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant -emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same \"Major Group\" (that is, which have the same first two digit code) as described in the Standard 202 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101 -0066 and 003-005-00716 -0, respectively). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (B)(9)(a), building, structure, facility, or installation means, for onshore activities under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant -emitting activities included in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be considered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; or if they are located on surface sites that are located within one -fourth (1/4) of a mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fluids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas dehydrators or emissions control devices. Surface site, as used in this paragraph (b)(9)(b), has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761. (10) Clean coal technology means a ny technology, including technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides associated with the util ization of coal in the generation of electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of November 15, 1990. (11) Clean coal technology demonstration project means a project using funds appropriated under the heading \"Department of Energy -Clean Coal Technology,\" up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. The federal contribution for a qualifying proje ct shall be at least twenty (20) percent of the total cost of the demonstration project.

(11) The requirements of Section (K) shall not apply to a permit application for a stationary source or modification with respect to the revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone published on October 26, 2015, if: (a) The Department has determined the permit application subject to this section to be complete on or before October 1, 2015. Instead, the requirements in Section (K) shall apply with respect to the national ambient air quality standards for ozone in effect at the time the Department determined the permit application to be complete; or (b) The Departme nt has first published before December 28, 2015, a public notice of a preliminary determination or draft permit for the permit application subject to this section. Instead, the requirements in Section (K) shall apply with respect to the national ambient ai r quality standards for ozone in effect on the date the Department first published a public notice of a preliminary determination or draft permit. 224 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (J) Control technology review. (1) A major stationary source or major modification shall meet each app licable emissions limitation under the State Implementation Plan and each applicable emissions standard and standard of performance under 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61. (2) A new major stationary source shall apply BACT for each regulated NSR pollutant that it would have the potential to emit in significant amounts. (3) A major modification shall apply BACT for each regulated NSR pollutant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase at the source. This requirement applies to each proposed emissions unit at which a net emissions increase in the pollutant would occur as a result of a physical change or change in the method of operation in the unit. (4) For phased constructio n projects, the determination of BACT shall be reviewed and modified as appropriate at the latest reasonable time which occurs no later than eighteen (18) months prior to commencement of construction of each independent phase of the project. At such time, the owner or operator of the applicable stationary source may be required to demonstrate the adequacy of any previous determination of BACT for the source. (K) Source impact analysis. The owner or operator of the proposed source or modification shall de monstrate that allowable emission increases from the proposed source or modification, in conjunction with all other applicable emissions increases or reductions (including secondary emissions), would not cause or contribute to air pollution in violation of : (1) Any National Ambient Air Quality Standard in any air quality control region; or (2) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline concentration in any area. (L) Air quality models. (1) All estimates of ambient concentrations requ ired under this paragraph shall be based on applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix W (Guideline on Air Quality Models). (2) Where an air quality model specified in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix W (Guideline on Air Quality Models) is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another model substituted. Such a modification or substitution of a model may be made on a case -by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific state pr ogram. Written approval of the Department must be obtained for any modification or substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (Q). (M) Air quality analysis. (1) Preapplication analysis. 225 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (a) Any application for a permit under this section shall contain an analysis of ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source or major modification would affect for each of the following pollutants: (i) For the source, each pollutant that it would have the potential to emit in a significant amount; (ii) For the modification, each pollutant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase. (b) With respect to any such pollutant for which no National Ambient Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air quality monitoring data as the Department determines is necessary to assess ambient air quality for that pollutant in any area that the emissions of that pollutant would affect. (c) With respect to any such pollutant (other than nonmethane hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis shall contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of determining whether emissions of that pollutant would cause or contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable increase. (d) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that is required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and shall represent at least the year preceding receipt of the application, except that, if the Department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathe red over a period shorter than one (1) year (but not to be less than four (4) months), the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period. (e) For any application which becomes complete, except as to the requirements of paragraphs (M)(1)(c) and (M)(1)(d), between June 8, 1981, and February 9, 1982, the data that paragraph (M)(1)(c), requires shall have been gathered over at least the period from February 9, 1981, to the date the application becomes otherwise complete, ex cept that: (i) If the source or modification would have been major for that pollutant under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, any monitoring data shall have been gathered over at least the period required by those regulations. (ii) If the Department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over a shorter period (not to be less than four (4) months), the data that paragraph (M)(1)(c), requires shall have been gathered over at least that short er period. (iii) If the monitoring data would relate exclusively to ozone and would not have been required under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, the Department may waive the otherwise applicable requirements of this paragraph (M)(1)(e) to t he extent that the applicant shows that the monitoring data would be unrepresentative of air quality over a full year. (f) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or modification of VOCs who satisfies all conditions of 40 CFR Part 51 Appen dix S, Section IV may provide post -approval monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as required under paragraph (M)(1). 226 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (g) For any application that becomes complete, except as to the requirements of paragraphs (M)(1)(c) and (M)(1)(d) pertaining to PM 10, after December 1, 1988, and no later than August 1, 1989, the data that paragraph (M)(1)(c) requires shall have been gathered over at least the period from August 1, 1988, to the date the application becomes otherwise complete , except that if the Department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over a shorter period (not to be less than four (4) months), the data that paragraph (M)(1)(c) requires shall have been gathered over that shorter period. (h) With respect to any requirements for air quality monitoring of PM 10 under paragraphs (I)(11)(a) and (I)(11)(b), the owner or operator of the source or modification shall use a monitoring method approved by the Department and sha ll estimate the ambient concentrations of PM 10 using the data collected by such approved monitoring method in accordance with estimating procedures approved by the Department. (2) Post -construction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as the Department determines is necessary to determine the effect emissions from the stationary source or modification may have , or are having, on air quality in any area. (3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall meet the requirements of Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 58 of during the operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying paragraph (M).

(2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification. (3) Visibility mon itoring. The Department may require monitoring of visibility in any Class I area near the proposed new stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate. (P) Sources impacting Federal Class I areas - additional requirements. (1) Notice to Federal Land Managers. The Department shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within thirty (30) days of receipt and at least sixty (60) days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impac ts on visibility in the Class I area. The Department shall also provide the Federal Land Manager and such federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (Q), and shall make available to them any materials used in ma king that determination, promptly after the Department makes such determination. Finally, the Department shall also notify all affected Federal Land Managers within thirty (30) days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application. (2) Federal Land Manager. The Federal Land Manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in consultation with the Department, whether a proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such values. (3) Visibility analysis. The Department shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal Land Manager, provided w ithin thirty (30) days of the notification required by paragraph (P)(1), that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Class I area. Where the Department finds that such an anal ysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Department must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain its decision or giv e notice as to where the explanation can be obtained. (4) Denial - impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Department that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality -related values (including visibility) of those lands, notwithstanding that 228 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute to concentrations which would exce ed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Department concurs with such demonstration, then the permit shall not be issued. (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federa l Land Manager that the emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such so urce or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and so certifies, the state may authorize the Administrator, provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the follow ing maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants: Pollutant Maximum Allowable Increase (micrograms per cubic meter) PM 2.5: annual arithmetic mean 4 24-hr maximum 9 PM 10: annual arithmetic mean 17 24-hr maximum 30 Sulfur dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 20 24-hr maximum 91 3-hr maximum 325 Nitrogen dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 25 (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved under paragraph (Q)(4) may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of twenty -four (24) hours or l ess applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Department shall issue a permit to such source or modification pu rsuant to the requirements of paragraph (Q)(7), provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. (7) Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence. In any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which t he Federal Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitted to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if it is found that the variance is in the national int erest. If the variance is approved, the Department shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (Q)(7), provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. 229 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or guberna torial variance. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (Q)(5) or (Q)(6) the source or modification shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from the source or modification wou ld not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such em issions would not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases for periods of exposure of twenty -four (24) hours or less for more than eighteen (18) days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period: MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INCREASE (Micrograms per cubic meter) Period of exposure Terrain Areas Low High 24-hr maximum 36 62 3-hr maximum 130 221 (Q) Public participation. (1) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application to construct, or any addition to such application, the Department shall advise the applicant of any deficiency in the application or in the information submitted and transmit a copy of such application to EPA. In the event of such a deficiency, the date of receipt of the application shall be, for the purpose of this regulation, the date on which the Department received all required information. (2) In accordance with Regulation 61 -30, Environmental Protection Fees , the Department shall make a final determination on the application. This involves performing the following actions in a timely manner: (a) Make a preliminary determination whether construction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. (b) Make available in a t least one location in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed a copy of all materials the applicant submitted, a copy of the preliminary determination and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered in m aking the preliminary determination. This requirement may be met by making these materials available at a physical location or on a public website identified by the Department. (c) Notify the public, by posting the notice, for the duration of the public comment period, on a public website identified by the Department. This consistent noticing method shall be used for all draft permits subject to notice under this section. The pub lic website notice shall include a notice of public comment including notice of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a publi c hearing as well as written public comment. The public website notice shall also include the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft permit and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. T he Department may use additional means to provide adequate notice to the affected public, including by publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in 230 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 which the proposed source or modification would be constructed (or in a sta te publication designed to give general public notice). (d) Send a copy of the notice of public comment to the applicant, the Administrator of EPA, and to officials and agencies having cognizance over the location where the proposed construction would o ccur as follows: The chief executives of the city and county where the source or modification would be located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any state, Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the source or modification. (e) Provide opportunity for a public hearing for interested persons to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air quality impact of the source or modification, alternatives to the source or modifica tion, the control technology required, and other appropriate considerations. (f) Consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing in making a final decision o n the approvability of the application. No later than ten (10) days after the close of the public comment period, the applicant may submit a written response to any comments submitted by the public. The Department shall consider the applicant's response in making a final decision. The Department shall make all comments available for public inspection in the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information relating to the proposed source or modification. (g) Make a final determination whether construction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved pursuant to this section. (h) Notify the applicant in writing of the final determination and make such notification available for public in spection at the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information and public comments relating to the source or modification. (i) Notify EPA of every action related to the consideration of the permit. (3) The requirements of Section (Q), Public Participation, of this standard shall not apply to any major plant or major modification which Section (I), Exemptions, would exempt from the requirements of Sections (K), (M), and (O), but only to the extent th at, with respect to each of the criteria for construction approval under the South Carolina State Implementation Plan and for exemption under Section (I), requirements providing the public with at least as much participation in each material determination as those of Section (Q) have been met in the granting of such construction approval. (R) Source obligation. In addition to all other applicable requirements specified in this regulation, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of parag raphs (R)(1) through (R)(8). (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. 231 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (2) Approval to constr uct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time . The Department may extend the eighteen (18) -month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State Imple mentation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or mo dification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements or paragraphs (J) through (R) shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification. (5) Reserved (6) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. The provisions of this paragraph (R)(6) apply with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at an existing emissions unit at a major stationary source (other than projects a t a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragra phs (B)(41)(b)(i) through (B)(41)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (a) If the project requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the info rmation set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b). (b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (i) A description of the project; (ii) Identification of the emissions un it(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baselin e actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(41)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. 232 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (c) If the emissions unit is an existi ng electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b) of this section to the Department. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the Department before beginning actual construction. (d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of t he project and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph (R)(6)(b)(ii); and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) years following resumption of regul ar operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity of or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty (60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (R)(6)(d) setting out t he unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report. (f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the an nual emissions, in tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (R)(6)(b), exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(b)(iii)), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (B)(49)) for th at regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(b)(iii). Such report shall be submitted to the Department within sixty (60) days after the end of such ye ar. The report shall contain the following: (i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (ii) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(d); and (iii) Any other information needed to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (g) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (R)(6) of this section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (i) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significa nt net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (ii) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(41)(b)( iii) of this section, sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regu lated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( ii) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( i) of this section, then provisions (R)(6)(c) through (R )(6)(f) do not apply to the project. 233 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (7) If a project at a source with a PAL requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements\", the owner or operator shall provide notification of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (8) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (R)(6) available for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the gener al public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii). (S) through (U)(3) [Reserved] (U)(4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to a ir quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Administrator must approve the deter mination of BACT as set forth in the permit. (V) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the Department in writing no later than the close of the comment period unde r 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology. (2) The Department shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if: (a) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function; (b) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph (J)(2), by a date specified by the Department. Such date shall not be later than four (4) years from the time of startup or seven (7) years from permit issuance; (c) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (J) and (K), based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Department; (d) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Department: (i) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard; o r (ii) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and (e) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met. (f) The provisions of paragraph (P) (relating to Class I areas) have b een satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. 234 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (3) The Department shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if: (a) The proposed system fails by t he specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or (b) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or (c) The Department decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety. (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the sp ecified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (V)(3), the Department may allow the source or modification up to an additional three (3) years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology t hrough use of a demonstrated system of control. (W) Permit rescission . (1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior version of this regulation shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires or is rescinded under this paragraph (W). (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a permit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (W)(3) of this section may request that the Department re scind the permit or a particular portion of the permit. (3) The Department may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification. (4) If the Department rescinds a permit under t his paragraph, the Department shall post a notice of the rescission determination on a public website identified by the Department within sixty (60) days of the rescission. (X) [Reserved] (Y) [Reserved] (Z) [Reserved] (AA) Actuals PALs. The provisions in paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability. (a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15). The term \"PAL\" shall mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout Section (AA). 235 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (b) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in p aragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15), and complies with the PAL permit: (i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration . However, the change will be reviewed through Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, Permit Requirements ; and (iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (R)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program). (c) Except as provided under paragraph (AA)(1)( b)(iii), a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definit ions in paragraphs (AA)(2)(a) through (AA)(2)(k) shall apply to actual PALs consistent with paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (B) or in the Clean Air Act. (a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(4)) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (B)(20)) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutan t. (b) Allowable emissions means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in paragraph (B)(3), except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (AA)(2)(b)(i) and (AA)(2)(b)(ii). (i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limit ations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in paragraph (B)(37), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (c) Small emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragrap h (B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (d) Major emissions unit means: (i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one hundred (100) tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act 236 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance wit h the definition of major stationary source in Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit f ifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year. (e) Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) means an emission limitation expressed in tons per year, for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source -wide in accordance with paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15). (f) PAL effective date generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (g) PAL effective period means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (h) PAL major modification means, notwithstanding paragraphs (B)(30) and (B)(34) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level eq ual to or greater than the PAL. (i) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the state operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major sta tionary source. (j) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (k) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equ al to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (AA)(2) (d). (3) Permit application requirements. As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (a) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices apply to each unit. (b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and m alfunction. (c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)-month rolling total for each month as re quired by paragraph (AA)(13)(a). 237 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (4) General requirements for establishing PALs. (a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(4)(a)(i) through (AA)(4)(a) (vii) are met. (i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tons per year, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelve (12) -month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit u nder the PAL is less than the PAL. (ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (AA)(5). (iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (AA)(7). (iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (AA)(12) through ( AA)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (b) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii) unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirements for PALs. PALs fo r existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with Section (Q) \"Public Participation\" of this regulation. This includes the requirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10 -year actuals PAL level. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (AA)(6)(b), the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(4)) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source ; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (B)(49) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When 238 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were perma nently shut down after this twenty -four (24) -month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons per year) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to the issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty (60) parts per million (ppm) NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (b) F or newly constructed units (which do not include modification to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four (24) -month period, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the uni ts. (7) Contents of the PAL permit. The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (AA)(7)(a) through (AA)(7)(j). (a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source -wide emission limitation in tons per year. (b) The PAL permi t effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). (c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (AA)(10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes must include e missions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (AA)(9). (f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12) -month rolling total as required by paragraph (AA)(13)(a). (g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator m onitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (AA)(12). (h) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (AA)(13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (i) A requirement to submi t the reports required under paragraph (AA)(14) by the required deadlines. (j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. 239 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit. The requirements in p aragraphs (AA)(8)(a) and (AA)(8)(b) apply to actuals PALs. (a) PAL effective period. The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (b) Reopening of the PAL permit. (i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL; (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii); and (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (AA)(11). (ii) The Department shall have discret ion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the state may impose on the major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan; and (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contribu ting to a National Ambient Air Quality Standard or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (AA)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (AA)(5). (9) Expiration of a PAL. Any PAL that is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (AA)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(9)(a) through (A A)(9)(e) shall apply. (a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (AA)(9)(a)(i) and (AA)(9)(a)(ii). (i) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (AA)(10)(b), the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distr ibution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the 240 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requi rement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (AA)(10)(e), such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a twelve (12) -month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (c) Until th e Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (AA)(9)(a)(ii), the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, multi -unit emissions cap eq uivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (d) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (B)(30). (e) The major stationary source owner o r operator shall continue to comply with any state or federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (R)(4), but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (AA)(1)(b)(iii). (10) Renewal of a PAL. (a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (AA)(5) in appro ving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL le vel for the source for consideration by the Department. (b) Application deadline. A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen (18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (c) Application requirements. The application to rene w a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (AA)(10)(c)(i) through (AA)(10)(c)(iv). 241 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (i) The information required in paragraphs (AA)(3)(a) through (AA)(3)(c). (ii) A proposed PAL level. (iii) The sum of the potential to e mit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (d) PAL adjustment. In determinin g whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (AA)(10)(d)(ii). However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (AA)(10)(d)(iii). (i) If the emissions l evel calculated in accordance with paragraph (AA)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (AA)(10)(d)(ii); or (ii) Th e Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be more appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (AA)(10)(d)(ii): (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a rene wed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (AA)(11) (increasing a PAL). (e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effe ctive period. (a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (AA)(11)(a)(i) through (AA)(11)(a)(iv). (i) The owner or operator of the major stationary source s hall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. 242 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of t he significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent control s on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (AA)(11)(a)(i), regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements result ing from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions un it that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the bas eline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (AA)(11)(a)(ii)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (AA)(5). (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs. (a) General requirements. (i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet gen erally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. (ii) The PAL mo nitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (AA)(12)(b)(i) through (AA)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (A A)(12)(a)(ii), the owner or operator may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (AA)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. 243 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders th e PAL invalid. (b) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (AA)(12)(c) through (AA)(12)(b)(i ): (i) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or solvents; (ii) CEMS; (iii) CPMS or PEMS; and (iv) Emission factors. (c) Mass balance calculations. An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: (i) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at th e emissions unit; (ii) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and (iii) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unles s the Department determines there is site -specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support another content within the range. (d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements : (i) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B; and (ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (e) CPMS or PEMS . An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site -specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and 244 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Department, whil e the emissions unit is operating. (f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within six (6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (g) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there i s no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(12)(c) through (AA)(12)(g), where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Department shall, at the time of permit issuance: (i) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monito red parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (i) Re -validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re -validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five (5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements . (a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any re quirement of Section (AA) and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's twelve (12) -month rolling total emissions, for five (5) years from the date of such record. (b) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a co py of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus five (5) years: 245 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (i) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and (ii) Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to Title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. (14) Reporting and notification requirements . The owner or operator shall submit semi -annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports to the Department in accordance with Regulation 61 -62.70. The reports shall meet the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(14)(a) through (AA)(14)(c). (a) Semi -annual report. The semi -annual report shall be submitted to the Department within 30 days of the end of each reporting period. This report shall conta in the information required in paragraphs (AA)(14)(a)(i) through (AA)(14)(a)(vii). (i) The identification of owner and operator and the permit number.

A report submitted pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) shall satisfy this rep orting requirement. The deviation reports shall be submitted within the time limits prescribed by the applicable program implementing 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B). The reports shall contain the following information: (i) The identification of owner and op erator and the permit number; (ii) The PAL requirement that experienced the deviation or that was exceeded; (iii) Emissions resulting from the deviation or the exceedance; and 246 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7 (iv) A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by R egulation 61 -62.70) certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report. (c) Re-validation results. The owner or operator shall submit to the Department the results of any re-validation test or method within three (3) months after completion of such test or method. (15) Transition requirements. (a) The Department may not issue a PAL that does not comply with the requirements in paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15) after the date these provisions become effective . (b) The Department may supersede any PAL that was established prior to the date these provisions become effective with a PAL that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (AA)(1) through (AA)(15). (BB) If any provision of this regulation, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this regulation, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. 247 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 Regulation History as Published in State Register Date Document Number Volume Issue June 24, 2005 2943 29 6 April 24, 2009 4056 33 4 February 25, 2011 4160 35 2 May 27, 2011 4130 35 5 May 25, 2012 (Errata) 4130 36 5 September 28, 2012 (Errata) 4130 36 9 April 26, 2013 4330 37 4 June 26, 2015 4481 39 6 November 27, 2015 4577 39 11 April 24, 2020 4873 44 4 61-62.5 Standard No. 7 .1 Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) 248 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (A) Applicability. (1) This rule applies to all major stationary sources constructed or modified in any nonattainment area as designated in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341 (\"nonattainment area\") if the emissions from such facility will cause or contribute to conc entrations of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(32)) for which the nonattainment area was designated as nonattainment. Applicability to this regulation shall be based on the pollutant emission rate set out in paragraph (B)(37) for only those pollutants for which the area's designation is based. (a) The requirements of this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as provided in Se ction(A)(10). (b) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of this regulation apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (2) Redesignation to attainment . If any nonattainment area to which this regulation applies is later designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as attainment, all sources in that nonattainment area s ubject to this regulation before the redesignation date shall continue to comply with this regulation. (3) For any area designated as nonattainment a major stationary source or major modification that is major for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or nit rogen oxides is also major for ozone. (4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(9), and consistent with the definition of major modification as defined in paragraph (B)(21)(a), a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (B)(38), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (B)(24) and (B)(37)). The project is not a major modification if it does not ca use a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (5) The procedure for calculating, before beginning ac tual construction, whether a significant emissions increase (the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (A)(6) through (A)(8). The procedure for calculating, before beginning a ctual construction, whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (B)(24). Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major mod ification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase. (6) Actual -to-projected -actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(31)) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (B)(3)(a) and (B)(3)(b), as applicable), f or each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)). (7) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s) . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference 249 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (B)(27)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the basel ine actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(3)(c)) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)). (8) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emission s units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (A)(6) and (A)(7) as applicable with respect to each emissi ons unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)). (9) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with requirements under Section (N). (10) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source or major modification if the source or modification would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following categories: (a) Coal cleani ng plants (with thermal dryers); (b) Kraft pulp mills; (c) Portland cement plants; (d) Primary zinc smelters; (e) Iron and steel mills; (f) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants; (g) Primary copper smelters; (h) Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 250 tons of refuse per day; (i) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants; (j) Petroleum refineries; (k) Lime plants; (l) Phosphate rock processing plants; (m) Coke oven batteries; (n) Sulfur recovery plants; 250 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (o) Carbon black plants (furnace process); (p) Primary lead smelters; (q) Fuel conversion plants; (r) Sintering plants; (s) Secondary metal production plants; (t) Chemical process plants - The term chemical process ing plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermentation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140; (u) Fossil -fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per ho ur heat input; (v) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (w) Taconite ore processing plants; (x) Glass fiber processing plants; (y) Charcoal production plants; (z) Fossil fuel -fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; and (aa) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under Section 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act. (B) Definitions . For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(a) Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (B)(1)(b) through (B)(1)(d), except that this definition sh all not apply for calculating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under Section (N). Instead, paragraphs (B)(3) and (B)(31) shall apply for those purposes. (b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Departme nt shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials process ed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. 251 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal op erations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the so urce is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (b) Any applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (3) Baseline actual emissions means the rate of emissions, in tons per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (B)(3)(a) through (B)(3)(d). (a) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five (5) -year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator beg ins actual construction of the project. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent qu antifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period. (iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period for wh ich there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (B)(3)(a)(ii). (b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), base line actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately pr eceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Department for a permit required either under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator w hichever is earlier, except that the 252 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 ten (10) -year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty -four (24) -month period selected is appropriate. (i) The average rate sha ll include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was op erating above an emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period. (iii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with whic h the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable con trol technology standard that the Administrator proposed or promulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the state has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of paragraph (D)(7) (iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for t he emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (v) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (B)(3)(b)(ii) and (B)(3)(b)(iii). (c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit. (d) For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline ac tual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(3)(a), for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(3)(b ), and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (B)(3)(c). (4) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of physical on -site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent natu re. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operating this term refers to th ose on -site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. (5) Best available control technology (BACT) means an emissions limitation (including a visible emissions standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determi nes is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or 253 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 or 61. If the Department determines that technological or economic l imitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed inste ad to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (6)(a) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the pollutant -emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant -emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same \"Major Group\" (which have the same two -digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101 -0066 and 003 -005-00176 -0, respectively). (b) Notwithstanding the provisio ns of paragraph (B)(6)(a), building, structure, facility, or installation means, for onshore activities under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant -emitting activities included in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be considered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; o r if they are located on surface sites that are located within one -fourth (1/4) of a mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fl uids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas dehydrators, or emissions control devices. Surface site, as used in this paragraph, has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761. (7) Temporary clean coal technology demonstration project means a clean coal t echnology demonstration project that is operated for a period of five (5) years or less, and which complies with the State Implementation Plan for the state in which the project is located and other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the nationa l ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated. (8) Clean coal technology means any technology, including technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of November 15, 1990. (9) Clean coal t echnology demonstration project means a project using funds appropriated under the heading \"Department of Energy -Clean Coal Technology,\" up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funde d through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. The Federal contribution for a qualifying project shall lie at least twenty (20) percent of the total cost of the demonstration project. 254 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (10) Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary source or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has: (a) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on -site construction of the source, to be comp leted within a reasonable time; or (b) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time. (11) Construction means any physical change or change in the method of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or modification of an emissions unit) that would result in a change in emiss ions. (12) Continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) means all of the equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements, to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions on a continuous basis. (13) Continuous emissions rate monitoring system (CERM S) means the total equipment required for the determination and recording of the pollutant mass emissions rate (in terms of mass per unit of time). (14) Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) means all of the equipment necessary to meet the data a cquisition and availability requirements, to monitor process and control device operational parameters (for example, control device secondary voltages and electric currents) and other information (for example, gas flow rate, O 2 or CO 2 concentrations), and to record average operational parameter value(s) on a continuous basis. (15) Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one -third of its potential electric ou tput capacity and more than twenty -five (25) MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing steam to a steam -electric generator that would produce elect rical energy for sale is also considered in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility. (16) Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant a nd includes an electric utility steam generating unit as defined in paragraph (B)(15) of this section. For purposes of this section, there are two types of emissions units as described in paragraphs (B)(16)(a) and (B)(16)(b) of this section. (a) A new e missions unit is any emissions unit which is (or will be) newly constructed and which has existed for less than two (2) years from the date such emissions unit first operated.

(20) Lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) means, for any source, the more stringent rate of emissions based on the following: (a) The most stringent emissions limitation which is contained in the implementation plan of any state for such class or category of stat ionary source, unless the owner or operator of the proposed stationary source demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or (b) The most stringent emissions limitation which is achieved in practice by such class or category of stationary sou rces. This limitation, when applied to a modification, means the lowest achievable emission rate for the new or modified emission units within the stationary source. In no event shall the application of the term allow a proposed new or modified stationary source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under an applicable new source standard of performance. (21)(a) Major modification means any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in: (i) A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (B)(32)); and (ii) A significant net em issions increase of that pollutant from the major stationary source. (b) Any significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (B)(38)) from any emissions units or net emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (B)(24)) at a major stationary sour ce that is significant for volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides shall be considered significant for ozone.

Instead, the definition a t paragraph (N)(2)(h) shall apply. (e) [Reserved] (22)(a) Major stationary source means: (i) Any stationary source of air pollutants that emits, or has the potential to emit, one -hundred (100) tons per year or more of any regulated NSR pollutant, except that lower emissions thresholds shall apply in areas subject to Subpart 2, Subpart 3, or Subpart 4 of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act, according to the following table: Nonattainment Area Classification NO X VOC CO SO 2 PM 10 PM 2.5 All values expressed in tons per year Ozone: Marginal and Moderate 100 100 257 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 Nonattainment Area Classification NO X VOC CO SO 2 PM 10 PM 2.5 All values expressed in tons per year Ozone: Serious 50 50 Ozone: Severe 25 25 Ozone: Extreme 10 10 CO 100 CO: Serious, where stationary sources contribute significantly to CO levels 50 PM 10 100 PM 10: Serious 70 PM 2.5 100 100 100 100 PM 2.5 in any serious nonattainment area for PM 2.5. 70 70 70 70 SO 2 100 NO X 100 (ii) Any physical change that would occur at a stationary source not qualifying under paragraph (B)(22)(a) as a major stationary source, if the change would constitute a major stationary source by itself. (b) A major stationary source that is major for volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides shall be considered major for ozone.

(23) Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits means those permits or approvals required under federal air quality control laws and regulations and those air quality control laws an d regulations which are part of the applicable State Implementation Plan. 259 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (24)(a) Net emissions increase means, with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted by a major stationary source, the amount by which the sum of the following exceeds zero: (i) The increase in emissions from a particular physical change or change in the method of operation at a stationary source as calculated pursuant to paragraphs (A)(4) through (A)(8); and (ii) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the major stationary source that are contemporaneous with the particular change and are otherwise creditable. Baseline actual emissions for calculating increases and decreases under this paragraph (B)(24)(a)(ii) shall be determined as provided in paragrap h (B)(3), except that paragraphs (B)(3)(a)(iii) and (B)(3)(b)(iv) shall not apply. (b) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is contemporaneous with the increase from the particular change only if it occurs between: (i) The date five (5) years before construction on the particular change commences; and (ii) The date that the increase from the particular change occurs. (c) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable only if: (i) The Department has not relied on it in iss uing a permit for the source which permit is in effect when the increase in actual emissions from the particular change occurs; (ii) [Reserved] (d) An increase in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level; (e) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that: (i) The old level of actual emissions or the old level of allowable emissions, whichever is lower, exceeds the new level of actual emissions; (ii) It is enforceable as a practical matter at and after the time that actual construction on the particular change begins; (iii) The Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subp art I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress; and (iv) It has approximately the same qualitative significance for public health and welfare as that attributed to the increase from the particula r change. (f) An increase that results from a physical change at a source occurs when the emissions unit on which construction occurred becomes operational and begins to emit a particular pollutant. Any replacement unit that requires shakedown becomes o perational only after a reasonable shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days; 260 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (g) Paragraph (B)(1)(b) shall not apply for determining creditable increases and decreases or after a change. (25) Nonattainment major new source review (NSR) program means a major source preconstruction permit program that has been approved by the Administrator and incorporated into the plan to implement the requirements of this regulation, or a program that implements 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, Sections I through VI. Any permit issued under such a program is a major NSR permit. (26) Pollution prevention means any activity that through process changes, product reformulation or redesign, or substitution of less polluting raw materials, eliminates or reduces the releas e of air pollutants (including fugitive emissions) and other pollutants to the environment prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; it does not mean recycling (other than certain \"in -process recycling\" practices), energy recovery, treatment, or disposal . (27) Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution co ntrol equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design only if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable. Se condary emissions do not count in determining the potential to emit of a stationary source. (28) Predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS) means all of the equipment necessary to monitor process and control device operational parameters (for example, control device secondary voltages and electric currents) and other information (for example, gas flow rate, O 2 or CO 2 concentrations), and calculate and record the mass emissions rate (for example, lb/hr) on a continuous basis. (29) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit means any permit that is issued under a major source preconstruction permit program that has been approved by the Administrator and incorporated into the plan to implement the requirements of 40 CFR 51.166, or under t he program in 40 CFR 52.21. (30) Project means a physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, an existing major stationary source. (31)(a) Projected actual emissions means, the maximum annual rate, in tons per year, at which an existing emissions unit is projected to emit a regulated NSR pollutant in any one of the five (5) years (twelve (12)-month period) following the date the unit resumes regular operation after the project, or in any one of the ten (10) years following that date, if the project involves increasing the emissions unit's design capacity or its potential to emit of that regulated NSR pollutant and full utilization of the unit would result in a significant emissions increase or a significant net emissions increase at the m ajor stationary source. (b) In determining the projected actual emissions under paragraph (B)(31)(a) before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator of the major stationary source: (i) Shall consider all relevant information, including b ut not limited to, historical operational data, the company's own representations, the company's expected business activity and the company's highest 261 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 projections of business activity, the company's filings with the state or federal regulatory authorities, and compliance plans under the approved plan; and (ii) Shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions; and (iii) Shall exclude, in calculating any increase in emissio ns that results from the particular project, that portion of the unit's emissions following the project that an existing unit could have accommodated during the consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period used to establish the baseline actual emissions under paragraph (B)(3) and that are also unrelated to the particular project, including any increased utilization due to product demand growth; or, (iv) In lieu of using the method set out in paragraphs (B)(31)(b)(i) through (B)(31)(b)(iii) may elect to use the emissions unit's potential to emit, in tons per year, as defined in paragraph (B)(27) of this section. (32) Regulated NSR pollutant, for purposes of this regulation, means the following: (a) Nitrogen oxides or any volatile organic compounds; (b) Any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard has been promulgated; or (c) Any pollutant that is identified under this paragraph as a constituent or precursor of a general pollutant listed under paragraphs (B)(32)(a) or (B)(32)(b), provided that such constituent or precursor pollutant may only be regulated under NSR as part of regulation of the general pollutant. Precursors identified by the Administrator for purposes of NSR are the following: (i) Volatile organic compounds and n itrogen oxides are precursors to ozone in all ozone nonattainment areas; (ii) Sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia are precursors to PM 2.5 in any PM 2.5 nonattainment area. (d) PM 2.5 emissions and PM 10 emissions shall include gaseous emissions from a source or activity, which condense to fo rm particulate matter at ambient temperatures. On or after January 1, 2011 (or any earlier date established in the upcoming rulemaking codifying test methods), such condensable particulate matter shall be accounted for in applicability determinations and i n establishing emissions limitations for PM 2.5 and PM 10 in nonattainment major NSR permits issued under this ruling. Compliance with emissions limitations for PM 2.5 and PM 10 issued prior to this date shall not be based on condensable particulate matter unless required by the terms and conditions of the permit or the applicable implementation plan. Applicability determinations made prior to this date without accounting for condensable particulate matter shall not be considered in violation of this section un less the applicable implementation plan required condensable particulate matter to be included. (33) Replacement unit means an emissions unit for which all the criteria listed in (B)(33)(a) through (B)(33)(d) are met. No creditable emission reductions sh all be generated from shutting down the existing emissions unit that is replaced. 262 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (a) The emissions unit is a reconstructed unit within the meaning of 40 CFR 60.15(b)(1), or the emissions unit completely takes the place of an existing emissions unit; (b) The emissions unit is identical to or functionally equivalent to the replaced emissions unit; (c) The replacement does not alter the basic design parameters of the process unit; and (d) The replaced emissions unit is permanently removed from the major stationary source, otherwise permanently disabled, or permanently barred from operation by a permit that is enforceable as a practical matter. If the replaced emissions unit is brought back into operation, it shall constitute a new emissions unit. (34) Resource recovery facility means any facility at which solid waste is processed for the purpose of extracting, converting to energy, or otherwise separating and preparing solid waste for reuse. Energy conversion facilities must utilize solid waste to provide more than fifty (50) percent of the heat input to be considered a resource recovery facility under this Ruling. (35) Reviewing authority means the state air pollution control agency, local agency, other state agency, Indian tribe, or other agenc y authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under 40 CFR 51.165 and 40 CFR 51.166, or the Administrator in the case of EPA -implemented permit programs under 40 CFR 52.21. (36) Secondary emissions means emissions which would occur as a result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or major modification itself. Secondary emissions must be specific, well defined, quantifiable, and impact the sam e general area as the stationary source or modification which causes the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include emissions from any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the constru ction or operation of the major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a train, or from a vessel. (37) Significant means, in reference to a net emissions increase or the potential of a source to emit any of the following pollutants, a rate of emissions that would equal or exceed any of the following rates: Pollutant Emissions Rate (tons per year) Carbon monoxide Marginal and Moderate Nonattainment Areas 100 Serious Nonattainment Areas 50* Nitrogen oxides 40 Sulfur dioxide 40 PM 10 15 PM 2.5 of direct PM 2.5 10 263 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 Pollutant Emissions Rate (tons per year) of SO 2, NO X, or VOC 40 Ozone Marginal and Moderate Nonattainment Areas 40 (of VOC or NO X) Serious and Severe Nonattainment Areas 25 (of VOC or NO X) Extreme Nonattainment Areas Any (of VOC or NO X) Lead 0.6 * The significant emission rate of 50 tons for carbon monoxide in serious nonattainment areas shall only apply if the Administrator has made a determination that stationary sources significantly contribute to the carbon monoxide levels in the area. (38) Significant emissions increase means, for a regulated NSR pollutant, an increase in emissions that is significant (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)) for that pollutant. (39) Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit a regulated NSR pollutant. (40) Volatile organic compounds (VOC) is as defined in Regulation 61 -62.1, Section (I), Definitions . (C)(1) Permitting requirements. If the Department finds that the major stationary source or major modificat ion would be constructed in an area designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as nonattainment for a pollutant for which the stationary source or modification is major, approval may be granted only if the following conditions are met: (a) The major stationary source or major modification is required to meet an emission limitation which specifies the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) for such source. (b) The applicant must certify that all existing major sources owned or operated by the applicant (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the applicant) in the same state as the proposed source are in compliance with all applic able emission limitations and standards under the Clean Air Act (or are in compliance with an expeditious schedule which is federally enforceable or contained in a court decree). (c) The owner or operator of the proposed new major stationary source or m ajor modification will obtain sufficient emission reductions of the nonattainment pollutant from other sources. Emission reductions shall be in effect and enforceable prior to the date the new source or modification commences operation. The emission reduct ions shall be obtained in accordance with the requirements in Section (D), Offset standards. (d) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in the affected area as determined by 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, Emission Offset Inter pretative Ruling . 264 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (e) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the e nvironmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification shall be required. (2) Exemptions. Temporary emission sources, such as pilot plants and portable facilities which will be relocated outside of the nonattainm ent area after a short period of time, are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (C)(1)(c) and (C)(1)(d) of this section. (3) Secondary emissions. Secondary emissions need not be considered in determining whether the stationary source or modification is major. However, if a source is subject to this regulation on the basis of the direct emissions from the source, the applicab le conditions in paragraph (C)(1) must also be met for secondary emissions. However, secondary emissions may be exempt from paragraphs (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) of this section. (4) The requirements of this regulation applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels that exceed the PM 10 ambien t standards in the area. (D) Offset standards. (1) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, and surplus; (2) Where the permitted emissions limit allows greater emissions than the potenti al to emit of the source (as when a state has a single particulate emission limit for all fuels), emissions offset credit will be allowed only for control below this potential; (3) For an existing fuel combustion source, credit shall be based on the allo wable emissions for the type of fuel being burned at the time the application to construct is filed. If the existing source commits to switch to a cleaner fuel at some future date, emissions offset credit based on the allowable (or actual) emissions for th e fuels involved is not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require the use of a specified alternative control measure which would achieve the same degree of emissions reduction should the source switch back to a dirtier fuel at some later date . (4) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or curtailing production or operating hours below baseline levels may be generally credited for offsets if the shutdown or curtailment occurred after the last day of the base year fo r the SIP planning process. For purposes of this paragraph, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demon stration explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. No credit may be given for shutdowns that occurred before August 7, 1977. (5) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing emissions unit or curtailing production or operating hours and that do not meet the requirements in paragraph (D)(4) may be generally credited only if: 265 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (a) The shutdown or curtailment occurred on or after the date the new source permit application is filed; or, (b) The applicant can establish that the proposed new source is a replacement for the shutdown or curtailed source, and the emission reductions achieved by the shutdown or curtailment met the requirements of paragraph (D)(4). (6) No emissions credit may be allowed for replacing one hydrocarbon compound with another of lesser reactivity, except for those compounds listed in Table 1 of EPA's \"Recommended Policy on Control of Volatile Organic Compounds\" (42 FR 35314, July 8, 1977); (7) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress. (8) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tons per year, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with Section 173 of the Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emi ssions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (B)(2)) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in paragraph (B)(1)) for each emissions unit. (9) If a designated nonattainment area is projected to be an attainment area as part of an approved SIP control strategy by the new source start -up date, offsets would not be required if the new source would not cause a new violation. (10) Any facility that has the potential to emit any NAAQS pollutant in an amount greater than five (5) tons per year and that is located in a federally -designated nonattainment area shall be eligible to create emission offsets. (11) Emission reductions shall have been created by an existing facility that has obtained an enforceable air quality permit or letter of permit cancellation resulting from the surrender of the source's permit(s). (12) Emission reductions may be created by any of, or a combination of, the following methods: (a) Installation of control equipment beyond what is necessary to comply with existing requirements; (b) A change in process inputs, formulations, products or product mix, fuels, or raw materials; (c) A reduction in actual emission rates; or (d) Any other enforceable method that the Department determines to resu lt in real, permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, and surplus reduction of emissions. (13) A completed emissions offset submittal must be received by the Department within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions. Emission off sets not requested within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions will be permanently retired. Prior to commencing operation of a permitted emissions unit, Department approval for the required emission offsets must be granted. 266 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (14) The following emission reductions that are not considered surplus, are ineligible for emission offsets: (a) Emission reductions that have previously been used to avoid Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or Regulatio n 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), through a netting demonstration; (b) Emission reductions of hazardous air pollutants, listed in Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, to the extent needed to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), and Regulation 61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories. However, emission reductions of hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC) and/or hazardous particulate matter (PM) air pollutants beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, NESHAP, and Regulation 61 -62.63, NESHAP for Source Categories, are considered surplus; (c) Emission reductions of ni trogen oxides (NO X), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM), and VOCs to the extent needed to comply with Section 111 of the Clean Air Act and Regulation 61 -62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) . However, emission reductions of NO X, SO 2, PM, and VOCs beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.60, S outh Carolina Designated Facility Plan and NSPS , are considered surplus; (d) Emission reductions from emission units covered under an agreement, order, or variance for exceeding an emission standard until compliance is demonstrated with the emission standard that is the subject of the agreement, order or variance; (e) Emission reductions from sources that have o perated less than twelve (12) months; (f) Emission reductions required in order to comply with any state or federal regulation not listed above, unless these reductions are in excess of the amount required by the state or federal regulation; and (g) Emission reductions from facilities that have received a Department transmittal letter with notification of permit cancellation due to the facility's decision to close out its operating permit without a request to qualify facility emission reductions as of fsets. (E) Calculation of Emission Offsets (1) The following procedure shall be used to calculate emission offsets: (a) The source shall calculate average annual actual emissions, in tons per year, before the emission reduction using data from the tw enty-four (24) -month period immediately preceding the reduction in emissions. With the Department's approval, the use of a different time period, not to exceed ten (10) years immediately preceding the reduction in emissions, may be allowed if the owner or operator of the source documents that such period is more representative of normal source operation, but not prior to the base year inventory date, which is the last day of the two (2) years preceding the date of nonattainment designation; and 267 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (b) The e mission offsets created shall be calculated by subtracting the allowable emissions following the reduction from the average annual actual emissions prior to the reduction. (2) For any emissions unit that has been operating for a consecutive period of at least twelve (12) months but less than twenty -four (24) months on the base year inventory date, based on the unit's potential to emit, emissions shall be calculated equal to the amount needed to complete a twenty -four (24) -month period on the base year inv entory date. (F) Location of offsetting emissions. Emission offsets shall be obtained from sources currently operating within the same designated nonattainment area as the new or modified stationary source. Emission offsets may be obtained from another no nattainment area with the Department's approval only if: (1) The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located, and (2) Emissions from the other area contribute to a violation of t he NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (G) Emission offsetting ratios . Emission offsets shall be required in nonattainment areas in accordance with the following provisions: (1) Emissions for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) nonattainment areas shall be offset at a ratio greater than one to one. (2) Emissions increases for ozone nonattainment areas shall be offset for volatile or ganic compounds (VOCs) and NO X in accordance with the following table: Designation Offset ratios Marginal 1.1 to 1 Moderate 1.15 to 1 Serious 1.2 to 1 Severe 1.3 to 1 Extreme 1.5 to 1 (H) Interpollutant offsetting. (1) In meeting the emissions offset requirements of Section (D) the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant unless interpollutant offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph. (a) The offset requirement(s) of Section (D) for emissions of the ozone precursors NO X and VOC may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of emissions of either of those precursors, if all other requirements for such offsets are also satisfied. (b) The offset r equirements of Section (D) for direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of precursors of PM 2.5 may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of any PM 2.5 268 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 precursor identified under paragraph (B)(32)(c) if such offsets comply w ith the interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio established in the approved plan for a particular nonattainment area. (2) The control requirements applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 shall also apply to major statio nary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 precursors in a PM 2.5 nonattainment area, except that the Department may exempt new major stationary sources and major modifications of a particular precursor from the requirements for PM 2.5 if the nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration submitted to and approved by the Administrator shows that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 2.5 levels that exceed the standard in the area. Any demonstration submitted for the Administrator 's review must meet the conditions for a nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration as set forth in 40 CFR 51.1006(a)(3). (I) Banking of emission offsets. For new sources obtaining permits by applying offsets after January 16, 1979, the Department may allo w offsets that exceed the requirement of reasonable progress toward attainment to be \"banked\" (i.e., saved to provide offsets for a source seeking a permit in the future) for future use. Likewise, the Department may allow the owner of an existing source th at reduces its own emissions to bank any resulting reductions beyond those required by the State Implementation Plan for future use. (J) [Reserved] (K) [Reserved] (L) Source obligation. (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after t he effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Department may extend the eighteen (18) -month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforcement limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modifica tion otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of regulations approved pursuant to this section 269 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification; (5) Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting. The following provisions apply with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragr aphs (B)(31)(b)(i) through (B)(31)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (a) If the project requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \" Permit Requirements, \" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the info rmation set out in paragraph (L)(5)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \" Permit Requirements, \" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (L)(5). (b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (i) A description of the project; (ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s ) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline ac tual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(31)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing e lectric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (L)(5)(b) to the reviewing authority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require th e owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the reviewing authority before beginning actual construction. (d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitted by any emissions units identified in paragraph (L)(5)(b)(ii); and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) years following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the p roject increases the design capacity or potential to emit of that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty (60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (L)(5)(b) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the year that preceded submission of the report. 270 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (f) If the unit is an existing unit other than a n electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (L)(5)(b), exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and m aintained pursuant to paragraph (L)(5)(b)(iii), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (B)(37)) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (L)(5)(b)(iii). Such report shall be submitted to the Department within sixty (60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (ii) The annual e missions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (L)(5)(d); and (iii) Any other information needed to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (6) A \"reasonable poss ibility\" under paragraph (L)(5) occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (a) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined u nder paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (b) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(31)( b)(iii), sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of this paragraph, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (L)(6)(a), then provisions (L)(5)(c) through (L)(5)(f) do not apply to the project. (7) The owner or operator of th e source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (L)(5) for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii). (M) Public participation. (1) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application to construct, or any addition to such application, the Department shall advise the applicant of any deficiency in the application or in the information submitted and tra nsmit a copy of such application to EPA. In the event of such a deficiency, the date of receipt of the application shall be, for the purpose of this regulation, the date on which the Department received all required information. (2) In accordance with Re gulation 61 -30, Environmental Protection Fees , the Department shall make a final determination on the application. This involves performing the following actions in a timely manner: (a) For the purposes of this section, the time frame for making a final determination shall be consistent with Regulation 61 -30, Environmental Protection Fees , paragraph (H)(2)(c)(iii). 271 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (b) Make a preliminary determination whether construction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. (c) Make a vailable in at least one location in each region in which the proposed facility or modification would be constructed a copy of all materials the applicant submitted, a copy of the preliminary determination and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered in making the preliminary determination. This requirement may be met by making these materials available at a physical location or on a public website identified by the Department. (d) Notify the public, by posting the notice, for the duratio n of the public comment period, on a public website identified by the Department. This consistent noticing method shall be used for all draft permits subject to notice under this section. The public website notice shall include a notice of public comment including notice of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment. The public websi te notice shall also include the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft permit, and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. The Department may use additional means to provide adequate n otice to the affected public, including by publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed (or in a state publication designed to give general public notice). (e) Send a copy of the notice of public comment to the applicant, the Administrator of EPA, and to officials and agencies having cognizance over the location where the proposed construction would occur as follows: The chief executives of the city and county where the facility or modification would be located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any State, Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the facility or modification. (f) Provi de opportunity for a public hearing for interested persons to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air quality impact of the facility or modification, alternatives to the facility or modification, the control technology required, and other app ropriate considerations. (g) Consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing(s) in making a final decision on the approvability of the application. No later than ten (10) days after the close of the public comment period, the applicant may submit a written response to any comments submitted by the public. The Department shall consider the applicant's response in making a final decision. The Department shall ma ke all comments available for public inspection in the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information relating to the proposed facility or modification. (h) Make a final determination whether constru ction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved pursuant to this section. (i) Notify the applicant in writing of the final determination and make such notification available for public inspection at the same location or on the same we bsite where the Department made available preconstruction information and public comments relating to the facility or modification. (j) Notify EPA of every action related to the consideration of the permit. 272 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (N) Actuals PALs . The provisions in paragraph s (N)(1) through (N)(15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability . (a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source (except as provided in paragraph (N)(1)(b)) if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (N)(1) through (N)(15). The term \"PAL\" shall mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout Section (N). (b) The Department shall not allow an actuals PAL for VOC or NO X for any major stationary source located in an extreme ozone nonattainment area. (c) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the r equirements in paragraphs (N)(1) through (N)(15), and complies with the PAL permit: (i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7.1, \" Nonattainment New Source Review \"; however, will be reviewed through Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \" Permit Requirements, \" and (iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (L)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used t o avoid applicability of the nonattainment major NSR program). (d) Except as provided under paragraph (N)(1)(c)(iii), a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limitations, and work pr actice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (N)(2)(a) through (N)(2)(k) shall apply to actuals PALs consistent with paragraphs (N)(1) through (N)(15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in Section (B) of this regulation; or in the Clean Air Act. (a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(3)) o f all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (B)(16) of this regulation) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (b) Allowable emissions means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in paragraph (B)(2) of this regulation, e xcept as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (N)(2)(b)(i) through (N)(2)(b)(ii). (i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on t he emissions unit's potential to emit. (ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in paragraph (B)(27), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" 273 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (c) Small emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (d) Major emissions unit means: (i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one -hundred (100) tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary s ource in Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit fifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year . (e) Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) means an emission limitation expressed in tons per year, for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source -wide in accordance with paragraphs (N) (1) through (N)(15). (f) PAL effective date generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit which is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and b egins to emit the PAL pollutant. (g) PAL effective period means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (h) PAL major modification means, notwithstanding paragraphs (B)(21) and (B)(24) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level eq ual to or greater than the PAL. (i) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1 Section II(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stat ionary source. (j) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (k) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equa l to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (N)(2)(d ). (3) Permit application requirements . As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: 274 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (a) A list of all emissions units at th e source designated as small, significant, or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limitations or work practices apply to e ach unit. (b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and mal function. (c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12) month rolling total for each month as requ ired by paragraph (N)(13)(a). (4) General requirements for establishing PALs . (a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (N)(4)(a)(i) through (N)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tons per year that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions fr om each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelve (12) month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary so urce owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participat ion requirements in paragraph (N)(5). (iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (N)(7). (iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential t o emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (N)(12) through (N)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (b) At no time (during or after the PAL effecti ve period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant, which occur during the PAL effective period, creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under Section (D) Offset standards unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions r eductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. 275 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (5) Public participation requirement for PALs . PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with Section M. This includes the requirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comments b efore taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10 -year actuals PAL level . (a) Except as provided in paragraph (N)(6)(b), the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (B)(3)) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (B)(37) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishi ng the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four (24) -month period may b e used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this twenty -four (24) -month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) in tons per year in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be req uired to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty (60) ppm NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (b) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four (24) -month period the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units. (7) Contents of the PAL permit . The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (N)(7)(a) through (N)(7)(j). (a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source -wide emission limitation in tons per year. (b) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration dat e of the PAL (PAL effective period). (c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (N)(10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not e xpire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunct ions. (e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (N)(9). 276 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12) month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (N)(13)(a). (g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (N)(12). (h) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (N)(13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (i) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragra ph (N)(14) by the required deadlines. (j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit . The requirements in paragraphs (N)(8)(a) and (N)(8)(b) app ly to actuals PALs. (a) PAL effective period . The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (b) Reopening of the PAL permit . (i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL. (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions r eductions for use as offsets under Section (D). (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (N)(11). (ii) The Department shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date. (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the Department may impose on the major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan. (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. 277 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (N)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (N)(5). (9) Expiration of a PAL . Any PAL which is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (N)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (N)(9)(a) through (N)(9)(e) shall a pply. (a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (N)(9)(a)(i) through (N)(9)(a)(ii ). (i) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (N)(10)(b), the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (N)(10)(e), such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions wil l be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limita tion on a twelve (12) month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), Continuous Emissions Rate Monitoring System (CERMS), Pred ictive Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS), or Continuous Parameter Monitoring System (CPMS) to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emis sions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (N)(9)(a)(i), the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, multi -unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (d) Any physical change or c hange in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to the nonattainment major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (B)(21). (e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had been estab lished pursuant to paragraph (L)(4), but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (N)(1)(c)(iii). (10) Renewal of a PAL . 278 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (N)(5) in approving any req uest to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department. (b) Application deadline . A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen (18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stat ionary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (c) Application requirements . The application to renew a PAL perm it shall contain the information required in paragraphs (N)(10)(c)(i) through (N)(10)(c)(iv). (i) The information required in paragraphs (N)(3)(a) through (N)(3)(c). (ii) A proposed PAL level. (iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emiss ions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (d) PAL adjustment . In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (N)(10)(d)(i) and (N)(10)(d)(ii). However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (N)(10)(d)(iii). (i) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (N)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (N)(10)(d)(ii); or (ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated econ omic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (N)(10)(d)(i) and (N)(10)(d)(ii ), (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (N)(11) (increasing a PAL). 279 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (N)(11)(a)(i) through (N)(11)(a)(iv). (i) The owner or operator of the major stationary source shall sub mit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the signi ficant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on eac h significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (N)(11)(a)(i), regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the nonattainment major NSR program process (for example, LAER), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus th e sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (N)(11)(a)(ii)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emi ssions units. (c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (N)(5). (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs . (a) General Requirements. 280 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1 (i) Each PAL permit must conta in enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. (ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (N)(12)(b)(i) through (N)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph ( N)(12)(a)(ii), you may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (N)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (b) Minimum Performance Requirements for Approved Monitoring Approaches.

GENERAL APPLICABILITY. This Standard is applicable to sources of toxic air pollutants as provided below. This Standard does not apply to fuel burning sources which burn only virgin fuel or specification used oil. The terms in this Standard are used as defined i n South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards Regulation 62.1, Section I, \"Definitions\". The effective date of this Standard is June 28, 1991. A. EXISTING SOURCES: (1) Any person with an existing source of any toxic air pollutant shal l be required to show compliance with this standard not later than two years after the effective date of this standard. These sources must provide the Department with the name and Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number of the chemical, stack parameters, an d emission rate data. If potential emissions of any single toxic air pollutant are 1000 lbs/month or greater an operating permit will be required. An operating permit may or may not be required for sources with emissions less than 1000 lbs/month. This det ermination will take into consideration, but not be limited to, the nature and amount of the pollutants, location, proximity to commercial establishments and residences. (2) Any person holding an operating permit prior to the effective date of this stand ard shall be required to demonstrate compliance with this standard for all toxic air pollutant emissions prior to renewal of the operating permit. The compliance demonstration must include all sources of toxic air pollutants at the facility, including sour ces not previously subject to permit requirements. Methods for compliance demonstration may be found in the Air Quality Modeling Guidelines as prepared pursuant to paragraph II(A) of this regulation. B. NEW SOURCES: Any person who constructs, alters, or adds to a source of toxic air pollutants after the effective date of this standard, shall comply with this standard. These sources must provide the Department with the name and Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number of the chemical, stack parameters, and emission rate data. If potential emissions of any single toxic air pollutant are 1000 lbs/month or greater a construction permit will be required. A permit may or may not be required for sources with emissions less than 1000 lbs/month; however, all sources are required to demonstrate compliance with this standard for all toxic emissions. This determination will take into consideration, but will not be limited to, the nature and amount of the pollutants, location, proximity to residences and commercial estab lishments. Methods for compliance demonstration may be found in the Air Quality Modeling Guidelines as prepared pursuant to paragraph II(A) of this regulation. C. This standard will not supersede any requirements imposed by Federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants nor any special permit conditions, unless this standard would impose a more restrictive emission limit. D. Facilities are exempt from the requirements of this standard as follows: (1) Affected sources that emit Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) (42 U.S.C. 112(b)) and are subject to one or more Federal Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards (42 U.S.C. 112(d), (g), (h), or (j)) are exempt. This exemption shall only apply to toxic air pollutants regulated by this standard 286 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 8 that are also federally regulated HAPs, except as provided below. This exemption shall apply once the emission sources are in compliance with a proposed or final MACT standard. Affected source, for the purpos es of this part, means the stationary source, the group of stationary sources, or the portion of a stationary source that is regulated by a relevant standard or other requirement established pursuant to Section 112 of the Act (42 U.S.C 7401 et seq.). Each relevant standard will define the \"affected source\" for the purposes of that standard. (2) Emission points that emit HAPs which are not exempt from this standard according to (1) above are granted an exemption once a federally required Residual Risk anal ysis (42 U.S.C. section 112(f)) that accounts for all facility -wide HAPs has been completed. Such emission points may be exempted prior to a Residual Risk analysis on a case -by-case basis after review by the Department. Exemptions may be granted in cases w here off -site impacts from HAP emissions are significantly below levels established by this standard (less than 50% of the standard).1 (3) Sources that emit toxic air pollutants regulated by this standard which are not federally regulated HAPs can reques t an exemption from this standard on a case -by-case basis after review by the Department. Exemptions may be granted in cases where non -HAP emissions are controlled (reduced) by MACT controls applied to reduce HAP emissions and in cases where off -site impac ts from non -HAP emissions are significantly below levels established by this standard (less than 50% of the standard).1 E. Additions and deletions to the list of Toxic Air Pollutants may be made following normal administrative procedures. II. TOXIC AIR E MISSIONS. A. The Department will prepare Air Quality Modeling Guidelines to provide assistance to facilities concerning compliance demonstrations and modeling issues. These guidelines may be updated periodically as new models and/or modeling procedures ar e developed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Detailed procedures for showing compliance with this standard may be found in the Air Quality Modeling Guidelines. Required modeling must use the latest versions of United States Environmental Protection Agency air dispersion models to determine the concentration of the toxic air pollutant in the ambient air at or beyond the plant property line, using 24 -hour averaging. B. The Bureau may provide modeling assistance to facilities that are designated as \"sm all business stationary source\" as defined in the Federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Sect. 507 (c)). However, the facility is still responsible for submitting the emission and facility data needed for the modeling analyses. Nothing in this section preclude s a facility from conducting its own modeling if desired by the facility. C. Changes in the following parameters will require a review by the facility to determine if they have an adverse impact on the compliance demonstration: __________________________ _ 1 If future construction/modifications cause off -site impacts to exceed 50% of the appropriate standard, the exemption is no longer valid. 287 | Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 8 (1) Decrease in stack height (2) Decrease in stack exit temperature (3) Increase in stack diameter (4) Decrease in stack exit velocity (5) Increase in building height or building additions at the facility (6) Increase in emission rates (7) Decrease in distance between stack and property line (8) Changes in stack orientation from vertical (9) Installati on of a rain cap that impedes vertical flow Exemptions to this requirement may be granted on a case -by-case basis. A revised compliance demonstration will not be required when air dispersion modeling software programs are updated. D. The air toxics, emi ssion rates, and other information used in the compliance determination will be listed in Attachment A -- Modeling Parameters Used in Compliance Determination of the construction and/or operating permit for the facility. Changes that increase maximum model ed concentrations may be administratively incorporated in these permits provided a compliance demonstration using these changes is submitted to the Department. Variations from the input parameters shall not constitute a violation unless the maximum allowa ble ambient concentrations identified in this standard are exceeded. E. The allowable ambient air concentrations of a toxic air pollutant beyond the plant property line as determined by modeling under Part A shall be limited to the value listed in the fol lowing table. The pollutants are divided into three categories based on chronic exposure as follows: Category 1: Low Toxicity - Those pollutants which cause readily reversible changes which disappear after exposure ends. Category 2: Moderate Toxicity - Those pollutants which may cause chronic reversible or irreversible changes that are not severe enough to result in death or permanent injury. Category 3: High Toxicity - Those pollutants which may cause chronic effects that result in death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities.

CONTROLS. If modeling by the source indicates that the maximum allowable concentration is exceeded, the Department may allow approved, site specific modeling/ambient monitoring on a case -by-case basis. If this approach does not demonstrate that the public health will be adequately protected, the source will be required to reduce emissions by implementing controls, altering the process, or limiting production. IV. SOURCE TEST REQUIREMENTS. The owner or operato r of all sources of toxic air pollutants shall conduct such tests as required by the Department to verify toxic air pollutant emission rates. An owner or operator shall ensure that source tests are conducted in compliance with the requirements of R.61 -62.1, Section IV, Source Tests. V. RECORDKEEPING. A. Copies of all records and reports required under this Standard shall be available for inspection by the Department during normal business hours and copies shall be provided to the Department within ten working days of receipt of a written request by the Department. B. Copies of all records and reports required under this Standard shall be maintained by the owner/operator for three years after the date on which the record was made or the report submitte d. 299 | Regulation 61 -62.6 May 24, 1985 457 9 5 December 28, 2012 (Errata) 457 36 12 December 27, 2013 4387 37 12 November 27, 2015 4577 39 11 61-62.6 Control of Fugitive Particulate Matter 300 | Regulation 61 -62.6 SECTION I - CONTROL OF FUGITIVE PARTICULATE MATTER IN NONATTAINMENT AREAS (A) No person shall cause or permit any fugitive particulate matter to go beyond property boundaries below a height of 150 feet. Necessary precautions shall be taken to prevent such occurrences and be in accordance with good dust control practices as determined by the Department taking into consideration economic reasonableness, the seriousness of the dust conditions, and anti cipated benefits; and may include but not be limited to the following: 1. Use, where possible, of water or chemicals for control of dust in demolition or construction operations, the grading of roads, or the clearing of land; 2. Application of asphalt (cut back asphalt is prohibited), water, or suitable chemicals on dirt roads, material stockpiles, and other surfaces which can give rise to airborne dust; 3. Installation and use of hoods, scrubbers, fabric filters or other dust cleaning devices where f easible and effective to capture and contain fugitive particulate matter while handling dusty materials. Adequate containment methods shall be employed during sandblasting or other similar operations; 4. The paving of roadways and the prompt removal of e arth or other materials from paved streets that have been deposited by vehicular traffic, earth moving equipment, water erosion, or other means; 5. Stabilization of long term storage piles by vegetation or appropriate chemicals and reclamation of mined a reas; 6. Modifying the process or materials handling system; 7. Use of a slurry to move material if feasible; 8. Use of traveling booms, telescopic chutes, rotary stackers, adequate shrouding of openings in containers to be filled; 9. Avoid use of front end loader in handling dry dusty materials unless there is no other reasonable option; 10. Impose strict slow speed limits for vehicular traffic on plant property or construction/destruction sites; 11. Ensure proper loading of trucks, trailers, front end loaders, etc., to prevent spillage on paved roadways. (B) No visible dust in excess of ten (10) percent opacity will be allowed to come from transfer points of any conveyor system for raw material or finished product unless the source owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that such control is not feasible. (C) No new source will be granted a permit to construct in a nonattainment area for primary standards if any part of materials handling of dry and dusty materia l is to be done with a front end loader, dump truck, or similar type handling which permits excessive dust to escape to the ambient air. 301 | Regulation 61 -62.6 SECTION II - CONTROL OF FUGITIVE PARTICULATE MATTER IN PROBLEM AREAS (A) For the purpose of this section, problem are as are defined as areas in which ambient levels of particulate matter are at or near primary standards; areas where an undesirable level of air pollution exists; areas in which excessive levels of fugitive particulate matter result in complaints from the g eneral public; areas in which fugitive particulate matter is determined to be impacting upon a nonattainment area. (B) No person shall cause or permit any fugitive particulate matter that can reasonably be controlled to escape into the ambient air. Such r easonable control shall be in accordance with recognized and generally accepted methods as determined by the Department and may include, but not be limited to, the following: 1. Restrictions as applicable and contained in Section I; 2. Enclosure of any dust generating process to prevent fugitive emissions/dust; and 3. Modification or reduction of materials handling to minimize the generation of dust. SECTION III - CONTROL OF FUGITIVE PARTICULATE MATTER STATEWIDE (A) Emissions of fugitive particulate matter shall be controlled in such a manner and to the degree that it does not create an undesirable level of air pollution. (B) Restrictions and requirements may be contained in operating permits on a case -by-case basis that are deemed approp riate and necessary to control fugitive particulate matter in accordance with reasonably available control technology. (C) No source shall use any method of materials handling which will generate fugitive particulate matter that is not fully described in the permit application. (D) Volatile organic compounds shall not be used for dust control purposes. Oil treatment is also prohibited. SECTION IV - EFFECTIVE DATE The effective date of this regulation is July 1, 1979. 302 | Regulation 61 -62.7 February 25, 1983 - 7 2 May 24, 1985 457 9 5 May 23, 1986 715 10 5 December 28, 2012 (Errata) 715 36 11 61-62.7 Good Engineering Practice Stack Height 303 | Regulation 61 -62.7 SECTION I. GENERAL The purpose of this regulation is to prevent the use of tall stacks or other dispersion techniques from affecting the emissions limitations required to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) or Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increments. This regulation does not, in any manner, restrict the actual physical stack height nor the actual use of dispersion tec hniques at any source. Rather, it sets limits on the maximum credit for stack height and other dispersion techniques which can be used in ambient air quality modeling for the purpose of setting an emission limitation and calculating the air quality impact of a source. Sources requiring modeling must use Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack height. Credit for dispersion techniques is prohibited. SECTION II. APPLICABILITY This regulation applies to all stacks excluding flares which were not \"in existence\" before December 31, 1970. The regulation also applies to stack heights or dispersion techniques at sources which were reconstructed or under major modification after December 31, 1970. SECTION III. DEFINITIONS AND CONDITIONS For the purpose of determining GEP stack heights and other parameters applicable to modeling, the following definitions and conditions apply. A. Stack \"In Exist ence\" - A stack on which the owner or operator had (1) begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of physical on -site construction or (2) entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations which could not be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator to undertake a program of construction to be completed in a reasonable time. B. \"Dispersion Technique\" 1. Any technique which attempts to affect the concentration of a pollutant in the ambient air by: a. Using that portion of a stack which exceeds GEP stack height; b. Varying the rate of emission of a pollutant acco rding to atmospheric conditions or ambient concentrations of that pollutant; or c. Increasing final exhaust gas plume rise by manipulating source process parameters, exhaust gas parameters, stack parameters, or combining exhaust gases from several exist ing stacks into one stack; or other selective handling of exhaust gas streams so as to increase the exhaust gas plume rise. 2. Paragraphs B.1.a, B.1.b, and B.1.c, above do not include: a. The reheating of a gas stream, following use of a pollution con trol system for the purpose of returning the gas to the temperature at which it was originally discharged from the source generating the gas stream; b. The merging of exhaust gas streams where: 304 | Regulation 61 -62.7 (i) The source owner or operator demonstrates that the process was originally designed and constructed with such merged gas streams; (ii) After July 8, 1985, such merging is part of a change in operation at the plant that includes the installation of pollution controls and is accompanied by a net reductio n in the allowable emissions of a pollutant. This exclusion from the definition of \"dispersion technique\" applies only to the emission limitation for the pollutant affected by such change in operation; or (iii) Before July 8, 1985, such merging was part of a change in operation at the plant that included the installation of emissions control equipment or was carried out for sound economic or engineering reasons. Where there was an increase in the emission limitation or, in the event that no emission limitation was in existence prior to the merging, an increase in the quantity of pollutants actually emitted prior to the merging, the Department shall presume that merging was significantly motivated by an intent to gain emissions credit for greater dispe rsion. Without a demonstration by the source owner or operator that merging was not significantly motivated by such intent, the Department shall deny credit for the effects of such merging in calculating the allowable emissions for the source; c. Smoke management in agricultural or silvicultural prescribed burning programs; d. Episodic restrictions on residential woodburning and open burning; or e. Techniques which increase final exhaust gas plume rise where the resulting allowable emissions of sulfur dioxide from the plant do not exceed 5,000 tons per year. C. \"Good Engineering Practice\" (GEP) Stack Height The greater of: 1. 65 meters, measured from the ground -level elevation at the base of the stack; 2. Hg = H + 1.5L, where: Hg = GEP stack height, measured from the ground -level elevation at the base of the stack H = height of nearby structure(s) measured from the ground -level elevation at the base of the stack L = lesser dimension, height, or projected width of nearby structure(s) The Department or EPA may require the use of a field study or fluid model to verify GEP stack height for the source; or 3. The height demonstrated by a fluid model or a field study approved by the Department and EPA which ensures that the emissions f rom a stack do not result in excessive concentrations of any air pollutant as a result of atmospheric downwash, wakes, or eddy effects created by the source itself, nearby structures or nearby terrain features. 305 | Regulation 61 -62.7 D. \"Nearby\" 1. For the purpose of applying the formula provided in paragraph C.2 above, nearby means that distance up to 5 times the lesser of the height or the width of a structure, but not greater than 0.8 kilometers (km) (1/2 mile); and 2. For conducting demonstrations under paragraph C.3 above, nearby means not greater than 0.8 km (1/2 mile), except that a portion of a terrain feature may be considered \"nearby\" when: a. At a distance of 0.8 km (1/2 mile) from the stack the height of the feature is at least 40 percent of the GEP (as determined by the formula in paragraph C.2 above) or 26 meters, whichever is greater; and b. The portion of the terrain feature must be within 10 times the maximum height of the feature, but not more than 2 miles, from the stack. All heights are meas ured from the ground -level elevation at the base of the stack. E. \"Excessive Concentration\" For the purpose of determining GEP stack height under paragraph C.3 above. 1. For sources seeking credit for stack height exceeding that established under para graph C.2 above, excessive concentration means a maximum ground -level concentration resulting from stack emissions which are due in whole or part to downwash, wakes, and eddy effects produced by nearby structures or nearby terrain features which are at lea st 40 percent in excess of the maximum concentration experienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy effects and which contribute to a total concentration due to emissions from all sources that are greater than an ambient air quality standard; 2. For sources seeking credit for stack height exceeding that established under paragraph C.2 above, and where such sources are subject to the PSD program, excessive concentration means a maximum ground - level concentration resulting from stack emissions which are due in whole or part to downwash, wakes, or eddy effects produced by nearby structures or nearby terrain features which are at least 40 percent in excess of the maximum concentration experienced in the absence of such downwash, wakes, or eddy eff ects and greater than a PSD increment; 3. The allowable emission rate to be used in making demonstrations under paragraphs E.1 or E.2 above shall be prescribed by the New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) that is applicable to the source category unless the owner or operator demonstrates that this emission rate is infeasible. Where such demonstrations are approved by the Department, an alternative emission rate shall be established in consultation with the source owner or operator; 4. For sources seeki ng credit after October 11, 1983, for increases in existing stack heights up to the heights established under paragraph C.2 above, excessive concentration means either: a.

(2) Based upon available information, as defined in this subpart, the MACT emission limitation and control technology (including any requirements under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) recommended by the applicant and approved by the Department shall achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAPs which can be achieved by utilizing those control technologies that can be identified from the available information, taking into consideration the costs of achieving such em ission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements associated with the emission reduction. (3) The applicant may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or a combinat ion thereof, and the Department may approve such a standard if the Department specifically determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission limitation under the criteria set forth in Section 112(h)(2) of the Act. (4) If the Administrator has either proposed a relevant emission standard pursuant to Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) of the Act or adopted a presumptive MACT determination for the source category which includes the constructed or reconstructed major source, then th e MACT requirements applied to the constructed or reconstructed major source shall have considered those MACT emission limitations and requirements of the proposed standard or presumptive MACT determination. (e) Application requirements for a case -by-case MACT determination. (1) An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under Title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other document specified by the Department under paragraph (c) of this section) sha ll specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. 366 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (2) In each instance where a constructed or reconstructed major source would require additional control technology or a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information: (i) The name and address (physical location) of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed; (ii) A brief description of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed and identification of any listed source category or categories in which it is included; (iii) The expected commencement date for the construction or reconstruction of the major source; (iv) The expected completion date for construction or reconstruction of the major source; (v) The anticipated date of start -up for the constructed or r econstructed major source; (vi) The HAP emitted by the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the estimated emission rate for each such HAP, to the extent this information is needed by the Department to determine MACT; (vii) Any federally enforceable emission limitations applicable to the constructed or reconstructed major source; (viii) The maximum and expected utilization of capacity of the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the associated uncontrolled emission rates for that source, to the extent this information is needed by the Department to determine MACT; (ix) The controlled emissions for the constructed or reconstructed major source in tpy at expected and maximum utilization of capacity, to the extent this info rmation is needed by the Department to determine MACT; (x) A recommended emission limitation for the constructed or reconstructed major source consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; (xi) The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency of the control technology (and the manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and relevan t specifications and drawings, if requested by the Department); (xii) Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis of cost and non -air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements for the selected control technology; and (xiii) Any other relevant information required pursuant to 40 CFR 63, Subpart A. (3) In each instance where the owner or operator contends that a co nstructed or reconstructed major source will be in compliance, upon startup, with case -by-case MACT under this subpart without a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information: (i) The i nformation described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(x) of this section; and 367 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (ii) Documentation of the control technology in place. (f) Administrative procedures for review of the Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The Department will notify the owner or operator in writing, within forty -five (45) days from the date the application is first received, as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required. (2) The Department will initiall y approve the recommended MACT emission limitation and other terms set forth in the application, or the Department will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intent to disapprove the application, within thirty (30) calendar days after the owner or operator is notified in writing that the application is complete. (3) The owner or operator may present, in writing, within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of notice of the Department's intent to disapprove the application, additional informatio n or arguments pertaining to, or amendments to, the application for consideration by the Department before it decides whether to finally disapprove the application. (4) The Department will either initially approve or issue a final disapproval of the app lication within ninety (90) days after it notifies the owner or operator of an intent to disapprove or within thirty (30) days after the date additional information is received from the owner or operator, whichever is earlier. (5) A final determination by the Department to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. If any application is finally disapproved, the owner or operator may submit a subsequent application concerning construction or reconstruction of the same major source, provided that the subsequent application has been amended in response to the stated grounds for the prior disapproval. (6) An initial decision to approve an application for a MACT determination will be set fo rth in the Notice of MACT Approval as described in paragraph (g) of this section. (g) Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The Notice of MACT Approval will contain a MACT emission limitation (or a MACT work practice standard if the Department determines it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard) to control the emissions of HAPs. The MACT emission limitation or standard will be determined by the Department and will conform to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of thi s section. (2) The Notice of MACT Approval will specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting, and record keeping requirements. The Notice of MACT Approval will include: (i) In addition to the MACT emission limitation or MACT work practice standard established under this subpart, additional emission limits, production limits, operational limits, or other terms and conditions necessary to ensure federal enforceability of the MACT emission limitation; (ii) Compliance certifications, testing, monitoring, reporting, and record keeping requirements that are consistent with the requirements of Regulation 61 -62.70.6(c); (iii) In accordance with Section 114(a)(3) of the Act, requirements for monito ring capable of 368 | Regulation 61 -62.63 demonstrating continuous compliance during the applicable reporting period. Such monitoring data shall be of sufficient quality to be used as a basis for enforcing all applicable requirements established under this subpart, including emissi on limitations; (iv) A statement requiring the owner or operator to comply with all applicable requirements contained in 40 CFR 63, Subpart A; (3) All provisions contained in the Notice of MACT Approval shall be federally enforceable upon the effec tive date of issuance of such notice, as provided by paragraph (j) of this section. (4) The Notice of MACT Approval shall expire if construction or reconstruction has not commenced within eighteen (18) months of issuance, unless the Department has grant ed an extension which shall not exceed an additional twelve (12) months. (h) Opportunity for public comment on the Notice of MACT Approval. (1) The Department will provide opportunity for public comment on the Notice of MACT Approval, including, at a m inimum: (i) Availability for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected of the information submitted by the owner or operator and of the Department's initial decision to approve the application; (ii) A 30 -day period for subm ittal of public comment; and (iii) A notice by prominent advertisement in the area affected of the location of the source information and initial decision specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. (2) At the discretion of the Department, th e Notice of MACT Approval setting forth the initial decision to approve the application may become final automatically at the end of the comment period if no adverse comments are received. If adverse comments are received, the Department will make any nece ssary revisions in its analysis and decide whether to finally approve the application within thirty (30) days after the end of the comment period. (i) EPA notification. The Department will send a copy of the final Notice of MACT Approval to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office, and to all other state and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in affected states. (j) Effective date of MACT determination shall be the date the Notice of MACT Approval becomes final. (k) Compliance date. On and after the date of start -up, a constructed or reconstructed major source which is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall be in compliance with all applicable requirements specified in the MACT determination. (l) Compliance with MACT determinations. (1) An owner or operator of a constructed or reconstructed major source that is subject to a MACT determination shall comply with all requirements in the final Notice of MACT Approval, including but not limited to, any MACT emission limitation or MACT work practice standard and any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. 369 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (2) An owner or operator of a constructed or reconstructed major source which has obtained a MACT determination shall be deemed to be in compliance with Section 112(g)(2)(B) of the Act only to the extent that the constructed or reconstructed major source is in compliance with all requirements set forth in the final Not ice of MACT Approval. Any violation of such requirements by the owner or operator shall be deemed by the Department and by EPA to be a violation of the prohibition on construction or reconstruction in Section 112(g)(2)(B) for whatever period the owner or o perator is determined to be in violation of such requirements, and shall subject the owner or operator to appropriate enforcement action under the Act. (m) Reporting to the Administrator. Within sixty (60) days of the issuance of a final Notice of MACT Approval, the Department will provide a copy of such notice to the Administrator, and will provide a summary in a compatible electronic format for inclusion in the MACT database. Section 63.44 - Requirements for Constructed or Reconstructed Major Sources Su bject to a Subsequently Promulgated MACT Standard or MACT Requirement. (a) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) of the Act or the Department issues a determination under Section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which would be deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart before the date that the owner or operator has obtained a final and legally effective MACT determinatio n under any of the review options available pursuant to Regulation 61 -62.63, Section 63.43, the owner or operator of the source(s) shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination rather than any MACT determination under Section 112(g) by the De partment, and the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard. (b) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) of the Act or the Departmen t makes a determination under Section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and has been subject to a prior case -by-case MACT de termination pursuant to Regulation 61-62.63, Section 63.43, and the owner or operator obtained a final and legally effective case -by-case MACT determination prior to the promulgation date of such emission standard, then the Department will (if the initial Part 70 permit has not yet been issued) issue an initial operating permit which incorporates the emission standard or determination, or will (if the initial Part 70 permit has been issued) revise the operating permit according to the reopening procedures i n Regulation 61 -62.70, or 40 CFR 70 or 71, whichever is relevant, to incorporate the emission standard or determination. (1) The EPA may include in the emission standard established under Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) of the Act a specific compliance date for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart and which have submitted the information required by Regulation 61-62.63, Section 63.43, to the Department before the close of the public commen t period for the standard established under Section 112(d) of the Act. Such date shall assure that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than eight (8) years after such standard is promulgated. In that event, the Department shall incorporate the applicable compliance date in the Part 70 operating permit. (2) If no compliance date has been established in the promulgated 112(d) or 112(h) Standard or Section 112(j) determination, for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart, then the Department shall establish a compliance date in the permit that assures that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard o r determination as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than eight (8) years after such standard is promulgated or a Section 112(j) determination is made. 370 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the Admin istrator promulgates an emission standard under Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) of the Act or the Department issues a determination under Section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a cons tructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and which is the subject of a prior case -by-case MACT determination pursuant to Regulation 61 -62.63, Section 63.43 of this subpart, and the level of control required by the emission standard issued u nder Section 112(d) or Section 112(h) or the determination issued under Section 112(j) of the Act is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation or standard in the prior MACT determination, the Department is not required to incorporate any less stringent terms of the promulgated standard in the Part 70 operating permit applicable to such source(s) and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the prior MACT determination to be applicable legal requireme nts when issuing or revising such an operating permit. Section 63.50 - Applicability (a) General applicability. (1) The requirements of this section through Section 63.56 implement Section 112(j) of the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990). The requirements of this section through Section 63.56 apply in each state beginning on the effective date of an approved Title V permit program in such state. The requirements of this section through Section 63.56 do not apply to research or laboratory activi ties as defined in Section 63.51. (2) The requirements of this section through Section 63.56 apply to: (i) The owner or operator of affected sources within a source category or subcategory under this part that are located at a major source that is subject to an approved Title V permit program and for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate emission standards by the Section 112(j) deadlines. If Title V applicability has been deferred for a source category, then Section 112(j) is not applica ble for sources in that category within that state, local, or tribal jurisdiction until those sources become subject to Title V permitting requirements; and (ii) Permitting authorities with an approved Title V permit program. (b) Relationship to stat e and local requirements. Nothing in Sections 63.50 through 63.56 shall prevent a state or local regulatory agency from imposing more stringent requirements, as a matter of state or local law, than those contained in Sections 63.50 through 63.56. (c) The procedures in Sections 63.50 through 63.56 apply for each affected source only after the Section 112(j) deadline for the source category or subcategory in question has passed, and only until such time as a generally applicable federal standard governing th at source has been promulgated under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act. Once a generally applicable federal standard governing that source has been promulgated, the owner or operator of the affected source and the permitting authority are not required to take any further actions to develop an equivalent emission limitation under Section 112(j) of the Act. (d) Any final equivalent emission limitation for an affected source which is issued by the permitting authority pursuant to Sections 63.50 through 63.5 6 prior to promulgation of a generally applicable federal standard governing that source under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act shall be deemed an applicable federal requirement adopted pursuant to Section 112(j) of the Act. Each such equivalent emissio n limitation shall take effect upon issuance of the permit containing that limitation under Section 112(j)(5) of the Act, and shall remain applicable to the source until such time as it may be revised or supplanted pursuant to the 371 | Regulation 61 -62.63 procedures established by Sections 63.50 through 63.56. Such a final equivalent emission limitation, and all associated requirements adopted pursuant to Section 63.52(f)(2), are directly enforceable under federal law regardless of whether or not any permit in which they may be con tained remains in effect. Section 63.51 - Definitions . Terms used in Sections 63.50 through 63.56 that are not defined in this section have the meaning given to them in the Act, or in Subpart A of this part. (a) \"Affected source\" means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is in a Section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard by the Section 112(j) deadline, an d that is addressed by an applicable MACT emission limitation established pursuant to this subpart. (b) \"Available information\" means, for purposes of conducting a MACT floor finding and identifying control technology options under this subpart, any infor mation that is available as of the date on which the first Part 2 MACT application is filed for a source in the relevant source category or subcategory in the state or jurisdiction; and, pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, is additional relevant information that can be expeditiously provided by the Administrator, is submitted by the applicant or others prior to or during the public comment period on the Section 112(j) equivalent emission limitation for that source, or information contained in the information sources in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this definition.

(d) \"Enhanced review\" means a review process c ontaining all administrative steps needed to ensure that the terms and conditions resulting from the review process can be incorporated using Title V permitting procedures. (e) \"Equivalent emission limitation\" means an emission limitation, established und er Section 112(j) of the Act, which is equivalent to the MACT standard that EPA would have promulgated under Section 112(d) or Section 112 (h) of the Act. (f) \"Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for existing sources\" means the emission limitation reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAPs (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, an d any non -air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies. This limitation shall not be less stringent than the MACT floor. (g) \"Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources\" means the emission limitation which is not less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the m aximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAPs (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non -air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies. (h) \"Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) floor\" means: (1) For existing sources: (i) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing twelve (12) percent of the existing sources in the United States (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within eighteen (18) months before the emissio n standard is proposed or within thirty (30) months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the source is not subject to such standard, with t he LAER (as defined in Section 171 of the Act) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory, for categories and subcategories of stationary sources with thirty (30) or more sources; or (ii) The average e mission limitation achieved by the best performing five (5) sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category or subcategory, for categories or subcategories with fewer than thirty (30) sources; (2) For new sources, the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. (i) \"New affected source\" means the collection of equipment, activities, or both, that if constructed after the issuance of a Section 112(j) permit fo r the source pursuant to Section 63.52, is subject to the applicable MACT emission limitation for new sources. Each permit must define the term \"new affected source,\" which 373 | Regulation 61 -62.63 will be the same as the \"affected source\" unless a different collection is warrante d based on consideration of factors including: (1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources; (2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment; (3) Flexibility to accommodate common control str ategies; (4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging; (5) Incentives for pollution prevention; (6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (for example, product recovery devices); (7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and (8) Other relevant factors. (j) \"Permitting authority\" means the permitting authority as defined in Part 70 of this chapter. (k) \"Research or laboratory activities\" means activities whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products where such activities are operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and are not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner; and where the source is not in a source category, specifically addressing research or laboratory activities, that is listed pursuant to Section 112(c)(7) of the Act. (l) \"Section 112(j) deadline\" means the date eighteen (18) months after the date for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated under this part, except that for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1994, the Section 112(j) deadline is No vember 15, 1996, and for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1997, the Section 112(j) deadline is December 15, 1999. (m) \"Similar source\" means that equipmen t or collection of equipment that, by virtue of its structure, operability, type of emissions, and volume and concentration of emissions, is substantially equivalent to the new affected source and employs control technology for control of emissions of HAPs that is practical for use on the new affected source. (n) \"Source category schedule for standards\" means the schedule for promulgating MACT standards issued pursuant to Section 112(e) of the Act. Section 63.52 - Approval Process for New and Existing Aff ected Sources. (a) Sources subject to Section 112(j) as of the Section 112(j) deadline. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section apply to major sources that include, as of the Section 112(j) deadline, one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable Section 112(j) deadline. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a Title V permit issued to the source pursuant to the requirements of the subpart, must apply to such sources. 374 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (1) The owner or operator must submit an application for a Title V permit or for a revision to an existing Title V permit or a pending Titl e V permit meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) by the Section 112(j) deadline if the owner or operator can reasonably determine that one or more sources at the major source belong in the category or subcategory subject to Section 112(j). (2) If an application was not submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and if notified by the permitting authority, the owner or operator must submit an application for a Title V permit or for a revision to an existing Title V permit or a pending Title V permit meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) within thirty (30) days after being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source belong to such category or subcategory. Permitting authorities are not req uired to make such notification. (3) The requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(ii) of this section apply when the owner or operator has obtained a Title V permit that incorporates a case -by-case MACT determination by the permitting authori ty under Section 112(g) or has submitted a Title V permit application for a revision that incorporates a case -by-case MACT determination under Section 112(g), but has not submitted an application for a Title V permit revision that addresses the emission li mitation requirements of Section 112(j). (i) When the owner or operator has a Title V permit that incorporates a case -by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under Section 112(g), the owner or operator must submit an application meetin g the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for a Title V permit revision within thirty (30) days of the Section 112(j) deadline or within thirty (30) days of being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source bel ong in such category or subcategory. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case -by-case MACT determination under Section 112 (g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to Section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopt ed to effectuate Section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate Section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission lim itations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j). The Title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the em ission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised Title V permit incorporating any additional Section 112(j) requirements. (ii) When the owner or operator has submitted a Ti tle V permit application that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under Section 112(g), but has not received the permit incorporating the Section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must continue to pursue a Title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of Section 112(g). Within thirty (30) days of issuance of that Title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for a change to th e existing Title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case -by-case MACT determination under Section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to Section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effe ctuate Section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate Section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations i n the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j). The Title V permit applicable to that source must be revised 375 | Regulation 61 -62.63 accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission lim itations to effectuate Section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised Title V permit incorporating any additional Section 112(j) requirements. (b) Sources that become subject to Section 112(j) after the Section 112(j) deadline and that do not have a Title V permit addressing Section 112(j) requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section apply to sources that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section on th e Section 112(j) deadline and are, therefore, not subject to Section 112(j) on that date, but where events occur subsequent to the Section 112(j) deadline that would bring the source under the requirements of this subpart, and the source does not have a Ti tle V permit that addresses the requirements of Section 112(j). (1) When one (1) or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to the requirements of this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source du e to the installation, and the installation does not invoke Section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) within thirty (30) days of startup of the source. This application shall be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a Title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources. (2) The requirements in this paragraph apply when one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source due to the installation, and the i nstallation does require emission limitations to be established and permitted under Section 112(g), and the owner or operator has not submitted an application for a Title V permit revision that addresses the emission limitation requirements of Section 112( j). In this case, the owner or operator must apply for and obtain a Title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of Section 112(g). Within thirty (30) days of issuance of that Title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an appli cation meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for a revision to the existing Title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case -by-case MACT determination under Section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to Section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting autho rity determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate Section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate Section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j). The Title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not re tain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised Title V permit incorporating any additional Section 112(j) require ments. (3) The owner or operator of an area source that, due to a relaxation in any federally enforceable emission limitation (such as a restriction on hours of operation), increases its potential to emit HAPs such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart, must submit an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for a Title V permit or for an application for a Title V permit revision within thirty (30) days after the date that such source becomes a major sourc e. This application must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a Title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of thi s subpart, must apply to such sources. (4) On or after April 5, 2002, if the Administrator establishes a lesser quantity emission rate under Section 112(a)(1) of the Act that results in an area source becoming a major source that is subject to this 376 | Regulation 61 -62.63 subp art, then the owner or operator of such a major source must submit an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for a Title V permit or for a change to an existing Title V permit or pending Title V permit on or before the date six (6) months after the date that such source becomes a major source. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a Title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources. (c) Sources that have a Title V permit addressing Section 112(j) requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply to major sources that include one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator fails to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable Section 112(j) deadline, and the owner or operator has a permit meeting the Section 112(j) requirements, and where changes occur at the major source to equipment, activities, or both, subsequent to the Section 112(j) deadline. (1) If the Title V permit already provides the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the Section 112(j) deadline, then the source m ust comply with the applicable new source MACT or existing source MACT requirements as specified in the permit, and the Section 112(j) requirements are thus satisfied. (2) If the Title V permit does not contain the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the Section 112(j) deadline, then the owner or operator must submit an application for a revision to the existing Title V permit that meets the requirements of Section 63.53(a). The ap plication must be submitted within thirty (30) days of beginning construction and must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a Title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources. (d) Requests for applicability determination or notice of MACT approval. (1) An owner or operator who is unsure of whether one or more sources at a ma jor source belong in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part may, on or before an applicable Section 112(j) deadline, request an applicability determination from the permitting aut hority by submitting an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) by the applicable deadlines specified in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section. (2) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this se ction, the owner or operator of a new affected source may submit an application for a Notice of MACT Approval before construction, pursuant to Section 63.54. (e) Permit application review. (1) Each owner or operator who is required to submit to the permitting authority a Part 1 MACT application which meets the requirements of Section 63.53(a) for one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to Section 112(j) must also submit to the p ermitting authority a timely Part 2 MACT application for the same sources which meets the requirements of Section 63.53(b). Each owner or operator shall submit the Part 2 MACT application for the sources in a particular category or subcategory no later than the applicable date specified in Table 1 to this subpart. The submission date specified in Table 1 to this subpart for Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing shall apply to sources in each of the source categories listed in Table 2 to this subpart. When the owner or operator is required by Sections 63.50 through 63.56 to submit an application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(a) by a date which is after the date for a Part 2 MACT application for sources in the category or subcategory in que stion established by Table 1 to this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit a Part 2 MACT application 377 | Regulation 61 -62.63 meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(b) within sixty (60) additional days after the applicable deadline for submission of the Part 1 MACT applic ation. Part 2 MACT applications must be reviewed by the permitting authority according to procedures established in Section 63.55. The resulting MACT determination must be incorporated into the source's Title V permit according to procedures established under Title V, and any other regulations approved under Title V in the jurisdiction in which the affected source is located. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may request either an applicability determination or a n equivalency determination by the permitting authority as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Each owner or operator who submitted a request for an applicability determination pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section on or before May 15, 2002, which remains pending before the permitting authority on May 30, 2003, and who still wishes to obtain such a determination, must resubmit that request by July 29, 2003, or by the date which is sixty (60) days after the Ad ministrator publishes in the Federal Register a proposed standard under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for the category or subcategory in question, whichever is later. Each request for an applicability determination which is resubmitted under this paragraph (e)(2)(i) must be supplemented to discuss the relation between the source(s) in question and the applicability provision in the proposed standard for the category or subcategory in question, and to explain why there may still be uncertainties that r equire a determination of applicability. The permitting authority must take action upon each properly resubmitted and supplemented request for an applicability determination within an additional sixty (60) days after the applicable deadline for the resubmi tted request. If the applicability determination is positive, the owner or operator must submit a Part 2 MACT application meeting the requirements of Section 63.53(b) by the date specified for the category or subcategory in question in Table 1 to this subp art. If the applicability determination is negative, then no further action by the owner or operator is necessary. (ii) As specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an owner or operator who has submitted an application meeting the requireme nts of Section 63.53(a) may request a determination by the permitting authority of whether emission limitations adopted pursuant to a prior case -by-case MACT determination under Section 112(g) that apply to one or more sources at a major source in a releva nt category or subcategory are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to Section 112(j) for the source in question. Such a request must be submitted by the date for the category or subcategory in question specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Any owner or operator who previously submitted such a request under a prior version of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) need not resubmit the request. Each request for an equivalency determination u nder this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), regardless of when it was submitted, will be construed in the alternative as a complete application for an equivalent emission limitation under Section 112(j). The process for determination by the permitting authority of whe ther the emission limitations in the prior case -by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under Section 112(j) must include the opportunity for full public, EP A, and affected state review prior to a final determination. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case - by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under Section 112(j), then the permitting authority must adopt the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate Section 112(j) for the source in question. If more than three (3) years remain on the current Title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application for a Title V permit revision to make any conforming changes in the permit required to adopt the existing emission limitations as the Section 112(j) MACT emission limita tions. If less than three (3) years remain on the current Title V permit, any required conforming changes must be made when the permit is renewed. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case - by-case MACT determina tion under Section 112(g) are not substantially as effective as the emission 378 | Regulation 61 -62.63 limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt for the source in question under Section 112(j), the permitting authority must make a new MACT determination and a dopt a Title V permit incorporating an appropriate equivalent emission limitation under Section 112(j). Such a determination constitutes final action for purposes of judicial review under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and corresponding state Title V program provisi ons. (3) Within sixty (60) days of submittal of the Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority must notify the owner or operator in writing whether the application is complete or incomplete. The Part 2 MACT application shall be deemed complete on the date it was submitted unless the permitting authority notifies the owner or operator in writing within sixty (60) days of the submittal that the Part 2 MACT application is incomplete. A Part 2 MACT application is complete if it is sufficient to begin processing the application for a Title V permit addressing Section 112(j) requirements. In the event that the permitting authority disapproves a permit application or determines that the application is incomplete, the owner or operator must revise and resu bmit the application to meet the objections of the permitting authority. The permitting authority must specify a reasonable period in which the owner or operator is required to remedy the deficiencies in the disapproved or incomplete application. This peri od may not exceed six (6) months from the date the owner or operator is first notified that the application has been disapproved or is incomplete. (4) Following submittal of a Part 1 or Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority may request addit ional information from the owner or operator. The owner or operator must respond to such requests in a timely manner. (5) If the owner or operator has submitted a timely and complete application as required by this section, any failure to have a Title V permit addressing Section 112(j) requirements shall not be a violation of Section 112(j), unless the delay in final action is due to the failure of the applicant to submit, in a timely manner, information required or requested to process the application. Once a complete application is submitted, the owner or operator shall not be in violation of the requirement to have a Title V permit addressing Section 112(j) requirements. (f) Permit content. The Title V permit must contain an equivalent emission limita tion (or limitations) for the relevant category or subcategory determined on a case -by-case basis by the permitting authority, or, if the applicable criteria in Subpart D of this part are met, the Title V permit may contain an alternative emission limitati on. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, early reductions made pursuant to Section 112(i)(5)(A) of the Act must be achieved not later than the date on which the relevant standard should have been promulgated according to the source category schedule for standards. (1) The Title V permit must contain an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to existing source MACT and an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to new source MACT for control of emissions of HAPs. The MACT emission standards or limitations must be determined by the permitting authority and must be based on the degree of emission reductions that can be achieved if the control technologies or work practices are installed, maintained, and operate d properly. The permit must also specify the affected source and the new affected source. If construction of a new affected source or reconstruction of an affected source commences after a Title V permit meeting the requirements of Section 112(j) has been issued for the source, the new source MACT compliance dates must apply. (2) The Title V permit must specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In developing the Tit le V permit, the permitting authority must consider and specify the appropriate provisions of Subpart A of this part. The Title V permit must also include the information in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(iii) of this section. (i) In addition to the MACT emission limitation required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, 379 | Regulation 61 -62.63 additional emission limits, production limits, operational limits, or other terms and conditions necessary to ensure practicable enforceability of the MACT emission limitation. (ii) Compliance certifications, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements that are consistent with requirements established pursuant to Title V and paragraph (h) of this section. (iii) Compliance dates by which the owner or oper ator must be in compliance with the MACT emission limitation and all other applicable terms and conditions of the permit. (A) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with the emission limit ation(s) by the date established in the source's Title V permit. In no case shall such compliance date be later than three (3) years after the issuance of the permit for that source, except where the permitting authority issues a permit that grants an addi tional year to comply in accordance with Section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, or unless otherwise specified in Section 112(i), or in Subpart D of this part. (B) The owner or operator of a new affected source, as defined in the Title V permit meeting the requirements of Section 112(j), that is subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with a new source MACT level of control immediately upon startup of the new affected source. (g) Permit issuance dates. The permitting authority must issue a Title V permit meeting Section 112(j) requirements within eighteen (18) months after submittal of the complete Part 2 MACT application. (h) Enhanced monitoring. In accordance with Section 114(a)(3) of the Act, monitoring shall be capable of demonstrating continuous compliance for each compliance period during the applicable reporting period. Such monitoring data shall be of sufficient quality to be used as a basi s for directly enforcing all applicable requirements established under this subpart, including emission limitations. (i) MACT emission limitations. (1) The owner or operator of affected sources subject to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to affected sources, including the compliance date for affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. (2) The owner or operator of new affected sources subje ct to paragraph (c)(1) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to new affected sources, including the compliance date for new affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Section 6 3.53 - Application Content for Case -by-Case MACT Determinations. (a) Part 1 MACT application. The Part 1 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section. (1) The name and address (physical location) of the major source. (2) A brief description of the major source and an id entification of the relevant source category. (3) An identification of the types of emission points belonging to the relevant source category. (4) An identification of any affected sources for which a Section 112(g) MACT determination has been made. 380 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (b) Part 2 MACT application. (1) In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may cross -reference specific information in any prior submission by the owner or operator to the permitting authority, but in cross - referencing such informat ion the owner or operator may not presume favorable action on any prior application or request which is still pending. In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may also cross -reference any part of a standard proposed by the Administrat or pursuant to Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for any category or subcategory which includes sources to which the Part 2 application applies. (2) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) t hrough (b)(2)(v) of this section. (i) For a new affected source, the anticipated date of startup of operation. (ii) Each emission point or group of emission points at the affected source which is part of a category or subcategory for which a Part 2 MACT application is required, and each of the HAPs emitted at those emission points. When the Administrator has proposed a standard pursuant to Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for a category or subcategory, such information may be limited to tho se emission points and HAPs which would be subject to control under the proposed standard. (iii) Any existing federal, state, or local limitations or requirements governing emissions of HAPs from those emission points which are part of a category or s ubcategory for which a Part 2 application is required. (iv) For each identified emission point or group of affected emission points, an identification of control technology in place. (v) Any additional emission data or other information specifica lly requested by the permitting authority. (3) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination may, but is not required to, contain the following information: (i) Recommended emission limitations for the affected source and support information consistent with Section 63.52(f). The owner or operator may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, as an emission limitation. (ii) A description of the control technologies that would be ap plied to meet the emission limitation including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency and any other information deemed appropriate by the permitting authority, and identification of the affected sources to which the control technologies must be applied. (iii) Relevant parameters to be monitored and frequency of monitoring to demonstrate continuous compliance with the MACT emission limitation over the applicable reporting period. Section 63.54 - Preconstruct ion Review Procedures for New Affected Sources. The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs a new affected source subject to Section 63.52(c)(1). The purpose of this section is to describe alternative review processes tha t the 381 | Regulation 61 -62.63 permitting authority may use to make a MACT determination for the new affected source. (a) Review process for new affected sources. (1) If the permitting authority requires an owner or operator to obtain or revise a Title V permit before construct ion of the new affected source, or when the owner or operator chooses to obtain or revise a Title V permit before construction, the owner or operator must follow the procedures established under the applicable Title V permit program before construction of the new affected source. (2) If an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a Title V permit before construction of the new affected source (and has not elected to do so), but the new affected source is covered by any preconstruction or pre operation review requirements established pursuant to Section 112(g) of the Act, then the owner or operator must comply with those requirements in order to ensure that the requirements of Section 112(j) and 112(g) are satisfied. If the new affected source is not covered by Section 112(g), the permitting authority, in its discretion, may issue a Notice of MACT Approval, or the equivalent, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, or an equivalent permit review process, before construction or operation of the new affected source. (3) Regardless of the review process, the MACT determination shall be consistent with the principles established in Section 63.55. The application for a Notice of MACT Approval or a Title V permit, permit modification, or administrative amendment, whichever is applicable, shall include the documentation required by Section 63.53. (b) Optional administrative procedures for preconstruction or preoperation review for new a ffected sources. The permitting authority may provide for an enhanced review of Section 112(j) MACT determinations for review procedures and compliance requirements equivalent to those set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. (1) The permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required. (2) The permitting authority will approve an applicant's proposed control technology, or the permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intention to disapprove a control technology. (3) The owner or operator may present in writing, within a time frame specified by the permitting authority, addit ional information, considerations, or amendments to the application before the permitting authority's issuance of a final disapproval. (4) The permitting authority will issue a preliminary approval or issue a disapproval of the application, taking into account additional information received from the owner or operator. (5) A determination to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. (6) Approval of an applicant's proposed control t echnology must be set forth in a Notice of MACT Approval (or the equivalent) as described in Section 63.52(f). (c) Opportunity for public comment on Notice of MACT Approval. The permitting authority will provide opportunity for public comment on the preli minary Notice of MACT Approval prior to issuance, including, at a minimum: 382 | Regulation 61 -62.63 (1) Availability for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected of the information submitted by the owner or operator and of the permitting authority's tenta tive determination; (2) A period for submittal of public comment of at least thirty (30) days; and (3) A notice by prominent advertisement in the area affected of the location of the source information and analysis specified in Section 63.52(f). The form and content of the notice must be substantially equivalent to that found in Section 70.7 of this chapter. (4) An opportunity for a public hearing, if one is requested. The permitting authority will give at least thirty (30) days notice in advance o f any hearing. (d) Review by the EPA and affected states. The permitting authority must send copies of the preliminary notice (in time for comment) and final notice required by paragraph (c) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Reg ional Office, and to all other state and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in affected states. The permitting authority must provide EPA with a review period for the final notice of at least forty -five (45) days and shall not issue a final Notice of MACT Approval until EPA objections are satisfied. (e) Compliance with MACT determinations. An owner or operator of a major source that is subject to a MACT determination must comply with notification, operation and maintenance, performanc e testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements established under Section 63.52(h), under Title V, and at the discretion of the permitting authority, under Subpart A of this part. The permitting authority must provide the EPA with the oppo rtunity to review compliance requirements for consistency with requirements established pursuant to Title V during the review period under paragraph (d) of this section. (f) Equivalency under Section 112(l). If a permitting authority requires preconstruct ion review for new source MACT determinations under this subpart, such requirement shall not necessitate a determination under Subpart E of this part. Section 63.55 - Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Determinations for Affected Sources Subject to Case -by-Case Determination of Equivalent Emission Limitations. (a) Requirements for permitting authorities. The permitting authority must determine whether the Section 63.53(a) Part 1 and Section 63.53(b) Part 2 MACT application is complete or an application for a Notice of MACT Approval is approvable. In either case, when the application is complete or approvable, the permitting authority must establish HAP emissions limitations equivalent to the limitations that would apply if an emission stan dard had been issued in a timely manner under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act. The permitting authority must establish these emissions limitations consistent with the following requirements and principles: (1) Emission limitations must be establishe d for the equipment and activities within the affected sources within a source category or subcategory for which the Section 112(j) deadline has passed. (2) Each emission limitation for an existing affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAPs (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non - air quality health and environmental impacts and ene rgy requirements, determines is achievable by affected sources in the category or subcategory for which the Section 112(j) deadline has passed. This limitation must not be less stringent than the MACT floor which must be established by the permitting autho rity according to the requirements of Section 112(d)(3)(A) and 112(d)(3)(B) and must be based upon available 383 | Regulation 61 -62.63 information. (3) Each emission limitation for a new affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAPs (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non -air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achiev able. This limitation must not be less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source which must be established by the permitting authority according to the requirements of Section 112(d)(3). This limitati on must be based upon available information. (4) The permitting authority must select a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, when it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an equivalent emission limitation due to the nature of the process or pollutant. It is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a limitation when the Administrator determines that HAPs cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to capture such pollutant, or that a ny requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with any federal, state, or local law, or the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological and economic limitations. (5) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent a state or local permitting authority from establishing an emission limitation more stringent than required by federal regulations. (b) Reporting to EPA. The owner or operator must submit additional copies of it s Part 1 and Part 2 MACT application for a Title V permit, permit revision, or Notice of MACT Approval, whichever is applicable, to the EPA at the same time the material is submitted to the permitting authority. Section 63.56 - Requirements for Case -by-Case Determination of Equivalent Emission Limitations After Promulgation of Subsequent MACT Standard. (a) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard that is applicable to one or more affected sources within a major source before the date a permit application under this paragraph (a) is approved, the Title V permit must contain the promulgated standard rather than the emission limitation determined under Section 63.52, and the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated sta ndard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard. (b) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act that is applicable to a source after the date a permit is issued pursuant to Section 63.5 2 or Section 63.54, the permitting authority must incorporate requirements of that standard in the Title V permit upon its next renewal. The permitting authority must establish a compliance date in the revised permit that assures that the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated standard within a reasonable time, but not longer than eight (8) years after such standard is promulgated or eight (8) years after the date by which the owner or operator was first required to comply with the emission limi tation established by the permit, whichever is earlier. However, in no event shall the period for compliance for existing sources be shorter than that provided for existing sources in the promulgated standard. (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of parag raph (a) or (b) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section shall apply. (1) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under Section 112(d) or 112(h) that is applicable to an affected source after the da te a permit application under this paragraph is approved under Section 63.52 or Section 63.54, the permitting authority is not required to change the emission limitation in the permit to reflect the promulgated standard if the permitting authority determin es that the level of control required by the emission limitation in the permit is substantially as effective as that required by the 384 | Regulation 61 -62.63 promulgated standard pursuant to Section 63.1(e). (2) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under Section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act that is applicable to an affected source after the date a permit application is approved under Section 63.52 or Section 63.54, and the level of control required by the promulgated standard is less stringent than the level of co ntrol required by any emission limitation in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent emission limitation of the promulgated standard in the Title V permit and may in its discretion consider a ny more stringent provisions of the MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such a Title V permit.

The total quantity shall be assumed to be involved in the vapor cloud explosion. (2) For flammable gases handled as refrig erated liquids at ambient pressure: (i) If the released substance is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of one centimeter or less, the owner or operator shall assume that the total quantity of the sub stance is released as a gas in 10 minutes, and the total quantity will be involved in the vapor cloud explosion. (ii) If the released substance is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 centimeter, the owner or ope rator may assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool. The volatilization rate (release rate) shall be calculated at the boiling point of the substance and at the conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

All Part 70 permits shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance: 512 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (1) Consist ent with Section 70.6(a)(3), compliance certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required by a Part 70 permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of Section 70.5(d). (2) Inspection and entry requirements that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permitte e shall allow the Department or an authorized representative to perform the following: (i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a Part 70 source is located or emissions -related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditi ons of the permit; (ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit; (iii) Inspect any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and (iv) As authorized by the Clean Air Act and/or the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with th e permit or applicable requirements. (3) A schedule of compliance consistent with Section 70.5(c)(8). (4) Progress reports consistent with an applicable schedule of compliance and Section 70.5(c)(8) to be submitted at least semi -annually, or at a more frequent period if specified in the applicable requirement or by the Department. Such progress reports shall contain the following: (i) Dates for achieving the activities, milestones, or compliance required in the schedule of compliance, and dates when such activities, milestones or compliance were achieved; and (ii) An explanation of why any dates in the schedule of compliance were not or will not be met, and any preventive or corrective measures adopted. (5) Requirement s for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices. Permits shall include each of the following: (i) A schedule for annual submission of compliance certificatio ns during the permit term, unless a more frequent schedule is specified in the applicable requirement or by the Department; (ii) In accordance with Section 70.6(a)(3), a means for monitoring the compliance of the source with its emissions limitations, standards, and work practices; (iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include all of the following (provided that the identification of applicable information may cross -reference the permit or previous reports, as applicable): (A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification; 513 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (B) The identification of the method(s) or other means used by the owner or operator for determining the compliance status with each term and condition duri ng the certification period. Such methods and other means shall include, at a minimum, the methods and means required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If necessary, the owner or operator also shall identify any other material information that must be included in the certification to comply with section 113(c)(2) of the Act, which prohibits knowingly making a false certification or omitting material information; (C) The status of compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit for the per iod covered by the certification, including whether compliance during the period was continuous or intermittent. The certification shall be based on the method or means designated in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The certification shall identi fy each deviation and take it into account in the compliance certification. The certification shall also identify as possible exceptions to compliance any periods during which compliance is required and in which an excursion or exceedance as defined under Part 64 of this chapter occurred; and (D) Such other facts as the permitting authority may require to determine the compliance status of the source. (iv) A requirement that all compliance certifications be submitted to the Administrator as well as t o the permitting authority. (6) Such other provisions as the Department may require. (d) General permits. (1) The Department may, after notice and opportunity for public participation provided under Section 70.7(h), issue a general permit covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all requirements applicable to other Part 70 permits and shall identify criteria by which sources may qualify for the general permit. To sources that qualify, the Department shall gran t the conditions and terms of the general permit. Notwithstanding the shield provisions of Section 70.6(f), the source shall be subject to enforcement action for operation without a Part 70 permit if the source is later determined not to qualify for the co nditions and terms of the general permit. General permits shall not be authorized for affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under Title IV of the Act. (2) Part 70 sources that would qualify for a general permit must apply to the Department for coverage under the terms of the general permit or must apply for a Part 70 perm it consistent with Section 70.5. The Department may, in the general permit, provide for applications which deviate from the req uirements of Section 70.5, provided that such applications meet the requirements of Title V of the Act, and include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit. Without repeating the public pa rticipation procedures required under Section 70.7(h), the Department may grant a source's request for authorization to operate under a general permit, but such a grant shall not be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review. (e) Temporary sour ces. The Department may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary and involve at least one change of location during the term of the permit. No sources subject to 514 | Regulation 61 -62.70 Title IV of the Clean Air Act shall be permitted as a temporary source. Permits for temporary sources shall include the following: (1) Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at all autho rized locations; (2) Requirements that the owner or operator notify the Department at least 10 days in advance of each change in location; and (3) Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this Section. (4) Such other conditions as the Department may require. (f) Permit shield. (1) The Department may expressly include in a Part 70 permit a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirements as of the da te of permit issuance, provided that: (i) Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically identified in the permit; or (ii) The Department, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof. (2) A Part 70 permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield. (3) Nothing in Section 70.6(f) or in any Part 70 permit shall alter or affect the following: (i) The provisions of Section 303 of the Act (emergency orders), including the authority of the Administrator under that Section; (ii) The liabili ty of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance; (iii) The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consis tent with Section 408(a) of the Act; or (iv) The ability of EPA to obtain information from a source pursuant to Section 114 of the Act. (4) The permit shield shall not apply to sources subject to Section s 70.7(e)(5) and 70.7(e)(2) and (3). (g) Emergency provision. (1) Definition. An \"emergency\" means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to excee d a technology -515 | Regulation 61 -62.70 based emission limitation under the permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative mai ntenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error. (2) Effect of an emergency. An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology -based emission limitations if the conditions of Section70 .6(g)(3) are met. (3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: (i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of t he emergency; (ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; (iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards, or other requirements in the permit; and (iv) The permittee shall submit verbal notification of the emergency to the Department within 24 hours of the time when emission limitations were exceeded, followed by written notification within 30 days. This notice fulf ills the requirement of Section 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B). This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken. (4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the oc currence of an emergency has the burden of proof. (5) This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement. 70.7 Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions. (a) Action on application. (1) A permit, permit modification, or renewal may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met: (i) The Department has received a complete application for a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete applicat ion need not be received before issuance of a general permit under Section70.6(d); (ii) Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under Sections 70.7(e)(2) and (3), the Department has complied with the requirements for public participation under Section 70.7(h); (iii) The Department has complied with the requirements for notifying and responding to affected States under Section 70.8(b); 516 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (iv) The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all applicable r equirements and the requirements of Part 70; and (v) The Administrator has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices required under Sections 70.8(a) and 70.8(b), and has not objected to issuance of the permit under Section 70.8(c) within the time period specified therein. (2) The Department shall take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit modification or renewal) within 18 months, after receiving a complete application. Exceptions to this schedule are provided in the initial transition plan required under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(11) or under regulations promulgated under Title IV or Title V of the Clean Air Act for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program. (3) RESERVED. (4) The Departme nt shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the Department requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 60 days of receipt of an application, the applicati on shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed through minor permit modification procedures, such as those in Section 70.7(e)(2) and (3), the Department will not require a completeness determination. (5) The Department shall provide a statement that sets forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions (including references to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions). The Department shall send this statement to EPA and to any other person who requests it. (6) The sub mittal of a complete application shall not affect the requirement that any source have a preconstruction permit under Title I of the Act. (b) Requirement for a permit. No Part 70 source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application, except in compliance with a permit issued under a Part 70 program. If a Part 70 source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a Part 70 permit is not a viol ation of this Part until the Department takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph Section 70.7(a)(4), and as required by Section 70.5(a)(2), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the Department any additional information identified as being needed to process the application. Exceptions to this section are provided in Section 70. 7(e)(5)(i) and Section 70.7(e)(2)(v) and (3)(v). (c) Permit renewal and expiration. (1) Renewal and expiration of permits (i) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected S tate and EPA review, that apply to initial permit issuance; and (ii) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with Section 70.5(a)(1)(iii), Section 70.5(a)( 2)(iv), and Section 517 | Regulation 61 -62.70 70.7(b). In this case, the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied. All the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to Section 70.6(f) shall remain i n effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied. (2) RESERVED. (d) Administrative permit amendments. (1) An \"administrative permit amendment\" is a permit revision that: (i) Corrects typographical errors; (ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source; (iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee; (iv) Allows for a change in o wnership or operational control of a source where the Department determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the Department; (v) Incorporates into the Part 70 permit the requirements from preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA -approved program, provided that such a program meets procedural r equirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of Sections 70.7 and 70.8 that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in Sect ion 70.6; or (vi) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined as part of the approved Part 70 program to be similar to those in Section 70.7(d)(1)(i) through (iv). (2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of t he acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated under Title IV of the Act. (3) An administrative permit amendment may be made by the Department consistent with the following: (i) The Department shall take no more than 60 days from receipt of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to the public or affected States provided that it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this paragraph. (ii) The Department shall submit a copy of the revised permit to the Administrator. (iii) The source may implement the changes addressed in the request for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the request, except transfer/ownership which must comply with Regulation 61-62.1 Section II.M. 518 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (4) The Department may, upon taking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in Section 70.6(f) for administrative permit amendments made pursuant to Section 70.7(d)(1)(v) which meet the relevant requirements of Sections 70.6, 70.7, and 70.8 for significant permit modifications. (e) Permit modification. A permit modification is any revision to a Part 70 permit that cannot be accomplished under the program's provisions for administrative permit amendments under Section 70.7(d). A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall b e governed by regulations promulgated under Title IV of the Act. (1) Program description. RESERVED. (2) Minor permit modification procedures. (i) Criteria. (A) Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications that: (1) Do not violate any applicable requirement; (2) Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit; (3) Do not require or change a case -by-case determination of an emis sion limitation or other standard, or a source -specific determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis; (4) Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition for which there is no correspondin g underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and conditions include: (A) A federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid class ification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the Act; and (B) An alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under Section 112(i)(5) of the Act; (5) Are not modifications under any provision of Title I of the Act; and (6) Are not required by the Department to be processed as a significant modification. (B) Notwithstanding Sections 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(3)(i), minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit modifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading, and other similar approaches, to the extent that such minor permit modification procedures are explicitly provided for in the South Carolina State Implementatio n Plan or in applicable requirements promulgated by EPA. 519 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (ii) Application. An application requesting the use of minor permit modification procedures shall meet the requirements of Section 70.5(c) and shall include the following: (A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs; (B) The source's suggested draft permit; (C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with Section 70.5(d), t hat the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of minor permit modification procedures and a request that such procedures be used; and (D) Completed forms for the Department to use to notify the Administrator and affected States as required u nder Section 70.8. (iii) Within five working days of receipt of a complete permit modification application, the Department shall meet its obligation under Sections 70.8(a)(1) and (b)(1) to notify the Administrator and affected States of the requested pe rmit modification. The Department promptly shall send any notice required under Section 70.8(b)(2) to the Administrator. (iv) Within 90 days of the Department's receipt of an application under minor permit modification procedures or 15 days after the en d of the Administrator's 45 -day review period under Section 70.8(c), whichever is later, the Department shall: (A) Issue the permit modification as proposed; (B) Deny the permit modification application; (C) Determine that the requested modific ation does not meet the minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the significant modification procedures; or (D) Revise the draft permit modification and transmit to the Administrator the new proposed permit modification as required by Section 70.8(a). (v) The Department may allow the source to make the change proposed in its minor permit modification application immediately after it files such application. After the source makes the change allowed by the p receding sentence, and until the Department takes any of the actions specified in Section 70.7(e)(2)(iv) (A) through (C) above, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existing permit terms an d conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it. (vi) The permit shield under Section 70.6(f) may not extend to minor permit modifications. 520 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (3) Group processing of minor permit modifications. Consistent with this paragraph, the Department may modify the procedure outlined in Section 70.7(e)(2) to process groups of a source's applications for certain modifications eligible for minor permit modification processing. (i) Criteria. Group processing of modifications may be used only for those permit modifications: (A) That meet the criteria for minor permit modification procedures under Section 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A); and (B) That collectively are below the threshold level approved by the Administrator as part of the Department's approved pr ogram. This threshold shall be 10 percent of the emissions allowed by the permit for the emissions unit for which the change is requested, 20 percent of the applicable definition of major source in Section 70.2, or 5 tpy, whichever is least. (ii) Applic ation. An application requesting the use of group processing procedures shall meet the requirements of Section 70.5(c) and shall include the following: (A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs. (B) The source's suggested draft permit. (C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with Section 70.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of group processing pro cedures and a request that such procedures be used. (D) A list of the source's other pending applications awaiting group processing, and a determination of whether the requested modification, aggregated with these other applications, equals or exceeds the threshold set under Section 70.7(e)(3)(i)(B). (E) Certification, consistent with Section 70.5(d), that the source has notified EPA of the proposed modification. Such notification need only contain a brief description of the requested modification. (F) Completed forms for the Department to use to notify the Administrator and affected States as required under Section 70.8. (iii) On a quarterly basis or within 5 business days of receipt of an application demonstrating that the aggregate of a source's pending applications equals or exceeds the threshold level set under Section 70.7(e)(3)(i)(B) of this Section, whichever is earlier, the Department promptly shall meet its obligation under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of Section 70. 8 to notify the Administrator and affected States of the requested permit modifications. The Department shall send any notice required under Section 70.8(b)(2) to the Administrator. (iv) The provisions of Section 70.7(e)(2)(iv) shall apply to modificat ions eligible for group processing, except that the Department shall take one of the actions specified in Section 70.7(e)(2)(iv)(A) through (D) within 180 days of receipt of the application or 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45 - day review peri od under Section 70.8(c), whichever is later. 521 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (v) The Department may allow the source to make the changes proposed for group processing in its minor permit modification application immediately after it files such application. After the source makes the changes allowed by the preceding sentence, and until the Department takes any of the actions specified in Section 70.7(e)(2)(iv)(A) through (C), the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the changes and the proposed permit term s and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existi ng permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it. (vi) The permit shield under Section 70.6(f) may not extend to minor permit modifications eligible for group processing. (4) Significant modification procedures. (i) Criteria. Significant modification procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit modifications that: (A) Involve a significant change in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions, or constitute a relaxation of reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions. (B) Require or change a case -by-case determination of an emission limitation or other standard, or a source -specific determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or visibility or increment analysis; (C) Seek to establish or change a permit term or condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and condit ions include: (1) A Federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I; (2) An alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under Section 112(i)(5) of t he Act; and (D) Are modifications under any provision of Title I of the Act, except those that qualify for processing as administrative permit amendments under Section 70.7(d). Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee, upon appropriate approval by the Department, from making changes consistent with this part that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant. (ii) Significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of this part, including those for applications, public participation, review by affected States, and review by EPA, as they apply to permit issuance and permit renewal. The Department shall complete review on the majority of significant permit modifications within 9 months afte r receipt of a complete application. 522 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (5) Operational Flexibility. A permitted facility is authorized to make changes within their facility without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of Title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions): Provided that the facility provides the Administrator and the Department with written notification as required below in advance of the proposed changes, which shall be a minimum of 7 days, unless the Department provides in its regulations a different time frame for emergencies. The source, Department, and EPA shall attach each such notice to their copy of the relevant permit. The following provisions implement this authorization: (i) The permitted sources are allowed to make Section 502(b)(10) changes without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of Title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions). (A) For each such change, the written notification required above shall include a br ief description of the change within the permitted facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable as a result of the change. (B) The permit shield described in S ection 70.6(f) of this part shall not apply to any change made pursuant to Section 70.7(e)(5)(i). (ii) The Department may provide for permitted sources to trade increases and decreases in emissions in the permitted facility, where the South Carolina Sta te Implementation Plan provides for such emissions trades without requiring a permit revision and based on the 7 -day notice prescribed in Section 70.7(e)(5). This provision is available in those cases where the permit does not already provide for such emi ssions trading. (A) Under Section 70.7(e)(5)(ii), the written notification required above shall include such information as may be required by the provision in the South Carolina State Implementation Plan authorizing the emissions trade, including at a minimum, when the proposed change will occur, a description of each such change, any change in emissions, the permit requirements with which the source will comply using the emissions trading provisions of the South Carolina State Implementation Plan, and the pollutants emitted subject to the emissions trade. The notice shall also refer to the provisions with which the source will comply in the South Carolina State Implementation Plan and that provide for the emissions trade. (B) The permit shield desc ribed in Section 70.6(f) of this part shall not extend to any change made under Section 70.7(e)(5)(ii). Compliance with the permit requirements that the source will meet using the emissions trade shall be determined according to requirements of the South C arolina State Implementation Plan authorizing the emissions trade. (iii) The Department shall, if a permit applicant requests it, issue permits that contain terms and conditions, including all terms required under Sections 70.6(a) and (c) to determine c ompliance, allowing for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally -enforceable emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable requirem ents. The permit applicant shall include in its application proposed replicable procedures and permit terms that ensure the emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable. The 523 | Regulation 61 -62.70 Department shall not be required to include in the emissions trading provisio ns any emissions units for which emissions are not quantifiable or for which there are no replicable procedures to enforce the emissions trades. The permit shall also require compliance with all applicable requirements. (A) Under Section 70.7(e)(5)(iii ), the written notification required above shall state when the change will occur and shall describe the changes in emissions that will result and how these increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the terms and conditions of the permit. (B) The permit shield described in Section 70.6(f) of this part may extend to terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions. (6) Off-Permit Changes. Except as provided in Section 70.7(e)(6)(v) below, a facility is allowed to make changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the permit without a permit revision. The provisions under this Section do not excuse any facility from the preconstruction permitting requirements under South Carolina Regulation No. 61 -62.1. Any such change shall be subject to the following requirements and restrictions: (i) Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and shall not violate any existing permit term or condition. (ii) Sources must provide contemporaneous wri tten notice to the Department and EPA of each such change, except for changes that qualify as insignificant under Section 70.5(c). Such written notice shall describe each such change, including the date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted, and any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change. (iii) The change shall not qualify for the shield under Section 70.6(f). (iv) The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at the source that result in emissions of a re gulated air pollutant subject to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes. (v) No permittee shall make, without a permit revision, a change that is not addressed or prohibite d by the facility's Part 70 permit, if such a change is subject to any requirements under Title IV of the Act or is a modification under any provision of Title I of the Act. (f) Reopening for cause. (1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specif ying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances: (i) Additional applicable requirements under the Act become applicable t o a major Part 70 source with a remaining permit term of 3 or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than 18 months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its terms and conditions has been extended pursuant to Section 70.7(c)(1)(ii). 524 | Regulation 61 -62.70 (ii) Additional requirements (including excess emissions requirements) becom e applicable to an affected source under the acid rain program. Upon approval by the Administrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit. (iii) The Department or EPA determines that the permit contains a mater ial mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit. (iv) The Administrator or the Department determines that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the applicable requirements. (2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists. Such reopening shall be made as expeditiously as practicable. (3) Reopenings under Section 70.7(f)(1) shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the Part 70 source by the Department at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the Department may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency. (g) Reopenings for cause by EPA. (1) If the Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to S ection 70.7(f), the Administrator will notify the Department and the permittee of such finding in writing. (2) The Department shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notification, forward to EPA a proposed determination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate. The Administrator may extend this 90 -day period for an additional 90 days if he finds that a new or revised permit application is necessary or that the Department must require the permittee to sub mit additional information. (3) The Administrator will review the proposed determination from the Department within 90 days of receipt. (4) The Department shall have 90 days from receipt of an EPA objection to resolve any objection that EPA makes and t o terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the Administrator's objection. (5) If the Department fails to submit a proposed determination pursuant to Section 70.7(g)(2) or fails to resolve any objection pursuant to Section 70 .7(g)(4), the Administrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after taking the following actions: (i) Providing at least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any such action.
