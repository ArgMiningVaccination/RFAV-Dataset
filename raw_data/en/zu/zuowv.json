Author's personal copy Commentary Opioids for chronic pain in patients with substance abuse: Too much, too little or just right? Over the past two decades, opioid analgesic prescriptions for chronic noncancer pain have increased [12]. Medical literature supporting this practice began in the 1980s [13], followed by aggressive marketing of ''safe\" sustained-released opioids to pri- mary care physicians. Increases in opioid prescribing continued de- spite lack of strong evidence supporting this practice [9]and subsequent increases in rates of opioid misuse including addictionand overdose [3,16,17] . The paper by Weisner et al. conrms this dramatic increase in long-term opioid analgesic prescribing over an eight year period in two large health plans representing community practices. Importantly, they found that patients with a prior substance abuse history were about 4 times more often prescribed opioids than those without a substance abuse history. This prevalence increased by 7-8 times for patients with an opioid use disorder with over half of these patients prescribed opioids. Patients with a substance abuse history were prescribed opioids with higher potency and at higher dosages. They were also twice as likely to be concurrently prescribed sedative hypnotics. Of concern is the assertion by the authors that primary care physicians prescribing opioids may not have been aware of their patient's substance abuse history. Often these diagnoses were made in mental health and substance abuse treatment settings where restrictive privacy regulations prevent full communication of these diagnoses with primary care physi- cians. These ndings are concerning in light of observational stud- ies that have found that a substance abuse history signicantly increases the risk for prescription opioid misuse [11]. This paper adds a great deal to our understanding of the magnitude of high-risk opioid prescribing by community-based physicians. It is unlikely that all patients with a history of substance abuse share the same level of risk for prescription opioid misuse. A limi-tation of this study is the inability to differentiate between patients who are in stable recovery from their substance abuse from those who are not. For patients in recovery, relapse prevention theories would suggest that unrelieved pain is more likely to trigger relapse than adequate analgesia. For patients with active substance abuse, the potential risks i.e. prescription opioid abuse and/or diversion, may outweigh any potential benets. Guidelines state that patients who are ''actively using illicit drugs\" should be treated in ''highly controlled and specialized settings\" and co-managed with an addiction expert [4]. Unfortunately addiction experts are not read- ily available to most primary care physicians and when available,their level of expertise and interest in managing patients with chronic pain is highly variable. So what is the correct prevalence of opioid prescribing for the management of chronic pain in patients with a history of substance abuse? This is obviously a controversial and contentious issue asexemplied by a survey of state medical boards where the majorityof respondents did not consider the use of long-term opioid anal- gesics in patients with substance abuse to fall within the scope of acceptable medical practice [6]. This question is particularly per- tinent since chronic pain and substance abuse can be related phe-nomena. Over forty years ago, Martin and Inglis [10] observed that patients with opioid addiction self-medicate ''an abnormally lowtolerance for painful stimuli\". The presence of one condition seems to influence the expression of the other. Savage and Schofferman [15] found that persons with addiction and pain have a ''syndrome of pain facilitation.\" Their pain experience is worsened by with-drawal-related sympathetic nervous system arousal, sleep distur- bances, and affective changes, all consequences of addictive disease. Supporting a negative effect of addiction on pain tolerance, patients who abuse stimulants and those who abuse opioids have been shown to be less tolerant of pain than their peers in remission [5]. Studies have consistently found that patients with substance abuse histories have an unusually high prevalence of chronic pain[14] and are more likely to have their pain under-treated [1]. This under-treatment has been reported as a reason for initiating andcontinuing illicit drug use [8]. While opioids are not indicated or effective for all chronic pain, it is unlikely that pain in patients withsubstance abuse is any less opioid responsive than pain in patients without a history substance abuse. Universally withholding opioid analgesics as well as ignoring their risks in patients with substance abuse would constitute poor clinical care. Although this study raises concerns about opioid over-prescrib- ing in high risk patients, we do not know what is happening behind the scenes. Are opioids being started appropriately and continued based on improved clinical outcomes? Are patients being closely monitored for signs of prescription opioid misuse or abuse? Pain and addiction society guidelines [4]recommend performing a careful initial assessment including screening for unhealthy sub-stance use. Historically substance use screening tools have been lengthy and impractical for primary care physicians however shorter screening [2]instruments are available. Also recommended are the use of controlled substance agreements to inform patientsabout the expected benets and risks of opioids, and that treat- ment goals include close monitoring for improved function and any addictive behaviors. Because the consequences of opioid anal- gesic misuse are so serious and because the true risk cannot be reli- ably predicted, it has been suggested that physicians utilize ''universal precautions\" when starting and maintaining patients on opioids [7]. That is, monitoring all patients as if they all have the potential for developing prescription opioid abuse. Because of the uncertain benets of using long-term opioids for managing chronic pain especially in patients with substance abuse 0304-3959/$36.00 /C2112009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Implementation of these guidelines will not be easy as they will require system changes including developing specic policies and procedures for universally screening and assessing for substance use disorders, using patient agreements and monitoring for benets and risks. Physician educational initia- tives must address when and how to use opioids safely and when and how to discontinue opioids when there is lack of benet and/or apparent harm. Finally, primary care physicians must learn communication skills for discussing opioid misuse and abuse with patients. Because these discussions are potentially uncomfortable, they are often delayed, addressed poorly or never addressed at all.

BACKGROUND: Education about substance use (SU) disorders remains inadequate in medical training. OBJECTIVE: To describe the Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) program in addiction medicine and to evaluate its impact on chief resident (CR) physicians ' substance use knowledge, skills, clinical practice, and teaching. DESIGN: A controlled educational study of CRIT pro- grams (2003, 2004, and 2005) for incoming CRs ingeneralist disciplines. Intervention CRs were trained to diagnose, manage, and teach about SU. The control CRs sought but did not receive the intervention. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six CR applicants to the CRIT program. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline and 6-month question- naires assessing substance use knowledge, skills, clin-ical practice, and teaching. Outcomes were comparedwithin groups from baseline to follow-up and between groups at follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention (n=64) and control (n=22) CRs were similar demographically. At 6-month follow- up, the intervention CRs reported a significant increase in SU knowledge, confidence, and preparedness todiagnose, manage, and teach and an increase in SUclinical and teaching practices compared to their base- line and control CRs. CONCLUSIONS: This intensive training for chief resi- dents (CRs) improved knowledge, confidence, and pre- paredness to diagnose, manage, and teach about substance use (SU), affecting both the CRs 'SU clinical and teaching practices. The CRIT program was aneffective model for dissemination of SU knowledge and skills to educators in a key position to share this training with a broader audience of medical trainees.This model holds potential to address other high priority medical, yet under-addressed, content areasas well.

Chief residents (CRs) play a key role in training future physicians.36Not only is their teaching central to medical education,37,38but CRs often become change agents in future leadership roles.39Despite these pivotal roles, published efforts to advance medical training by capitalizing on the CRs role are rare. A training effort in SU that has influentialmedical educators and leaders, such as CRs, as its targetaudience has enormous potential to integrate SU clinical training into medical curricula and practice. 36,40 The Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) program sought to provide incoming generalist CRs with the scientific foundation of addiction medicine and state-of-the-art sub- stance use (SU) diagnosis and management skills, in order tofacilitate integration of SU content into residency program curricula and CR teaching. METHODS Study Design and Subjects This study is a controlled educational evaluation of applicants to the 4-day annual CRIT program in Addiction Medicine from 2003 -2005. The programs were advertised at http://www. bumc.bu.edu/CARE and by mailings to generalist residency training program directors and professional organizations. All applicants had accepted CR positions for the following aca- demic year in internal medicine, family medicine, or emergencymedicine, with priority given to outstanding candidates who (1) demonstrated the presence of a supportive faculty member to assist in promoting the teaching of substance use (SU) and (2)would have dedicated time for teaching during their CR year.Due to resource limitations, enrollment was limited to no more than 22 attendees per year based on their application, which included a curriculum vitae, personal statement, and letter ofrecommendation. The intervention group consisted of CRIT program attendees, while the control group consisted of applicants who were either not accepted or accepted butunable to attend. This study was approved by the Boston Medical Center Institutional Review Board. CRIT Program Description The CRIT program curriculum was developed by national experts in physician SU education. After the first year in2002, the curriculum was modified based on attendees ' evaluations and an independent evaluator-led attendee focus group. Subsequent program evaluations gave feedback tofaculty, resulting in minor teaching and programmatic mod- ifications. The CRIT program was held at a conference center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Curriculum and Faculty. The CRIT curriculum (see Appendix A) utilized principles of adult and experiential learning and provided an in-depth evidence-based synthesis of major advances in the field of addiction medicine. The curriculumincluded a keynote address on the science of addiction, by a National Institute on Drug Abuse senior scientist. CRIT faculty, all with addiction and medical education expertise,role modeled teaching methods, including didactic case-based presentations, small group discussions, journal clubs, role plays, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and smallgroup conversations with individuals in recovery. Both the AA meeting visits and session with individuals in recovery were preceded by an orientation describing the learning objectivesand followed by a debriefing session emphasizing the use of these curricular elements in teaching physician trainees. The use of experiential learning a nd specifically AA meeting visits 41,42are curricular elements that have been used successfully in physician training. Attendees received SU resources and teaching tools, including slide presentations, case studies for small group work, instructions and roledescriptions for skill practice exercises, up-to-date medical literature, and important SU websites. The program also included instruction on teaching skills, including small groupinstruction, giving feedback, teaching reluctant learners, and ways to integrate SU issues into teaching. Substance Use Teaching Project. The CRIT curriculum included the development of a SU teaching project toenhance transfer of learning from the CRIT setting to the CRs 'work setting. Prior to arrival, CR attendees were asked to discuss possible SU teaching projects with their residencyprogram director and a faculty mentor, giving consideration to residency program needs and CRs 'interests. The CRs explicitly stated project goals, objectives, implementation methods,potential resources and barriers, a timeline, and outcomes using a worksheet (see Appendix B). CRs met with CRIT faculty to further develop an achievable project. To encourageinstitutional support, a copy of the teaching project was sent to the CR 's mentor and residency program director. Assessments The outcome evaluation comparing the intervention and control CRs consisted of self-assessment questionnaires com-pleted at the time of the CRIT application (baseline) and 6- months after the CRIT program (follow-up). The majority of questions used five-point Likert-type scales based on work byD'Onofrio et al. 43CRs were asked to rate their knowledge, skills, and confidence ( \"not at all \"to\"very \") and specific clinical and teaching practices ( \"never \"to\"always \"). In addition, the intervention CRs completed a pre- and post-CRIT multiple-choice knowledge exam at the training based on didactic session content and an 11-month questionnaire about SU teaching project implementation and impact. The baseline, 6-,and 11-month follow-up questionnaires were administered via e-mail, and the pre- and post-CRIT knowledge exams were completed at the CRIT course. All were returned to the CRITindependent evaluator. Intervention CRs received a gift worth approximately $10, and control CRs received a $50 honorar- ium after completing the follow-up questionnaires. CRs usedunique IDs for assessments to assure confidentiality. Outcomes Substance Use Clinical Knowledge, Skills, and Practice. Multiple outcomes measured CRs knowledge, confidence, and self-reported SU clinical practices. The baseline and 6-monthquestionnaires assessed self-reported clinical knowledge and41 Alford et Immersion Training (CRIT) Program JGIMskills (SU neurobiology, screening, readiness to change assessment, referral options, pharmacotherapy, and relapse) and self-reported clinical confidence and practice (confidencein diagnosing SU problems and frequency of using screening tools with new patients, counseling drug and alcohol using patients, and referring drug- and alcohol-dependent patientsfor specialty treatment). A multiple-choice knowledge exam was administered to attendees immediately before and after the program. Substance Use Teaching Skills and Practice. Teaching outcomes included self-reported responsibility for, confidence in, and frequency of teaching about SU. Additionally, CRs were asked how prepared they felt to teach about SU compared toother chronic medical conditions (i.e., congestive heart failure and dementia). For the intervention CRs 'SU teaching project, outcomes included type of teaching activity, impact on residencyprogram curriculum, and implementation facilitators and barriers. Statistical Analysis Baseline comparison of the intervention and control groups was performed using chi-square and t-tests, as appropriate,for analysis of the demographic variables (Table 1). The differences in self-reported knowledge, skills, and practice from baseline to 6-month follow-up were compared withineach group using the paired t-test procedure (Table 2). Differ- ences between group medians for outcomes at 6 months wereexamined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A two-sided p- value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mean scores of the intervention group multiple-choice knowledgeexams for attendees were compared. RESULTS Eighty-six chief resident (CR) applicants to the CRIT program(2003 -2005) were assessed; 64 attended CRIT (intervention group), and 22 did not (control group). Of the control group, six had been accepted to the program. The baseline character- istics of the intervention and control groups were similar(Table 1). Applicants represented 56 different residency pro- grams (87% internal medicine, 7% family medicine, and 6% emergency medicine) from 23 states. All intervention andcontrol CRs completed the baseline assessment; 6-month follow-up and 86% (19/22) for the inter- vention and control groups, respectively. All of the interventionCRs completed the pre- and post-CRIT multiple-choice knowl-edge exams. All intervention CRs developed a SU teaching project, and 98% (63/64) completed the 11-month follow-up questionnaire. Substance Use Clinical Knowledge, Skills, and Practice (Table 2) The intervention CRs showed significant improvement (p< 0.001) at 6-month follow-up compared to baseline assessmentin self-reported knowledge on SU neurobiology, screening, readiness to change assessment, referral options, pharmaco- therapy, and relapse. Similarly, they had increased confidence(p<0.05) in diagnosing SU problems and more frequently used a SU screening tool with new patients, counseled drug and alcohol using patients, and referred drug-dependent patientsto treatment. The control CRs improved in some outcomes from baseline to follow-up. When comparing the intervention group and the control group medians at 6-month follow-up,the intervention group displayed statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement in self-reported knowledge of SU neurobi- ology, screening, referral options, pharmacotherapy, and re- lapse, as well as confidence in diagnosing SU problems andfrequency of using a SU screening tool with new patients. The mean pre- and post-CRIT multiple-choice knowledge exam scores for the intervention CRs were 67% and 78% answerscorrect, respectively (p<0.001). Substance Use Teaching Skills and Practice (Table 2) The intervention CRs showed significant improvement (p< 0.001) at 6-month follow-up compared to baseline in confi- dence in incorporating SU into teaching, making presentationson SU issues, and incorporating SU information into residents ' curriculum. The frequency of covering alcohol and drug abuse in teaching similarly improved. Differences between the inter-vention group and the control group medians at 6-month follow-up were also significant (p<0.05) for those outcomes, with the exception of frequency of covering drug abuse. Atbaseline, both groups reported high levels of feeling responsi-ble for teaching about SU. While the intervention CRs had noTable 1 .

Almost all (97%) of intervention CRs reported being \"more \"or\"much more \"likely to incorporate SU content into their teaching as a result of their CRITtraining. When reporting their preparedness to teach about SU and other chronic conditions (i.e., congestive heart failure, dementia), the intervention group showed significant improve-ment (p<0.05) at follow-up in their preparedness to teachabout alcohol abuse as compared to the control group (Fig. 1). Substance Use Teaching Project All intervention CRs developed a SU teaching project. At 11- month follow-up, 86% (56/64) reported that their teachingproject had an impact on their residency program curriculum. Examples of the SU teaching projects included new or expanded SU curriculum (n=21), new SU lecture or teachingactivity (n=33), and SU screening protocols (n=16). Two CRs published an assessment of the impact of their SU teaching project, one included taking residents and medical students toan Alcoholics Anonymous meeting 42and the other the successful implementation of an \"Educational Half Day \" focusing on SU.44CRs identified cooperative residency pro- gram staff and support from a mentor as the top twofacilitators in helping to achieve their SU teaching project, while the top two barriers were time constraints and competingpriorities. DISCUSSION The Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) program inaddiction medicine effectively transferred evidence-based SUknowledge and practice to 64 CRs in generalist disciplines and more importantly, enhanced the SU curriculum in 47 residen- cy programs. Training CRs, who have a primary responsibilityfor educating medical trainees, appears to be one important pragmatic strategy to address the compelling need for better physician training in the identification and management ofpatients with SU-related problems. Educating trainees about SU poses extraordinary chal- lenges. Until a few decades ago, there was little research toguide the practice of addiction medicine by generalists. Yet in 1990, the Institute of Medicine stated that most patients with SU issues should receive care in a primary care setting. 45A decade later, Fiellin and colleagues described the basic corecompetencies in SU education for physicians and recom- mended increased efforts to provide physicians with a level of SU training commensurate with the economic and clinicalTable 2 .

Recently, the National Institute on DrugAbuse has joined forces with the American Medical Association toimprove SU training in medical education. 21 Renner described three critical elements to successfully train physicians in addiction medicine: (1) an adequateknowledge base, (2) a positive attitude toward the patient and the benefits of treatment, and (3) a sense of responsibility for the clinical problem. 46The CRIT program exposed CRs to up- to-date SU knowledge and evidence-based practices. The immersion experience allowed CRs to focus on the CRIT curriculum without the inevitable distractions of their jobs athome. The faculty modeled different teaching methodologieswith an emphasis on interactive learning. Meeting with individuals in recovery demonstrated the reality of treatment, its successes, and challenges. In addition, the physicianfaculty, all generalists with special expertise in addiction and medical education, served as role models of physicians who had successfully integrated academic, clinical, and researchcareers in addictions and medical education. The SU teaching project helped foster the transfer of SU knowledge and skills to the CRs 'home institutions. CRs were asked to identify a mentor at their institution as this support system was viewed as key to successful local implementation of teaching projects. The finding that intervention CRs had greater increases in self-perceived preparedness to teach about alcohol abuse comparedto no changes in teaching about another chronic medical condition, such as dementia, which remained persistently low, highlights the fact that such improvements do not occurspontaneously.Targeting CRs was a tactical decision in order to magnify the impact of the immersion program. Other successful interven- tions have increased the knowledge and skills of generalistresidents, 26,32but have not demonstrated the potential to shift the values and culture of a residency program to include more SU training. In addition to being pivotal educators in theclinical training of students and residents, CRs have additional strengths. They are chosen for the high quality of their medical knowledge, clinical skills, and organizational abilities. As rolemodels, CRs have the opportunity to impact the knowledge,skills, and attitudes of trainees. Surprisingly, there have been relatively few efforts to advance medical training by capitalizing on the role of CRs as influential instructors, leaders, and role-models. One example is a CRIT program for the care of older adults to teach geriatric medicine skills to a single institution 's chief residents. 47Engaging these key young medical leaders early in their careers when they are open to new ideas is a strategy with enormous educational potential. The CRIT program evaluation has several limitations worth considering. The control group was smaller than the interven- tion group, and neither group was randomly assigned. If the control group had been larger, it is possible that some of theoutcomes that were significant in the intervention group wouldhave also been significant in the control group; however, the absolute change between baseline and follow-up was almost always smaller in the control group. The non-randomizednature of the study could have led to confounding. For example, because enrollment in the intervention group was based on selection by the CRIT program directors and 73% ofthe control group was not accepted, intervention CRs might have been more qualified than the controls. However, both groups were similar in the baseline variables measured.Another limitation is the overall small sample size, whichmakes it difficult to identify differences between groups. Nevertheless, many results did reach statistical significance. Next, it is possible that due to the self-reported nature of thed a t a ,s o m eo ft h ef i n d i n g sm a yb ea t t r i b u t e dt os o c i a l desirability bias. Social desirability may have been more of an issue for the intervention group. To mitigate this bias, CRsreturned their questionnaires to an independent evaluator, a n dw e r et o l dt h a tf a c u l t ya n ds t a f fw o u l do n l ys e ed e - identified aggregate data. While we found improvements inclinical knowledge, skills, and practice among the CR atten- dees, we were unable, by study design, to detect if these improvements continued downstream to their trainees. How-ever, in two cases we are aware of CRs conducting their ownassessment of impact of their teaching project. 42,44Future research on the CRIT model should consider a more in-depth investigation of impact on the CRs 'trainees. Finally, the conclusions of this study may not be generalizable to all generalist CRs, as the CRIT program enrolled CRs who self- selected for interest in this training and had a disproportion-ately high representation from internal medicine. In summary, immersion programs directed at CRs incorpo- rating a variety of teaching modalities and the explicit devel-opment of a teaching project can help transmit substance useknowledge and teaching expertise to medical trainees. Chief Resident Immersion Training (CRIT) impacted physicians who play a critical role in medical trainee education but are notoften trained in substance use themselves. CRs are an untapped resource for changing medical education and prac- tice about substance use disorders, and this CRIT model holds Figure 1 .

We used 3 readiness to change measures: a 1 to 10 visualanalog scale (VAS) and two factors of the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale: Perception of Problems (PP) and Taking Action (TA). Subjects with the highest level of VAS-measured readiness consumed signi cantly fewer drinks 3 months later [Incidence rate and 95% con dence interval (0.36, 0.91) highest vs. lowest tertile]. PP associated with more drinking [IRR (95%CI): 1.94 (1.02, 3.68) third vs. lowest quartile]. Greater TA scores were associated with less drinking [IRR (95%CI): 0.42 (0.23, 0.78) highest vs. lowest quartile]. Perception of Problems' association with moredrinking may re flect severity rather than an aspect of readiness associated with ability to change; high levels of Taking Action appear to predict less drinking. Although assessing readiness to change may have clinicalutility, assessing the patient's planned actions may have more predictive value for future improvement inalcohol consumption. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Consequences resulting from excessive alcohol consumption are responsible for considerable disease burden ( Rehm et al., 2003 ). Consequently, interventions aimed at reducing excessive alcohol consumption are viewed as bene cial from a public health point of view. In 2004, the US Services Preventive Task Force recommended theuse of brief counseling intervention in primary care, where its ef cacy has been con rmed; this practice is among the most effective and cost- effective of preventive care services Assessment of patients' readiness-to change provides a self-report index of patient motivation to alter their drinking patterns that may be used to tailor advice and counseling to patients and determine treatment dispositions. Indeed, health care providers have been encouraged to see increases in readiness-to-change as a desirable intermediate goal on the path to behavior change ( Samet, Rollnick, & Barnes, 1996 ).The focus on readiness is based in large part on the assumption that there is a clear association between readiness-to-change and outcome(e.g., decreases in drinking). However, there is con flicting evidence regarding the relationship between readiness to change and outcome(Forsberg, Ekman, Halldin, & ). These equivocal ndings may have a number of explanations. First, a family of concepts is included under the term \"readiness. \"These concepts may include importance of change, problem recognition, con dence, and actions re flecting a commitment to change. These concepts, especially importance of change (sometimes related to or understood as problem or consequence recognition) or con dence in ability to change (also known as self-ef cacy), could operate differently. In particular, con dence seems to predict better outcomes ( Maisto, Conigliaro et al., 1999 ). Initiation of behavior change appears to be associated with the expectancy to cope successfully ( Demmel, Beck, Richter, & Reker, 2004 ). However, other indices of motivation to change, such as Problem recognition, do not appear to be associated with betteroutcomes. Miller and Tonigan developed a questionnaire (the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES)) aimed at capturing stages of change as described by Prochaska and DiClemente. After examining the psychometric properties of the questionnaire, it appeared that items about negation of the problem (precontemplation) and recognition of the problem (determination) formed a single factor.Addictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 636- 640 Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.addbeh.2009.03.034 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Addictive BehaviorsThis factor was named \"Recognition \"(Miller & Tonigan, 1996 ). Problem recognition is linked to one's capacity to attribute the cause of a health or social problem to alcohol and to the existence of such a problem. As such, problem recognition is considered to be an important component of readiness-to-change drinking ( Nye, Agostinelli, & Smith, 1999 ). How- ever, in addition to suggesting greater awareness of problematic alcoholuse patterns, problem recognition may also indicate higher levels ofalcohol consequences and thus serve as a marker of alcohol use disorder severity ( Maisto, Conigliaro et al.,1999; Williams, Horton, Samet, & Saitz, 2007 ). The differing associations between readiness measures and out- comes may also be explained by patient populations and by theassessment instrument. For example, the development of the SOCRATES questionnaire was designed to assess readiness among a treatment seeking population. The structure and validity of these measures may be quite different among non-treatment seeking problem drinking samples ( Maisto, Conigliaro et al., 1999 ).The role of readiness to change is of particular interest in patients withunhealthy alcohol use (i.e., the spectrum from risky consumption to alcohol dependence) identi ed by screening in general health settings, such as hospitals. In this circumstance, patients are notnecessarily help-seeking, unlike patients in specialty treatment. Such a population is less homogeneous than a treatment seeking popula- tion, which may be responsible for differences in the potential associations between readiness to change and drinking. Therefore we studied whether readiness to change predicts sub- sequent alcohol consumption in medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use. We studied this association using three different measures of readiness to change based on two instruments \u2014a visual analog scale (VAS) for the simple question \"how ready are you to change your drinking habits? \"and two factors from the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), levelof perception of the drinking problem and taking action towards change/commitment to making a change. The use of two different instruments covering a more global readiness concept and more speci c constructs, is of interest since we expect to capture various aspects of readiness. There is currently no gold standard in readinessto change measurement and so the use of two different instruments will also give additional information on their respective predictive values. We hypothesized that a high level of taking action towardschange/commitment to change would be associated with less drinking, and that greater problem perception, refl ecting severity, would be associated with more drinking, based on what has beenobserved in a primary care population ( Williams et al., 2007 ). 2. Methods We studied a prospective cohort of medical inpatients at an urban academic hospital who were drinking risky amounts ( N14 drinks/wk or5 drinks/occasion for men, N11 drinks/wk or 4 drinks per occasion for women and persons aged 66 and over). The general medical inpatient service we studied was internal medicine and it did not include intensive care unit beds. Subjects were participants in a randomized trial of brief intervention to reduce alcohol use ( Saitz et al., 2007 ) and were recruited from the inpatient medical service of an urban teaching hospital. Research associates approached all patients aged 18 or older whose physicians did not decline patient contact. Individuals fluent in English or Spanish who gave consent were asked to complete a screening interview. Eligibility criteriaincluded the following: currently drinking risky amounts, 2 contacts to assist with follow-up, no plans to move from the area for the next year, and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21 (Smith, Horton, Saitz, & Samet, 2006 ). Eligible subjects were randomized to receive usual care or a brief intervention to reduce alcohol use. The study population was used as a cohort in the present analyses. Assess- ments took place before group allocation.2.1. Assessments Demographics were assessed at study entry, as well as medical diagnoses by medical record review to identify those that were alcohol related (see Table 1 ), and alcohol use disorder diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders, 4thedition and determined by the Composite International DiagnosticInterview (CIDI) Alcohol Module ( Robins et al., 1988; WHO, 1996 ). More details on assessment and enrollment were previously pub-lished ( Saitz et al., 2007 ). At study entry in the hospital and 3 months later, alcohol con- sumption was assessed using a validated calendar method (Timeline Followback) ( Sobell & Sobell, 1995 ). Readiness to change was assessed with a 1 -10 visual analog scale (VAS) and with the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES). The VAS measure was a response to: \"How ready are you to change your drinking habits? \"The VAS has not been extensively validated but is attractive for clinical use in busy settings because of its brevity ( LaBrie, Quinlan, Schiffman, & Earleywine, 2005; Williams et al., 2007 ). The SOCRATES is a 19 item questionnaire developed to assess readiness to change alcohol use ( Miller & Tonigan, 1996 ). Based on a factor in Dukes, Hortton, Palfai, Pedley, & Saitz, 2009 ), we used a 2 factor structure for analyses on 16 items: 1 \u2014\"Perception of Problems \"(PP), and 2 \u2014\"Taking Action \"(TA). These two factors had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.94 and 0.88, respectively). PP represents problem awareness and recognition of the need for additional help to address the drinking problem and TA denotes the concrete steps a person is taking or has already taken towards a decrease in drinking and commitment to change.

Bertholet et al. / Addictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 636 -6402.2. Analysis The primary outcome was the average number of standard drinks per day (past 30 days) assessed at 3 months. The main predictors of interest were the three readiness to change measures (VAS readiness, SOCRATES PP and TA). To avoid assumptions of a linear relation between readiness to change measures and outcome, each independent variablewas categorized into quartiles, with the exception of VAS where division into quartiles was not feasible due to the distribution of the data and tertiles were used instead. The distribution of drinks per dayat 3 months, a count variable, was skewed, with a considerable number of zeros and a long tail, so the use of models assuming normality was not adequate. Therefore we used overdispersed Poisson regression models to assess the effect of readiness to change on subsequent drinking ( Horton, Kim, & Saitz, 2007; McCullagh & Nelder, 1989 ). The Pearson chi-square correction was used to account for overdispersion in the data. Separate models were t for VAS readiness and each of the two SOCRATES factors, and controlled for drinking at study entry (drinks per day, last 30 days),randomization group (despite the fact that there was no effect of intervention group in the parent trial on drinking outcome, both groups having reduced their drinking), age, gender, any heroin or cocaine use (last 30 days), marijuana use (last 30 days) and presence of an alcohol related medical diagnosis at hospital admission. The magnitude of association between measures of readiness to change and drinking were quanti ed using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). The IRR is a ratio of drinks per day for the exposed group of interest (i.e. level of readiness) versusthe reference group (lowest level of readiness). The null value of no association for the IRR is equal to 1. An IRR greater (less) than 1 indicates that readiness is associated with more (less) drinking. We calculated 95% con dence intervals for the IRR. All analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and a signi cance level of 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 3. Results Of the 7824 individuals approached for the study, 2011 were excluded (1127 for language barriers, 392 because they were too confused, 492 because they had time con flict or declined). Of the 5813 screened, 4775 did not have unhealthy alcohol use, and for 52amounts were not determined, leaving 986 patients with unhealthyalcohol use. Of these, 462 were ineligible (230 were not able to provide 1 or 2 contacts for follow-up purposes, 94 refused to complete the screening, 52 were moving in the next months, and 86 had a Mini Mental State Evaluation of less than 21) and 183 declined further participation. Therefore 341 subjects were included in the study (65% of the 524 eligible subjects). Eligible subjects who enrolled were more likely to be Black (45% vs 31%) and to drink greater amounts of alcohol (24 vs 18 drinks per week) compared to eligible subjects who refused participation. Of the 341 remaining eligible subjects, we excluded 7because although they had unhealthy alcohol use according to the screening questions, results of the calendar assessment method were that they had not consumed risky amounts recently. An additional 67 of the 334 subjects (20.1%) were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the present analyses ( Fig. 1 ). Those analyzed were not different from those lost to follow-up ( pN0.05) with respect to alcohol consumption, readiness to change measures (VAS readiness, SOCRATES factors), age, gender, living with a partner, employment, homelessness, or drug use. Subject's median (25th and 75th percentiles) readiness to change drinking at study entry on a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 1 to 10 was 8 (5, 10). Median (25th and 75th percentiles) SOCRATES Perception of Problems (PP) score was 39 (28, 44) on a scale from 10 to 50. Median (25th and 75th percentiles) SOCRATES Taking Action (TA) score was 22 (18, 26) on a scale from 6 to 30. Other subjects' characteristics are presented in Table 1 . 3.1. Association between readiness and consumption In adjusted analyses, subjects with VAS-measured readiness in the highest tertile at study entry, compared to those in the lowest tertile, drank signi cantly fewer drinks per day 3 months later (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.57, 95% con dence [0.90, 2.08]) ( Fig. 2 ).

Subjects with Taking Action (TA) scores in the highest quartile, compared with those in the lowestquartile, drank signi 0.78]); associations were and third quartiles (IRRs [95% CIs] for 2nd 1.07 [0.66, 1.71]) ( Fig. 3 ). 4. Discussion We explored whether readiness to change predicts subsequent alcohol consumption three months after a medical hospitalizationamong adults with unhealthy alcohol use. The predictive value of readiness to change appears to depend on the measures used, and on the various concepts included under the rubric of \"readiness. \" Components of readiness to change measured by the SOCRATESquestionnaire ( \"Perception of Problems \"and \"Taking Action \"or commitment to change) appear to operate differently. Higher levelsof Perception of Problems appeared to be associated with more, not less, drinking 3 months later. Clinically meaningful differences in consumption at 3 months were observed for each Perception of Problems quartile (compared to the lowest level), however the result was statistically signi cant only for the 3rd quartile. These results, consistent with prior literature, suggest that this measure may captureseverity rather than an aspect of readiness associated with the ability to change in the future ( Maisto, Conigliaro et al.,1999 ). In contrast, the highest level of Taking Action was associated with less drinking.Results suggested a threshold level for Taking Action; only the highest level was associated with a decrease in drinking. The highest level of Taking Action was the strongest predictor of decrease in drinking 3 months later of all the measures examined. The implications of our results for the SOCRATES are that greater Perception of Problems is not a predictor of decreased drinking since it may be a measure of severity. In contrast to the denial stereotype, patients in this sample of mainly non-treatment seeking alcohol dependent adults appeared to recognize that their drinking patternswere problematic, which is consistent with other studies wherehigher readiness to change was associated with more consequences (Williams et al., 2006 ). Our results also underscore the importance of commitment to change, and change-related actions (i.e. concretesteps a person takes towards a decrease in drinking); a high level of Taking Action was predictive of less drinking, consistent with studies that have emphasized the impact of commitment to change on behavior change ( Amrhein, Miller, Yahne, Palmer, & Fulcher, 2003 ). The second measure used, the visual analog scale, was associated with less drinking at the highest level. Of note, the middle tertile appeared to be associated with more drinking, although the results were not statistically signi cant. It is possible that different concepts (e.g. severity, and commitment) may be captured with this single scale, or that there may be simply threshold effects. Thus, outside itsclinical utility to elicit discussion about alcohol use during a patient - physician interaction, the VAS should probably be used with cautionas a predictive tool. We are unaware of similar studies of the predictive value of readiness measures in medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use. None- theless, these results are comparable to those observed in other populations regarding the importance of commitment to change and planned action. Readiness is predictive of change when related to action in people with alcohol dependence recruited in psychiatric hospitals (Demmel et al., 2004 ). As such, counseling that supports self-ef cacy and action plans may be particularly useful for medical inpatients withun healthy alcohol use ( Maisto, Carey, & Bradizza,1999 ). Our results also add to the evidence linking problem recognition to severity. Individualswith more severe problems related to their alcohol consumption are more likely to have high level of recognition ( Williams et al., 2007, 2006 ). These ndings should be considered in the context of limitations of the present study. First, our subjects agreed to participate in a study inwhich they could receive alcohol counseling. This sample could have been predisposed to change. In addition, participants drank more than those who refused to enroll in the study. However, enrolled subjects and refusers did not differ on VAS-measured readiness to change. Given the approach to recruitment in this study, these results are likely generalizable to individuals who agree to talk about their alcohol consumption after screening. Second, although recommended for use based on its face validity, the visual analog scale for readiness Fig. 3.

Bertholet et al. / Addictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 636 -640has not been extensively validated. Third, the follow-up period was 3 months. This could be considered short. We believe it likely that any effects of readiness on drinking would be present in the short-term. Whether these effects would persist (or appear anew) in long term follow-up is an empirical question for future study. Secondary analysis of randomized trial data can raise methodolo- gical challenges. But unlike secondary analyses in other cohorts, anintervention is well-speci ed and its receipt and effects are known. In this sample, the intervention delivered was not effective: as demon-strated in the parent study, both groups (intervention and usual care) reduced their drinking without statistically signi cant differences between groups ( Saitz et al., 2007 ). In addition we controlled all analyses for randomization group. Furthermore, the follow-up rate was 80%, which is good for this type of population and did not differ by group. Finally, prospective data collection and follow-up in this randomized trial is a strength because of high quality assessments and a detailed description of the study population. Our study also had notable strengths. We used a large sample of mostly dependent medical inpatients, a population that is of great interest since they are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality, represent the vast majority of medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use ( Freyer-Adam et Freedner, Palfai, Horton, & Samet, 2006 ), and are generally not seeking alcohol treatment despite experiencing alcohol consequences. Data collection was prospective and loss to follow-up was relatively small. We used a factor structure for the SOCRATES questionnaire that was determined in medical inpatients. Since this questionnaire has been shown to have different factor structure across settings, it was a strength to use a structure determined for this sample ( Demmel et al., 2004; Figlie, Dunn, Cornelius, Maisto,Conigliaro et al., 1999; Miller & Tonigan, 1996 ). By using various measures of readiness to change, we were able to test different aspectsof readiness. Also, by avoiding the assumption of a linear relation between readiness to change measures and drinking outcome in our analyses, we were able to identify a more re ned relation between readiness and outcome. In conclusion, readiness to change does predict subsequent alcohol consumption in medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use,however, readiness appears to be less useful as a monolithic construct. Readiness appears to be comprised of a number of more speci c constructs. These ndings may explain, at least in part, inconsistencies in the literature regarding the predictive ability of \"readiness \"and the role and importance of \"readiness \"for behavior change. In medical inpatients, the readiness construct \"Perception of Problems \"(or problem recognition) appears to be a measure of severity rather than as a predictor of change. Nevertheless, it may still be useful to assess problem recognition as a rst step to set goals and to plan actions to reduce drinking or to attend specialty treatment. Visual analog scalemeasures of readiness have some ability to predict behavior change however this ability may operate only after some threshold. Since a high level of taking action/commitment to change appeared to predict less drinking, physicians should be encouraged to enhance their patient's self-ef cacy and help them set goals and action plans. For greatest clinical and predictive utility, the component concepts ofreadiness should be separated when they are measured and used in research and practice. Additional studies of these separate constructs may help determine their optimal use. References Amrhein, P. C., Miller, W. R., Yahne, C. E., Palmer, M., & Fulcher, L. (2003).

Its factor structure and concurrent validity has been described for specialized alcohol treatment settings and primary care. The purpose of this study was to determine thefactor structure and concurrent validity of the SOCRATES among medical inpatients with unhealthy alcoholuse not seeking help for specialized alcohol treatment. The subjects were 337 medical inpatients with un- healthy alcohol use, identi ed during their hospital stay. Most of them had alcohol dependence (76%). We performed an Alpha Factor Analysis (AFA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the 19 SOCRATESitems, and forced 3 factors and 2 components, in order to replicate ndings from Miller and Tonigan (Miller, W.

The rst component measured Perception of Problems and was more strongly correlated with severity of alcohol-related consequences, presence of alcohol dependence, and alcohol consumption levels (average number of drinks per day and total number of binge drinking days over the past30 days) compared to the second component measuring Taking Action. Our ndings support the view that the SOCRATES is comprised of two important readiness constructs in general medical patients identi ed by screening. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Brief motivational counseling interventions have ef cacy for people with nondependent unhealthy 2001; Saitz, 2005 ). interviewing is an extended intervention that has ef cacy for a num- ber of health behaviors, including alcohol dependence ( Carbonari & DiClemente, 2000; Project MATCH Research Group, 1997 ). Readiness-to-change and motivation are frequently viewed as intermediate outcomes and have been seen as mediators and potential predictors of change ( Demmel, Horton, Samet, & Saitz, 2007 ). As a result, the assessment of motivation to change has been of great interest to researchers and clinicians alike ( Fiellin, Reid, & O'Connor, 2000; Miller & Rollnick, 1991 ). The Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) was developed and designed to measure stages of read- iness to change alcohol use ( Miller & Tonigan, 1996 ). It was rst intended as a self-administered questionnaire to categorize indivi- duals into one of four stages of change (pre-contemplation, contem- plation, determination, and action ( Prochaska & DiClemente, 1984 ). After several iterations of the SOCRATES, Miller and Tonigan validatedAddictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 568 -572 Corresponding author. -see matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These par- ticipants were in specialty settings: either in outpatient treatment programs or seen for aftercare following residential or day treatment. The authors identi ed 3 independent factors (using exploratory alpha factor analysis with a varimax rotation): Ambivalence, Recognition,and Taking Steps. The 19-item version of the SOCRATES is widely used and non-English versions of the scale have been validated among treatment seeking populations ( Demmel et al., 2004; Figlie, Dunn, & Laranjeira, 2005 ). Each item response is based on a 5-point Likert scale (i.e., 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided or unsure, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). The 19-item SOCRATES is included in Table 2 ; more information is available online at http:// casaa.unm.edu/inst/SOCRATESv8.pdf . Because most of the research on the psychometric properties of the SOCRATES has been done in specialized settings in patients with alcohol dependence, there has been concern about whether the ques- tionnaire's factor structure is applicable to non-treatment seeking patients in other settings. To address the question of the applicability of the factor structure in other populations, Maisto et al. (1999 ) investigated the factor struc- ture of the SOCRATES in a population of opportunistically screened primary care patients. Using exploratory component analysis and conrmatory factor analysis, they concluded that a two factor solution (retaining 15 items) was more parsimonious than the three factor solution. Speci cally, the rst factor contained 9 of the Ambivalence and Recognition items (named AMREC) and the second factor com- prised 6 of the Taking Steps items (and was named Taking Steps). Several publications have reported either a 2 or 3-factor solution for the SOCRATES ( Burrow-Sanchez & Lundberg, et al., 2004; Figlie et al., 2005 ). Given inconsistencies in the literature among different populations, we investigated the most appropriate factor structure solution based on a sample hospitalized for medical illness in a general hospital (i.e. not seeking or receiving specialty alcohol treatment) who were identi ed opportunistically by screening for the spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use (i.e. from use of risky amounts through dependence). This is to our knowledge the rst study to in- vestigate the appropriate factor structure solution of the SOCRATES in this population. We performed both an exploratory analysis replicat-ing techniques utilized by and compared our results to those of Miller and Tonigan (1996) , and Maisto et al. (1999) . 2. Methods2.1. Participants The participants were enrolled in a randomized trial of a brief moti- vational intervention for unhealthy alcohol use ( Saitz et al., 2007 ). They were recruited while on the inpatient internal medicine service of a large, urban, academic medical center hospital. Eligibility criteria included: 18 or more years old, fluent in English or Spanish, currently (past month) drinking risky amounts (de ned as more than 14 stan- dard drinks per week or 5 or more drinks per occasion for men 18 to 65 years of age, and more than 11 standard drinks per week or 4 or more drinks per occasion for women and people over age 65), avail- ability of 2 contacts to assist with follow-up, no plans to relocate in the next 2 years, and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of at least 21. Subjects provided written informed consent and completed the SOCRATES at the time of enrollment. Study assessments (collected prior to randomization) were admin- istered bytrained research associates. Questions regarding alcohol con- sumption and consequences, medical and mental health, and health care utilization as well as other domains were obtained. Subjects com- pleted the Short Inventory of Problems, a questionnaire assessing alcohol-related consequences ( Miller, Tonigan, & Longabaugh, 1995 ),and the Use Disorders Identi cation Test ( Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993 ). The presence of an alcohol use disorder diagnosis was determined with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Alcohol Module ( WHO, 1996 ). Alcohol consumption was assessed with a validated calendar method (30-day Timeline Followback) ( Sobell & Sobell, 1995 ). The study was approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Boardand all subjects provided written informed consent. Details of the methodology of the randomized controlled trial are reported else- where ( Saitz et al., 2007 ). 2.2. Analyses Therst step of the analysis was to ensure that the underlying assumptions of the factor analytic model were appropriate and to investigate the distributional properties of each of the 19 items comprising the SOCRATES. In order to replicate ndings from Miller and Tonigan (1996 )a n d Maisto et al. (1999 ), we performed an Alpha Factor Analysis (AFA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the 19 SOCRATES items, using orthogonal (varimax) rotation and forced the 3 factors and 2 components, respectively. When evaluating the factor and component structures, we retained items with component or factor loadings 0.4 and with factorial complexity of one ( Nunally & Bernstein, 1994 ). In order to assess the potential impact of the inadvertent omission of item 16 of the SOCRATES by Maisto et al., we also performed analyses removing this item to allow comparison with their ndings. As a con rmatory FA technique we computed the coef cient of congruence to compare matrix structures between datasets or studies ( Cureton &D ' A g o s t i n o ,1 9 9 3 ). Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefcients was assessed utilizing items that loaded on our factors or components. Cluster-based scores were created for each factor or component and concurrent validity was assessed for demographic, drinking and drug use measures using Pearson and Spearman correlation coef cients. All computations were performed using SAS Version 9.1. Unless otherwise speci ed, all statistical tests and/ or con dence intervals were performed at =0.05 (2-sided). 3. Results 3.1. Participants Of 986 medical inpatients who reported at-risk drinking amounts during screening, 341 enrolled. Subjects enrolled were more likely to be African American (45% vs 31%) and drank larger quantities of alcohol (median 24 vs 18 drinks per week) compared to eligible subjects who refused participation, but did not signi cantly differ on readiness to change measured with a 1 to 10 visual analog scale. Of enrolled subjects, 337 completed the SOCRATES and comprise our analytic sample. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 . 3.2. Determination of the most appropriate factor structure solution in the study sample 3.2.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) The PCA yielded 2 components based upon Kaiser's Rule (i.e., eigenvalue N1). The rst three eigenvalues were 8.97, 2.65, and 0.91. The orthogonal component structure and associated loadings from the PCA with a varimax rotation are presented in Table 2 . Sixteen of the 19 items comprising the SOCRATES were retained based on the criteria of having a component loading 0.4 and a factorial complexity of one. Therst component, accounting for 37% of the item response variance, was comprised of 10 items: 3 that were originally described as Ambi- valence, 6 as Recognition, and 1 as Taking Steps. Six items originally described as Taking Steps composed the second component, accounting for an additional 24% of the item response variation. The remaining569 N. Bertholet et al. / Addictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 568 -572items split a load between two components (items 1 and 19) or did not load on either component (item 11). 3.3. Comparison with previously published factor structure solutions3.3.1. Maisto et al. To compare our data and ndings with those of Maisto et al. (1999 ), we repeated the PCA excluding item 16 ( Table 3 ). In these analyses, the PCA using Kaiser's Rule yielded 2 factors ( rst three eigenvalues: 8.57, 2.62, 0.87). The rst component is comprised of 11 items (using scale names from Miller and Tonigan): 2 Ambivalence, 7 Recognition and 2 Taking Steps, while the second component contains 8 items: 1 Recognition and 7 Taking Steps. Fifteen of the 18 SOCRATES items included in this procedure had a component loading 0.4 and a factorial complexity of one, and as with the prior analysis, two of the items (1 and 19) split a load between two components and item 11 did not load on either component. Analyses performed with a non- orthogonal rotation without item 16 yielded similar results. 3.3.2. Miller and Tonigan The hypothesized underlying three factor structure, based on Miller and Tonigan's (1996 ) published work, is displayed in Table 3 . This structure is comprised of 4 Ambivalence items (items 2, 6, 11 and 16), 7 Recognition items (items 1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 15 and 17), and 8 Taking Steps items (items 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18 and 19). Utilizing Miller's approach with our data, the AFA yielded 2 factors using Kaiser's rule. However, for comparison, we assessed a forced 3 factor solution. Therst three eigenvalues were 14.09, 3.81 and 0.80. The orthogonal factor structure and associated loadings from the AFA with a varimax rotation are presented in Table 3 . Three of the 4 hypothesized Ambi- valence items, all 7 of the hypothesized Recognition items, and 2 of the 8 hypothesized Taking Steps items loaded on the rst factor. Seven of the 8 hypothesized Taking Steps items and 1 of the hypothesized Recognition items loaded on the second factor. No items loaded on the third factor. Analyses performed utilizing a non-orthogonal solution yielded similar results (not shown). 3.3.3. Con rmatory factor analytic techniques To compare our component and factor analytic structure with that described by Miller and Tonigan (1996 ) and Maisto et al. (1999 cients of congruence. Coef cients of congruence(CC) range from 1 to 1, with greater absolute coef cients indicating increased concordance between structures ( Cureton & D'Agostino, 1993 ). Comparing the 3 factor structure solution from our data to the structure reported by Miller and Tonigan (1996 ), the coef cients of congruence implied strong concordance between both of the Recognition factors and the Taking Steps factors (CC=0.885 and 0.963, respectively) and a weak dissimiliarity between the Ambiva-lence factors (CC= 0.527, due to no items from our data loading on the third factor). For the 2 component structure compared to the solution published by Maisto et al., the coef cients of congruence were 0.988 comparison with Maisto et al.'s AMREC factor) and 0.985 (for comparison with their Taking Steps factor), for the rst and second components from our data, implying excellent concordance. The 2 component solution proposed by Maisto et al. is therefore more appropriate for our data in comparison to the 3 factor solution. A con rmatory factor analysis (also omitting item 16) for the 2 and 3 factor models also provided better t for the 2 factor solution (not shown). 3..4. Concurrent validity To assess concurrent validity we developed cluster-based scores based on the two component PCA solution and assessed the associa- tions between these scores and important measures. Results are re- ported in Table 4 . Both of the cluster-based scores are correlated with the presence of alcohol dependence, the presence of alcohol-related problems, and Alcohol Use Disorder Identi cation Test (AUDIT) score. Component 1 consistently has stronger correlations with each of these alcohol-related measures. In addition, component 1 is signi cantly correlated with alcohol consumption levels (average number of drinks Table 2 Determination of the most appropriate component structure solution in the studysample (exploratory PCA).

Discussion We examined the factor structure of the SOCRATES questionnaire in a population of adult men and women with unhealthy alcohol use identi ed by opportunistic screening, who were hospitalized in a general hospital and not attending specialized alcohol treatment.We found a 2 component structure. We propose that the rst com- ponent be named \"Perception of Problems \"(PP) (consisting of 10 items) and the second component be named \"Taking Action \"(TA) (consisting of 6 items). PP includes 3 items originally classi ed by Miller and Tonigan as Ambivalence, 6 as Recognition and one as Taking Steps. This component re flects the cognitive dimension of acceptance and recognition of alcohol problems. Item 14, \"I want help to keep from going back to the drinking problems that I had before, \"originally classi ed as Taking Steps, is part of PP. This could re flect that the acceptance of needing help is more a recognition of an underlying problem than an action statement. PP appears to re flect both the per- ception of problems related to alcohol drinking and a need for help. TA consists of 6 items originally described as Taking Steps, and appears to report actions that individuals are already doing in order to address their drinking problem. The desire to get help appears to be separate from taking actions to change drinking behavior. In the PCA, 3 of the 19 items had component loadings 0.4 with a factorial complexity of one. Item 19 ( \"I have made changes in my drinking and I want some help to keep from going back to the way I used to drink \"), originally classi ed as Taking Steps, is a composite question made of two statements, one on changes already made in drinking and the other on the desire to get help. It loaded 0.4 on both components, consistent with what the 2 factors appear to capture. Item 1 loaded 0.4 on both components, and item 11 did not load 0.4 on any component. The assessment of concurrent validity indicates that PP (the rst component) is correlated with alcohol consumption level (drinks per day and heavy drinking episodes). PP has stronger associations with the presence of alcohol-related consequences than TA (the second component). This is consistent with the interpretation that PP re flects perception of alcohol problems, but suggests also that PP could re flect the severity of the problems related to alcohol use.Table 3 Comparison with previously published component and factor structure solutions.

Bertholet et al. / Addictive Behaviors 34 (2009) 568 -572The exploratory analysis results were reinforced by the compara- tive analysis. In comparative and con rmatory analyses, the most appropriate structure in our data was similar to that found by Maisto et al. and less similar to that found by Miller and Tonigan. Our data support the evidence that the factor structure of the SOCRATES questionnaire may be dependent upon the population and the therapeutic setting in which the questionnaire is administered.The use of a 3 factor solution seems to be appropriate in specialized addiction and psychiatric settings, especially with alcohol dependent patients, even if this remains questionable since Figlie and colleagues demonstrated a 2 factor solution in a mixed population of patients from specialized setting and from a gastroenterology clinic ( Demmel et al., 2004; Figlie et al., 2005; Miller & Tonigan, 1996 ). On the other hand, the use of a 2 factor solution seems more appropriate for patients screened opportunistically in general health settings such as primary care clinics, community samples or hospitals ( Maisto et al., 1999; Burrow-Sanchez & Lundberg, 2007 ). Among adolescents and young adults, published data are inconsistent in favor of one or the other structures ( Maisto, Chung, Cornelius, & Martin, 2003; Vik, Culbertson, & Sellers, 2000 ). Contrary to the ambivalence and recognition con- structs that the originally described Ambivalence and Recognition factors intended to capture, the concept captured in the factor called \"Taking Steps \"(measure of actions taken towards change, or change- related actions) in both the Maisto et al. and Miller and Tonigan studies is consistent across populations and settings. The main strength of our study was the examination of the SOCRATES in a large sample of medical inpatients, adding to the liter- ature on readiness to change in patients who are identi ed oppor- tunistically, and are not seeking treatment (in contrast to studies in specialty addiction treatment settings). This is the rst study to our knowledge investigating the factor structure in this population. Nevertheless, the generalizability of these results should be limited to hospitalized medical patients. The results are particularly applicable to those who agreed to participate in a clinical trial where they could receive alcohol counseling. It is possible that the subjects included in our sample were more motivated to change than were those who refused to participate. However, individuals who agreed to participate had similar readiness scores on a 1 to 10 visual analog scale compared to eligible subjects who refused participation. In conclusion, our ndings support the likelihood that the SOCRATES can assess and measure two important motivational constructs in patients identi ed by screening, who are not necessarily seeking nor receiving specialty alcohol treatment. One of these constructs, change- related actions, was consistently found across settings and populations. Therst component identi ed in our sample (PP) re flects perception of problems and need for help, and the second taking action or change- related actions (TA). Nevertheless, identi cation of these two readi- ness-to-change constructs is of interest primarily as potential pre- dictors of change or determinants of behavior change. The predictive validity of the 2 components and their relationship with behavior change need to be further explored. Since only about 5% of individuals with alcohol dependence seek and receive treatment, having tools that help researchers to better study the 95% who do not seek help isimportant and relevant, particularly when it is assumed that seeking treatment is related to motivation and problem recognition.

The objective of the study was to determine changes in readiness, importance and confidence after a primary care visit, and 6-month improvements in both drinking and cognitive dimensions of behavior change, in patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Methods: Prospective cohort study of patients with unhealthy alcohol use visiting primary care physicians, with repeated assessments of readin ess, importance, and confidence (visual analogue scale (VAS), score range 1-10 points). Improvemen ts 6 months later were defined as no unhealthy alcohol use or any increase in readiness, import ance, or confidence. Regr ession models accounted for clustering by physician and adjusted for demographics, alcohol consumption and related problems, and discussion with the physician about alcohol. Results: From before to immediately afte r the primary care physician visit, patients (n = 173) had increases in readiness (mean +1.0 point), importance (+0.2), and confidence (+0.5) (all p < 0.002). In adjusted models, discussion with the physici an about alcohol was associated with increased readiness (+0.8, p = 0.04). At 6 months, many participants had improvements in drinking or readiness (62%), drinking or importance (58%), or drinking or confidence (56%). Conclusion: Readiness, importance and confidence im prove in many patients with unhealthy alcohol use immediately after a pr imary care visit. Six months after a visit, most patients have improvements in either drin king or these cognitive dime nsions of behavior change. Background Unhealthy alcohol use (the spectrum from at-risk drink- ing amounts through alcohol dependence) and its conse- quences represent a major burden of disease in the general population [1,2]. Among those with unhealthy alcoholuse, brief intervention (BI) and motivational interviewing have demonstrated evidence of efficacy [3-5]. In primarycare, BI is recommended by national practice guidelines (US Preventive Services Task Force, 2004), and, as part of BI, clinicians are encouraged to assess motivation andPublished: 9 April 2009 BMC Public Health 2009, 9:101 doi:10.1186/1471-2458-9-101Received: 17 September 2008 Accepted: 9 April 2009 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/101 \u00a9 2009 Bertholet et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

These changes in readiness are seen as short term goals on the way to decreased consumption [7,8]. Processes of change have been conceptualized in various ways; in the Transtheoretical model, Prochaska andDiClemente described the progression of individuals through stages of change [9]. Others have pointed out the role of importance of change for the patient [10], whileBandura emphasized the role of self efficacy, or confi-dence in ability to change [11]. Importance and confi-dence are considered components of readiness orreadiness-related factors. For the purpose of this article we will refer to readiness, importance and confidence as 3 behavior change constructs, cognitive dimensions ofbehavior change, that comprise \"readiness to change.\" These three constructs can facilitate clinical conversations about health behaviors, and may even have predictivevalue for later behavior change [12-14]. They can be assessed with visual analog scales (VAS), which, because of their brevity, can be widely used. Longer assessmentssuch as the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RTCQ)(developed to assess readiness per se, not importance orconfidence specifically) allow classification according tostage of readiness to change in addition to the computa- tion of a continuous score [15]. The predictive value of cognitive dimensions of behavior change, however, has been mixed. Demmel et al. demon-strated that in alcohol dependent inpatients, readinessaccounted for 9.4% of the variance in outcome [12]. Self- efficacy also appears to be a predictor of abstinence [16]. In other studies, however, readiness was not associatedwith subsequent consumption, and was predictive ofmore, not fewer consequences (or at least greater recogni-tion of consequences) [17,18]. Thus, how behavior change constructs relate to later behavior change is not well understood. Furthermore,how these constructs change over time and in response tobrief counseling, particularly in general healthcare set-tings, is also not well known. The efficacy for BI in primarycare for unhealthy alcohol use is modest, and interven-tions with different theoretical rationales (e.g. MATCH and COMBINE studies) lead to similar results [10,19,20], calling into question the roles played by behavior changeversus other constructs. These concerns are also encoun-tered more broadly in psychotherapy research, and werenamed by Rosenzweig in 1936 after Alice in Wonderlandas the \"Dodo Bird effect\" [21]. Rosenzweig proposed that \"common\" factors were responsible for the efficacy of psy- chotherapy. He used Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonder-land's Dodo bird conclusion \"everybody has won and allmust have prizes.\" In most trials of alcohol BI, control(and intervention) groups decrease consumption over time (one way to understand natural history in these set- tings). This improvement has a number of possible expla-nations: regression to the mean, effects of assessments orcontact with study staff, natural history, and selection ofindividuals more prone to change (since agreement toparticipate might indicate some desire to change) [22]. A better understanding of behavior change constructs, the natural history of behavior change, and how the con-structs relate to outcome might therefore inform thedesign of more efficacious interventions that achieve andsustain changes in drinking [23]. Therefore we studiedimprovements and predictors of improvements in 3 behavior change constructs (readiness, importance, confi- dence) and subsequent drinking after a primary care visitin a prospective cohort of patients. Methods We studied a prospective cohort of adults with unhealthyalcohol use visiting an urban academic primary care prac- tice who participated in a randomized trial of the impact of providing (or not providing) primary care physicianswith patients' alcohol screening results [24]; physicianswere the unit of randomization. Additional detail regard-ing the clinical trial has been published [24]. Patients werescreened if they had a visit with an included physician. A trained staff researcher approached and interviewed enrolled subjects before and after their visits with a physi-cian (February 1998-August 1999) in the waiting room.Patients were told they were being asked (initial screen-ing) questions for research purposes. Eligible patientswere told they were being asked to participate because they were primary care patients who reported drinking alcohol, and that the study might help physicians learnhow to identify alcohol use by patients. Six months later,subjects were interviewed by telephone, after which theyreceived compensation in the form of a voucher worth tenU.S. dollars. The screening was done using the CAGE questionnaire and the 3 questions published in the 1995 NIAAA guide to assess quantity and frequency of drinking[25,26]. The CAGE and the 3 alcohol questions were com-pleted by paper and pencil in the waiting room or by helpof a research assistant when needed. The baseline assess-ment was done by face to face interview. Inclusion for thepresent study was based on drinking as assessed using the Timeline Followback method [27]. Subjects were asked how many drinks they had each day for the past 30 daysusing a calendar and chronologic cues (e.g. weekends,holidays, significant events during the time period) basedon published instructions for this assessment. For the present study, eligible patients drank risky amounts (> 14 U.S. standard drinks [12 g each]/week or >4 drinks/occasion for men and > 7 drinks/week or > 3drinks/occasion for women in the past month), were flu-BMC Public Health 2009, 9:101 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2458/9/101 Page 3 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)ent in English or Spanish, and had data available on 3 behavior change constructs of interest. Subjects were interviewed before, immediately after the visit and 6months later. At each time point, subjects completed 3visual analog scales (VASs), one for each of 3 behaviorconstructs (\"how ready are you to change your drinkinghabits\", \"how important is it for you right now to change your drinking\", \"if you decide to change your drinking habits, how confident are you that you would succeed\",with a score of 1 being \"not ready/not important tochange/not confident to succeed\" and 10 \"ready/veryimportant change/very confident to succeed\") [17,28].Subjects also completed the RTCQ, a validated instrument that assesses readiness that has satisfactory test-retest reli- ability and consists of 12 statements, each one evaluatedby the participant on a 5 point Likert scale [29]. For the present study, we used a continuous RTCQ score (-24 to +24) that has good reliability (alpha = 0.85-0.86)[30,31]. The readiness item was included in the screener (paper and pencil). Confidence and importance items and the RTCQ were included in the previsit inter-view (face to face interview). After the visit and 6 monthslater, subjects completed the 30-day Timeline Followback,a validated calendar method considered a reference stand-ard for assessing alcohol consumption,[32] and the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP) to assess alcohol-related problems [33]. Immediately after the visit, subjects wereasked by research assistants if they had had any discussionwith their physician about alcohol consumption as well asthe content of such a discussion (i.e. \"Did the doctor giveyou advice about your drinking habits,\" \"Did the doctor talk about drinking?\", \"Did the doctor tell you how many drinks would be safe for you to drink?\", \"Did the doctorrecommend that you cut down/quit drinking, go to Alco-holics Anonymous/treatment?\"). Research assistants alsoassessed demographics, social support (\"Do you currentlyhave a partner?\"), and illicit drug use over the past month (\"In the last 30 days have you used marijuana/cocaine/ heroin/other illegal drug?\"). The study was approved bythe Boston University Medical Center Institutional ReviewBoard and a Certificate of Confidentiality was obtainedfrom the U.S. government. Analyses were performed using SAS software 9.1.3 (Cary, North Carolina). P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses controlled forclustering of subjects within physician and physician ran-domization group, using Generalized Estimating Equa-tions (GEE) regression models with an exchangeableworking correlation and empirical variance estimator. Of note, in the original trial, the intervention (i.e. randomi- zation group) was not associated with improvements indrinking risky amounts.We assessed the outcomes changes in readiness, impor- tance, and confidence between pre- and immediate post- visit assessments. Differences were computed by subtract-ing the pre-visit score from the immediate post-visit score.We used unadjusted models (but accounting for cluster-ing) and models that adjusted for predictors to assess thechanges between pre- and immediate post-visit assess- ments in each of the behavior change constructs. Because a change in behavior could take place during the 6-month follow-up period after the pre-visit assessment,the state of readiness to change drinking at 6 monthscould become irrelevant (e.g. readiness to change in a sub- ject who no longer consumed alcohol). Therefore, to assess change outcomes, we created 3 dichotomous varia-bles representing \"improvement,\" each defined as eitherno longer drinking risky amounts or, if still drinking riskyamounts, having improvement (difference > 0) in readi-ness to change drinking (i.e. improvement in drinking or readiness), importance of changing drinking (i.e. improvement in drinking or importance), or confidence in ability to change drinking (i.e. improvement in drink-ing or confidence). Since readiness, importance and confi- dence are often considered intermediate outcomes, it is ofclinical relevance to use an outcome taking into accountincreases in these readiness to change constructs [34,35]. We did not analyze these behavior change constructs in those who had already changed, and we did not have dataon readiness/importance/confidence to sustain changesin drinking (e.g. not drinking risky amounts), and there-fore could not analyze these constructs as outcomes. Predictors of interest were: demographics (age, sex, race/ ethnicity), social support (currently having a partner),alcohol consumption at study entry (drinks per day), SIPscore, illicit drug use (marijuana, heroin, cocaine, other),and discussion with the physician about alcohol con-sumption during the visit. All analyses were repeated with the RTCQ continuous score as the outcome, in order to corroborate the resultsobtained with the readiness VAS. Results Of 4143 patients approached, 182 did not complete the screener. Of 487 who reported drinking risky amounts in the past month, 235 refused participation in the study and18 had no time before the visit to complete the pre-visitassessment. Of the 234 remaining enrolled patients, ouranalytic sample was restricted to the 173 subjects drinkingrisky amounts who had available data on \"readiness to change\" at all 3 assessments (Table 1); they saw one of 36 physicians. We tested potential differences betweenincluded subjects who completed and did not completethe follow up: There were no significant differences (p <BMC Public Health 2009, 9:101 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2458/9/101 Page 4 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)0.05) between study subjects (n = 173) and those enrolled but not included in the analytic sample (n = 61) on pre-visit readiness, importance, confidence, discussion withthe physician about alcohol consumption, provision ofscreening results to the physician, drinks per day, age,race, employment status, having a partner or drug use. There was a significant difference between study subjects and those enrolled but not included in the analytic sam-ple on gender: subjects not included (i.e. lost to followup) were more likely to be male (74% vs 58%, p = 0.05). Regarding generalizability, we compared included sub- jects to all other individuals identified by screening who were eligible. Subjects included in the analytic sampledrank more (mean days drinking per week 2.98 vs 2.49, p= 0.01, mean number of drinks per typical day of con-sumption 4.45 vs 3.44, p < .0001). There were no signifi-cant differences (p < 0.05) between subjects included inthe analytic sample and all individuals identified by screening on gender, race and readiness to change. Pre- to immediate post-visit changes In unadjusted analyses of visual analog scales (VASs)(score range 1 to 10 points), subjects had significant increases immediately post-visit in readiness (+1.02 points, p < 0.0001), importance (+0.16, p < 0.0001), andconfidence (+0.49, p = 0.003) when compared to pre-visitassessments (Table 2). Similarly, readiness as assessed bythe RTCQ also increased (mean change +0.14, p <0.0001). All of the differences indicated increases in read- iness, importance, and confidence. In adjusted models (Table 3), a discussion with the physi- cian about the patient's alcohol consumption was a signif-icant positive predictor of an increase in readiness asmeasured by VAS (adjusted mean change +0.78 points, p= 0.04), as was not having a partner (+1.06, p = 0.006).Table 1: Characteristics of 173 Adults with Unheal thy Alcohol Use Visiting a Primary Care Physician Characteristic %(n) Female 42% (72) Race/ethnicity African-American 58% (101) White 18% (31) Latino 16% (28) Other 8% (13) Employed (last 3 month) 60%(103) Having a partner 68%(118) Illicit drug use, last 30 days (any drug) 34% (58) Patient's physician random ized to receive intervention (provis ion of screening results) 58% (100) Discussion with physician about alcohol consumption 55% (95) mean, (SD ) Age 43.10 (12.61) Drinks per day 3.05 (4.76) Alcohol related consequences 8.41 (10.36) Readiness to change drinking measures (pre visit) Readiness (1 to 10) 5.04 (3.13) Importance (1 to 10) 6.01 (3.56) Confidence (1 to 10) 7.75 (2.60) RTCQ (-24 to 24) 3.32 (6.76) Alcohol related consequences: Shor t Inventory of Problems score RTCQ: Readiness To Change Questionnaire Table 2: Changes (from Before to) Immediately After a Primary Care Physician Visit in Patien t \"Readiness\" to Change Drinking Measure (range) Mean Change (95% CI) Effect size (d) Readiness (1-10) 1.02 (0.74, 1.30) 0.33 Importance (1-10) 0.16 0.49 (0.16, 0.81) 0.19 RTCQ (-24 - +24) 0.14 (0.13, 0.15) 0.02 RTCQ: Readiness To Change Questionnaire CI = confidence intervalBMC Public Health 2009, 9:101 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2458/9/101 Page 5 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Being white was a negative predictor of change in readi- ness (white versus other: -1.41, p = 0.002). Age, gender,alcohol consumption and werenot significant predictors. Similarly for readiness meas- ured by the RTCQ, discussion with the physician about the patient's alcohol consumption was a significant pre-dictor of an increase (+1.14 points, p = 0.04). However,not having a partner was not significantly associated withan increase in RTCQ-measured readiness, and being whitewas associated with an increase (not a decrease) (+1.24, p = 0.03). None of the predictors were significantly associ- ated with increases in importance and confidence. Pre-visit to 6-month follow up changes Of the 173 subjects, 62 (36%) reported not drinking riskyamounts during 30 days prior to the 6-month follow-up interview. But most subjects had improvements in drink- ing or readiness, importance and confidence: 62% wereno longer drinking risky amounts or had improved readi-ness, 58% were not drinking risky amounts or hadimproved importance, and 56% were not drinking riskyamounts or had improved confidence. Similarly, 67% ofsubjects were not drinking risky amounts or had improved RTCQ-readiness. We assessed the proportion of subjects who had improved because of a change in drink-ing. Of the 98 subjects who had improved drinking orreadiness, 54 (55%) were no longer drinking riskyamounts and 44 (45%) were still drinking risky amountsbut had improved readiness. For improvement in drink- ing or importance, 62 (62%) had improved drinking, 38 (38%) improved importance; for improvement in drink-ing or confidence, 62 (64%) improved drinking, 35(36%) confidence. Results were similar for improvementin drinking or RTCQ-readiness (62 (54%) had improved drinking, 53 (46%) improved RTCQ score. In adjusted analyses, few predictors of improvement were identified. Not having a partner was a significant predictor of improvement in drinking or importance (p = 0.007),and drinking or confidence (p = 0.005). Being white wasa negative predictor of improvement in drinking or readi-ness (p = 0.007). No other predictors were significantlyassociated with improvements in the hypothesized direc- tion. Unexpectedly, having a discussion with the physi- cian (at the initial visit) was a negative predictor (p = 0.03)of improvement in drinking or importance (Table 4). Discussion We assessed variations in readiness, importance and con- fidence regarding changing drinking after a single primary care physician visit and improvements in these constructsand drinking 6 months later. After the visit, we observedsignificant increases in readiness, importance, and confi-dence. The effects were small (i.e. 1 point for readiness,0.16 for importance, 0.49 for confidence, on a 1 to 10scale). However, a clinically significant change in these constructs has not yet been well-defined, and the impact of changes of any magnitude is not known. Based on thetranstheoretical model and motivational interviewing, cli-nicians are encouraged to help patients increase motiva-tion, which in turn is expected to lead eventually tobehavior change [10,35]. After a physician visit we can detect the beginning of such changes. Having a discussion about alcohol with the physician appeared to have anadditional impact on readiness to change, an effect thatwas no longer detectable 6 months later. Like other meas-Table 3: Predictors of Improvement Immediately After a Primary Care Visit Improvemen t inReadiness (1-10)Importance (1-10)Confidence change(95% CI) Mean adjusted change(95% CI) adjusted change(95% 0.18) -0.01 (-0.06, 0.01) 0 .01 (-0.03, 0.05) (-0.46, 0.79) Inventory of Problems Readiness To Change QuestionnaireBold entries have p-values < 0.05BMC Public Health 2009, 9:101 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2458/9/101 Page 6 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)ures of health states (e.g. blood pressure), \"readiness to change\" should be viewed as an instantaneous measure dependent on various internal and external influences. In addition to these short-term changes, we studied the course of risky drinking and \"readiness to change\" in pri-mary care patients. Six months after a physician visit, mostsubjects improved either their drinking or readiness. These improvements suggest that primary care physicians should be somewhat optimistic regarding the course ofunhealthy alcohol use, with more than half of patientsimproving in a relatively short period of time. We identified few predictors of changes in \"readiness to change\" and none that were consistent across measures or time. Not having a partner was a positive predictor ofimmediate changes in readiness but a negative predictorof improvement in two measures 6 months later. Beingwhite was associated with worse readiness immediatelyafter a physician visit and less improvement 6 months later but the finding was not confirmed in analyses with the RTCQ or the other two behavior change constructmeasures. Speculation regarding the mechanism for thesehypothesis generating and inconsistent findings would bepremature. A discussion between the physician and the subject about alcohol predicted a positive change in readiness immedi- ately after the visit (confirmed by the RTCQ), but para-doxically, was associated with less improvement indrinking or importance (but no change in VAS- or RTCQ-measured readiness). The fact that no association wasfound between discussion with the physician and drink- ing 6 months later may have been due to the use of inef- fective counseling, but given the observed short-termeffect, another explanation could be simply that this effectdid not last.Neither alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, nor illicit drug use significantly affected behavior change con- structs or improvements. The fact that these markers of severity were not found to be negative predictors ofimprovement is of interest and should encourage physi-cians to address problems related to alcohol consumptioneven in the presence of concomitant illicit drug use, con-sidering that most of their patients will have some improvement, independent of the severity of the alcohol problem. A number of studies have assessed readiness to change and related constructs. In general, these studies havefocused on characterizing specific populations [13,36-39] or on studying readiness as a predictor of behavior change [12,14]. Our study instead focused on how these con-structs change over time. Improvement over time inuntreated adults with unhealthy alcohol use and alcoholuse disorders (alcohol abuse and dependence) has beenpreviously reported [22,40,41]. Alcohol abuse and alco- hol dependence seem to be (especially the latter) chronic conditions characterized by recurrent episodes of diseaseactivity [42]. But the natural history of the spectrum ofunhealthy alcohol use (risky drinking amounts throughdependence) is not well described in the literature, nor isthe natural history of readiness to change. In addition to the aforementioned studies of the natural history of alcohol use disorders, studies of brief interven-tion for nondependent unhealthy alcohol use in primarycare consistently report improvement over time in bothtreated and untreated individuals [43]. For example, maleheavy drinkers in primary care decreased drinking over 3 years by 25 to 53% (depending on the outcome measure) in both intervention and control groups [44]. Theimprovement in drinking observed in our sample is in thisrange. Improvements such as these could be attributed toTable 4: Predictors of Improvement 6 Mont hs After a Primary Ca re Physician Visit Improvement in drinking or ...

However, our study sample was not primarily composed of very heavy drinkers, and we also observed improvements in readiness, importanceand confidence regarding changing drinking, which werein the opposite direction than any hypothesized regres-sion to the mean, given the relatively high levels of readi-ness, importance and confidence in the study population at baseline. Assessment effects (improvements due to being asked questions about drinking and discussinganswers to those questions) have also been suggested ascauses of improvements in drinking [45,46]. This expo-sure may have in part accounted for improvements in oursample. But if asking about alcohol and discussing drink- ing in primary care are in fact responsible for improve- ments, such effects should be viewed as favorableexposures in the primary care setting, and as part of thecourse in these patients, rather than as methodologicalnuisances. This study has some strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore changes in readiness, importance and confidence during a single primary care visit. Wedescribed rapid changes in these constructs. We were alsoable to describe changes in readiness, importance or con-fidence and drinking over a 6 month period. Subjectsstudied were participants in a trial but there was no exper- imental brief counseling intervention nor a significant treatment effect on drinking amounts. The study also has some limitations. First, the applicabil- ity of our findings may be limited to primary care patientswith unhealthy alcohol use who agree to be screened and followed in a research study, and to those with similar characteristics as in our sample (e.g. 32% reporting noalcohol problems, a third with illicit drug use). Althoughparticipants differed little from those who did not partici-pate, participants did drink more. Similarly, subjects lostto the analytic sample differed little from those studied except on gender. The effects of these differences can be considered in the interpretation of our results. Second,findings are from secondary data analyses. Causality (ofpredictors) cannot be inferred, and there could be manyexplanations for changes in the readiness constructs.However, observational studies such as this one are likelyamong the best ways to study the natural course of behav- ior change constructs and changes in drinking, particu- larly prospective studies. Third, in our attempt to explorechanges over time, we had to combine actual behavior(changes in alcohol consumption) with cognitions aboutbehavior change. It is likely that these two dimensionsreflect different aspects of behavior. We presented data on the dimensions separately (and combined) but per- formed regression analyses on the combined outcome.From a clinical perspective, improvements in either drink-ing or readiness (combined) seem to be most relevant.Also, the interpretation of a 6 month change in readiness on a continuous scale for someone who continues to drink risky amounts is difficult, since it not clear how onewould interpret a change in some number of points.Fourth, we did not adjust the level of significance for mul-tiple comparisons. As such one should be cautious aboutinterpreting associations, particularly those not in the hypothesized direction. Lastly, all data were obtained from interviews and are subject to recall and social desir-ability biases. But interviews with trained research associ-ates and assurances of confidentiality took placeimmediately after the primary care visit to maximize accu-rate recall and minimize bias. Nonetheless, we do not know what patients meant by discussions about alcohol, which could have been brief or extensive and may or maynot have included known effective components of briefinterventions. Conclusion Our results provide important information. First, subjects appear to change readiness, importance and confidence after a single physician visit. Second, most patients withunhealthy alcohol use will improve 6 months after a pri-mary care visit, either on behavioral change constructs ordrinking. Third, factors usually associated with worsealcohol treatment outcomes (e.g. drug use, alcohol related problems) do not seem to prevent improvement. Future research should focus on specific measures of behaviorchange constructs, perhaps assessed by ecologicalmomentary assessments of these rapidly changing dimen-sions [47,48] and what contributes to their changing, andhow and when they contribute to actual behavior change. A better understanding of these mechanisms could be used to enhance interventions for unhealthy alcohol usein primary care settings, which at present, are only mod-estly effective. But even if the reasons for the improve-ments in drinking and behavior change constructs aremostly unknown, primary care physicians should be aware of the prognosis for patients with unhealthy alco- hol use, to recognize incremental steps towards changeand to support their patient's efforts.

B. Berz, MD,* Katherine MA, MSc, Bertina PhD,\u00a7 Adam J. and Tracy A. Battaglia, MD, MPH* /H20648 Background: Black Americans have higher mortality from breast cancer than white Americans. This study explores the influence ofsocioeconomic factors and black race on treatment and mortality forearly-stage breast cancer.Methods: A cohort of 21,848 female black and white, non-Hispanic subjects from the Massachusetts Cancer Registry diagnosed withstage I or II breast cancer between 1999-2004 was studied. Subjectswith tumors larger than 5 cm were excluded. We used mixedmodeling methods to assess the impact of race on guideline concor-dant care (GCC), dened as receipt of mastectomy or breast con-serving surgery plus radiation. Cox proportional hazard regressionwas used to assess disease-specic mortality.Results: Blacks were less likely to receive GCC after adjusting for age and clinical variables (OR: CI: 0.61, of GCC. Afteradjustment for all covariates, there were no longer signicant dif-ferences between black and white women regarding the receipt ofGCC. Nevertheless, black women were more likely to die of early-stage breast cancer than white women after adjusting for clinical,treatment, socioeconomic variables, and reporting hospital (HR: 1.6;95% CI: 1.1-2.1).Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors are mediators of racial ences in treatment outcomes. Signicant racial differences exist indisease-specic mortality for women with early-stage breast cancer.Attention to reducing socioeconomic barriers to care may influence racial differences in breast cancer treatment and mortality. Key Words: African Americans, breast neoplasms, health inequities, survival analysis, health services (Med Care 2009;47: 986-992) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among US women, and these deaths disproportionally affect black Americans. Recent statistics show that althoughblacks have a lower incidence rate of breast cancer thanwhites, they have the highest mortality rate of any racial orethnic group. 1Furthermore, despite an overall decrease in breast cancer mortality since the early 1990s as a result of improvements in both early detection and treatment, blackshave beneted the least compared with whites with respect tothis decrease. 2 Various factors have been implicated in this mortality gap including tumor biology and delays in or lack of receiptof recommended screening and therapies. 3In addition, while it is well documented that blacks present at a later stage of disease, they continue to have higher mortality even whencontrolling for stage at diagnosis. 1,4Therefore, achieving equal receipt of therapy for early-stage disease, where rec- ommended treatment guidelines are clear and relatively uni-form, may contribute to closing the mortality gap. Receipt of either mastectomy or breast conserving sur- gery (BCS) with radiation has been shown to be equivalentwith respect to breast cancer survival in early-stage disease,though the latter treatment may be preferred due to the lessinvasive nature of the procedure and the advantage of breastpreservation. 5Among those who receive BCS, radiation is an important part of treatment to decrease recurrence and im- prove survival.6,7Many studies have shown that blacks are similarly likely to receive BCS but less likely to receive radiation, compared with whites.8-10Only some of these studies include socioeconomic factors, such as income or insurance, and none use reporting hospital as a variable toexplain differences when they do exist. 8-14 The goal of this study was to use recent cancer registry data to understand the role that race and certain socioeco-nomic factors may play in treatment received and in breastFrom the *Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Medicine, Beth IsraelDeaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Massachusetts De-partment of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; \u00a7Boston UniversitySchool of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts; \u00b6Center for HealthQuality, Outcomes and Economic Research, Bedford VA Medical Cen-ter, Bedford, Massachusetts; and /H14067Women's Health Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, Boston,Massachusetts.

We used the Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR) to explore these associations in women diagnosedwith stages I and II breast cancer during the years 1999through 2004. METHODS Database and Study Population Data were obtained from the MCR, a population based cancer registry that collects information on newly diagnosedcancers among residents of the state. The criteria for caseselection of female invasive breast cancer cases were denedusing International Classication of Diseases for OncologyThird Edition codes (ICD-O-3). The codes used were primarysite 50.0 50.9, histologies except 9590 to 9989, forthe years 1999-2004. Only the rst case of breast cancer forthat time period was included based on the date of diagnosis.Non-Massachusetts residents were excluded. Analysis was limited to those women with American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I, IIa, and IIb. In addition,those women who were stage II but who had a tumor sizegreater than 5 cm were excluded from analysis since treat-ment guidelines are different for this subgroup. 15Subjects who had missing information or \"unknown\" listed in the variables for poverty, reporting hospital, tumor size, andradiation receipt were also excluded from analysis and ac-counted for approximately 5% of the total sample. Sevenpercent of black non-Hispanics were excluded due to missingor unknown data compared with 5% of white non-Hispanics.Those excluded were slightly younger and more likely to bestage II (mean age: 61, 51% stage II) compared with thoseretained (mean age: 62, 37% stage II)). The Institutional Review Boards of Boston University Medical Center and the Massachusetts Department of PublicHealth approved this study. Variables Demographic The main independent variable was race, classied as black non-Hispanic or white non-Hispanic, which will bereferred to as black or white, respectively. We excluded allother racial and ethnic categories because the primary aim ofthe study was to examine differences due to black race, andbecause other categories had numbers too small for meaning-ful analysis. Age was grouped into 5 categories ( /H1102150 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and /H1102279 years). Marital status was classied as married or \"all other,\" whichincluded those not married and those whose marital statuswas unknown. Tumor Characteristics Stage was classied as stage I or II. For those with no pathologic stage recorded, clinical stage was used. In theyears 1999-2003, 3025 subjects (2948 whites, or 16.5% ofwhites, and 77 blacks, or 14% of blacks) were clinicallystaged because there was no pathologic stage information. Ofthese, 2394 were staged as I and 631 were staged as II.Beginning in 2004, collaborative staging was implementedto address the issue of discrepancies in staging guidelinesamong the 3 major staging systems in the United States. Therefore, 2004 data does not have staging variables thatdiscern whether a subject was clinically or pathologicallystaged. Tumor grade was recorded as 1 through 4 orunknown. Tumor size was categorized into /H110212c ma n d2t o 5c m . Insurance and Income Insurance was categorized as uninsured, Medicaid only, Medicare with or without other coverage, commercial and\"all other.\" In the \"all other\" category, the large majority(86%) were insured but had an unknown type of insurance,whereas the rest were either unknown with respect to havinginsurance at all (13%) or had military insurance (1%). Censustract information was collected and served as a proxy forsocioeconomic status. U sing methods described by the Pub- lic Health Disparities Geocoding Project, we linked eachsubject's census tract of residence with the percentage ofthe population in that census tract living below the federalpoverty line according to the 2000 census. 16Subjects were categorized according to quintile of census tract poverty level. Reporting Hospital To account for intraclass correlation by site of care, we adjusted for each of the 75 hospitals that reported the cancercase for each subject. Each reporting facility was assigned acode by the MCR to keep its identity private. Treatment Outcomes The main treatment outcome was dichotomous based on receipt of guideline concordant care (GCC), dened asreceipt of mastectomy or BCS with radiation. 15BCS was dened as partial mastectomy, partial mastectomy with nip- resection, or simple mastectomy, simplemastectomy, modied radical mastectomy, or radical mastec-tomy. The MCR collects information on initiation of radia-tion therapy but not on whether treatment was completed. Wedid not examine receipt of hormonal therapy because suchinformation, coupled with hormone receptor status, was notuniformly available in the database. Mortality Outcomes Breast cancer mortality was determined by linking state vital records with the National Death Index and by usingICD-10 codes. 17Analysis was limited to subjects diagnosed before December 31, 2003, as the MCR had not linked state vital records with the National Death Index for the year 2004at the time of analysis. Those who died of causes other thanbreast cancer or those not recorded as having died wereexcluded. Analysis The/H92732test was used to test for differences in the distribution of categorical variables (demographic, socioeco- nomic, and clinicopathologic) among black and whiteMedical Care \u007f Volume 47, Number 9, September 2009 Race, Socioeconomics, and Breast Cancer \u00a9 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.lww-medicalcare.com |987women, and the Student ttest was used to compare distribu- tions in continuous variables (age). Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between outcomes and the main independent variable, patientrace, while controlling for possible confounders. Mixed mod-eling methods were used due to multilevel nature of theindependent variables. Different models were considered forreceipt of GCC to assess for the degree to which the socio-economic variables, marital status, income, and insurancecontributed to receipt of the outcome. First, age and year wereadded into the model, then clinical variables, followed bymarital status, insurance, income by census tract, and report-ing hospital. For survival analyses, Cox proportional hazard models were developed after testing for proportional hazard assump-tions using graphical methods. 18This procedure gave evi - dence that the assumption for the radiation received variabledid not hold. This issue was addressed by running stratiedanalysis. All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS In-stitute, NC), version 9.1. RESULTS Subjects included 21,155 white and 693 black women with stage I and II breast cancer. Patient and tumor charac-teristics are described in Table 1. Compared with whites,blacks were younger at diagnosis (62 vs. 56 years old), lesslikely to be married (56% vs. 34%), and more likely to haveMedicaid (2% vs. 16%), to be uninsured (1% vs. 5%), or tobe living in the lowest income census tract. Blacks were alsomore likely to be diagnosed at stage II compared with stageI, to have a larger tumor size, as well as a higher tumor grade.However, with respect to type of surgery received, blacks andwhites had similar rates of receipt of BCS, mastectomy, andno surgery in unadjusted analyses. Table 2 shows ndings from models predicting receipt of GCC. The models sequentially adjust for stage, age, andyear (partially adjusted model), plus marital status, censustract income, insurance, and reporting hospital (fully ad-justed). In the partially adjusted model, blacks were signi-cantly less likely to receive GCC after adjusting for age, yearof diagnosis, and stage (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.92).However, in the fully present (OR: 0.94; 95% 1.20; 95% CI:1.10-1.30) as were those older than 60, with 1 exception:those older than 79 were much less likely to have receivedGCC (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.31-0.41). Being Medicaid were all independent predictorsof GCC. Living in a census tract with high levels of povertydid not appear to be an independent predictor of GCC. Because of concern for collinearity between age and insurance status, stratied analyses were run and showed thatMedicare had a similar effect on receipt of the outcome forthose younger than 65 (HR: 0.85; 95% 0.64, 0.86). (data nottabulated) to the effect of Medicareon in the unstratied were also stratied by insurance type andshowed that black race had a different effect on treatment received in the Medicare group (OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 95% CI: 0.6,TABLE 1.

(data not tabulated) In addition, removing insurance from themodel did not change the results compared with the fullyadjusted model. For the analysis in Table 2, mixed (or random effects) modeling was compared with xed effects modeling. The fullyadjusted mixed model (displayed in Table 2) showed a pointestimate closer to 1 than did the fully adjusted xed effectsmodel (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.08) (data not tabulated). The age standardized breast cancer mortality rate per 100,000 person-years was 23.1 and 11.4 for blacks andwhites, respectively (data not tabulated). Cox proportionalhazard modeling of breast cancer mortality showed thatblacks had a hazard ratio of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.74-3.15) afteradjusting for age (Table 3). This disparity persisted, thoughattenuated, after controlling for clinical, treatment, socioeco-nomic variables, and reporting hospital (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.13-2.13). Living in a census tract with the highest quintileof poverty was also an independent predictor of death (HR:1.32; 95% CI: 1.06-1.65). Sensitivity analyses were run to assess the effect that competing risks might have on the mortality results. When theevent (death) was changed to include all cancer deaths instead ofonly breast cancer deaths, the hazard ratio for black race did notchange appreciably (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.12). When theevent was results also did notchange appreciably (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.13, 2.50).

As has been found in other studies of breast cancer, blacks in this cohort were younger, poorer, and morelikely to be at a later stage at diagnosis compared with theirwhite counterparts. 11,14We found certain measures of socio - economic status, namely marital status and insurance type, toindependently predict treatment. However, while race itselfwas not an independent predictor of GCC, blacks werenevertheless more likely to die of breast cancer during thestudy years, even after adjustment for covariates. A recent analysis of the SEER-Medicare database found similar results regarding mortality. Using data from1994-1999, Curtis et al found that blacks with stages II andIII disease were at increased risk of cancer death aftercontrolling for clinical, treatment, and socio-demographicvariables that included income and type of community. Theoutcome, however, was not limited to breast cancer deaths. 14 Other studies have shown that blacks diagnosed with early-stage disease have higher all-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality but have not controlled for socioeconomic factors,reporting hospital, and used breast cancer specic mortalityas the outcome. 4,9,11,12,19-21Using more recent data, our study shows that black women with stages I and II breast cancer have increased disease-specic mortality that persistseven after adjusting for clinical and treatment variables aswell as marital status, income by census tract, type of insur-ance, and reporting hospital. With respect to treatment received, other studies have had mixed results. When examining type of surgery received,our study is in line with several others in that blacks andwhites were equally likely to receive BCS compared withmastectomy. 9,10,22,23However after adjusting for age, year, and stage, we found that black women were less likely to receive GCC.

Marital status,income by census tract, and insurance appear to be theprimary mediators of this difference, as it was no longerpresent when these factors were added into the model. In-deed, as shown in the same analysis, those who were marriedwere 20% more likely to receive GCC, and blacks were lesslikely to be married. Given that radiation therapy usually requires daily hospital visits for 6 weeks, it is not surprising thatmarried women, with marital status being a proxy for socialsupport, were more likely to receive GCC. These ndings aresupported by other studies which show that being married is animportant predictor of not only receiving recommended thera-pies, but also stage at diagnosis and mortality. 24-26 Evidence suggests that controlling for reporting hospi- tal is important in studies of racial disparities in treatment,given that some treatments may be less rapidly adopted bycertain hospitals, which may serve a disproportionate numberof a given racial or ethnic group. 30However, our study did not nd that controlling for this variable signicantly changed the results with respect to the primary predictor variable, race. Our study has several limitations. The MCR does not collect information on comorbidity so we cannot exclude thepossibility that lack of appropriate treatment was a functionof increased comorbid illness. The use of census track fordening poverty level could be confounded by other issues that are related to neighborhood of residence, such as atti-tudes or knowledge about treatment. In addition, research hasshown that race and ethnicity plays a role in both patientrefusal of recommended treatment and in health care provid-ers not offering treatment. 31-33However, our data did not allow us to determine if such preferences were important. Additionally, prognostic variables such as hormone receptorstatus were not available for the mortality analysis. Black women may be more likely to have hormone receptor negativetumors than whites, 34and since such tumors have a poorer prognosis, such a biologic difference may help explain the mortality disparity seen. Some studies have shown that blackwomen are less likely to receive adjuvant hormonal treatmenteven after controlling for hormone receptor status. 23,35There - fore, it is possible that decreased receipt of such recom-mended therapy may explain the mortality differences ob-served in our study. Finally, because this study analyzesMassachusetts data only, the results may not generalize toother states. In summary, our study demonstrates that in early-stage invasive breast cancer, being a black non-Hispanic woman isan independent risk factor for disease-specic mortality, andthat this disparity is not fully explained by differences inreceipt of guideline concordant cancer care or availablemeasures of socioeconomic status. In addition, we found thatmarital status, income, and insurance were the primary me-diators of racial differences in receipt of GCC. Our ndingssupport the notion that racial differences previously reportedare a result of a complex interplay of both sociodemographicand tumor characteristics, and that attention to reducingsociodemographic barriers to care may influence receipt ofrecommended treatments and survival.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Rebecca Silliman, Wee Lock Ooi, Cynthia Boddie-Willis, Jane Mendez, Michael Winter, andTimothy Lash for their valuable contributions to this manu-script.

Introduction Face-to-face encounters with a health provider - in conjunction with written instructions - remains one of the best methods for communicating health information to patients in general, butespecially those with low health literacy [1-4] . Face-to-face consultation is effective because providers can use verbal and nonverbal behaviors, such as head nods, hand gesture, eye gaze cues and facial displays to communicate factual information to patients, as well as to communicate empathy [5]and immediacy [6]to elicit patient trust. Face-to-face conversation also allows providers to make their communication more explicitly interactive by asking patients to do, write, say, or show something that demonstrates their agreement and understanding [7]. Finally, face- to-face interaction allows providers to dynamically assess apatient's level of understanding based on the patient's verbal and nonverbal behavior and to repeat or elaborate information as necessary [8]. However, there are several pervasive problems that limit a clinician's capacity to communicate effectively. Providers can onlyspend a limited amount of time with each patient [9]. Time pressures can result in patients feeling too intimidated to ask questions. Another problem is that of ''delity'': providers do not always perform in accordance with recommended guidelines, resulting in signicant variation in the delivery of health information. Given the efcacy of face-to-face consultation, a promising approach for conveying health information to patients with limited health literacy is the use of computer animated agents that simulate face-to-face conversation with a provider [10]. The benets of using conversational agents include: use of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors that signify understanding and mark signicance, and convey information in redundant channels of information (e.g., hand gestures, such as pointing, facial display of emotion, and eye gaze); use of of verbal and nonverbal communicative behaviors to maximize comprehension;Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 315-320 ARTICLE INFO Article history: Received 15 September 2008 Received in revised form 8 February 2009 Accepted 9 February 2009 Keywords: Health literacy Computer agentRelational agentInformed consentABSTRACT Objective: Patients are commonly presented with complex documents that they have difculty understanding. The objective of this study was to design and evaluate an animated computer agent to explain research consent forms to potential research participants. Methods: Subjects were invited to participate in a simulated consent process for a study involving a genetic repository. Explanation of the research consent form by the computer agent was compared toexplanation by a human and a self-study condition in a randomized trial. Responses were compared according to level of health literacy. Results: Participants were most satised with the consent process and most likely to sign the consent form when it was explained by the computer agent, regardless of health literacy level. Participants with adequate health literacy demonstrated the highest level of comprehension with the computer agent- based explanation compared to the other two conditions. However, participants with limited healthliteracy showed poor comprehension levels in all three conditions. Participants with limited health literacy reported several reasons, such as lack of time constraints, ability to re-ask questions, and lack of bias, for preferring the computer agent-based explanation over a human-based one.Conclusion: Animated computer agents can perform as well as or better than humans in the administration of informed consent. Practice implications: Animated computer agents represent a viable method for explaining health documents to patients. /C2232009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This latter point is particularly important as health providers frequently fail to elicit patients' questions, and patients with limited health literacy are even less likely than others to ask questions [12]. According to the 2004 National Assessment of Adult Literacy, fully 36% of American adults have limited health literacy skills, with even higher rates of prevalence among patients with chronic diseases, those who are older, minorities, and those who have lower levels of education [13,14] . Seminal reports about the problem of health literacy include a sharp critique of current norms for overly complex documents in health care such as informed consent [15,16] . Indeed, a signicant and growing body of research has brought attention to the ethical and health impact of overly complex documents in healthcare [17,18] . Computer agents may provide a particularly effective solution for addressing this problem, by having the agents describe health documents to patients using exemplary communication techniques for patients with limited health literacy and by providing this information in a context unconstrained by time pressures. Informed consent agreements for individuals to participate in medical research represent a particular challenge for individuals with limited health literacy to understand, since they typically encode many subtle and counter-intuitive legal and medical concepts. They are often written at a reading level that is far beyond the capacity of most subjects [19,20] . Researchers may not have the resources to ensure that participants understand all theterms of the consent agreement. Indeed, many potential research subjects sign consent forms that they do not understand [21-23] . Consequently, we modied an existing computer agent frame- work designed for health counseling [10,11] to provide explana- tion of health documents such as research informed consent forms. In this paper we describe the development of this agent, and then present a preliminary evaluation of the computer agent in a three- arm randomized trial in which the agent explains an informed consent document for participation in a genetic repository. 2. Methods2.1. Preliminary studies. Part 1. Health document explanation by human experts We conducted two empirical studies to characterize how human experts explain health documents to their clients in face- to-face interactions [24]. The rst study was conducted with four different experts explaining two different health documents to research confederates. The second study was conducted with one expert explaining health documents to three laypersons with different levels of health literacy. Our primary focus was a micro- analysis of the nonverbal behavior exhibited by the expert in order to inform the development of a computational model of document explanation. We found that one kind of nonverbal behavior was nearly ubiquitous: the use of pointing gestures towards the document by the expert ( Fig. 1 ). Of the 1994 expert utterances analyzed, 26% were accompanied by a hand gesture, and 90% of these involved pointing at the document. We derived a predictive model of the occurrence and form of referential hand gestures and other nonverbal behavior used by the experts during their explanations. We found that initial mentions of part of a document were more likely to be accompanied by apointing gesture (43% vs. 19%) and that the kind of document object referred to (page vs. section vs. word or image) was predictive of the kind of hand gesture used (e.g., using a flat hand to refer to a page vs. pointing with a nger to refer to a word). We also found that the expert in the second study omitted a signicant amount of detail and used more scaffolding (description of document structure) when describing a health document to listeners with low health literacy, compared to listeners with adequate health literacy. 2.2. Preliminary studies. Part 2. Adapting a computer agent for health document explanation An existing computer agent framework designed for health counseling [10,11] was modied to provide explanation of health documents. The framework features an animated computer agent whose nonverbal behavior is synchronized with a text-to-speech engine( Fig.2 ).Patientcontributionstotheconversationaremadevia a touch screen selection from a multiple choice menu of utterance options, updated at each turn of the conversation. Dialogues are scripted using a custom hierarchical transition network-based scripting language. Agent utterances can be dynamically tailored based on information about the patient, information from previous conversations, and the unfolding discourse context [10].T h e animated agent has a range of nonverbal behaviors that it can use, including: hand gestures, body posture shifts, gazing at and away fromthepatient,raisingandloweringeyebrows,headnods,different facial expressions, and variable proximity. The framework was extended for document explanation in several ways. A set of animation system commands was added to allow document pages to be displayed by the character ( Fig. 2 ), with page changes accompanied by a page-turning sound. A set of document pointing gestures was added so that the agent could be commanded to point anywhere in the document with either a pointing hand or an open hand. While the document is displayed, the agent can continue using its full range of head and facial behavior, with gaze-aways modied so that the agent looks at the document when not looking at the patient (in our studies of human experts, the expert gazed at the document 65% of the time and at the patient 30% of the time). We also extended our text-to- embodied-speech translation system (''BEAT'' [25]) to automati- cally generate document pointing gestures given the verbal content of the document explanation script, based on models from our earlier studies [24]. We conducted a preliminary study of the document explana- tion agent in a three-arm randomized trial with 18 participants Fig. 1. Explanation of consent by experts.T.W. Bickmore et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 315-320 316Author's personal copy aged 19-33, in which each participant experienced two of the three conditions. We compared agent-based health document explanation with explanation by human experts and a self-study condition. While there were no signicant effects of study condition on comprehension of the documents (measured bypost-intervention knowledge tests), the participants who inter- acted with both the agent and human were signicantly more satised with the agent (paired t(5) = 2.7, p<.05) and with the overall experience (paired t(5) = 2.9, p<.05), compared to the human [24]. 2.3. Part 3. Evaluation of computer agent for explanation of research informed consent While the preliminary study provided feedback on the promise of using agents for health document explanation, it lacked ecological validity because the participants were primarily college students who had a fairly high level of health literacy. Thus, the primary purpose of the third research activity was to repeat the pilot evaluation with a population in which limited health literacy is represented. We conducted an evaluation study to test the efcacy of our agent-based document explanation system, compared with a standard of care control (explanation by a human) and a non- intervention control (self-study of the document in question) for individuals with adequate and inadequate health literacy. The study was a three-arm (COMPUTER AGENT vs. HUMAN vs. SELF) between-subjects randomized experimental design. An interaction script was created to present an informed consent form for participation in a genetic repository, based on the preliminary work described above. The consent document used was taken with minor revisions from an existing National Institute of General Medical Sciences template for genetic repository research that has been used in multiple NIH funded projects [26]. The example of a study involving a genetic repository was chosen because we wanted little overlap between the simulatedconsent experience and the actual consent document used for participating in the current study, and we wanted material that would be largely foreign to participants to decrease the influence of prior knowledge. In each script, patients could simply advance linearly through the explanation (by selecting ''OK''), ask for anyutterance to be repeated (''Could you repeat that please?''), request major sections of the explanation to be repeated, or request that the entire explanation be repeated. Any number of repeats could be requested and, although the scripting language has the ability to encode rephrasings when an utterance is repeated, for the current study the agent would repeat the exact same utterance when a repeat was requested for any part of the script. The agent was deployed on a mobile cart with a touch screen attached via an articulated arm. 2.3.1. Measures In addition to basic demographics, we assessed health literacy using the 66-word version of the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) [27]. We dened limited health literacy as a reading level of 8th grade and below and adequate health literacy as 9th grade and above for our analyses, as prior authors have done [28-31] . We also created a knowledge test for the consent document, based on the Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol (BICEP) [22]. This test was administered in an ''open book'' fashion with the participant able to refer to a paper copy of the consent form during the test. We augmented the BICEP with scale measures of likelihood to sign the consent document, overall satisfaction with the consent process, and perceived pressure to sign the consent document. In the COMPUTER AGENT and HUMAN conditions, the number of questions or requests for clarications asked by participants during the explanation of the consent document was also counted. 2.3.2. Participants Twenty-nine subjects participated in the study, were recruited via fliers posted around the Northeastern University neighborhood Fig. 2. Computer agent interface.T.W. Bickmore et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 315-320 317Author's personal copy and in a nearby apartment complex whose demographic consisted of mostly older minority adults, and were compensated for their time. Participants had to be 18 years of age or older and able to speak English. Participants were 66% female, aged 28-91 (mean 60.2). Three were categorized as 3rd grade or below, four as 4th- 6th grade, six as 7th-8th grade, and the rest as high school level. 2.3.3. Procedure The study took place either in a common room of the apartment complex or the Human-Computer Interaction laboratory at Northeastern University. After arriving, people who consented to participate lled out a demographic questionnaire and then had the REALM health literacy evaluation administered. Following this, they were exposed to one of three treatments in which a consent document was explained to them by either the COMPUTER AGENT or a HUMAN, or were given time to read the document on their own (SELF). For the COMPUTER AGENT condition, they were given a brief training session on how to interact with the computer agent. The experimenter then gave the participant a paper copy of the consent document so they could follow along with the computer agent's explanation, and left theroom. At the end of the interaction, the computer agent informed the participant that they could take as much time as they needed to review the document before signaling to the experimenter that they were ready to continue. For the HUMAN condition, a second research assistant explained the document to the study partici- pant. Two different female instructors played this second role, and both had signicant experience administering informed consent for research studies. The instructor was blind to the computer agent interaction script content and evaluation instruments, and was simply asked to explain the document in question to the participant. For the CONTROL condition, participants were handed the document and told to take as much time as they needed to read and understand it, and were then left alone in the observation room until they signaled they were ready to continue. The research assistant then verbally administered the knowl- edge test in ''open book'' format, with the participant being able to reference their paper copy during the test. The process measures were then verbally administered and a semi-structured interview was conducted to ask participants about their impressions of the study. 3. Results Of the 29 participants, 13 (45%) had inadequate health literacy. We conducted full-factorial ANOVAs for all measures, with study CONDITION (COMPUTER AGENT, HUMAN, SELF) and health LITERACY (ADEQUATE, INADEQUATE) as independent factors, and LSD post hoc tests when applicable. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the outcome measures. There was a signicant interaction between CONDITION and LITERACY on knowledge test comprehension scores, F(2,23) = 4.41, p<.05 ( Fig. 3 ). Post hoc tests indicated that, for participants with adequate health literacy, explanations by HUMAN and COMPUTERAGENT resulted in signicantly greater comprehension compared to SELF study (with no signicant difference between HUMAN and COMPUTER AGENT). However, for participants with inadequate health literacy, there were no signicant differences on comprehen- sion between study conditions, and they scored signicantly lower as a group compared to participants with adequate health literacy. There was a main effect of study CONDITION on satisfaction with the consent process, F(2,23) = 4.78, p<.05, with participants being signicantly more satised with explanations by the COMPUTER AGENT compared to the HUMAN (participants were also more satised with the COMPUTER AGENT compared to SELF study, with post hoc tests approaching signicance, p= .09). There was also a main effect of study CONDITION on self- reported likelihood to sign the consent document, F(2,32) = 5.46, p<.05, with participants signicantly more likely to sign the consent form following explanation by the COMPUTER AGENT, compared to either explanation by the HUMAN or SELF study. There were no signicant differences between groups on perceived PRESSURE to sign the consent form, F(2,23) = 0.20, p= .72. Finally, it appeared that participants with limited health literacy asked more questions of the computer agent comparedto the human, while those with adequate health literacy asked more questions of the human, although this interaction was not signicant, F(1,13) = 1.76, p= .21 ( Fig. 4 ). 3.1. Qualitative results Participant responses to semi-structured interview questions were transcribed from the videotape and common themes were identied [32]. When asked about their impressions of the computer agent, the most frequently mentioned theme (7 participants) was that the computer agent was clear, direct and easy to understand. OneTable 1 Study results (mean and (S.D.)). Measure Condition Literacy Condition /C2literacy Agent of informed consent.T.W. Bickmore et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 315-320 318Author's personal copy participant explicitly said that this clarity was due to the computer agent's ability to point at the virtual document, with the participant following along: ''She was very direct and very clear when she was explaining it, she was explaining it very nice and slow. And she was pointing to the areas that needed to be focused on. When she was explaining it, she was breaking it down on the paper. Where you couldn't get lost if you were concentrating on what she was saying. Because it was right there in front of you [points at computer] and it's like right here [points on paper document], and it's just she was explaining the whole thing. And I was very comfortable with it because as I was reading it, I understood what she was saying and what I was seeing in front of me.'' (49 year old female, adequate literacy) The second most common impression of the computer agent (4 mentions) was that participants felt they could take as much time as they needed, and did not feel embarrassed asking the computer agent to repeat itself: ''Elizabeth [the name of the agent] was very, uh, patient, and if she says something to you that you don't understand, she will repeat it again if you push the button. And she would take her time.'' (68 year old female, limited literacy). ''For me, you know, when it's on the computer I can do it ve times over if I want to. I can just hit repeat, wait I didn't understand it, I can just repeat it again. You know, but I wouldn't do that with you [a human] because if I didn't understand it I might ask you one time to repeat it, and if I still didn't understand it I wouldn't ask you to repeat it. Because I wouldn't want to seem stupid.'' (47 year old female, adequate literacy). Two participants said that they liked the computer agent because she was polite and did not talk down to them: ''She was really polite, she was really polite. That I liked. Besides the fact, more important than anything else, she looked at me and she talked to me. You know, she was talking to me as a person, as opposed to, um, looking down on me and saying 'did you understand me!' you know? And that made me feel really good.'' (50 year old female, adequate literacy) Other positive comments included that the computer agent was ''informative'' and ''correct'' (2 mentions), that the computer agentwas ''honest'' (1 mention), and that the respondents liked using the touch screen instead of a mouse (1 mention). There were two negative comments about the computer agent. One participant mentioned that the computer agent seemed ''impersonal'', and another felt the computer agent was too ''robotic''. When asked whether they would prefer that health documents be explained to them by a person or a computer agent, 3 of the 9 participants who interacted with the agent said they would prefer the agent, 1 said they would prefer a human, and 1 said that either would be equally acceptable (the others did not respond). For example: ''I think she did the same as talking to an ordinary person in the hospital. Uh, except she would give you a little moreinformation than they do. Because sometimes they only tell you a little bit, you know what I'm saying, and she explain the whole thing.'' (68 year old female, limited literacy). 4. Discussion and conclusion 4.1. Discussion The computer agent did as well as or better than the human on all measures, with participants (regardless of literacy level) reporting higher levels of satisfaction with the consent process and greater likelihood to sign the consent document when it was explained by the computer agent, compared to either explanation by a human or self study. In addition, explanation by the computer agent led to the greatest comprehension of the document, but only for those participants with adequate levels of health literacy; participants with limited literacy scored poorly on comprehension in all treatment conditions. The tendency for participants with inadequate health literacy to ask more questions of the agent may be due to their being comfortable asking a computer repeated questions without feeling ''stupid'' (as one participant put it). However, an alternate hypothesis is that they asked more questions of the agent because they had a more difcult time understanding it. The low comprehension scores for participants with inadequate health literacy indicate that much work remains to make the computer agent effective for this population. One pedagogical methodology espoused for patients with limited health literacy is ''teach back'' in which the patient is asked to teach what they have learned back to the health educator [7]. While there are some problems implementing this in an unconstrained way within our system, it is at least possible to add comprehension checks at key places in the agent-patient conversation and to have the computer agent provide additional information or review if it appears the patient is having problems. Limitations of our study include the generalizability of our ndings, especially given the very small convenience sample used. The research assistants who explained the consent forms to participants may not be representative of most researchers who perform this function. There are also ecological validity issues with our study settings, although we would expect that in a rushed clinical environment the agent may outperform a typical research assistant by an even wider margin than we observed. 4.2. Conclusion Our future work is focused on several extensions to the system and more extensive evaluation. We plan to add audio prompts to the user interface so that patients who are unable to read the text of their conversational responses can still use the system. We are also developing a framework that will allow health document Fig. 4. Questions asked of the computer agent or human.T.W. Bickmore et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 315-320 319Author's personal copy templates to be instantiated and explained, so that, for example, consent form ''boilerplates'' can be instantiated with the details of a research study, and the computer agent would be able to explain the document to a patient without further scripting or program- ming. We have also developed the capability for the agent to keep track of specic issues and questions that it could not resolve for the patient, and output these at the end of the session for follow up by a human research assistant or clinician. We also plan to explore the integration of the conversational agent with other multimedia content, such as video clips, to further explain complex topics such as randomization, or numerical concepts like rates\u2014ideas that can be hard to convey verbally. Finally, we plan to replicate the evaluation study in a clinic or hospital environment, where we would expect that the advantages of the computer agent-based approach would be even greater given the time pressures that most human providers are under. 4.3. Practice implications This work suggests that animated computer agents can perform as well as people in explaining health documents to patients. For the administration of informed consent in particular, it is possible to construct computer agents that result in at least as much under- standing of the consent form, satisfaction of the process, and study participation rates compared to the administration of informed consent by human research assistants. Time and cost savings for research studies or medical procedures requiring informed consent could be signicant when large number of patients are involved. The use of this technology may also lead to more ethical treatment of patients through a more controlled administration of informed consent and automated comprehension tests. Conflict of interest The authors have no conflicts of interest that could influence this work.

Wee31, Nancy Ridley32, John Auerbach32, Frank B. Hu32, Leslie Kirle32, Rita B. Buckley32 and Catherine L. Annas32 Rapid shifts in the demographics and techniques of weight loss surgery (WLS) have led to new issues, new data, new concerns, and new challenges. In 2004, this journal published comprehensive evidence-based guidelines on WLS. In this issue, we've updated those guidelines to assure patient safety in this fast-changing field. WLS involves a uniquely vulnerable population in need of specialized resources and ongoing multidisciplinary care. Timely best-practice updates are required to identify new risks, develop strategies to address them, and optimize treatment. Findings in these reports are based on a comprehensive review of the most current literature on WLS; they directly link patient safety to methods for setting evidence-based guidelines developed from peer-reviewed scientific publications. Among other outcomes, these reports show that WLS reduces chronic disease risk factors, improves health, and confers a survival benefit on those who undergo it. The literature also shows that laparoscopy has displaced open surgery as the predominant approach; that government agencies and insurers only reimburse procedures performed at accredited WLS centers; that best practice care requires close collaboration between members of a multidisciplinary team; and that new and existing facilities require wide-ranging changes to accommodate growing numbers of severely obese patients. More than 100 specialists from across the state of Massachusetts and across the many disciplines involved in WLS came together to develop these new standards. We expect them to have far-reaching effects of the development of health care policy and the practice of WLS.

In 2004, the Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction (Lehman Center) formed an Expert Panel to assess WLS procedures, identify issues related to patient safety, and develop evi- dence-based best practice recommendations to address those issues. The resulting document, published as a supplement in Obesity in 2005, set the standard for WLS across the state and well beyond it. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality abstracted the report for broad use, and the American College of Surgeons adopted it as the blueprint for its Bariatric Surgery Network Center Accreditation Program. Its recom- mendations influenced health care policy and medical practice at home and abroad. Since 2004, the literature on WLS has expanded rapidly. New data have been published; new procedures have been devel- oped; and new issues have been brought to our attention. In Massachusetts, weight loss operations increased from over 2,700 in Fiscal Y ear 2003 to nearly 3,500 in Fiscal Y ear 2006 (Figure 2 ). We saw a shift from open to laparoscopic operations, and changes in reimbursement policies. The safety of WLS continues to be of concern. In response, the Lehman Center reconvened the Expert Panel to update the literature review and evidence-based recommendations devel- oped in 2004. Several new members joined the 2007 Expert Panel as well its task groups. All told, there were two additional task groups, bringing the total from 9 to 11. We separated the Psychology Task Group from Multidisciplinary Evaluation and Treatment, and formed a new group, Endoscopic Interventions, to develop best practice guidelines for that emerging technol- ogy. In addition, we changed the name of the Coding and Reimbursement Task Group to Policy and Access to better reflect its focus. The charge to the 2007 Expert Panel was to update the evi dence-based best practice recommendations for WLS devel- oped 3 years ago. Toward that end, its members reviewed weight loss surgical procedures, analyzed the medical literature published since 2004, recommended specific steps to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety, developed credentialing and train- ing standards, identified best practices, and established clinical guidelines and directions for future research. What follows is a comprehensive evidence-based update to the original best practice recommendations. As with the first report, we hope that these guidelines will have far-reaching effects on clinical practice and health care policy, not only in the Commonwealth, but also nationwide. We hope that they will equalize access and reduce variability in performance and outcomes. Ultimately, our objective is to improve the safety of WLS in the state of Massachusetts and protect the well-being of patients who undergo it. More than 100 individuals created this report. I express my deepest appreciation to the Expert Panel and task group members for the monumental work that went into this project. I especially thank George Blackburn, Chair, Matt Hutter, Vice Chair, Frank Hu, our clinical epidemiologist, and Rita Buckley, our librarian and medical editor, for their continued leadership and commitment to this project. Last but not least, I thank the Department of Public Health and Betsy Lehman Center staff, especially our project manager, Leslie Kirle, and Katie Annas for their diligent efforts in coordinating and facilitating the work of this project. Preface Overwhelming data demonstrate a reduction in known dis- ease risk factors and improvements in health after WLS (1-3). Recent studies also indicate that WLS confers a survival advantage on patients who undergo it compared with com-munity controls (1,2). Landmark findings from the Swedish Obese Subjects study show an estimated 28% reduction in the adjusted overall mortality rate in the surgical groups compared with conventionally treated controls (4). Similar outcomes have been cited in other reports. A col- laborative research project in Utah compared 7,925 gastric bypass patients with the same number of age-, gender-, and BMI-matched controls. Data showed that the rate of death from all diseases was 52% lower in the surgery group than in the control group (P < 0.001) (ref. 5).

(6) found a statistically significant sur - vival difference in favor of the surgically treated group. Perry et al . (7) compared a cohort of extremely obese Medicare beneficiaries who underwent WLS to a similar cohort of extremely obese Medicare beneficiaries who did not. At the 2-year follow-up, younger (<65 years old) and older patients (65) in the surgical group had significantly reduced mortal- ity compared with those in the nonsurgical group. Similarly, Sowemimo et al . (8) reported 50-85% mortality reductions with surgical intervention. Decreased total mortality in the Swedish Obese Subjects study (4) surgical groups was primarily due to fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease (especially myocardial infarc- tion) and cancer. In the Utah study (5), significant reductions in mortality were linked to fewer deaths from coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, and cancer. These results, which show substantial and consistent evidence of a survival advan-tage for severely obese patients who undergo WLS, are in line with those of earlier reports by Christou et al . (9) and Flum and Dellinger (10). They also confirm previous case series and epidemiologic observations on mortality after weight loss operations in more diverse populations (1,11). But despite reductions in disease-related mortality after WLS, death rates from other causes, such as accidents and sui-cides, exceed those of nonsurgery patients. In Adams et al. (5), rates of death not caused by disease were 58% higher in the surgery group than in the control group. Reports reveal that a substantial number of severely obese persons have unrecog-nized presurgical mood disorders or post-traumatic stress dis-order, or have been victims of childhood sexual abuse (12). Data on the association between presurgical psychological status and postsurgical outcomes are limited (13). Although research shows an improved quality of life (QOL) after gas- tric bypass surgery (14-17), certain unrecognized presurgical conditions may reappear after surgery (18). Some WLS centers recommend that all patients undergo psychological evaluation, and, if necessary, treatment before surgery and psychologically related surveillance postoperatively (12,13,19). Adams et al. (5) note the need for further research on the optimal approach to evaluating candidates for WLS, including possible presurgical assessment, psychiatric treatment, and diligent postoperative follow-up. We know from a substantial body of literature that WLS achieves significant and durable weight loss with minimal mortality or complications. We know that laparoscopy short- ens length of stay and makes for a faster, easier recovery (20). Now reliable evidence is starting to accumulate on the survival advantage conferred by WLS on those who undergo it. The field is dynamic (21), with surgical approaches being developed and refined at a rapid pace. Y et technical performance of the opera- tions, critical though it may be, is only one of many challenges. WLS deals with a uniquely vulnerable population in need of specialized resources and ongoing multidisciplinary care. Timely best practice updates are critical to identify new risks, develop strategies to address them, and optimize treatment of WLS patients. As before (22), members of this panel have come together to protect patient safety and prevent medical errors with evidence-based standards of care. This update of best practice guidelines is part of our continued efforts to improve the efficacy and safety of WLS procedures. Background More than 33% of US adults are classified as obese based on objectively measured weight (23), and one-third of American children are either obese or at risk of becoming so (24). Between 2000 and 2005, the proportion of Americans with a BMI 40 increased by 50%, although those with a BMI 50 increased by 75% (25). Severe obesity has been growing at the fastest rate for the past 20 years (23,25). Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, coronary heart disease, and strokes (26,27). In 1998, medical costs attributable to overweight and obesity accounted for 9.1% of total US medical expenditures, and may have reached as high as $78.5 billion ($92.6 billion in 2002 dollars) (28,29). In 2000, there were ~360,000 deaths associated with obesity (30). It has been suggested that in the 21st century, increasing rates of obesity may lead to a decline in overall life expectancy in the United States (31). Methods And Procedures u pdate on common WL s procedures Overview. WLS reduces caloric intake by modifying the anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract via restriction, malabsorption, or a combination of the two techniques. Ensuing changes in the gut-brain axis alter peptides that may regulate appetite and satiety (32) (e.g., ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide, and pancreatic polypeptide). Among the several competing approaches for the management of severe obesity, the general trend is toward combined restrictive-malabsorptive procedures (33). Over the past few decades, the number of weight loss surgeries performed in the United States has increased significantly (34,35). Between 1998 and 2004, weight loss operations rose by 900% to 121,055 (ref. 36). In 2006, the estimated total climbed to 200,000 (refs. 20,25). Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is considered the gold standard operation for long-term weight control in United States (35,37). Rates of RYGB per 100,000 adults rose significantly from 1998 to 2002, from 7.0 to 38.6. This increase may be attributed, in part, to improved surgical techniques, better patient outcomes, and growing popularity of the procedure (38). LAGB is the second most commonly performed operation in the United States. Despite rapid growth in LRYGB and other weight loss procedures, only an estimated 1% of patients who are eligible for WLS receive it in any given year (39). common WL s procedures LRYGB. Gastric bypass involves the creation of a small (20-30 ml) gastric pouch and a Roux limb (typically 75-105 cm) (34) that reroutes a portion of the alimentary tract to bypass the distal stomach and proximal small bowel ( Figure 3 ). Following LRYGB, a pleio- tropic endocrine response may contribute to improved glycemic control, appetite reduction, and long-term changes in body weight (40). LYRGB also has a profoundly positive impact on obesity- related comorbidities and QOL (41). Other advantages include established long-term effectiveness for sustained weight loss, reduction of comor - bidities, minimal risk for long-term nutritional sequelae, and effective relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease (21). LRYGB is not without risks. Common causes of death include pulmonary embolism and anastomotic leaks. Nonfatal perioperative complications include obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 845articles intervention and Prevention venous thromboembolism, wound infections, small bowel obstruc- tion, and bleeding. Postoperative gastrointestinal complications include nausea and vomiting, micronutrient deficiencies, (35) and possible weight regain (22). LAGB. LAGB involves the placement of a band or collar around the upper stomach 1-2 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, thereby creating an ~30 ml upper gastric pouch. Degree of stomach constriction can be adjusted by modifying the amount of saline injected into a subcutaneous port, which is linked to a balloon within the band (34) ( Figure 4 ). Parikh et al. (42) found that LAGB had fewer and less severe complications compared with LRYGB or laparoscopic malabsorptive procedures. But other data link LAGB with intermedi-ate and long-term complications (e.g., band erosion or slippage, fail-ure to achieve or maintain weight loss) that require reoperation in up to 20% of patients (43,44). Biliopancreatic limb Alimentar y limb Common channel Figure 5 Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) with duodenal switch. BPD creates malabsorption by maintaining a flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the biliopancreatic limb. The procedure is commonly performed with a duodenal switch in which a distal, common-channel length of small intestine severely limits caloric absorption. The extent of malabsorption is thought to be a function of the length of the common channel. (Reprinted with permission of Atlas of Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery, Jones et al. Cine-Med, 2008.)

Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) cre- malabsorption by maintaining flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the biliopancreatic limb (45). The procedure is commonly performed with a duodenal switch (DS) in which a distal, common- channel length of small intestine severely limits caloric absorption (35). The extent of malabsorption is thought to be a function of the length of the common channel (34). The procedure is combined with a sleeve gas-trectomy (SG) in which the greater curvature of the stomach is resected, creating a tubular section along the lesser curvature of the stomach (34) ( Figure 5 ). The BPD described by Scopinaro (45) is capable of pro- ducing substantial and sustained weight loss, perhaps associated with markedly suppressed ghrelin levels (46). However, increased incidence of stomal ulceration, severe protein-energy malnutrition, diarrhea, and dumping has limited its broad acceptance (21). Laparoscopic SG. Laparoscopic SG (LSG) is a new purely restrictive treatment for severe obesity. The technique consists of the restric- tive component of the DS, a resection of the greater curvature of the stomach over a 45-50 F bougie positioned along the lesser curvature. The pylorus and part of the antrum are preserved, resulting in a lesser curvature-based \"restrictive\" gastric sleeve (21) ( Figure 6 ). Early reports of SG have shown it to be safe and effective (47,48), with marked weight loss and significant reduction of major obesity-related comorbidi-ties (49,50). LSG can be performed as a stand-alone operation or as a bridge to more complex WLS. Following the operation, the stomach empties its contents rapidly into the small intestine, but with little or no vomiting (characteristic of restrictive procedures) (51). There is also a significant reduction in ghrelin associated with resection of the gastric fundus, the predominant area of human ghrelin production (46,52). Framework for evidence-based recommendations We divided the 35-member Expert Panel into 11 task groups: Surgical Care (53). Multidisciplinary Evaluation and Treatment (54). Behavior and Psychological Care (55). Pediatric/Adolescent (56). Anesthetic Perioperative Care and Pain Management (57). Nursing Perioperative Care (58). Informed Consent and Patient Education (59). Policy and Access (Coding and Reimbursement) (60). Specialized Facilities and Resources (61). Data Collection (Registries)/Future Considerations (62). Endoscopic Interventions (63). Panel members joined one or two task groups, each with an assigned coordinator. Participants were asked to update recommendations from the first Lehman Center report (22) based on the best available evi- dence, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and expert opinion. A medical librarian performed systematic litera- ture reviews for each group. Searches were limited to English-language studies published between April 2004 and May 2007 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Some groups also searched other databases (e.g., CINHAL). The process used to extract data, assess the literature, and grade evidence has been previously described (22). Each task group prepared a critical summary of its literature review and developed updated best practice recommendations (individual studies are published in this issue of Obesity ) based on the most current evidence. Their reports were reviewed and approved by the Expert Panel. This Executive Report, a summary of key recommendations from all the task groups, was approved by the Expert Panel at its final meeting on 19 July 2007. resu L ts And dI scuss I on s ummary of evidence-based recommendations I. s urgical c are The Surgical Care Task Group identified >135 papers; the 65 most relevant were reviewed in detail (53). These included randomized control trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, meta-analyses, case reports, prior systematic reviews, and expert opinion. A. overview RYGB remains the predominant gold standard WLS in the United States, accounting for 93% of all such operations in 2000 (ref. 64). LAGB is the second most commonly performed procedure (65,66). RYGB is known to safely improve or reverse obesity-related comorbidities and produce significant long-term weight loss (21). Long-term data on weight loss after LAGB vary (42,67,68). B. types of WL s Combination procedures. Combination procedures join a res - trictive component (e.g., gastric stapling) with some form of duodenal bypass. They include RYGB, BPD, and DS. RYGB (open and laparoscopic): Most gastric opera- tions are now done laparoscopically. LRYGB reduces pulmo- nary, wound, hernia-related complications, and postoperative pain (category B), but may have higher internal hernia rates than RYGB (category C). Weight loss is similar with both approaches (category B). RYGB modifications: Long-limb RYGB and very very long- limb extend the length of the Roux limb to enhance weight loss. The procedures may increase risk of protein and micronutrient deficiencies (category C); it has yet to be determined whether they produce superior weight loss (category C). Banded RYGB may be subject to long-term complications related to reintervention, reoperation, and QOL (categories C and D). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommenda-tion (category D). Long-term drawbacks of mini-gastric bypass might include bile reflux and the need for revisional surgery (category C). As with banded RYGB, more data are needed to develop recommendations. BPD and DS: BPD and DS produce effective weight loss (category B). In patients with a BMI >50, it may be superior to that achieved with RYGB (category C). However, the pro- cedures may increase severe complications (e.g., protein and micronutrient deficiencies) (category B). They also require diligent lifelong patient follow-up (category D). Restrictive procedures. Restrictive WLS (e.g., LAGB) has no malabsorptive or maldigestive components. LAGB: Short-term data show promising outcomes with LAGB, but long-term studies raise questions on durability and reoperative rates (category B). We recommend monitoring of long-term data and continuation of current practice patterns, with yearly follow-up of patients (category D). LAGB should be performed in accredited, multidiscipli- nary settings by experienced surgeons. They should have advanced laparoscopic skills, including those needed to revise LAGB to an alternate procedure. Barring that, WLS programs should be able to provide appropriate referrals to facilities that can provide that level of care (category D). It is safe for obesity medicine specialists, nurse practitioners, obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 847articles intervention and Prevention physician assistants, residents, and bariatric nurse special- ists to adjust bands under the supervision of a weight loss surgeon (category D). LSG: Several short-term studies suggest safe and effective weight loss with LSG (categories B and C), but long-term data on safety and efficacy are needed to recommend the approach as anything other than investigational (category D). If other WLS options are ruled out for reasons of preference or safety, LSG may be considered (category D). Vertical banded gastroplasty: Vertical Banded Gastroplasty is associated with increased peri- and postoperative com-plications compared with LAGB. Evidence suggests that it should not be used as a primary surgical treatment for obesity (categories A and B). However, it can be considered when alternative weight loss surgeries are not safe or possible (category D). c. revision of WL s Revisional WLS can address unsatisfactory weight loss or complications after primary WLS. It may also enhance weight loss and further improve comorbidities (category B). Complications, length of stay, and mortality are higher for revisional WLS (category B), but it can be safe and effec- tive when performed by experienced weight loss surgeons (category D). d. Intraoperative techniques We recommend the following as standard practice: testing of gastrojejunal anastomosis for leaks intraopera- tively or within 48 h (category C); strong consideration of whether to close mesenteric defects to avoid internal hernia (category C). e. Patient selection Emerging issues in patient selection include treatment of those with a BMI >50 and individuals >age 60. Although procedure- specific recommendations for extremely obese patients have yet to be determined (category C), the literature suggests that combination procedures (e.g., RYGB, BPD, DS) lead to greater excess weight loss and resolution of comorbidities than restric- tive procedures (e.g., LAGB) (category D). Age may remain an independent risk factor following WLS (category C), but evidence suggests that WLS can be safe and effective in patients >60 (categories B and C). We recommend that older patients not be denied improvements in health and QOL associated with WLS (category D). F. Facility and surgeon credentialing standards The following are best practice updates to guidelines in our prior report (69). These recommendations are all based on category D evidence, unless otherwise noted. Facilities All WLS centers should have, or be in the process of obtaining, accreditation by external review; they should meet WLS volume standards specified by cre- dentialing bodies; centers with lower volume should be endorsed if risk- adjusted outcomes fall within benchmarks determined by credentialing body data. Surgeon\u2014credentialing General requirements: All surgeons seeking WLS credentials for the first time should complete an accredited general surgery program and be board-certified, board-eligible, or the equivalent; have documented training in the fundamentals of WLS, including pre-, peri-, and postoperative care of the WLS patient. Open privileges: Most weight loss surgeries are performed laparoscopically. Those who want only open privileges should complete the general credentialing requirements above, and be proctored by an experienced weight loss surgeon until proficient; have their first 10 cases reviewed by the chief of service and an experienced weight loss surgeon; count fellowship cases toward individual surgeon volume requirements. Full privileges (open and laparoscopic): It is no longer prac- tical to require specific and mandatory experience in open WLS prior to applying for laparoscopic privileges. Those seeking full laparoscopic privileges should complete the gen- eral requirements and a laparoscopic fellowship of 50 WLS procedures. As an alternative, they can be proctored for a minimum of 25 cases by an experienced (70) (>200 laparo- scopic cases) weight loss surgeon with full privileges. In addi-tion, surgeons should have their first 10 cases reviewed by the chief of staff and an experienced weight loss surgeon; count fellowship cases toward individual surgeon volume requirements. Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery certification is also highly recommended for newly trained laparoscopic surgeons. Surgeon\u2014recredentialing Institutions should develop in-house standards for recredentialing based on procedure-specific and risk-adjusted outcomes (benchmarks) rather than volume alone. An annual volume of 25 cases may be sufficient if outcomes are within accepted standards, reported to a central database, and performed at an accredited institution. Weight loss surgeons should complete at least 12 CME credits related to WLS or obesity every 2 years.848 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention Procedure-specific credentialing. Rapid changes in technologies and techniques warrant disclosure of procedure-specific infor - mation to patients, and selection of those with lower risk profiles for the first 25 cases. As part of the educational process, surgeons should disclose the type and approximate number of procedures they per- form (category D); alternative WLS options available (category D); risks, potential benefits, and program outcomes (category D). II. Multidisciplinary e valuation and t reatment The Multidisciplinary Care Task Group identified over 150 abstracts related to WLS in general, and to medical, nutri-tional, and multidisciplinary care in particular; 112 of these studies were reviewed in detail (54). A. Multidisciplinary care The American Society for Bariatric Surgery recently changed its name to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, reflecting growing knowledge that WLS has benefits beyond the treatment of severe obesity. This change expands the scope of multidisciplinary expertise required to provide optimal care for WLS patients. As the nature of multidiscipli-nary care changes, we recommend development of uniform minimum standards of multidis- ciplinary care for WLS patients (category D); further research on the effectiveness of general medical, surgical, anesthetic, nutritional, and psychological aspects of multidisciplinary treatment (category D). B. Preoperative education and patient selection Preoperative education allows for more appropriate match-ing of patients and procedures. It can dispel misperceptions and unrealistic expectations, and help clarify issues related to resolution of comorbid conditions, differences between sur - gical procedures, and required lifestyle changes after WLS (category D). c. operative risk Higher BMI and medical comorbidities (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and coronary heart disease risk factors) increase operative risk and postoperative complications. We recommend assessment of risk factors (71) in each patient (category C). Preoperative weight loss. Preoperative weight loss of 5-10% of initial body weight can decrease operation time and may reduce surgical risk. Patients, especially those with a BMI 50, should be encouraged to achieve weight loss of 5-10% of initial body weight prior to surgery (category C). Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to determine optimal preoperative weight loss and improve supervision of preoperative weight reduction (category C).Medical evaluation. Specific consideration should be given to WLS patients with a history of CAD or DVT/PE, those who are current smokers, and those with known or suspected abnormal liver function. Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment may also be useful, but more evidence is needed to determine its impor - tance. Other risk factors include postprandial hypoglycemia, chronic renal disease, and HIV . CAD: Patients with a history of CAD should receive preoper - ative assessment of cardiovascular conditions as indicated (cat- egory C). Those with stable or suspected CAD should receive perioperative blockade unless contraindicated (category C). Abnormal liver function: Patients with known or suspected liver disease should be evaluated to assess severity of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension (category B). Intraoperative liver biopsy at the time of surgery may be useful for diagnosis and assessment of liver disease (category C). WLS is not recom- mended in patients with Child's Class C cirrhosis (category B). DVT/PE: We recommend perioperative use of anticoagu - lants and sequential compression devices to reduce the risk of DVT/PE unless clinically contraindicated (category B). In patients with increased risk of DVT/PE extended prophylaxis should also be considered (category D). Smokers: Smokers should be strongly encouraged to stop smoking prior to WLS (category B). Smoking cessation advice and treatment should be available at the institution or through the WLS program (category D). Hypoglycemia: Patients with known or suspected hypoglyc- emia should be assessed by an endocrinologist prior to WLS. In that gastric bypass surgery is already being used to treat dia- betes (72), purely restrictive procedures should be considered for WLS patients with a documented history of hypoglycemia (category D). Chronic renal disease: Pre- and postoperative monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients with diabetes and hypertension (categories A and B). Patients with significant renal disease should be evaluated by a nephrologist prior to WLS (category D). Special consideration should be given to pre- and postoperative monitoring of fluid and intravascular volume status (category A). HIV infection: Patients with HIV should be evaluated by an infectious disease specialist prior to WLS (category D). Special consideration should be given to preoperative assessment of viral loads, CD4 counts (category D), and weight gain from antiretroviral medications (category D). d. nutrition Preoperative and postoperative micronutrients. WLS, especially malabsorptive procedures, can cause multiple micronutrient deficiencies. Patients should be monitored pre- and postopera-tively for deficiencies in vitamin D, thiamine, calcium (includ-ing PTH), iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid, with repletion as indicated (categories A, B, and C). e. exercise and physical activity WLS patients should be encouraged to increase pre- and post- operative physical activity (category D) and low-to-moderate obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 849articles intervention and Prevention intensity exercise (category A). Guidance and periodic moni- toring should be used to help WLS patients remain physically active (category D). F. Pregnancy WLS should not be performed in patients who are known to be pregnant; we strongly recommend preoperative testing for women of childbearing age (category C). Patients should be strongly counseled to not get pregnant for at least 18 months after surgery (category C). G. Post-WL s body contouring Post-WLS body contouring is an emerging field. The task group identified and reviewed in detail 80 relevant articles, ranging from case reports and expert opinion to prospective randomized trials. Insurance coverage. Body contouring should generally be reserved until a patient has achieved a stable weight. This usually happens at 18 months (or more) after WLS. There are no widely accepted guidelines for insurance coverage of body contouring after substantial weight loss. We recommend third party cover - age of excess skin excision, if medically indicated (category D). Surgeon criteria. Body contouring should only be performed by board-eligible or board-certified surgeons with training and experience in the relevant procedures (category D). III. Behavioral and Psychological c are The Behavioral and Psychological Care Task Group identified 17 papers; the 13 most relevant were reviewed in detail (55). These included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, meta-analyses, case reports, and prior systematic reviews. A. Patient selection and preoperative evaluation WLS patients are an emotionally vulnerable population. All candidates for WLS should undergo psychosocial evaluation by a credentialed expert in psychology and behavior change (category C). Evaluations should be carried out by a social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist with a strong background in the current literature on obesity and WLS, and some experi-ence in the pre- and postoperative assessment and care of WLS patients (category D). Though not essential, it is preferable that the evaluator be on staff or affiliated with the WLS center to facilitate communication, maintain the support network, and provide continuity of care (category D). To address long-term complications, mental health resources should be made available to patients beyond the standard post- operative period of 6 months (category D). This recommenda- tion can be met in a variety of ways (e.g., staff mental health professional, referral network). Mental illness, including eating pathology, should not nec- essarily be a contraindication to WLS. Evaluations should determine the degree to which mental illness, including eat- ing pathology, may jeopardize the safety or efficacy of WLS (category C). They should be used to identify patients in need of preoperative psychosocial intervention, and develop recom- mendations on if, how, and when to best address significant psychosocial risk factors (category C). Psychological assessment and support have become essential components of multidisciplinary care in WLS. We recommend that organizations that provide education on obesity and WLS (e.g., North American Association for the Study of Obesity) offer continuing education units to mental health providers. This will facilitate the development of continuing education standards for mental health specialists in the fields of obesity and WLS (category D). B. Binge eating disorder Binge eating disorder in patients seeking WLS is clinically impor - tant, especially in the long-term. It should be taken into account in the development of treatment plans. Assessment should be done in a standardized, empirically validated way (e.g., screening with EDE-Q and follow-up with a brief, standardized inter - view based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) (category C). The disorder should not be considered a contraindication for WLS, but rather, a potential complication that may need to be addressed before or after surgery to ensure optimal outcome (category C). Patients should know that eating pathology can recur after WLS, and that they may need professional help to deal with recurring patterns of binge eating. This disorder should be included in the informed consent process and as part of the WLS program's standard educational component (category C). c. night eating syndrome In that there is no clear evidence that night eating syndrome has any impact on surgical outcome, the condition should not be considered a contraindication for WLS. Rather, it should be seen as a potentially complicating factor that may need to be addressed before or after surgery to ensure optimal outcome (category D). d. emotional eating Data are insufficient to make recommendations on the assess-ment and treatment of emotional eating. As with night eating syndrome, the issue should be considered a potentially com- plicating factor that may need to be addressed before or after WLS to assure optimal outcome (category D). e. substance abuse Findings on the prevalence of substance abuse among those seeking WLS are conflicting, and there are few studies on the subject. Evidence is insufficient to conclude that the problem is a frequent one after WLS. Further research is needed to estab- lish the prevalence of substance abuse after WLS as well as its predictors, its relation to surgical outcome, and effective treat-ment approaches (category D). F. Psychotropic medications Data indicate significantly higher use of psychotropic medica- tions in WLS patients compared with the general population. 850 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention Further research is needed to determine the relation between various psychotropic medications and their impact on postop-erative weight loss and psychosocial adjustment (category D). The effects of WLS on the dissolution, absorption, and clini- cal response to psychotropic drugs are not well understood. For this reason, we recommend close postoperative monitoring of WLS patients, especially after gastric bypass (category D). G. Future research needs The needs of future research are adequately powered and controlled prospective trials that examine the relation between psychosocial factors and surgical outcomes; randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of treat- ments to reduce the impact of psychosocial risk factors on outcomes. IV. Pediatric/Adolescent The Pediatric/Adolescent WLS Task Group identified >1,085 papers; 186 of the most relevant were reviewed in detail (56). A. types of surgery RYGB is considered a safe and effective option for extremely obese adolescents as long as appropriate long-term follow-up is provided (category B). The adjustable gastric band has not been approved by the FDA for use in adolescents, and therefore, should be considered investigational. Off-label use can be considered, if done in an IRB-approved study (category C). BPD and DS procedures cannot be recommended in adoles- cents. Current data suggest substantial risks of protein malnutri-tion, bone loss, and micronutrient deficiencies. These nutritional risks are of particular concern during pregnancy. In addition, several late maternal deaths have been reported (category C). SG should be considered investigational; existing data are not sufficient to recommend widespread and general use in adolescents (category D). B. comorbidities Strong indications for WLS in adolescents include estab- lished type 2 diabetes (category B), moderate to severe OSA with AHI 15 (category C), severe and/or progressive NASH (category C), and pseudotumor cerebri (category C). Other indications for WLS in adolescents include mild OSA, mild NASH, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and significantly impaired QOL (categories C and D). All adolescents with obesity should be formally assessed for depression. If found to be depressed, they should be treated prior to WLS (category B). The presence of eating disturbances is not an exclusion criterion for WLS, but adolescents with such disorders should be treated prior to surgery (category B). c. Patient selection When combination procedures are used in adolescents, physi- cal maturity (completion of 95% of adult stature based on radiographic study) should be documented. In most cases, this criterion will limit surgery to children over age 12 (category D). Psychological maturity\u2014demonstrated by understanding of the surgery, mature motivations for the operation, and compli- ance with preoperative therapy\u2014should be assessed prior to WLS (category D). BMI cutpoints in children and adolescents who meet other cri- teria should be 35 with major comorbidities (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus, moderate to severe sleep apnea (AHI >15), pseudotu- mor cerebri, or severe NASH) and 40 with other comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, sub- stantially impaired QOL or activities of daily living, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea with AHI 5) (categories B and C). There are no data available to suggest that prolonged preop- erative weight management programs are of benefit to adoles- cents who undergo WLS. However, children and adolescents should demonstrate the ability to comply with treatment regi- mens and medical monitoring before WLS. In many cases, consistent attendance in a prolonged weight management pro-gram will provide important assurance of postoperative com-pliance (category D). Individuals with mental retardation vary in their capacity to demonstrate knowledge, motivation, and compliance; they should, therefore, be evaluated for WLS on a case-by-case basis. For these children, we suggest including an ethicist on the multidisciplinary evaluation team (category D). Others who should be screened on a case-by-case basis include patients with syndromic obesity, endocrine disorders, obesity that appears to be related to the use of weight-promoting medi-cations, and those in whom obesity cannot be controlled through medical interventions and/or carefully designed environmental and behavioral management. Very limited information is avail- able about the outcomes of WLS for such patients (category D). Patients with uncontrolled psychosis (presence of hallucinations and delusions), bipolar disorder (extreme mood lability), or sub- stance use disorders can be considered for WLS on a case-by-case basis after they have been in remission for 1 year (category C). d. team member qualifications Although few hospitals have sufficient volume for a stand-alone pediatric surgical center, the ideal WLS team should include a minimum of four or five professionals who are colocated and have at least one preoperative face-to-face meeting to prepare a treatment plan for each patient (category D). Staff should include surgeon\u2014experienced adult bariatric surgeon or pedi- atric surgeon with bariatric fellowship or the equivalent experience; pediatric specialist\u2014internist or pediatrician with adoles- cent and obesity training and experience; registered dietician\u2014with weight management certifi - cate and experience in treating obesity and working with children and families; mental health professional\u2014with specialty training in child, adolescent, and family treatment, and experience treating eating disorders and obesity;obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 851articles intervention and Prevention coordinator\u2014RN, social worker, or one of the other team members who has the responsibility of coordinating each child or adolescent's care and assuring compliance and follow-up. The ideal setting would be in an adult/pediatric hospital, with a pediatric program partnered with an adult program that has full access to pediatric specialists (category D). A compre-hensive family-based evaluation should be provided to parents seeking surgery for their adolescent children (category D). e. risks and outcomes Early WLS may reduce obesity-related mortality and mor - bidity. However, early timing must be weighed against the patient's possible psychological immaturity and the risk of decreased compliance and long-term follow-up (category C). All adolescents undergoing WLS should be included in pro- spective longitudinal data collection to improve the evidence base for evaluating the risks and benefits of WLS in this age group (category D). Emphasis on compliance strategies, careful monitoring of vitamin and mineral intake, and periodic laboratory surveil- lance to detect deficiencies is crucial (category D). Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies; this group is at substantial risk of developing iron deficiency ane- mia and vitamin B deficiencies during menstruation and preg- nancy (category C), and should receive special attention. Risk of pregnancy increases after WLS. All female adolescents should be informed about increased fertility following weight loss, and possible risks associated with pregnancy during the first 18 months after surgery. They should be counseled to avoid pregnancy during this period, and offered contraception (cat- egory D). In addition to risks for deficiencies of iron, calcium, and vitamin B12 after WLS, adolescents may also be at particu-lar risk for osteopenia and thiamine deficiency (category C). F. Informed consent Informed assent by the adolescent should be obtained sepa- rately from the parents to avoid coercion (as in other pedi-atric chronic illnesses that require surgical intervention) (category D). The patient's knowledge of the risks and benefits of the procedure and the importance of postoperative fol- low-up should be formally evaluated to ensure true informed assent (category C). The parental permission process should include discussion of the risks of adult obesity (category C), available medical treatments (category B), surgical alterna- tives, and the specific risks and outcomes of the proposed WLS in the proposed institution. V. Anesthetic Perioperative c are and Pain Management The Anesthetic Perioperative Care and Pain Management Task Group's literature search yielded 1,788 abstracts, with 162 potentially relevant titles. Following full-text evaluation of the latter, 45 articles were reviewed in detail. Best practice recom- mendations integrate the latest research on obesity and col- laborative multidisciplinary care (57).A. Preoperative evaluation and preparation Mandatory polysomnography for WLS patients has been proposed (category C). However, we recommend that it be used in selected patients as indicated. When uncertain of the indication for such testing, clinical assessment should be supplemented to include gender, waist-to-hip ratio, and neck circumference (category B). Preoperative CPAP treatment should be strongly considered for patients with a polysom- nography diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA (categories B and C). We recommend smoking cessation at least 6 weeks prior to surgery (category C); the WLS program should pro- vide active support to help patients achieve and sustain com-pliance (category D). B. Intraoperative management Induction and emergence. The 30\u00b0 reverse Trendelenburg position prolongs the ability of severely obese patients to tolerate apnea during induction of (category A), and emer - gence from (category D), anesthesia. CPAP of ~10 cm H2O be considered prolong non- hypoxic apnea (category A). Intubating laryngeal mask air - way devices provide an alternative mechanical approach to securing the airway (categories A and B), and may also improve success when attempting ventilation prior to secur - ing the airway. Intubating laryngeal mask airway devices should be included among the alternative airway manage- ment devices immediately available in the operating room (categories A and B). Maintenance of anesthesia. Preoperative oral administration of clonidine (an -2 agonist) to obese patients with OSA is asso- ciated with reduced anesthetic requirements as well as reduced intra- and postoperative opioid requirements. Its use may be considered unless medically or surgically contraindicated (categories A and C). Intraoperative oxygenation. Several methods to improve intra- operative oxygenation during WLS have been evaluated. We recommend initial treatment of intraoperative hypoxemia with recruitment maneuvers and positive end-expiratory pressure while monitoring their potential hemodynamic effects (catego-ries A and B). Other interventions. Postoperative nausea and vomiting in lap- aroscopic WLS patients is related to the volume and rate of intraoperative fluid replacement. To reduce postoperative nau- sea and vomiting, we recommend maintenance of euvolemia (category C). Intraoperative drug dosing. Pharmacodynamic studies in severely obese patients have suggested optimal dosing requirements for different neuromuscular blocking agents. Cisatracurium and rocuronium should be dosed according to ideal body weight during standard induction of general anesthesia (category A). The muscle relaxant succinylcholine should be dosed at 1 mg/ kg total body weight (category A). For target controlled 852 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention infusion (not yet approved in the United States), propofol dose should be calculated to more closely reflect total body weight (category C). c. Postanesthesia care Positive outcomes have been reported with early treatment of postoperative hypoxemia employing noninvasive positive pres- sure ventilatory support (NIV) in nonobese, non-OSA patients at high risk of respiratory failure. A joint decision between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, respiratory therapist, and nurse should determine NIV use on selected WLS patients (categories A, B, and C). LRYGB and LAGB have been performed safely as 23-h stay and outpatient procedures. However, patients with OSA should not be considered candidates for outpatient WLS (category C); we recommend adherence to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of Patients with OSA (category C). Postoperative pain management. Based on new evidence of effi - cacy and safety specific to WLS patients, we recommend use of opioid sparing multimodal analgesic strategies, including local anesthetic wound infiltration and nonsteroidal anti-inflam- matory medications, unless contraindicated (categories A and C). Solutions for thoracic epidural pain management in OSA patients should be opioid-free to reduce the risk of respiratory depression (category C). d. credentialing No evidence indicates that specific credentialing of anesthesia personnel for WLS will improve patient safety or outcomes. We recommend the selection of a board-certified anesthesiolo- gist to coordinate intradepartmental staff education and proc-toring to establish proficiency. This individual will also serve as an interdepartmental liaison to WLS programs and the multi- disciplinary WLS care team (category D). e. Medical error reduction and systems improvement Optimal outcomes require unimpaired intra- and periopera- tive multidisciplinary communication among WLS caregivers (category D). Development of perioperative care pathways for patients with OSA is at an early stage (category C) and needs further refinement for WLS patients. F. Future research needs Research is needed in the following areas: the role and parameters of preoperative OSA treatment for perioperative safety outcomes in WLS; intra- and perioperative prophy - tissue pharmacokinetic assessment; appropriate use of -2 agonists in the perioperative care of WLS patients; strategies for intra- and postoperative glycemic management; impact monitoring of anesthetic effects on outcomes; evidence-based postoperative care guidelines for WLS patients with OSA; optimal anesthetic care for WLS patients with increased BMI, age, and quantity and severity of comorbidities; impact of an organized multidisciplinary care team on WLS safety outcomes; effect of surgical and overall care team pathways to decrease and/or treat perioperative anesthetic and surgi- cal complications. VI. n ursing Perioperative c are A systematic review of MEDLINE, nursing journals, and the CINHAL database for nursing and allied health literature iden- tified >54 papers; the most relevant were reviewed in detail. Recommendations are based on published evidence and the consensus of the Task Group members (58). A. Planning and communication Effective communication between all members of the health care team is paramount in the delivery of quality care. It requires sufficient time for the collection of information from patients, site verification in the operating room, timely and concise reporting of symptoms, and the \"repeating back\" of information exchanged between team members. To optimize communication, we recommend continued development of clinical pathways (category D); an Advanced Practice Nurse or Clinical Bariatric Nurse Specialist on staff in WLS programs (category D); development and fostering of good communication skills between patients and practitioners and between members of the health care team (category D); promotion of collaboration between nurses, physical ther- apists, discharge planners, social workers, nutritionists, and facilitators of support groups (category D). B. Perioperative management Unit-specific triage based on individual comorbidities can pro- mote patient safety (category D). We also recommend use of the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses Bariatric Surgery Guideline (category D) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of Patients with OSA (category C). Preferably, a dedicated operative team of nurses and surgical technicians should regularly assist in WLS procedures (category D). Preventing complications. Risk of venous thromboembolic events after gastric bypass is significant. Other postoperative complications include those associated with monitoring of fluid balance, hypoxemia, anastomotic leak, tachycardia, peripheral nerve injury, and risk of skin irritation, infection, ulceration in skinfolds, and decubitus ulcers. We recommend ambulation on the day of surgery, and deep breathing/coughing (category D); careful positioning to decrease risk of peripheral nerve injury (categories C and D); and education of emergency obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 853articles intervention and Prevention department staff on early and late complications in WLS patients (category D). Perianesthesia. Obese patients present with distinct respiratory care considerations. They should be closely monitored for rapid oxyhemoglobin desaturation and respiratory depression after extubation. Facilities should reference the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses Bariatric Surgery Guideline (category D) and educate staff on pulmonary pathophysiology in obese patients (category D). Postoperative analgesia. The goal of postoperative pain man- agement is to promote participation in activity, ambulation, incentive spirometry, deep breathing, and coughing. Nursing staff should consult with a pharmacist on equianalgesic agents and dosing (category D), and use multimodal, opioid-sparing strategies to keep patients comfortable (category D). c. Patient and staff safety WLS patients move through many areas of hospitals for tests and procedures. Facilities should review each area and its equip- ment to make certain that they can accommodate extremely obese patients. The weight capacity of tables, beds, stretch- ers, and wheelchairs should be clearly marked (categories C and D). A comprehensive ergonomics program, including lifting and transferring equipment, should be used to prevent patient handling injuries (category B). A designated nurse or back injury resource nurse should coordinate equipment selec-tion, maintenance, staff training, and reporting (category D). d. outpatient postoperative nursing follow-up Dehydration, pulmonary embolisms, and anastomotic leaks are the serious conditions most likely to occur in the early dis-charge phase. Later complications can include hyperinsuline- mic hypoglycemia, metabolic bone disease, problems with redundant skin, nutritional deficiencies, suboptimal weight loss, issues with psychosocial adjustment, and pregnancy. Medications and vitamin supplements should be reviewed at each postoperative outpatient visit (categories C and D). Nurses should be knowledgeable about possible late complica-tions, know how to support patients, and be prepared to make referrals to appropriate caregivers (category D). WLS patients should be encouraged to continue treatment through ongoing WLS support groups and networks (categories A and D). e. credentialing The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery has developed national certification criteria for Clinical Bariatric Nurse Specialists. We recommend certification (category D). F. Future research needs Studies are needed in the following areas: clinical pathways for WLS, including emergency departments; comprehensive ergonomics teach-to-goal educational methods for pre- and postop- erative education; program retention tools and outcome measures; nursing research and involvement in pediatric WLS programs. VII. Informed c onsent and Patient e ducation This Task Group's literature search identified 120 papers, 38 of which were reviewed in detail. No articles were specific to informed consent and WLS. Recommendations are extrapo- lated from, and supported by, existing data (59). A. content Risks/complications. Informed consent should include realistic risk estimates that take into account patient factors (category C) and relevant institutional and health provider characteristics that might affect risk (e.g., experience and outcomes for spe- cific WLS procedures) (category B). Short- and long-term risks and complications, and the potential for unknown or unfore- seeable long-term risks, should be discussed (category D). Benefits/effectiveness. Patients should receive realistic estimates of short- and long-term weight loss, including the potential for weight regain and modest benefits (category B). They should also be informed if long-term data (>5 years) are unavailable (category D). They should be advised of the long-term health benefits of weight loss produced by WLS (category B), but also be made aware that not all pre-existing medical and psychosocial con-sequences of obesity (including eating disorders) will improve with WLS (category C). Candidates for WLS should be given realistic estimates for health outcomes if they decline surgical treatment (categories B and C), and be advised of known factors and interventions that might optimize benefits (category D). Informed consent and education should consider patient expectations, the value placed on different outcomes, and the risks each candidate is willing to accept. It should also address unrealistic expectations or other misconceptions patients might have (category C). Consequences. Patients should be advised of required behav- ioral and dietary changes and other reasonable and foresee-able consequences of WLS that could affect health or QOL in a substantive way, e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms, cosmetic effects, nutritional restrictions (category D). B. Alternative treatments Patients should be advised about alternative WLS procedures and nonsurgical treatment options (e.g., medical and behavio-ral) (category C). They should be informed about them even if they are not available through the consenting health provider or institution (category C). c. Patient comprehension Each patient should have their comprehension of the risks, benefits, consequences, and alternatives to WLS evaluated 854 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention (category C). Confirmation of comprehension should be included as a protection for patients engaged in the informed consent process (category C). d. Future research needs Future research is needed to better identify factors that affect short- and long-term outcomes so that patients can be cited appropriate and individualized outcome information. Research should focus on important gaps in knowledge on outcomes and consequences of WLS, and the different approaches that facilitate patient understanding of, and decision making about, WLS. VIII. Policy and Access ( c oding and r eimbursement) The Policy and Access group identified 51 publications in its literature search; the 20 most relevant were examined in detail (60). These included reviews, cost-benefit analyses, and trend and cost studies from administrative databases. A. Policy and access Access disparities (all category D). Public health policy should be aligned with long-term goals for the treatment of severe obesity. Barriers to WLS in populations with high prevalence of severe obesity should be identified and eliminated, and there should be uniform standards of coverage for all WLS candidates. We rec-ommend advocacy for increased access to WLS for underserved regions and population groups; support for community-based efforts to fight health disparities; and public education about the obesity epidemic and the risks/benefits of WLS. Childhood obesity (categories C and D). Sharp increases in child- hood obesity lend urgency to the need to address the problem (category C). Policy initiatives to identify pediatric and adoles- cent populations most likely to benefit from surgical treatment of obesity are needed. Surgical treatment should be considered a potentially effective option for appropriately selected individuals, and there should be uniform standards of coverage for adolescent patients. We need to educate legislators, community leaders, and other stakeholders on the costs and benefits of WLS for extremely obese adolescents, and leverage opportunities for collaboration between teachers, parents, and community leaders (category D). Insurance policies (category A, B, C, and D). Controversial issues include required documentation of prior weight loss attempts through more conservative means; access to WLS for those with a BMI of 35-40 and obesity-related comorbidities; and proof of extreme obesity for at least 5 years. We recommend routine examination of weight loss histories during behav- ioral evaluation to determine whether additional attempts at nonsurgical weight loss are advisable; coverage of WLS for those with a BMI of 35-40 and comorbid conditions that require ongoing treatment (e.g., CPAP , medication); research to characterize weight loss histories of surgical candidates, and explore the relation between dieting his- tory and postoperative outcomes; ongoing collection and dissemination of data on WLS costs, risks, and benefits; collaborative efforts between government, industry, and other stakeholders to promote safe and effective delivery of WLS. Cost-effectiveness issues. Obesity is linked to higher health care costs than smoking or drinking, and plays a major role in disability (category B). Accurate short- and long-term cost savings (and risk/benefits) for employers and insurance com- panies need to be collected and disseminated. Clinical path- ways that reduce unnecessary costs to providers should also be developed (category D). Innovation, evidence-based medicine, and cost containment. The application of standard cost-containment policies to surgical innovations may stifle new developments. We recommend the use of evidence-based medicine to both guide clinical decisions and show reasonable trends for health care cost containment (category C). Legislation. We need to keep legislators apprised of the personal and economic costs of obesity in the communities they serve. Dissemination of evidence-based information on the risks, ben- efits, and cost-effectiveness of WLS can bring these issues to their attention (categories C and D). Stigma (all category D). The highest BMI groups are the fastest growing and the most stigmatized. To address this problem, we recommend targeted education campaigns; community-level public information/education; and sensitivity training for hos- pital personnel. Hospitals should also acquire obese-appropriate products (e.g., gowns, chairs, commodes). B. coding and reimbursement Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allows national coverage for RYGB (open and laparoscopic), LAGB, and BPD with DS (open and laparoscopic). Nationally covered procedures and new 2006 CPT codes are available. c. Potential pathways to new codes Category III and S codes. CPT category III Codes are a tempo- rary set of tracking codes used to identify new and emerging technologies. CPT category III codes (T codes) support data collection on new services and procedures. CPT category III codes may be converted to CPT category I codes if the FDA and CPT Editorial Panel approve the clinical efficacy of the particular service or procedure. Blue Cross/Blue Shield and other commercial payers have developed the category of S codes, which were added to HCPCS Level II to report drugs, services, and supplies. S codes are typically used in conjunc- tion with a nonspecific CPT code. Medicare does not recognize or reimburse for services reported under S codes, and may or may not reimburse for CPT category III codes, depending on the service or procedure. obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 855articles intervention and Prevention Individual commercial insurers may or may not reimburse for S codes or CPT category III codes as medical policies and reimbursement polices are specific to each insurer. d. Issues and recommendations Alignment of reimbursement policies with clinical objectives. Reimbursement policies should reflect the importance of comprehensive, multidisciplinary care. There should be full coverage for medical, nutritional, and psychological preop- erative evaluation as well as pre-, peri-, and postoperative care required by insurers (category D). CPT codes for WLS and related clinical services (all category D). CPT codes for WLS should be updated to reflect current practice. New CPT category I codes should be requested and approved as evidence accumulates in favor of new procedures (e.g., vertical SG, endoscopic interventions). T codes should be considered for evolving technologies, and procedures. The use of T codes may create a pathway for reimbursement by supporting consistent data collection and development of evidence. Evidence indicating that a promising technology or new procedure leads to improved health outcomes could support conversion of category III codes to category I codes. There should be support for the development of appropriate CPT codes for each component of multidisciplinary care (e.g., exercise therapy, pre- and postoperative support groups). Data collection, tracking, and reporting systems. There are several national data collection, tracking, and reporting databases (see Data Collection) (62) as well as proprietary systems. We recom- mend standardized collection, tracking, and reporting of tiered and risk-adjusted data (category D). IX. s pecialized Facilities and r esources The Specialized Facilities and Resources Task Group identi- fied 1,647 papers in its literature search; the 46 most relevant were reviewed in detail (61). These included randomized control trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, meta-analyses, case reports, prior systematic reviews, and expert opinion. A. Personnel All medical and support staff must be adequately trained and credentialed as specified in the following task group reports: Surgical Care (53), Anesthesia Perioperative Care and Pain Management (57), Behavioral and Psychological Care (55), and Nursing Care (58). A team of dedicated medical special-ists\u2014fully aware of the problems and sensitivities of patients with severe obesity\u2014should be readily available, and all per - sonnel (including ancillary and nonclinical staff) should have obesity-specific education focused on sensitivity training. B. equipment All facilities performing WLS, including pediatric WLS cent- ers, require the same equipment. We strongly recommend that WLS centers have well-defined plans for the evaluation and treatment of post-WLS surgery patients with potential com- plications who cannot fit into available diagnostic equipment. Recommended equipment includes the following. Ancillary Wide wheelchairs, stretchers, and walkers. Wide BP cuffs. Biphasic defibrillators. Size-appropriate sequential compression devices. Emergency airway equipment. Wide examination tables bolted to the floor. Scales of appropriate size and capacity. Operating room. Specially equipped operating room and ancil- lary equipment should be available to support patients with severe obesity, including an automated extra-wide operating table with appropriate weight capacity; extra-long abdominal instrument sets; appropriately sized retractors; 43-46 cm laparoscopes. Radiology equipment. Special diagnostic and interventional equipment is required to support and accommodate WLS patients. Such equipment should include CT scanners with 400 lb weight capacity; MRI magnet with 400 lb weight capacity; fluoroscopic equipment with 300 lb capacity that can study patients in a standing position with high beam voltages; interventional facilities available 24 h a day, 7 days a week. c. Physical plant Size-appropriate facilities should be available in both postan esthesia and intensive care units; postoperative, dedi- cated in-patient floors with specially trained personnel should be available. Patient rooms and elevators must have sufficiently wide entrances. Floor-mounted commodes are recommended, but support systems can be used as an alternative. Design of new facilities that will accommodate the WLS patient must comply with the American Institute of Architects Planning and Design Guidelines for Bariatric Healthcare Facilities (73). d. extent of facility changes WLS patients travel throughout hospitals for tests and pro-cedures; there should be size-appropriate accommodations in all in-patient and outpatient points of service. These should include chairs and bathroom facilities, transferring equipment (stretchers and wheelchairs), and monitoring devices. e. Investment Specialized resources for WLS patients require a significant investment, the size of which depends on everything from 856 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention geography to patient population. Capital investments are preferred for renovations to existing facilities, and strongly recommended for new construction. WLS centers with lower volume or storage space problems should consider renting equipment. F. staff injury reduction Health care consistently ranks among the top fields for back injuries. Well-established, agreed-upon, and well-known plans for transferring severely obese patients at all points of care can help reduce injuries. We also recommend that proper equip- ment, as well as training on how to use it, should be immedi-ately available for the transfer of WLS patients. Staff should be well-educated in the use, location, and operation of available lift equipment. Portable equipment is more useful than ceiling lifts, but requires more room clearance. Trained and available on call \"lift team\" alternatives to equipment (as appropriate) should be considered. G. Medical error reduction We recommend dedicated facilities and staff to reduce risk of medical errors, including a dedicated hospital administrator to provide consistent support and oversight. All medical staff should be adequately trained and credentialed in best practice care of WLS patients (53,57,58). A team of designated medi- cal subspecialists, fully aware of the problems and sensitivities of extremely obese patients, should be readily available, and all personnel who interact with WLS patients should attend obesi- ty-specific education programs focused on sensitivity training. h. Medication error reduction Medication guidelines released by the Joint Commission Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in 2004 (ref. 74) emphasize safety. We recommend that facilities follow these recommendations, as well as those specified in our prior report (61). We also recommend an Institutional Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee to oversee WLS medical dosing regimens, and further research on medication use in the WLS patient. I. systems improvements Clinical pathways are required by WLS accreditation programs, such as the American College of Surgeons Bariatric Surgery Center Network Accreditation Program (75). Clinical pathways specific to WLS patients should be established. These should be procedure-specific, updated frequently, and consistent with order sets. Regular meetings by the WLS team to review patient outcomes and address possible systems changes are essential, as is investment in a WLS database. The database should track patient outcomes and be compatible with the needs of the cre- dentialing body that certifies the center. We recommend risk- adjusted outcomes to adequately evaluate performance. X. data c ollection ( r egistries)/Future c onsiderations This Task Group identified 212 papers and reviewed the 63 most relevant in detail. Recommendations are based on available evidence as well as consensus of opinions from Task Group and Expert Panel members (62,76). A. Administrative and nonadministrative databases Administrative databases have inherent problems, includ- ing unreliable coding and lack of WLS-specific data points. Clinical databases that are not WLS-specific have other shortcomings (e.g., short-term follow-up, sampling of WLS procedures), and single-institution, WLS-specific databases lack standardized definitions and appropriate quality bench- marks. Rather, we recommend collection of WLS-specific data (categories B and D) on 100% of weight loss surgeries performed (category D). B. new developments Longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery. The NIH-funded Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery consortium has developed a database of standardized information on WLS patients at six clinical centers. Data are being collected on patient characteristics, surgical procedures, medical and psy- chosocial outcomes, and economic factors. Accreditation programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made a national decision to cover WLS, but only if performed by institutions and surgeons that are accredited by either the American College of Surgeons Bar - iatric Surgery Center Network or the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery/Surgical Review Corpora- tion Centers of Excellence program. WLS-specific, longi-tudinal data collection systems are a major part of each of these accreditation programs. The optimal data collection system should gather information on all WLS procedures using a longitudinal, universal database system. It should be prospective, risk adjusted, and benchmarked, with WLS- specific data points that track clinical effectiveness and com-plications following WLS (categories B and D). The American College of Surgeons Bariatric Surgery Network Data Collection System, the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons Bariatric Data Collection System, and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery/Surgical Review Corporation system should meet these criteria. If these systems are not compatible (i.e., cannot agree on the same definitions), an interface should be developed that makes them so (category D). c. Areas that need more data Risk adjustment. Risk adjustment helps control for differences in patient risk factors and case mix. Appropriate risk adjust- ment models should be developed and refined over time to account for these variables (categories C and D). Determining the best data collector. Data entered into the sys- tem must be of the highest quality to ensure accurate analyses on quality of care. To avoid bias, data should be collected by audited, trained data collectors not directly involved in patient care (categories B and C). That data, in turn, should be analyzed obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 857articles intervention and Prevention to see whether information collected by audited, trained non- nurse reviewers is as valid as that collected by nurse reviewers (category D). Defining data points. High inter-rater reliability requires data points that are clinically relevant, objective, and easy to identify. Data points, definitions, and systems training programs should be developed that optimize clinical relevance and minimize subjectivity, and in so doing, maximize inter-rater reliability (categories C and D). Quality indicators and benchmarking capabilities. Definitions of quality and benchmark indicators of progress can be difficult to develop. To advance patient safety, quality indicators and metrics should be appropriate and actionable (category D). Outliers. Accurate determination of what constitutes an outlier, or bad performer, can have a direct effect on patient safety and access to WLS. Responsible analysis of data and careful definition of outliers is essential to improve quality of care. The means to regularly report that data to stakeholders should be determined (categories C and D). Poor performers, or high outliers, should be identified, and a mechanism for corrective action developed (category D). Novel therapies. Safe introduction of novel technologies and assessment of the appropriateness of those procedures in new patient populations are critical for patient safety. Novel and experimental therapies, new patient populations, and expanded indications for WLS should be carefully stud-ied through comprehensive data collection and analysis (category D). Experimental therapies should be performed with IRB approval, and data collected and audited by a data monitoring board to assess clinical effectiveness and patient safety (category D). Cost-effectiveness and utility analyses. There is a critical need for well-designed prospective studies that evaluate the cost- effectiveness, cost utility, return on investment, and economic impact of WLS. Cost utility studies should be carried out to guide decision-making on the appropriate allocation of resources (category D). State coalition. We propose the development of a statewide coali - tion to collectively gather and share data, and determine quality indicators and processes of care that could lead to best practices in WLS (categories C and D). XI. e ndoscopic Interventions This Task Group's literature search identified 18 related articles, all of which were reviewed in detail. All of our recommenda-tions are based on expert opinion (63). A. overview Endoscopic interventions may provide valuable approaches to the management of WLS complications, and should be a high priority for development and investigation. Similarly, endo- scopic interventions, endoscopically placed devices, and other minimally invasive, image-guided techniques may also pro- vide valuable approaches to the primary management of obes- ity; they too should be a high priority for development and investigation (category D). B. experimental status Until formally approved by appropriate regulatory bodies, novel endoscopic interventions and endoscopically placed devices should only be used in the setting of IRB-approved clinical trials (category D). c. credentials Treatment with endoscopic and other image-guided interven-tions should be performed only by clinicians with specialized training and expertise in their effective and appropriate use (category D). d. clinical application As is the standard for other medical and surgical therapies for obesity, endoscopic interventions should be studied and used only in the context of comprehensive patient evaluation and treatment that reflects the complex medical, nutritional, and behavioral contributors to obesity. e. risks and benefits As new technologies become available, choice among thera- peutic options for obesity should be determined by the comparative risk-benefit profiles of each modality. These considerations should be matched to the specific clinical characteristics, needs, and treatment goals of each patient (category D). F. data collection To facilitate tracking of utilization, adverse events, and com- parative outcomes, all patients who undergo endoscopic and other minimally invasive interventions for obesity and its com- plications should be entered into a standard registry. Methods of tracking should be compatible with those used for patients undergoing WLS (category D). G. coding and reimbursement As new devices and minimally invasive surgical therapies for obesity and its complications are approved for clini- cal use, a new category of provisional billing codes should be established for these interventions. Reimbursement for novel therapies for obesity should be determined on the basis of scientific evidence of their safety and efficacy (category D). h. Future research Randomized, blinded, sham-controlled clinical trials should be the standard for investigation of the safety and efficacy of endoscopic interventions for the treatment of obesity and its complications (category D).858 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 | www.obesityjournal.orgarticles intervention and Prevention Ackno WL ed GM ents This Expert Panel on Weight Loss Surgery report was prepared for the Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error reduction.

It used the methodology of evidence-based medicine to system- atically search available literature on the subject, and devel- oped a classification system from established models to grade the quality of evidence. The systematic review involved a MEDLINE search of studies published from April 2004 to May 2007. These included prior systematic reviews on the subject, ran - domized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, cross- sectional surveys, case reports, and existing guidelines on WLS procedures from national organizations. The panel based its grading classification system on those used by the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Diabetes Association, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Obesity Education Initiative Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the highest-level evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, but there are few such studies on WLS operations. The Expert Panel's recommendations are based on the best available evidence. The sections below detail the procedures and methodology used to develop recommendations. 1. Panel selection At the request of Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner, Christine Ferguson, the Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction (Lehman Center) convened an Expert Panel to study patient-related safety issues in the state's WLS programs and procedures. The 35-member panel included experienced weight loss surgeons, nurses, psychologists, and a nutritionist who counsels patients before and after the procedures; other physicians who care for patients with obesity (an anesthe- siologist, internist, and pediatrician); a hospital patient safety officer; a health plan medical director; an ethicist; and a consumer. The panel delivered a report on its progress to the Lehman Center and the Department of Public Health in mid-July 2007. 2. task groups We divided the panel into 11 task groups: Surgical Care (53). Multidisciplinary Evaluation and Treatment (54). Behavioral and Psychological Care (55). Pediatric/Adolescent (56). Anesthetic Perioperative Care and Pain Management (57). Nursing Perioperative Care (58). Informed Consent and Patient Education (59). Policy and Access (Coding and Reimbursement) (60). Specialized Facilities and Resources (61). Data Collection (Registries)/Future Considerations (62). Endoscopic Interventions (63). Panel members joined one or two task groups, each with an assigned coordinator. They were asked to update reports from the prior Lehman Center supplement (22). 3. Literature search A medical librarian, aided by a clinical epidemiologist with experience in systematic reviews, carried out litera - ture searches for each task group. Studies were included or excluded based on a priori criteria, i.e., written protocols that defined research questions and search parameters, including patient characteristics, study designs, surgical interventions, and outcomes. MEDLINE searches were limited to English-language stud- ies published from April 2004 to May 2007. (Some groups searched other databases or focused on more recent litera- ture.) References in retrieved articles, guidelines from national organizations, and systematic reviews from the Cochrane Library were also examined. Task group coordinators, with input from the clinical epidemiologist, screened all titles and abstracts; they selected only those most relevant to the review questions. 4. data extraction and tabulation The panel developed a data extraction sheet and used it to cull detailed information from selected full articles after review. Key data included study design; size; patient demographics; follow-up time; dropout rate; description of the intervention; outcome measures, including adverse effects; and main con- clusions. Information was tabulated in a format suitable for publication. 5. synthesis of evidence We primarily used narrative (or qualitative) summaries for the literature review because study designs and outcomes were too dissimilar to combine results in a formal meta-analysis. All selected studies were critically assessed for internal validity or methodological rigor. They were ranked according to levels of evidence based on study design obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 859articles intervention and Prevention (Table 1 ). For example, well-conducted RCTs (category A) provide the strongest evidence on the effectiveness of a surgical weight loss procedure. We used expert opinion (category D) (including clinical experience, the opinions of respected authorities, reports from expert committees, and consensus of the Expert Panel) in conjunction with evidence from RCTs or observational studies to develop recommendations. 6. developing evidence-based recommendations Each task group prepared a critical summary of the literature (Table 2 ) and developed evidence-based recommendations on its assigned topic; these were presented to the full group for comments. This Executive Report of key recommendations from all groups was approved by the Expert Panel at its last meeting on 19 July 2007.Literature search process Literature review process r e F erences For t he Fr AM e W ork 1.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 21% of the 1.1 million HIV-infected persons in the United States are unaware of their HIV status. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend routine opt-out HIV testing for allpatients aged 13 -64. Yet little is known about patient and provider perspectives on routine HIV testing. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand patient and provider perspectives on the adoption of routine HIV testing within the US Department of Veterans Affairs. DESIGN: We conducted four focus groups with patients and two focus groups with primary care providers to explore perceptions of, communication about, andbarriers and facilitators t o routine HIV testing in primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of patients and primary care providers at two geographically diverse Veterans 'Affairs Medical Centers. APPROACH: We conducted grounded thematic analy- ses of transcribed audio-recordings of focus groups to identify major themes, identifying similarities and dif-ferences between patient and provider perspectives. MAIN RESULTS: Patients and providers concurred that implementation of routine HIV testing, treating HIV like other chronic diseases, and removing require- ments for written informed consent and pre-test counseling were of benefit to patients and to publichealth. Patients, however, wished to have HIV testing routinely offered by providers so that they could decide whether or not to be tested. Veterans also stated thatroutinizing testing would help destigmatize HIV. Sixsteps to communicating about routine testing ( \"the 6R's\")w e r ei d e n t i f i e d . CONCLUSIONS: Patients and providers appear ready for implementation of routine HIV testing. However, providers should use patient-centered communicationstrategies to ease patients 'concerns about confidenti- with HIV disease.KEY WORDS: HIV/AIDS; screening; communication; qualitative 24(10):1109 -14 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-1078-6 \u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 INTRODUCTION With the availability of effective medications, early diagnosis of HIV reduces mortality and is cost-effective1-3. Patients diag- nosed and treated for HIV avoid hospitalizations and canreduce risky behaviors, further reducing HIV transmission 4. Despite longstanding guidelines recommending HIV testing, as many as 21% of the 1.1 million HIV-infected persons in the USare unaware of their status 5. Consequently, in 2006 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new recommendations that allpatients between the ages of 13 and 64 be offered opt-out HIV testing regardless of risk status6; these recommendations were recently endorsed by the American College of Physicians7. The guidelines suggest that providers routinely order HIV testing unless the patient declines. Theseguidelines differ from previous HIV testing practices in most jurisdictions, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in that previously HIV testing was only for patients at behavioralrisk for HIV, or if patients requested a test. In addition, require- ments for specified pre-test counseling and written informed consent have been, and remain, the policy in many places. Routine 'opt-out 'testing, in which patients are informed by the provider that they will be tested for HIVand assent is inferred unless the patients decline, is likely to reduce barriers to HIV testing 8. Yet adoption of routine testing in general, and of opt- out testing practices in particular, may be challenging9-11.W e know little about how patients will respond to the routine offering of HIV testing or how providers view this extension inscope of their primary care responsibilities. The persistent stigma associated with HIV and patients 'fear of the health and social consequences of the diagnosis have been identified assignificant barriers to being tested 10,12. Many primary care providers find discussing the sensitive topics of HIV risk behavior and testing difficult and awkward13,14. Therefore, routine discussions of HIV testing may be more complex thanscreening for other diseases. We sought to identify, from patient and provider perspec- tives, facilitators and barriers to implementing routine HIVtesting in the VA according to current CDC guidelines. The issue is of particular importance in the VA, where a change in policy will affect the care of over 5 million veterans. Veteransare subject to social and behavioral factors that put them at higher risk for HIV, including lower income, more substance Received December 24, 2008 Revised June 25, 2009Accepted July 16, 2009 Published online August 19, 2009 1109abuse and other co-morbidities15. Thus, HIV prevalence rates are higher than in the general population16, and early HIV detection is of particular concern. Understanding the concernsand perspectives of both VA patients and providers is central to succeeding with implementation of routine testing in this large health-care system. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups ofprimary care providers and patients at two VA MedicalCenters, one in California, one in New England. We explored provider and patient attitudes towards routine HIV testing, perceptions abou tw h a te f f e c t i v ec o m m u n i c a - tion about HIV testing should entail, and perceptions of barriers and facilitators to implementing routine HIV testing. Institutional review boards at both sites approvedthe study. Participants Patients were recruited using informational posters, post cards with a drop-box placed in primary care clinics and at patient orientation sessions. Recruitment materials stated we wereconducting focus groups about talking with providers aboutsensitive issues. A research assistant contacted each interest- ed patient and indicated that HIV would be discussed in the focus groups. Patients were eligible to participate if theyresponded negatively to the question, \"Have you ever been told you have HIV disease? \"This requirement ensured that parti- cipants had not been diagnosed with HIV disease, which mightalter their perceptions of HIV testing. Patients were eligible regardless of previous HIV testing, to include patients with HIV testing experiences. Providers were recruited at regularly scheduled staff meetings at each medical center by a project investigator. All primary care providers were eligible to participate,including physicians, nurse practitioners and physicianassistants. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data Collection Patient focus groups were conducted at the medical centers bya study investigator, lasted approximately 90 min and were audio-recorded. We used a semi-structured focus group guide,containing broad lead questions and focused follow-up ques- tions, designed to elicit patient experiences with, and perspec- tives on, HIV testing. The guide was used flexibly to follow theflow of conversation among participants while addressing all topics. Patients also commented on draft CDC patient HIV testing educational materials. Provider focus groups were conducted during regularly scheduled 45-min staff meetings. The semi-structured focus group guide elicited provider experiences with discussing HIV testing with patients, barriers to conducting HIV testing androutinizing HIV testing as recommended by the CDC. Providers also commented on draft patient and provider CDC educational materials.Analysis Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts wereanalyzed qualitatively using procedures informed by groundedtheory methodology 17,18, a systematic approach to deriving qualitative themes from textual data. Accordingly, we first conducted open coding in which an investigator identifies key concepts emerging from the language used by participants andassigns codes (descriptive phrases) to segments of text. NVIVO qualitative analysis software was used to facilitate data coding and sorting 19. Coded text segments were reviewed by two investigators to condense broad codes into distinct themes. Themes that emerged in both patient and provider groups were examined for similarities and differences in perspectives in aprocess known as constant comparison analysis. Subsequently,prominent themes and quotes exemplifying each were presented to the research team and refined through discussion. RESULTS Of the 67 patients contacted, 10 refused participation, 3 were ineligible, and 26 were unable to participate, predominantly dueto scheduling problems. The 28 patient participants in four focus groups \u20142a te a c hs i t e \u2014were all men aged 35 -88, were predom- inantly low income and had mixed levels of education (Table 1). Of the 47 providers contacted, 20 providers consented to partici-pate; however, 7 dropped out because of scheduling difficulties. Thirteen providers participated in two provider focus groups, one at each site, and two additional providers who were unable toattend a focus group participated in individual interviews. Seven of the providers were women, eight were physicians, six were nurse practitioners and one a registered nurse. In the focus groups, patients and providers discussed key issues that help or hinder conversations about, and achievement of, HIV testing in primary care encounters. Themes centeredaround perspectives on HIV testing becoming routine, whatinformation should be communicated to patients and how, and procedural issues that hinder HIV testing. We present below the major themes that emerged from analyses, highlighting somestrikingly similar as well as important differences in patient and provider perspectives. Table 1.

The most salient reason fortesting for both patients and providers was the value in knowing one 's HIV status. Patients and providers advocated that HIV should be equated with other chronic diseases \u2014such as diabetes and cholesterol \u2014for which testing is routine. \"I'd like to see [HIV] become like everything else, diabetes, tuberculosis, anything else that we test for. When they do the blood screening, do the whole thing. It's a deadly disease. \"(Patient) \"I mean, why should [HIV] be any different, you know? I can order a CBC. I can order a PSA and somebody can come back with a PSA of 150 and I know he 's got metastatic prostate disease. Why should this be anydifferent? \"(Provider) Both groups stated the importance of learning results for chronic diseases/conditions \u2014including HIV \u2014in order to com- mence treatment as quickly as possible, or, as one patient put it,\"nipping it [HIV] in the bud, \"before the disease progresses. In this respect, managing HIV was viewed as no different frommanaging other chronic health problems. Participants favoredincluding HIV testing along with other routine blood work typically included in primary care visits. Both patients and providers also evoked public health reasons for knowing one 's HIV status. As a serious public health threat, HIV testing and subsequent treatment were viewed as effective means of stemming the spread of the diseaseand protecting sexual partners. Some patients were motivated by misunderstandings about HIV transmission, arguing that knowing one 's status could protect others with whom they have even casual contact, such as kissing or sharing a glass. Routine Testing May Decrease HIV Stigma Patients and providers also asserted that testing for HIV routinely would likely reduce some of the stigma associated with the disease. Routinizing HIV testing would change anunusual screening into an ordinary event, rendering HIV testing \"normal, \"thereby diminishing the stigma. This could be accomplished by associating HIV testing with screening forother chronic diseases that have much less discernible stigma, such as diabetes. \"If it was something that happens all the time, you could take the stigmatism [sic]out of it, maybe. \"(Patient) One provider reflected that current processes make HIV testing anything but routine, and that routinizing testing would further decrease HIV stigma. \"My own feeling is that the stigma associated with it ...it's certainly decreasing .... And it 's almost like we 're creat- ing processes that make it different than routine care. \" (Provider)Stigma as a Barrier to HIV Testing At the same time, HIV stigma remained a barrier for patients as reflected in their concerns about confidentiality and the poten-tial impact on the patient-provider relationship. Confidentialitywas paramount to both patients and providers. Patients wanted guarantees that both the fact they were being tested, and the test results, would be confidential. One patient, stating that hedidn 't trust the VA or the government to maintain confidential- ity, said that he might choose to be tested elsewhere. Patients and providers indicated that a patient who trusts his/her provider would be more likely to agree to being tested. However, patients and providers alike were concerned about the impact raising this sensitive topic might have on thepatient-provider relationship. Emphasizing the wish to be offered rather than told to have the test, one patient said that being told to be tested might lead someone to \"walk out of [the doctor 's] office and see another doctor. \"One provider stated that simply asking a patient to be tested could alter their rapport, affect the level of the patient 's trust and negatively impact their future relationship. Barriers to HIV Testing in the Clinical Encounter Patients and providers described two important barriers to HIV testing that occur during the clinical encounter: obtaining written informed consent and pre-test counseling. Patientsviewed signing consent forms as anxiety-provoking, intimidat-ing and sometimes difficult to understand because of the dense legalistic language. They indicated that the documents rendered HIV different from other diseases, running counter totheir desire to normalize HIV by equating it with other chronic diseases. Once HIV is construed as exceptional \u2014somehow different from other diseases \u2014patients noted they were likely to be more apprehensive about being tested because of fears of a positive result. \"They do all [other tests] over here, but [HIV testing] is different. This is 'Ooh, keep away from that. 'You know, and that 's what that form does, in my opinion. \"(Patient) In addition, patients voiced concern about legal language in the consent forms indicating the possibility that test results might need to be released to \"third parties. \"Because of fears of breached confidentiality, some patients expressed reservationsabout having to sign a consent form. Providers agreed with patients that requiring written in- formed consent made HIV different from testing for other chronic diseases. In addition, the informed consent formsrepresented a formidable and time-consuming logistical obsta- cle. At one site, social workers conducted the consent process, but were not located in the primary care clinic, making, theproviders said, the \"whole situation so difficult, with the limited amount of time we have. \"Providers from the other site were encouraged to use computer-based consent forms and signa-ture pads intended to streamline the process, but these were cumbersome in practice. The second barrier to HIV testing was pre-test counseling, in which providers discuss the process of HIV testing, thepotential implications of a positive test result and behaviors that may put individuals at risk for HIV. Patients viewed pre- test counseling as another process that rendered HIV excep-1111 Bokhour et al.: Routine HIV testing in VA JGIMtional, and therefore preferred not to participate in it. They noted that counseling would be likely to instill fear about HIV, and may even prevent them from being tested. Equating HIVonce again with other chronic illnesses, patients said they wished to talk in-depth about HIV with a provider only if a test result were positive, at which time they would want informa-tion about the implications of a positive result and how best to manage the disease. For example, one patient, talking about routine TB testing, stated: \"It was automatic that we 'd get tested. I didn 't need an explanation at the time of the testing. However, if it came back positive, you 'd best like some explanation \". Providers viewed pre-test counseling as an obstacle to HIV testing because it took up many \"precious primary care minutes. \"One provider feared that talking with patients about HIV testing in depth would lead to a flood of patient questions and concerns, and yet others acknowledged the moral neces- sity of discussing potential ramifications of a positive test.Doing justice to such questions and concerns was viewed as taking away time from accomplishing other important tasks during clinical appointments. Patients identified an additional barrier to getting tested \u2014 the wait time between being tested and receiving the results. Several patients stated that waiting for results made them anxious and depressed, and when they considered beingtested again would delay the test. One patient even stated, \"I'd be swallowing tranquilizers while I 'm waiting for the phone to ring. \"Providers did not discuss this aspect of testing. Communicating About Routine Testing Although patients suggested HIV testing be handled as routine rather than unusual, they repeatedly stated that they wished to be asked if they would like to have an HIV test, rather than betold they were going to be tested or have it be done automatically without discussion. One man, after saying he would agree to be tested stated, \"But I don 't think it should be automatic. A lot of people might take umbrage at that. \"Others reported similar views, with statements such as: \"...as long as they use the word 'should, 'and not 'have to.\"(Patient) \"I'm not against it, absolutely not. But again I just don 't want something else shoved down my throat. \"(Patient) Above all, patients desired the autonomy to be able to choose and consent to be tested for HIV. Some patients equated their wish for the autonomy to decide about testing with their fundamental \"civil liberties, \"one stating that he wanted a choice in order to \"preserve as much of my freedom as possible. \" Patients stated they would be more likely to agree to be tested if providers communicated several key informationpoints when raising the topic. First, patients wanted to be told, \"We're going to test everybody, everybody, \"indicating the goal of making the test not only routine, but also universal.Patients indicated that they needed to be reassured they were not being singled out to be tested based on clinical signs of the disease. One patient stated: \"If he suggested he wanted to test me for AIDS, he must have saw something in my crit [ sic] counts or something like that, that are fallen enough that he wanted to do the research on me. \"(Patient) Thus, patients who were asymptomatic and had no appar- ent risk factors wished to be told that HIV testing was being suggested as a general policy, not because of suspected HIV disease. Patients found that learning that 25% of all HIV infected patients are unaware of their status, in combination with the test being 'offered, 'would be influential in achieving testing (note that this figure has changed to 21% since the time of thefocus groups). One man said it most succinctly: I think any time you go see a doctor, it should be offered to you. \"Would you like it? \"And this information should be given to each patient, that a quarter of the people don't know they have it, and offer them, \"Would you like to have an HIV test because of this information? \" (Patient) Providers similarly found that information from the CDC materials about HIV testing would be helpful in talking with patients, particularly the information noting that 25% of all HIV infected patients are unaware of their status. Severalproviders stated that they felt ill-prepared to raise the topic of HIV testing with patients. One even said that some sort of written script would be helpful. Others suggested that one wayto routinize testing would be to inform patients that they would be tested for HIV just as they inform patients about blood tests for other health conditions, such as thyroid disease or elevatedcholesterol. They argued that by making it completely matter-of-fact, patients would be more likely to agree to being tested. One provider stated that he would say the following to patients: \"I'm going to order a bunch of blood tests including cholesterol, kidney function, liver function. One of the tests that 's now recommended is that we also check for HIV. I 'm going to go ahead and order that. \"(Provider) Veterans may be Different The fact that the patients were veterans of the US Armed Forces is an important point that was raised by the patientsthemselves. They contended that veterans as a group are more likely than the general population to engage in unprotected sex and use drugs and alcohol, putting them at higher risk of HIVinfection. Therefore, they said, veterans may be more open to being tested than civilians. One man stated: \"I was tested when I was in California the first time in '95 when I was in the Marine Corps. And, you know, I was nervous then, just because, you know, we had had unprotected sex with, you know, a female, and it was a1112 Bokhour et al.: Routine HIV testing in VA JGIMbunch of us and it was just crazy .... It was just really reckless. \"(Patient) Another man stated:\"I think, you know, the veterans and stuff [who 's] been around the lower side of life a little bit, could accept itmore than somebody that goes to the Calvary Baptist Church every week. \"(Others laugh.) (Patient) Although this man recognized that \"being on the lower side of life, \"leads to a higher risk for HIV, the idea that anyone could become infected remained salient to him. Thus, he advocated for routine testing. Providers did not comment onthe uniqueness of the veteran population regarding HIV risk. DISCUSSION Under rapidly changing accepted HIV testing recommenda-tions, providers may take different approaches to discussing testing with patients. The CDC-recommended 'opt-out 'ap- proach to routine HIV testing is a dramatic change from typicalpast practices 20. At present, there is no clear consensus on exactly how providers should present 'opt-out 'testing to patients, and no other studies have examined patient perspec-tives on routine testing. Patients and providers in our study expressed clear perspectives about how to best achieve routine testing. Our findings have implications for implementing thenew CDC recommendations, supporting routine testing of all adults, eliminating written informed consent and reducing the time burden of HIV testing by eliminating extensive pre-testcounseling. We found that patients were open to being tested and supportive of testing as a routine aspect of regular care, similar to others 'findings that hospitalized patients responded positively to an unsolicited HIV test 10. However, our findings highlight veterans 'wishes to be tested only after being given information to make an independent decision and provideverbal consent for testing. This is important for providers to note, especially as some of our providers, in line with the CDC 'opt-out 'guideline, recommended informing the patient they would order an HIV test unless it was actively refused. The concomitant perspective that both routine testing and this more 'opt-in 'scenario are desirable for patients is understand- able given the stigma associated with HIV disease 21-23. Although HIV is less stigmatized than in the past, patients remain concerned about the confidentiality of testing and results. Previous research shows that providers can effectively commu-nicate and request routine testing with at-risk individuals, contributing to destigmatization of the disease 24.T oc o n d u c t HIV testing in a patient-centered manner, we must considerpatients 'concerns alongside those of the medical and public health communities. Barriers to testing noted by our providers, including con- cern about the patient-provider relationship, time constraintsand the consent process, have all been noted by other studies in a variety of settings 25. Like most primary care providers, the providers in our study felt constrained by time limits imposedon them for clinical appointments, and adding routine HIV testing to their responsibilities seemed onerous. Easing requirements for pre-test counseling and written consentshould result in reduced provider burden. Providers can be patient-centered in ordering this sensitive test by offering the test to patients, reassuring patients that HIV testing is nowroutine for all adults, stating that patients are not exhibiting clinical signs of HIV, providing some basic information about HIV and asking patients if they would like to be tested. Based on these findings, we developed the 6R's for routine testing \u2014six steps for providers to use in patient-centered discussions of HIV testing: (1) Raise the topic of HIV testing; (2)Reassure the patient that he/she is not showing clinical signs of the disease; (3) provide Rationale that many patients infected with HIV are not aware of their status; (4) Respond to any questions that the patient may have about HIV disease; (5)Request permission to order the test; (6) tell the patient when he/she can expect to get the Results. A sample script for using the6R 'sis provided in Table 2. There are several limitations to our study. We conducted our study at only two VAs; patients and providers from other regions in the US may have different views not expressed here. All veteranpatients enrolled in the focus groups were men, and women mayhave different perspectives about routine HIV testing 10.A sn o t e d by the veterans themselves, veterans may be different from the civilian population. In addition, other studies have identified thecosts of HIV testing and funding for HIV treatment as barriers to testing 8. In the VA, cost is not a barrier because HIV testing and treatments are covered fully for most HIV-positive veterans orrequire minimal out-of-pocket expense. Approximately half of patients who were eligible were unable to participate in our focus groups due to scheduling constraints. Nonparticipating indivi-duals may have different views. We also had a limited number ofproviders who participated in the focus groups, meaning that we may not have fully appreciated the range of perspectives of the providers at these sites. Finally, providers who choose to workwithin the VA system may differ in their perspectives about care for vulnerable patients from primary care providers elsewhere. Using the 6R 's, we propose, may help providers discuss HIV testing with their patients, and make patients comfortable with being testing for HIV disease. In contrast to 'opt-out 'testing, this communication strategy may alleviate the risk of patients ' being tested without their knowledge, which could put them at additional psychological and social risk if they are positive. Future research is needed to fully explore implementation of routine testing guidelines, examining both an opt-out ap- Table 2. Sample Script for Using the 6 R 's for Routine Testing Raise \"We are now offering to test everybody for HIV just as we test for other things like diabetes or heart disease,through a simple blood test \" Reassure \"There 's nothing I know about you or your health that makes me think you might have HIV \" Rationale \"It is possible to have HIV for a long time without knowing it. Of the people who have HIV as many as 25% of themdon't know they have it \" Respond \"Lots of people have questions about HIV disease or getting tested. What questions do you have for me? \" Request \"Given what we 've discussed, would you like me to test you for HIV along with your other blood tests today? \" Results \"It takes about 2 weeks for the results to come back. Waiting for the results can make people nervous. We willcontact you as soon as we receive the results \"1113 Bokhour et al.: Routine HIV testing in VA JGIMproach as proposed by CDC and the more patient-centered approach proposed here. Such research should examine the impact of these communication approaches on HIV testingrates, the impact on the patient-provider relationship and the cost-effectiveness of each approach. Increasing the number of patients tested for HIV in the US is a high priority, to achieve earlier detection, earlier treatment and earlier secondary prevention through education about HIV transmission 26. However, the ultimate goal of early detection is to transition newly positive patients into care smoothly andrapidly. If routine HIV testing is achieved at the cost of weakening veterans 'trust in the health-care system, this could lead patients to delay returning for test results, or itcould lead to delayed transition into care after testing. Putting an end to the 'exceptionalism 'of HIV requires an ongoing effort to routinize and destigmatize HIV testing andthe disease itself 20. In the hands of some doctors, a brief script in which HIV is embedded in a list of other needed blood tests may stifle opportunities for question-asking and fall short ofstandards for patient-centered communication. A patient- centered approach to streamlined HIV test discussion may improve the likelihood that patients accept testing and even-tually lead to fully routine HIV testing in primary care.

Poor adher- encetotheantihypertensivemedicationregimen is a major cause of inadequate blood pressure control. In this study, we assess the relationship of antihypertensivemedicationadherencetosocio- demographic, clinical and cognitive characteris- tics of urban African American adults. Method: Data were drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of a behavioral intervention to improve medica- tion adherence and blood pressure control among hypertensive African American patients followed in an urban primary care network. Medication adherence was assessed at baseline using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) - a method regarded as the gold standard for assessing medication adherence in clinical research. Information on potential corre- lates of medication adherence (sociodemo- graphic, clinical and cognitive) was obtained at baseline by computer-assisted interview. We assessed the cross sectional association of these factorsto medication adherencein baseline data. Results: Medication adherence was signifi- associated with systolic medication adherence ( r5.285, P,.03). The relationship of education to medication adherence varied significantly by sex ( P,.05 for interaction). Specifically, lower educational attainment was related to higher adherence among men, but lower adherence among women. Conclusion: Identifying correlates of low anti- hypertensive medication adherence and their interactions, as in this study, will help health providers to better recognize patients at higher risk for worse hypertension-related outcomes. This knowledge can also inform interventions which target a higher-risk subset of hypertensive patients. ( Ethn Dis. 2009;19:396-400) Hypertension, Medication Ad- herence, African Americans, Urban PopulationINTRODUCTION In the United States, hypertension is 30%-50% more prevalent in African Americans than Whites1and accounts for half of the excess cardiovascular mortality observed in African Americans vs Whites.2Of those diagnosed with hypertension, African Americans have lower rates of blood pressure (BP) control than Whites, and this disparity has increased over time.3Poor adher- ence to prescribed antihypertensive medications contributes significantly to lower rates of BP control and, among modifiable risk factors, increasing such adherence is considered to have the greatest potential to improve BP con- trol.4Further, studies suggest that as a group African Americans may have lower adherence to the antihypertensive medication regimen than Whites5-6and may benefit substantially from interven- tions to promote adherence to the BP medication regimen. Unfortunately, physicians are gener- ally not good at identifying poor medication adherence among their Af- rican American patients. In a study of young, urban, hypertensive, African Americans, primary care providers were unable to identify poor medication adherence 60% of the time.7Knowl- edge of the correlates of poor medica- tion adherence would help physicians and health educators to identify patients at risk for poorer BP-related health outcomes. This knowledge is also a first step toward developing interventions to improve antihypertensive medication adherence among African Americans.In this study, we assess the relation- ship of antihypertensive medication adherence to sociodemographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics of urban African American adults. METHOD Participants This study was part of a larger randomized control trial of a tele- phone-based behavioral intervention to improve medication adherence, physical activity and dietary behaviors among hypertensive, urban, African American adults of low socioeconomic status. We present results of a cross sectional analysis using baseline data. Participants were drawn from the primary care practices of a large urban teaching hospital, and four of its affiliated neighborhood health centers. Eligibility criteria were as follows: 1) a physician diagnosis of hypertension; 2) being at least 35 years old; 3) being non-adherent to dietary recommenda- tions for hypertension; 4) having an active prescription for at least one antihypertensive medication; 5) having two elevated clinic blood pressureFrom Division of Clinical Informatics, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (JB), Medical Information Systems Unit, Boston Medical Center (JD).

Procedure The electronic health record (EHR) was used to identify individuals who satisfied the first four eligibility criteria. Apparent race/ethnicity, also captured in the EHR, was used as an initial proxy for African American race/eth- nicity. Next, each participating primary care provider was shown a list of potentially eligible patients and asked to remove anyone who did not meet eligibility criteria. Study personnel then contacted the remaining patients by telephone to establish eligibility. Five weeks later, a research assistant went to the subject's home to confirm eligibil- ity, obtain written informed consent, and to place Medication Event Moni- toring System (MEMS) caps on up to 3 antihypertensive pill bot- tles. MEMS caps contain a micropro- cessor that records the time and date that a patient opens the pill bottle to obtain a dose of medication. Such electronic monitoring devices are con- sidered the gold standard for assessing rates of medication adherence in clin- ical research.8During the next home visit 6 weeks to one year later, a research assistant downloaded MEMS caps adherence data and collected baseline data on all other variables used in this analysis. The Boston Medical Center institutional review board ap- proved the study. Measures Medication adherence Medication adherence was viewed as the dependent variable in these analyses, and was measured using MEMS capsapplied to up to 3 BP medication bottles as described above. Because the duration between placing the caps and uploading data varied, by patient, from 6 weeks to 1 year, we used data from a middle 30-day period in the analyses. Powerview communication software (Aardex Corporation, Union City, CA) was used to read and download adherence data from each MEMS cap. For each medication, we calculated the percentage of prescribed doses taken each day during the 30-day period. We then averaged this number over all 30 days to determine the average percent- age of prescribed doses taken per day. For participants who had more than one monitored medication, we averaged this value across all medications. As a second measure of medication adherence, we calculated the average percentage of days the monitored medication was taken as prescribed. Therefore, we had two summary measures of medication adherence for each subject. Candidate correlating variables A list of potential correlates of poor medication adherence was derived from the literature9and supplemented by clinical opinion. As noted above, infor- mation on each of these factors was obtained by trained research assistants at the second home visit via computer- assisted personal interviews. The participants' subjective financial status was assessed by asking them to classify their current financial situation as: 1) comfortable, with enough money for extras; 2) enough to pay the necessary bills without cutting back, but not extras; 3) enough to pay the bills, but have had to cut back; or 4) cannot pay some bills no matter how hard I try. Household income was assessed by asking participants to approximate their household income in the previous year as:,$10,000; $10,000 to $50,000; or .$50,000.Employment type was assessed by asking the participants to indicate if they were employed and, if so, whether full- or part-time. If unemployed, participants could indicate if they were disabled, retired, a student or a homemaker. Insurance type was assessed using the question, ''How do you cover your health care costs?'' Possible responses were: Medicare/Medicaid, self-insured, employer-paid, veteran's benefits, free care, or other. Self-efficacy for taking medication was assessed using a 51-item measure consisting of all 43 candidate items tested by Ogedegbe et al,10and 8 additional experimental items. On a scale from 1 to 5, participants rated how confident they were that they could take their blood pressure medication as prescribed under certain adverse condi- tions, such as: when you are busy at home, when you are tired, or in the presence of people other than relatives or friends. Individual item scores were summed to create an overall score for each subject ranging from 51 (low self- efficacy) to 255 (maximal self-efficacy). We assessed self-reported medication adherence using the 7-item version of the Morisky survey, a validated measure of adherence to medication regimens.11 Each response tail contained 2 to 5 possible options and was scored from 1 to 5. Individual item scores were summed to create an overall score for each subject ranging from 7 (poor adherence) to 17 (maximum adherence). This total score was used in the analyses. Physician support was assessed using the single item, ''How much encourage- ment for taking your hypertension med- ication as prescribed do you get from your doctor?'' scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Family support was assessed using a similar item, ''How much encourage- m e n tf o rt a k i n gy o u rh y p e r t e n s i o n medication as prescribed do you get from your friends and family?'' In addition, every subject was asked to select 3 values of personal importance from a list of 12 including responsibil-PREDICTORS OF MEDICATION ADHERENCE -Braverman and Dedier Ethnicity & Disease, Volume 19, Autumn 2009 397ity, independence, God's will, physical strength, etc. Statistical Analysis The following were coded as cate- gorical variables in the analyses: sex, financial status (4 groups, as above), living alone or not, insurance and employment types, diabetes status (Y/ N), history of stroke (Y/N), medication class (beta blocker, diuretic or calcium channel blocker), and personal values. The following were coded as continuous variables in the analyses: education, self- reported income, blood pressure, num- ber of prescribed medications, weight, self-efficacy for taking medication, and level of physician and family support. Frequencies were calculated for categor- ical variables, and means and standard errors for continuous variables. We conducted a Pearson correlation and a curve analysis for all continuous vari- ables with MEMS-derived medication adherence to identify possible linear and non-linear correlates of medication adherence. For binary categorical vari- ables, we conducted ttests to assess theirrelation to medication adherence. For those with 3 or more categories we performed a one-way ANOVA. We used a two-way ANOVA to test for interaction effects of 2 or more categor- ical variables on medication adherence. RESULTS MEMS data were collected for all 337 randomized participants in the larger clinical trial as described above. However, we report findings on the 70 participants' baseline MEMS data avail- able for analysis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of these 70 participants and of all participants enrolled in the larger clinical trial. The2 groups are comparable across the variables shown and, therefore, are also likely to have had similar baseline levels of medication adherence. Twenty-seven (39%) participants took one antihyper- tensive medicine, 21 (30%) took two, and 22 (31%) participants took three. The two MEMS-derived measures of overall adherence were highly correlated with each other (ie, the mean percentage of prescribed doses taken per day and the mean percentage of days taken as prescribed, r5.94, P,.001). For this reason, we used only the latter measure as the dependent variable in subsequent analyses. Mean medication adherence was 71.6%, median 582.3%, sd 526%. Table 2 shows the correlation be- tween MEMS-derived medication ad- herence and selected study variables. Medication adherence was significantly correlated with systolic blood self- efficacy for medication adherence (r5.198, P,.09). No curve fit analysis resulted in significant results. There was no significant difference in adherence between males and fe- m a l e s ,h o w e v e r ,t h e r ew e r es t r o n g interactions between: 1) sex and educa- tion (Figure 1), and 2) sex and whether or not the individual lived alone (Figure 2). With respect to education, when education was coded as high school and above or below high school, females with a less than high school education were less adherent (61%) than females with more formal educa- tion (74%). The opposite pattern was observed for males as those with lower education were more adherent thanTable 1.

(Figure 1). The interaction between sex and whether or not the individual lived alone approached marginal statistical significance (F [1,66] 53.38, P,.08). Of the 70 subjects, 31 lived alone and 39 lived with someone else. Females who lived alone were more adherent (74%) than females who lived with someone else (65%); whereas, males who lived alone were less adherent (69%) than males who lived with someone else (86%) (Figure 2). We assessed for confounding of the interaction effects described above. We were particularly interested in the effects of per capita income and age as these two variables are intuitively related to educa- tion, sex and to whether or not one lives alone. Correlation analysis did not demon- strate any relation between age and medication adherence. However, it was found that people who lived alone wereolder (65 vs 54, P,.01). No significant interactions between age, sex and living alone were found. The per capita income was obtained by dividing the upper limit of the houshold income category by the num- ber of people in the houshold. Not surprisingly, females' self-reported in- come was lower than males' ($10.6 K vs $18.4 K, P,.001). No effect of income on medication adherence was found, either by itself or in an interaction with other variables. A separate one-way ANOVA test and a single multiway ANOVA were con- ducted to determine if adherence was related to insurance type, actual income or participants' perceived financial status. No test reached statistical significance or showed a promising trend. This may be explained by the fact that all but 2 subjects reported that their insurance covered the cost of medications. DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to identify correlates of medication adher- ence among urban, hypertensive, African American adults of low socioeconomic status. Unlike most other studies of medication adherence in this population, we assessed adherence using MEMS technology which is considered a more objective and rigorous assessment ap- proach than self-report alone. We ob- served a mean adherence rate of 71.6% in our sample, which is similar to that of other studies in similar socio-demo- graphic populations. We also observed a trend between self-efficacy for medica- tion taking and actual medication ad- herence which is consistent with prior research.9,10 A novel finding is the interaction observed between education and medi- cation adherence by sex. While the least educated females tended to demonstrate the lowest adherence, the least educated males demonstrated the highest adher- ence, on average. Similarly, high schooland above education was associated with relatively high adherence among wom- en, but only moderate to low adherence among men. A potential explanation for this finding is that women with lower education are more likely than more educated women to be preoccupied with children and families. Indeed, the literature does suggest that caring for dependents is associated with lower medication adherence.9This being the case, one might expect to find a direct correlation between education and em- ployment status, and between employ- ment status and medication adherence. No such relation was found. The moderating effect of education on medication adherence observed in our study may also parallel the effect of general IQ on behavior change de- scribed in McGuire's Informational Processing Theory.12This model states two factors must be present in order for someone to comply with a request or agree with a message: 1) reception (ie, understanding of the message), and 2) yielding (ie, accepting of the message). People with a higher IQ or level of education typically understand the mes- sage better than those with a lower IQ or educational level. However, they are also more likely to mount counterargu- ments and to display resistance to the request or message. This tendency toward resistance is also higher among people with higher self-esteem.13In our study sample, one can argue that the males with higher educational attain- ment possessed higher self-esteem14and were, therefore, less adherent to their Figure 1. Effects of sex and education level on medication adherence. Figure 2. Effects of sex and living alone or not on medication adherence.While the least educated females tended to demonstrate the lowest adherence, the least educated males demonstrated the highest adherence, on average.PREDICTORS OF MEDICATION ADHERENCE -Braverman and Dedier Ethnicity & Disease, Volume 19, Autumn 2009 399medication regimen on that basis. On the other hand, educational attainment has less influence on women's level of self-esteem. This is because women's self-esteem is shown to be more influ- enced by emotional factors (eg, rela- tional harmony) rather than by achieve- ment.14,15Therefore, for the women in our sample higher educational attain- ment may have increased understanding of the message about improving medi- cation adherence without increasing resistance to that message. We also noted a marginal interac- tion of sex, and whether one lived alone, on medication adherence. Specifically, women who lived alone were more adherent than women who lived with someone else (presumably, a family member), whereas, men who lived alone were less adherent than men who lived with someone else. As argued above, females who live with others may invest in meeting the needs of their depen- dents such that their own medication adherence suffers. Conversely, medica- tion adherence among men who have a live-in partner would be expected to improve, as was observed in this study. Although electronic monitoring sys- tems such as the one used in this study are considered to be the most reliable measure of drug adherence, their use may potentially increase adherence by the so-called Hawthorne effect.16This effect is strongest during the initial period of monitoring, but wanes over time.17In this study we used a middle 30-day period of MEMS data, rather than an earlier period, to calculate medication adherence. We believe this approach mitigates the influence of MEMS monitoring on actual medica- tion adherence. Moreover, the adher- ence rate reported in our study is similar to rates reported in studies of medica- tion adherence that did not use elec- tronic monitoring systems.9In addition, the 70 participants in our study were similar to those in the larger random- ized trial across a range of characteris-tics. These facts argue against the presence of significant monitoring or selection bias in the medication adher- ence rates we observed. Multiple factors that influence pa- tient adherence to prescribed therapies have been described. These include quality of life, complexity and side effects of medications, health care system issues, demographic, behavioral, treatment and clinical variables, lack of knowledge regarding hypertension, to name only a few.9Although these factors are variably important when considered in isolation, our findings highlight the need to consider how individual risk factors for poor medica- tion adherence interact to increase or reduce the likelihood of medication non-adherence. Identifying correlates of low antihypertensive medication adherence will help healthcare providers to better recognize patients at higher risk for poor adherence and worse hypertension-related outcomes. A knowledge of these risk factors will also inform the development of interven- tions which target a higher-risk subset of hypertensive patients. REFERENCES 1.

Naimi, MD, MPH, Traci Toomey, PhD, Briana Lawrence, MPH, Jennifer Cook Middleton, PhD, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services Abstract: The density of alcohol outlets in communities may be regulated to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Studies directly assessing the control of outlet density as a means of controlling excessive alcohol consumption and related harms do not exist, but assessments of related phenomena are indicative. To assess the effects of outlet density on alcohol-related harms, primary evidence was used from interrupted time-series studies of outlet density; studies of the privatization of alcohol sales, alcohol bans, and changes in license arrangements\u2014all of which affected outlet density. Most of the studies included in this review found that greater outlet density is associated with increased alcohol consump- tion and related harms, including medical harms, injury, crime, and violence. Primary evidence was supported by secondary evidence from correlational studies. The regulation of alcohol outlet density may be a useful public health tool for the reduction of excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6):556-569) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Excessive alcohol consumption, including both binge drinking and heavy average daily alcohol consumption, is responsible for approximately 79,000 deaths per year in the U.S., making it the third-leading cause of preventable death in the nation.1 Approximately 29% of adult drinkers (/H1135018 years) in the U.S. report binge drinking (ve or more drinks on one or more occasions for men and four or more drinks for women) in the past 30 days, as do 67% of high school students who drink.2,3The direct and indirect costs of excessive alcohol consumption in 1998 were $184.6 billion.4The reduction of excessive alcohol consumption is thus a matter of major public health and economic interest.The density of retail alcohol outlets is often regulated to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Alcoholic beverage outlet density refers to the number of physical locations in which alcoholic bever- ages are available for purchase either per area or per population. An outlet is a setting in which alcohol may be sold legally for either on-premises or off-premises consumption. On-premises settings may include restau- rants, bars, and ballparks; off-premises settings may include grocery and convenience stores as well as liquor stores. In 2005, the most recent year for which data are available, there were more than 600,000 licensed retail alcohol outlets in the U.S., or 2.7 outlets per 1000 population aged /H1135018 years.5The number of outlets per capita in states with state-owned retail outlets varied from a low of 0.48 per 1000 residents in Mississippi to a high of 7.25 per 1000 in Iowa.5 Alcohol outlet density is typically controlled by states. Under state jurisdiction, outlet density may be regu- lated at the local level through licensing and zoning regulations, including restrictions on the use and de- velopment of land.6This regulation may be proactive as part of a community development plan, or in response to specic issues or concerns raised by community leaders. However, local control can be limited by state pre-emption laws, in which state governments explicitly or implicitly curtail the ability of local authorities toFrom the Community Guide Branch of the National Center for Health Marketing (Campbell, Hahn, Elder, Chattopadhyay, Law- rence, Middleton); National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (Brewer, Naimi), CDC, Atlanta, Georgia; Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (Fielding), Los Angeles, California; and University of Minnesota School of Public Health (Toomey), Minneapolis, Minnesota Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Robert A.

The WHO has published a review that identies outlet density control as an effective method for reduc- ing alcohol-related harms.8Similarly, in 1999, the Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra- tion's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention review concluded that there was a \"medium\" level of evidence supporting the use of outlet density control as a means of controlling alcohol-related harms.9In addition, sev- eral organizations have advocated the use of outlet density regulation for the reduction of alcohol con- sumption and alcohol-related harms. These include the European Union (in their 2000-2005 Alcohol Action Plan)10and the WHO Western Pacic Region.11The criteria used in the WHO report are not specied and may be expert opinion rather than systematic assess- ment of the characteristics of available studies. The SAMHSA review uses specied characteristics of in- cluded studies in drawing conclusions; however, the studies included are not up to date. In the present synthesis, 14 of the studies reviewed were published after 2000. Finally, a recent review by Livingston et al.12presents useful conceptual hypotheses and notes the importance of outlet \"bunching\"\u2014which the team referred to as \"clustering\"\u2014density at a more micro level. Further, the present review assesses whether inter- ventions limiting alcohol outlet density satisfy explicit criteria for intervention effectiveness of the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide), and assesses studies available as of November 2006. In addition, unlike any of the prior documents, the present review considers evidence from assessments of policies that are not explicitly considered density- related but that have direct effects on outlet density (i.e., privatization, liquor by the drink, and bans). If effective, policies limiting alcohol outlet density might address several national health objectives related to substance abuse prevention that are specied in Healthy People 2010.13 Guide to Community Preventive Services The systematic review described in this report repre- sents the work of CDC staff and collaborators on behalf of the independent, nonfederal Task Force on Com- munity Preventive Services (Task Force). The Task Force is developing the Community Guide with the support of the USDHHS in collaboration with public and private partners. The book The Guide to Community Preventive Services. What Works to Promote Health? presents the background and the methods used in developing theCommunity Guide.14Methods The methods of the Community Guide review process15,16were used to assess whether the control of alcohol outlet density is an effective means of reducing excessive alcohol consump- tion and related harms. In brief, this process involves forming a systematic review development team (the team); developing a conceptual approach to organizing, group- ing, and selecting interventions; selecting interventions to evaluate; searching for and retrieving available research evi- dence on the effects of those interventions; assessing the quality of and abstracting information from each study that meets inclusion criteria; drawing conclusions about the body of evidence of effectiveness; and translating the evidence on intervention effectiveness into recommendations. Evidence is collected on positive or negative effects of the intervention on other health and nonhealth outcomes. When an intervention is shown to be effective, information is also included about the applicability of evidence (i.e., the extent to which available effectiveness data might generalize to diverse population seg- ments and settings), the economic impact of the intervention, and barriers to implementation. The results of this review process are then presented to the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Task Force), an independent scientic review board from outside the federal government, which considers the evidence on intervention effectiveness and determines whether the evidence is sufcient to warrant a recommendation.15 Conceptual Approach and Analytic Framework Outlet density is hypothesized to affect excessive alcohol consumption and related harms by changing physical access to alcohol (i.e., either increasing or decreasing proximity to alcohol retailers), thus changing the distance that drinkers need to travel to obtain alcohol or to return home after drinking. Increases in the density of on-premises outlets can also alter social aggregation, which may adversely affect those who are or who have been drinking excessively, leading to aggressive or violent behavior (Figure 1). With alcoholic beverages acquired in off-premises settings, the consumption more often occurs at the purchaser's home, and excessive consumption may be associated with domestic violence and suicidal behavior. Decreases in off-premises or on-premises alcohol outlets, or both, are expected to decrease access to alcoholic beverages by increasing the distance to alcohol outlets, increasing alcohol prices, reducing exposure to on-premises alcohol marketing, and potentially by changing social norms around drinking, thereby decreasing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Decreases in outlet density are expected to decrease social aggregation in and around on- and off- premises alcohol outlets which, in turn, may decrease aggres- sive behavior potentially exacerbated by alcohol consump- tion.17Finally, decreased density increases distances traveled to and from alcohol outlets, thus increasing the potential for alcohol-related crashes. However, this potential harm could be mitigated by decreased alcohol consumption and hence decreased alcohol-impaired driving.18,19Thus, the expected effect of outlet density on motor-vehicle crashes may be mixed.20 The effect that density has on consumption and harms may be further influenced by at least seven characteristics December 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6) 557of retail alcohol outlets and the communities in which they are located: (1) outlet size (i.e., the physical size of the retail premises or the volume of its sales); (2) clustering (i.e., the level of aggregation of outlets within a given area); (3) location (i.e., the proximity of alcohol retail sites to places of concern, such as schools or places of worship); (4) neighboring environmental factors (e.g., demograph- ics of the community and the degree of isolation of a community); (5) the size of the community (which may affect access to other retail sites); (6) the type and number of alcohol outlets (e.g., bar, restaurant, liquor store, grocery store) in a community may also influence whether and how outlet density affects drinking behavior21; and (7) alcohol outlets may be associated with illegal activities, such as drug abuse, which may also contribute to public health harms. As with other policies and regulations, the effects of regulations affecting outlet density may depend on the degree to which the policies are implemented and enforced. There are several challenges to directly evaluating the effectiveness of local policies in changing outlet density on alcohol consumption and related harms. Direct studies of the effects of policies changing density on alcohol-related public health outcomes have not been conducted. Policy changes may occur in small communities in which documentation anddata may be unavailable and where the number of retail alcohol outlets, alcohol-related outcomes, or both may be small; thereby it may be difcult to assess the relationship between outlet density and excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. Further, the effects of policy decisions on outlet density may be gradual. Other changes in alcohol control policies (e.g., enhanced enforcement of the mini- mum legal drinking age) may occur simultaneously, making it difcult to isolate the effect of changes in outlet density on drinking behavior. The team used both primary and secondary scientic evidence to help address these challenges and to comprehen- sively assess the impact of changes in alcohol outlet density on excessive alcohol consumption. Primary evidence included studies comparing alcohol-related outcomes before and after a density-related change. In this category were (1) studies assessing the impact of privatizing alcohol sales\u2014commonly associated with increases in density; (2) studies assessing the impact of bans on alcohol sales\u2014associated with decreases in density; and (3) studies of other alcohol licensing policies that directly affect outlet density (e.g., the sale of liquor by the drink). Time-series studies (i.e., studies in which the association between changes in outlet density and alcohol-related outcomes is assessed over time) were also used to provide primary evidence Figure 1. Analytic framework showing the hypothesized effects of changes in outlet density on excessive alcohol consumption and related harms 558 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 37, Number 6 www.ajpm-online.netof intervention effectiveness, even when the cause of the ob- served change in outlet density was unknown. The team did not include studies of strikes in the production or distribution of alcoholic beverages or studies of interventions among college populations. Secondary evidence included cross-sectional stud- ies, which do not allow the inference of causality. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria To be included in this review, studies had to meet the following criteria: First, they had to evaluate changes in outlet density or policy changes that clearly resulted in changes in outlet density. Studies of policy changes (e.g., privatization or the legalization of liquor by the drink) had to provide evidence that there was a corresponding change in alcohol outlet density. Second, studies had to be conducted in high-income nations,a,22be primary research (rather than a review of other research), and be published in English. Third, studies had to report outcome measures indicative of exces- sive alcohol consumption or related harms. Direct measures that had the strongest association with excessive alcohol consumption included binge drinking, heavy drinking, liver cirrhosis mortality, alcohol-related medical admissions, and alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes, particularly single- vehicle nighttime crashes, which are widely used to indicate motor-vehicle crashes due to drinking and driving.23Less direct measures included per capita ethanol consumption, which is a well-recognized proxy for the prevalence of heavy drinkers in a population8,24; unintentional injuries; suicide; and crime, such as homicide and aggravated assault. In most studies included in this review, consumption is measured by sales data; the team referred to this measure as \"consump- tion\" and note the exceptional study in which self-reported consumption is directly assessed. Fourth, studies had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal or in a government report. Reports not published or published by private orga- nizations were not included. Search for Evidence The following databases were searched from inception up to November 2006 to identify studies assessing the impact of changes in alcohol outlet density and other review topics: EconLit, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EtOH (no longer available after 2003). The search yielded 6442 articles, books, and conference abstracts, of which 5645 were unique. After screening titles and ab- stracts, 251 papers and articles and 17 books were retrieved specically related to outlet density; ve articles could not be retrieved. After assessing quality of execution and design suitability (see below), 88 articles or books were included in the review. The actual number of studies that qualied for thereview was less than this, however, because some studies were described in more than one report or publication. Assessing the Quality and Summarizing the Body of Evidence on Effectiveness Each study that met the inclusion criteria was read by two reviewers who used standardized review criteria (available at www.thecommunityguide.org/library/ajpm355_d.pdf )t oa s - sess the suitability of the study design and threats to validity. Uncertainties and disagreements between the reviewers were reconciled by the team. The classication of study design was based on Community Guide standards, and thus may differ from the classication reported in the original studies. Stud- ies with greatest design suitability were those in which data on exposed and control populations were collected prospec- tively. Studies with moderate design suitability were those in which data were collected retrospectively or in which there were multiple pre- or post measurements but no concurrent compar- ison population. Studies with least-suitable designs were cross- sectional studies or those in which there was no comparison population and only a single pre- and post-intervention mea- surement. On the basis of the number of threats to validity (maximum: nine; e.g., poor measurement of exposure or out- come, lack of control of potential confounders, or high attri- tion) studies were characterized as having good (one or fewer threats to validity); fair (two to four threats); or limited (ve or more threats) quality of execution. Studies with good or fair quality of execution, and any level of design suitability (great- est, moderate, or least), qualied for the body of evidence synthesized in the review. The team summarized the results of cross-sectional studies based on whether drinking occurred on- or off-premises. However, some studies did not stratify their ndings by outlet type and so were presented in a combined category. For each outcome and setting, the team summarized study ndings by comparing the relative number of positive and negative ndings. Finally, elasticities\u2014summary effect measures show- ing the percentage change in an outcome per 1% change in an exposure (e.g., outlet density)\u2014were calculated if the study provided sufcient information. Other Harms and Benets, Applicability, Barriers, and Economics Harmful and benecial outcomes not directly related to public health (e.g., vandalism or public nuisance) were noted if they were described in the studies reviewed or if the team regarded them as plausible. In addition, if an intervention was found to be effective, the team assessed barriers to implemen- tation; the applicability of the intervention to other settings, populations, or circumstances; and the economic costs and benets of the intervention. Results Intervention Effectiveness\u2014Primary Evidence Time-series studies of alcohol outlet density change. The team found ten studies20,25-33that directly evaluated the effect of changes in outlet density over time without identifying the causes for density changes. Of these, eight were \"cross-sectional time-series\" (i.e., panel)aWorld Bank High-Income Economies (as of May 5, 2009): Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bah- rain, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Faeroe Islands, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Guam, Hong Kong (China), Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao (China), Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Northern Mariana Islands, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, U.S., Virgin Islands (U.S.) December 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6) 559studies of greatest design suitability20,25-29,31,33and two were single-group time-series studies of moder- ate design suitability.30,32Eight of the studies were of good execution25-31,33and two were of fair execu - tion.20,32Few took spatial lag (i.e., the likelihood that neighboring geographic units are not statistically independent) into account. Five studies assessed associations between changes in outlet density and population-level alcohol consumption,25,26,28,31,33 and the remainder assessed specic alcohol-related harms.20,27,29,30,32 Consumption. All ve studies that assessed the associ- ation between outlet density and population-level alco- hol consumption found that they were positively asso- ciated; increased density was associated with increased consumption, and vice versa. Three studies examined the relationship between outlet density and the con- sumption of spirits in the U.S. The rst study estimated that, from 1955 to 1980, for each additional outlet license per 1000 population, there was an increase of 0.027 gallons in per capita consumption of spirits ethanol (p/H110210.01).28The second study reported an elasticity of 0.14 (p/H110210.01) for outlet density and spirits for the period 1970-1975.31The third study examined the association of outlet density and the sale of spirits and wine in 38 states over a period of 18 years; the effects of consumption on density were separated out by use of two-stage least squares regression. The elastic- ity for spirits and wine was found to be 0.033 (NS) and 0.015 (NS), respectively.26 A study assessing trends from 1952 to 1992 in the United Kingdom25reported an elasticity of 2.43 (p/H11021 0.05) for off-premises density and beer consumption but no signicant association for other beverages (ex- cept hard cider). Finally, a study33examining data from 1968 to 1986 in Canada reported a signicant associ- ation between reductions in off-premises density and reductions in alcohol consumption. This study also found an association between changes in outlet density and cirrhosis mortality, which was mediated by changes in alcohol consumption. When the alco- hol consumption variable was added to the analytic model, the coefcient for cirrhosis mortality was no longer signicant. Motor-vehicle crashes and other injury outcomes. Two studies by one author,20,30using the same methods and database in California, found mixed results when eval- uating the association between on- and off-premises outlet density and fatal and nonfatal motor-vehicle crashes in small California cities (i.e., with total popu- lations /H1102150,000) during two different time periods and among different populations. The rst study assessed the association between outlet density and crashes from 1981 through 1989 across all age groups. The author found a negative association between off-premises out- let density and both fatal and nonfatal crashes, and apositive association between on-premises outlets and both fatal and nonfatal crashes.20The second study assessed the association between outlet density and fatal and nonfatal crashes from 1981 through 1998 among people aged /H1135060 years. This study reported a negative association for nonfatal crashes (elasticity: /H110020.69, p/H110210.05) and a positive association for fatal crashes (elasticity: 1.18, p/H110210.05). Three studies27,29,32assessed the relationship be- tween outlet density and suicide or interpersonal vio- lence. A study of young people aged 10-24 years in the U.S. from 1976 through 1999 found positive associa- tions between outlet density (on- and off-premises outlets combined) and suicides for most gender and age strata assessed, but only the ndings for boys/men aged 15-19 years were signicant (elasticities ranged from/H110020.03 to 0.10 for girls/women and from 0.05 to 0.12 for boys/men).29 The effect of changes in the density of on-premises outlets and violent crime was investigated in Norway from 1960 through 1995.32The researcher used auto- regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model- ing and found that each alcohol outlet was associated with 0.9 violent crimes investigated (by the police) per year. A supplementary analysis found that this associa- tion persisted even after controlling for amount of alcohol consumption, suggesting that the effect of increased density was independent of the effect of increased alcohol consumption ( p/H110210.03). This suggests that the social aggregation of drinkers in and around alcohol outlets directly affects assaults, as indicated in Figure 1 (under \"social problems\"). Finally, a study of 581 California neighborhoods identied by ZIP code from 1996 through 200227 indicated that an increase in on- and off-premises outlet density was associated with an increase in hospitaliza- tions for assault, but that this association varied for on-premises and off-premises locations, and among various types of on-premises locations (e.g., bar or restaurant) as well. The researchers used random-effects regression models, taking spatial lag into account, thus allowing for the lack of independence of neighborhoods in the association of outlets and alcohol-related harms. Within a given ZIP code, the elasticity for off-premises outlets and alcohol-related assaults on residents was 0.167 (p/H110210.001); for restaurants, it was /H110020.074 (p/H110210.01); and for bars, 0.064 (p/H110210.001). The elasticity for bars and assaults involving residents of neighboring ZIP codes was also signicant (0.142, p/H110210.001); how- ever, the elasticities for off-premises alcohol outlets and for restaurants relative to assaults involving residents of neighboring ZIP codes were not signicant. Based on these results, the authors estimated that, on average, eliminating one bar per ZIP code in California would reduce the number of assaults requiring overnight hospitalization by 290 per year in the state. 560 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 37, Number 6 www.ajpm-online.netSummary Seven of nine time-series studies found positive associ- ations between changes in outlet density and alcohol consumption and related harms, particularly interper- sonal violence. However, two studies assessing the rela- tionship between alcohol outlet density and motor- vehicle crashes in small California cities during two different time periods20,30had inconsistent ndings for which no clear explanation was apparent. The studies reviewed also suggested that the association between outlet density and interpersonal violence may at least partially be due to social aggregation in and around alcohol outlets, and that the density of outlets in a given locale can also influence the probability of assaults involving residents of neighboring communities. Privatization Studies Alcohol privatization involves the elimination of gov- ernment monopolies for off-premises alcohol sales to allow sales by privately owned enterprises. In the U.S. and Canada, privatization occurs at the state or provin- cial level; in many European nations, privatization may occur at a national level, currently guided by policies of the European Union. In the U.S., one alcoholic bever- age may be privatized at a time; for example, wine might be privatized (i.e., subsequently for sale in com- mercial settings) while spirits may not be privatized, or may be privatized at a different time. Typically, privat- ization results not only in a substantial increase in the number of outlets where alcohol can be purchased but also in changes in alcohol price, days and hours of sale, and marketing.21,34This combination of events limits the ability to attribute subsequent changes in alcohol consumption and related harms to changes in outlet density alone. Nonetheless, because of the impact privatization generally has on outlet density, the team concluded that privatization studies were relevant for assessing the impact of changes in outlet density on excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The effects of privatization on the privatized bever- ages are assessed rst, followed by an assessment of the effects of privatization on beverages other than those for which sales were privatized. If privatization affects consumption and related harms by means of increased outlet density, the consumption (and related harms) of the privatized beverage should increase, while con- sumption of other beverages might decline if usual drinkers of these other beverages now switch to the newly available privatized beverage. Comparing the association between alcohol consumption and alcohol- related harms associated with privatized and nonprivat- ized alcoholic beverages, respectively, provides a basis for assessing the impact of privatization on alcohol consumption and related harms while controlling for other factors that might be occurring simultaneously.Following an analysis of the effects of privatization, this section then reviews the effects of remonopoliza- tion, that is, reversing privatization by reinstatement of government monopoly control over the retail sales of alcohol beverages. This policy change would be ex- pected to have the opposite effects of privatization and result in lower alcohol outlet density. Eleven events of privatization and one of remonopoli- zation, analyzed in 17 studies and reported in 12 pa- pers,35-45met the review inclusion criteria. The units of analysis were eight U.S. states (AL, ID, IA, ME, MT, NH, WA, WV); two Canadian provinces (Quebec and Alberta); and (in the sole study of remonopolization) Sweden. Several studies assessed overlapping privatization events. For example, two research teams assessed the privatiza- tion of wine and then spirits in Iowa,34,38,39,45and two researchers assessed early phases of the privatization of wine in Quebec, while one of these researchers also assessed the later phases, with each phase counted as a separate privatization event.36,46In addition, several papers assessed the effects of privatization in more than one state and provided separate effect estimates for the privatization in each state; for purposes of this review, each state-level assessment was treated as a separate study. Finally, a single state or province could privatize different beverages at different times, resulting in separate privatization events. Altogether, the events assessed in these studies occurred between 1978 and 1993. In all areas assessed, the number of outlets increased dramatically following privatization. The studies used ARIMA time-series study design; all except two studies36,46reported results for compari- son populations. All studies used alcohol sales data as a measure of population-level alcohol consumption. One study also assessed fatal motor-vehicle crashes (MVCs),42another study34also evaluated single-vehicle nighttime crashes and liver cirrhosis. The single study of remonopoliza- tion40assessed hospitalizations for alcoholism, alcohol intoxication, and alcohol psychosis combined, alcohol intoxication alone, assaults, suicides, falls, and MVCs.40 Fourteen studies (in seven papers)35,38,39,42-44,46were of greatest design suitability; three studies (in two papers)37,40were of moderate design suitability. All studies were of fair execution. Effects of Privatization on Privatized Beverages Seventeen studies35-44assessed the effects of privatiza- tion on the sale of at least one of four beverage types (wine, spirits, full-strength beer, and medium-strength beer) in ten settings. The median relative increase in alcohol sales subsequent to privatization was 42.0%, with an interquartile interval of 0.7% to 136.7%. That is, among the studies reviewed, compared with con- sumption prior to privatization, the median effect was December 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6) 561an increase of 42.0% in consumption of the privatized alcoholic beverage. Studies of three events of privatiza- tion, two in Iowa and one in Alberta, yielded inconsis- tent ndings, which merit further description. In Iowa, wine was privatized in 1985, and spirits in 1987. Wagenaar and Holder35,43reported that wine consumption increased 93.0% (95% CI/H1100569.3, 120.2) from baseline to 44 months after privatization of retail wine sales. Following the subsequent privatization of retail spirits sales in Iowa 2 years later, these research- ers35,43reported a 9.5% (95% CI/H110053.5, 15.9) increase in spirits consumption; they also found no evidence that privatization affected cross-border alcohol purchas- ing.35,43In contrast, Mulford and Fitzgerald39found that wine privatization in Iowa was associated with a nonsignicant increase of only 0.5% (95% CI /H11005/H11002 13.2, 16.4) in wine sales, and that spirits privatization was associated with a nonsignicant increase of 0.7% (95% CI/H11005/H11002 4.3, 6.0) in spirits sales. Differences between the ndings of these research groups may be due to differences in time periods assessed, modeling variables and procedures, beverage types included in the assess- ment (e.g., Mulford and Fitzgerald exclude wine cool- ers that were not affected by the policy change and Wagenaar and Holder do not), use of a control popu- lation, and outcome measurement. Fitzgerald and Mul- ford34also report small unadjusted rate decreases in single-vehicle nighttime crashes (/H110021.6%) and alcoholic cirrhosis mortality (/H110025.5%) associated with the privat- ization of wine and spirits in Iowa. A study in Alberta, Canada, estimated that gradual privatization over a period of 20 years resulted in an increase in spirits consumption of 12.7% (95% CI/H110052.2, 24.4) and no change in either wine or beer consump- tion.42Although the process of privatization occurred over an extended period, the major events of privatiza- tion occurred essentially at the same time (in 1992); thus, considered in aggregate, privatizing spirits in Alberta increased total alcohol sales by 5.1% (95% CI /H11005 /H110022.8, 13.7) over this 20-year period. Despite the in- creased alcohol sales, the authors reported that there was an estimated 11.3% (95% CI/H11005/H11002 33.8, 19.0) de- crease in trafc fatalities. However, neither the increase in total alcohol sales nor the decrease in trafc fatalities was signicant. Effects of Privatization on Beverages Not Subject to Privatization Five publications37,38,43,44,47assessed the effects of pri- vatization in eight settings on the concomitant sales of alcoholic beverages that were not privatized during the same period. Overall, these studies reported that there was a minimal decline: a median of 2.1% (interquartile interveral Remonopolization on Alcohol-Related Outcomes A single before-and-after study40evaluated the effects of remonopolization of sales of medium-strength beer in Sweden. This study compared the association between the number of retail alcohol outlets and the occurrence of six different alcohol-related outcomes during a 51-month period following the remonopolization of medium-strength beer, with that for a similar period prior to remonopolization. Among young people aged 10-19 years, alcoholism, alcohol intoxication, and al- cohol psychosis (which were considered in combina- tion) decreased by 20% (p/H110210.05) following remon- opolization. These outcomes also decreased by /H110225% among people aged /H1135040 years, although the change was not signicant (p/H110220.05). Hospitalizations for acute alcohol intoxication also decreased between 3.5% and 14.7% (p/H110220.05); suicides decreased by 1.7% by 3.6% to 4.9% (p/H11022 0.05) following remonopolization, although none of these changes were signicant either. Motor-vehicle crashes (MVCs) signicantly decreased by 14% ( p/H11021 0.05) in all age categories except one (those aged 20-39 years). Other nonsignicant changes include assaults, which decreased by 1.4% among those aged 20-39 years, but increased by 6.9% to 14.8% the other age groups: 10-19, 40-59, /H1135060 years. The authors did not provide any explanation for this seem- ingly inconsistent nding. Summary These studies indicate that privatization increases the sales of privatized beverages but has little effect on the sales of nonprivatized alcoholic beverages. The one study that evaluated the reintroduction of government monopoly control of sale of an alcoholic beverage (medium-strength beer) found that remonopolization led to a signicant decrease in motor-vehicle crashes for most age groups and a signicant decrease among youth for several, but not all, alcohol-related harms. Studies of Alcohol Bans The team found seven studies18,41,48-52that examined the effects of bans on local on- or off-premises alcohol sales or consumption (i.e., \"dry\" towns, counties, or reservations). Five studies examined the effects of bans in American Indian and Native settings in Alaska,49,50,53northern Canada,52and the southwest - ern U.S.51Two studies assessed the effects of bans in nontribal areas of the U.S. and Canada.18,41Two studies were of greatest design suitability18,41; two of moderate design suitability50,51; and three of least suitable design.49,52,53All were of fair execution. The studies examined events that occurred from 1970 562 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 37, Number 6 www.ajpm-online.netthrough 1996. Two additional studies modeled the asso- ciation of multiple policies, including local policies of dry counties, with spirits consumption28and with juvenile suicide.29Both of these studies were of greatest design suitability and good execution, and the team considered them comparable to studies of bans and as primary evidence. An additional cross-sectional study of bans54was not used as primary evidence of effectiveness, but provided insights into the effect that alcohol availability in areas surrounding dry communities (e.g., outside Indian reser- vations) has on the occurrence of alcohol-related harms among residents of the dry communities. Effects of Alcohol Bans in Isolated Communities All of the studies that evaluated the effect of bans in isolated northern communities found substantial reduc- tions in alcohol-related harms with the exception of suicide.18,41,49,51-59In the communities that instituted bans, rates of harm indicated by alcohol-related medical visits were reduced by 9.0% for injury deaths to 82% for alcohol-related medical visits (CIs not calculable). One of these studies50found that the effects were reversed when the ban was lifted, and found similar benets when the ban was then reimposed (Figure 2).50Two of these studies suggest that bans on alcohol sales in isolated communities led residents to decrease their use of other intoxicants. In Barrow, Alaska, medical visits for use of isopropyl alcohol declined during ban periods.50 An additional study qualitatively evaluated a Cana- dian Inuit community52that overwhelmingly voted toban alcohol in 1978. Although comparative data are not available from this study (and the study thus does not meet review inclusion criteria), it is notable that during the 3 years following the implementation of this prohibition there were only ve arrests for the illegal possession of alcohol and, of these, four were associated with a single incident. The reported reduc- tion in alcohol consumption in general and among youth in particular was linked with several societal benets, including improved mental and physical health among community members, and a reduction in conflicts within the community. The ban on alcohol sales was associated with a reduction in the use of other substances of abuse (e.g., inhalants) by youth. Effects of Alcohol Bans in Less-Isolated Communities Studies assessing the impact of bans (particularly bans on on-premises sales) in less-isolated communities have pro- duced mixed results. Some studies have found that bans are associated with increases in alcohol-related harms, including motor-vehicle crashes18,46and alcohol-related arrests.51However, two studies28,29found that states that had a larger proportion of their population living in dry counties had less alcohol consumption and related harms than states that had a smaller proportion of their population living in dry counties. One study28found that living in dry counties was associated with lower rates of spirits consumption (p /H110210.01). The other study found small, nonsignicant associations with male suicide (elasticities of /H110020.002 to /H110020.066) and female suicide (elasticities of /H110020.021 to /H110020.038).29 A cross-sectional study of injury deaths in New Me- xico54highlights the poten - tial harms associated with al- cohol sales bans in areas (in this case reservations, 80% of which are dry) that are adja- cent to other areas where al- cohol is readily available. This study found that in these settings, although the relative risk (RR) of total in- jury deaths was greater for American Indians than for whites (RR/H11005 3.1; 95% CI/H11005 2.6, 3.6), the relative risk was great- est for deaths involving pedes- trians struck by vehicles (RR/H11005 7.5; 95% CI/H11005 5.3, /H1100530.5; 95% CI/H11005 17.7, 48.7). Further- more, American Indians in New Mexico who died of these causes were likely to0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 No Ban 1 (Nov 93-Oct 94)Ban 1 (Nov 94-Oct 95) No Ban 2 (Nov 95-Feb 96)Ban 2 (Mar 96-Jul 96) Ban periodsMonthly average number of visits per period Total Withdrawal Medical/GI Trauma Acute intoxication/ detoxification Suicide attempt Family violence Exposure Isopropyl Pregnancy Figure 2. Alcohol-related outpatient visits associated with changes in alcohol ban policy, Barrow, Alaska, 1993-199650 December 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6) 563have elevated blood alcohol levels (an average of 0.24 g/dL and 0.18 g/dL for pedestrian deaths and hypothermia, respectively). A disproportionate num- ber (67%) of these deaths occurred in counties bordering reservations, despite the fact that most American Indians live on reservations. Although the design of this study does not allow causal inference regarding the effect of bans, these ndings suggest that travel between dry reservations and adjacent areas where alcohol is readily available may increase the risk of death from these external causes among those traveling off- reservation to purchase alcohol. Summary The effectiveness of bans in reducing alcohol-related harms appears to be highly dependent on the availabil- ity of alcohol in the surrounding area. In isolated communities, bans can substantially reduce alcohol- related harms. However, where alcohol is available in areas nearby those with bans, travel between these areas may lead to serious harms. Studies of Licensing-Policy Changes Affecting Outlet Density The team identied four studies of national or local licensing-policy changes that resulted in increased out- let density. The studies were conducted in Iceland,60 Finland,47New Zealand,61and North Carolina.62The policy changes assessed occurred between 1969 and 1990. The North Carolina study was of greatest design suitability and good execution. The other three studies were of moderate design suitability and good execu- tion.47,60,61These studies examined various indices of alcohol consumption; the North Carolina study also as- sessed effects on alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes. Another study assessed the effect of a change in national policy controlling the sale of table wine in New Zealand. Effects on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms The only U.S. study that met criteria for this category of interventions evaluated the decision by several North Carolina counties to allow on-premises sale of spirits (i.e., \"liquor by the drink\" [LBD]), replacing the pre- vious option of \"brown-bagging,\"62in which patrons of an establishment bring their own alcoholic beverage (in a bag) and the establishment supplies other items (e.g., a drink glass, ice, water). Of the 100 counties in North Carolina, three approved liquor by the drink in November 1978 and eight approved it in January 1979. The policy change was followed by the opening of many bars and lounges adjacent to restaurants. Interrupted time-series models indicated that, relative to counties that did not change their policies, sales of spirits increased in LBD counties by 8.2% (p/H110210.05) amongthe rst group of counties to adopt the new policy, and by 4.3% (p/H110210.05) among the second group. Nighttime single-vehicle crashes among men of legal drinking age also increased in both early- and late-adopting counties by 18.5% (p/H110210.01) and 15.7% (p/H110210.01), respectively. However, there were no signicant changes in rates of nighttime single-vehicle crashes among boys/men aged /H1102121 years, who were not permitted to drink spirits and were thus not (legally) affected by the policy change. In Finland, the enactment in 1969 of a policy allow- ing the sale of medium-strength beer resulted in a 22% increase in the number of monopoly alcohol outlets and a 46% increase in restaurant liquor licenses, and permitted 17,400 grocery stores to sell medium- strength beer. During the year following these changes, overall alcohol sales in Finland increased by 46%. Of the increase, 86% was attributed by the researchers to the increased availability of beer. Overall alcohol con- sumption increased by 56%, with the greatest volume increases among those drinking more than a half liter of pure alcohol per year (1/2 liter of pure alcohol is equivalent to 1/3 gallon of 80-proof liquor). However, alcohol consumption increased signicantly among all adults at all levels of alcohol consumption in Finland subsequent to this policy change, regardless of their baseline pattern of consumption, including those who had previously reported that they had not consumed alcohol during the past year. In Iceland,60a policy change in 1989 resulted in an expansion in off-premises monopoly outlets and commercial on-premises outlets in Reykjavik and in rural areas. Over the subsequent 4-year period, consumption increased by 43% among men who drank more than 350 centiliters of alcohol per year at baseline, but changed minimally among women and men who drank at lower levels. In New Zealand,61a policy change in 1989 allowed the sale of table wine in grocery stores, resulting in an increase of approximately 25% in the number of wine outlets in the country over a 2-year period. This re- sulted in a 17% (95% CI/H110059.8%, 24.9%) increase in wine sales during this time, but in no change in the sales of other alcoholic beverages. This indicates that there was an overall increase in alcohol consumption in New Zealand subsequent to this policy change, and that wine, the privatized beverage, was not being substituted for other nonprivatized alcoholic beverages. Summary These studies consistently indicated that more permis- sive licensing procedures increased the number of on- and off-premises alcohol outlets, which in turn led to increases in alcohol consumption. Two of these studies specically reported increases in alcohol consumption among heavy drinkers, and one study reported an increase in drinking among survey subjects who re- ported not drinking during a specied period at the 564 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 37, Number 6 www.ajpm-online.netbaseline assessment. The single study that evaluated alcohol-related harms (alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes) found that they increased substantially after allowing the sale of liquor by the drink. Intervention Effectiveness\u2014Secondary Evidence Although the primary evidence just reviewed is het- erogeneous in topic and design and does not allow summary tabular presentation, the secondary evi- dence presented below is based on consistent statis- tical procedures and readily allows a summary table. Cross-Sectional Studies Findings from studies of on- and off-premises outlets combined. The 28 cross-sectional studies19,55-57,63-86 that assessed the association of outlet density (on- premise and off-premise, not distinguished) assessed 47 alcohol-related outcomes. Of these outcomes, 41 (87.2%) found a positive association, that is, as density increased, so did consumption and alcohol-related harms, and vice versa (Table 1, A). Positive associations were found for consumption-related outcomes (e.g., per capita alcohol consumption); violence and injury outcomes; and several medical conditions (e.g., liver disease). The mean elasticities ranged from 0.045 for crime to 0.421 for motor-vehicle crashes. Findings from studies of on-premises outlets. The 23 studies23,58,78,79,87-105that assessed the association of outlet density and alcohol-related outcomes in on- premises outlets reported on 25 outcomes. Of these, 21 (84.0%) indicated a positive association (Table 1, B). Positive associations were also found for consumption- related outcomes, several forms of violence and injury outcomes related to alcohol consumption, and one med- ical condition. Mean study elasticities could be estimated for most outcome types, and values ranged from 0.021 for child abuse to 0.250 for population consumption. Findings from studies of off-premises outlets. The 23 studies58,79,89-92,94-99,101-111that assessed the associa- tion of outlet density and alcohol-related outcomes in off-premises outlets reported on 24 outcomes. Of these, 18 (75.0%) also indicated a positive association (Table 1, C). Positive associations were found for consump- tion-related outcomes, several forms of violence and injury outcomes related to alcohol consumption, and one medical condition. Mean study elasticities could be estimated for most outcome types and values ranged from/H110020.15 for injury to 2.46 for population consump- tion. Mean elasticity was also high (0.483) for violent crime. Summary Cross-sectional studies generally show consistent posi- tive associations between alcohol outlet density andexcessive alcohol consumption and related harms, with the possible exception of injuries, for which the nd- ings were less consistent. The largest effect sizes were for studies relating outlet density to population con- sumption and violent crime. Summary of the Body of Scientic Evidence on Alcohol Outlet Density and Excessive Drinking and Related Harms Using a variety of different study methods, study pop- ulations, and alcohol measures, most of the studies included in this review reported that greater outletTable 1.

This convergent evidence comes both from studies that directly evaluated outlet density (or changes in outlet density) and those that evaluated the effects of policy changes that had a substantial impact on outlet density, including studies of privatization, remonopolization, bans on alcohol sales and the removal of bans, and changes in density from known policy interventions and from unknown causes. Studies assessing the relationship between alco- hol outlet density and motor-vehicle crashes produced mixed results.18,20,62,112 Other Benets and Harms Communities commonly seek limits on alcohol outlet density, either through licensing or zoning, for pur- poses that may not be directly related to public health (e.g., the reduction of public nuisance, loitering, van- dalism, and prostitution).7,113Although the team did not specically search for studies that assessed these outcomes, some of the studies the team reviewed suggested that there may be an association between outlet density and these outcomes as well. For example, a study from New South Wales, Australia, reported an association between outlet density and \"neighborhood problems with drunkenness\" but did not nd a signi- cant association with property damage.114There was evidence of one potential harm of decreased outlet density (i.e., an increase in fatal single-vehicle night- time vehicle crashes) presumably associated with an increase in driving in response to greater distances between alcohol outlets.19 Applicability Evidence of the association of outlet density and alco- hol consumption and related harms derives from stud- ies conducted primarily in North American and in Scandinavian countries. One study27indicated that the impact of changes in outlet density may be affected by demographic characteristics (e.g., gender distribution) of the population; in this case, the association of outlet density with assaults requiring hospitalization was stron- ger where there was a greater proportion of boys/men in the population. Most of the studies reviewed assessed the effects of increased outlet density, which is a consequence of the general trend toward liberalization of alcohol policies associated with outlet density. Few data were found from which to draw inferences about regulations that control or reduce outlet density. Studies of bans on alcohol sales, conducted primarily among American Indian and Alaska Native popula- tions, consistently report a reduction in excessive con- sumption and related harms following the implemen- tation of a ban on alcohol sales, possession, or both,provided the area affected by the ban was not sur- rounded by other sources of alcoholic beverages. Barriers Reductions in outlet density, with resultant reductions in consumption, are likely to have substantial commer- cial and scal consequences, and thus may be opposed by commercial interests in the manufacture, distribu- tion, and sale of alcoholic beverages. In keeping with its commercial interests, the alcoholic beverage industry has tended to support policies that facilitate outlet expansion.115 State pre-emption laws (i.e., laws that prevent imple- mentation and enforcement of local restrictions) can also undermine efforts by local governments to regu- late alcohol outlet density.7Indeed, the elimination of pre-emption laws related to the sale of tobacco prod- ucts is one of the health promotion objectives in Healthy People 2010.13However, there is no similar objective in Healthy People 2010 related to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Economic Evaluation The team's systematic economic review did not identify any study that examined the costs and benets of limiting alcohol outlet density. Although there has been speculation that reducing the number of alcohol outlets may result in a loss of revenue to state and local governments owing to a loss of licensing fees and alcohol tax revenues, the team found no studies that have documented this speculation. In addition, there may be economic gains resulting from revenue gener- ation from merchants and consumers who would other- wise avoid areas known to have a high alcohol outlet density; however, the team found no studies about this topic. Moreover, in 2006, alcoholic beverage licenses accounted for only $406 million (0.9%) of the $45 billion that state governments received from all licensing fees, and alcohol taxes accounted for only 0.7% of all taxes ($4.9 billion of $706 billion) collected by state govern ments (www.census.gov//govs/statetax/0600usstax. html). Even in the absence of published data on program implementation costs and other costs related to this intervention, it should be expected that the cost of restricting access to alcohol by limiting the number of alcohol outlets is likely to be small relative to the societal cost of excessive alcohol consumption in the U.S. For example, in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the societal cost of excessive alcohol consumption in the U.S. was $185 billion, including, among other costs, approximately $87 bil- lion in lost productivity due to morbidity, $36 billion in lost future earnings due to premature deaths, $19 billion in medical care costs, $10 billion in lost earnings due to crime, $6 billion in costs to the criminal justice 566 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 37, Number 6 www.ajpm-online.netsystem, and $16 billion in property damage related to motor-vehicle crashes.4Moreover, each state alcohol enforcement agent is responsible for monitoring an average of 268 licensed establishments116; thus, reduc- ing the number of retail alcohol outlets might reduce their enforcement responsibilities. In summary, no existing study examines the economic costs and bene- ts of limiting alcohol outlet density. Research Gaps Although the scientic evidence reviewed indicates that the regulation of alcohol outlet density can be an effective means of controlling excessive alcohol con- sumption and related harms, it would be useful to conduct additional research to further assess this rela- tionship: There are few if any studies evaluating how local decisions are made regarding policies affecting alco- holic beverage outlet density or the consequences of such policy changes. Such case studies may be dif- cult to conduct, but they could provide important insights to guide policy decisions regarding alcohol outlet density in other communities. The majority of outlet density research explores the impact of increasing alcohol outlet density on alcohol- related outcomes; there is a lack of research on the impact of reducing outlet density. This might be done by observing the impact of temporal changes in outlet density on excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The association of on- and off-premises alcoholic beverage outlets with illegal activities such as prosti- tution and drug abuse should be examined. In themselves, these may have adverse public health and other outcomes; in addition, they may confound the apparent association of alcohol outlets with these outcomes. Relatively little is known about the impact of density changes relative to baseline density levels. Some authors (e.g., Mann117) have proposed that the association between outlet density and alcohol con- sumption follows a demand curve, such that when density is relatively low, increases in density may be expected to have large effects on consumption, and when density is relatively high, increases in density should be expected to have smaller effects.21,117 Thus, it would be useful to assess this hypothesis empirically using econometric methods, with differ- ent kinds of alcohol-related outcomes. Such infor- mation would allow communities at different alco- hol outlet density \"levels\" to project the possible benets of reducing density by specic amounts or the potential harms of increasing density. For public health practitioners, legislators, and oth- ers attempting to control alcohol outlet density to reduce alcohol-related harms, it would be useful tocatalog approaches to regulation beyond licensing and zoning that may have an effect on outlet density (e.g., trafc or parking regulations that, in effect, control the number of driving patrons who may patronize an alcohol outlet). A primary rationale for limiting alcohol outlet den- sity is to improve public health and safety. Further- more, the economic efciency of limiting outlet density is difcult to assess without data on the economic impact of this intervention. To remedy this, future studies on the impact of changes in alcohol outlet density should assess both health and economic outcomes, so that the economic impact of this intervention can be assessed empirically.

Carr, MD, Linda Pololi, MBBS, Sharon Knight, PhD, and Peter Conrad, PhD Abstract Purpose Collaboration in academic medicine isencouraged, yet no one has studied theenvironment in which faculty collaborate.The authors investigated how facultyexperienced collaboration and theinstitutional atmosphere forcollaboration. Method In 2007, as part of a qualitative study offaculty in five disparate U.S. medicalschools, the authors interviewed 96medical faculty at different career stagesand in diverse specialties, with anoversampling of women, minorities, andgeneralists, regarding their perceptions and experiences of collaboration inacademic medicine. Data analysis wasinductive and driven by the grounded theory tradition. Results Female faculty expressed enthusiasmabout the potential and process ofcollaboration; male faculty were morelikely to focus on outcomes. Seniorfaculty experienced a more collaborativeenvironment than early career faculty,who faced numerous barriers tocollaboration: the hierarchy of medicalacademe, advancement criteria, and thelack of infrastructure supportive ofcollaboration. Research facultyappreciated shared ideas, knowledge,resources, and the increased productivitythat could result from collaboration, butthey were acutely aware thatadvancement requires an independentbody of work, which was a major deterrent to collaboration among earlycareer faculty. Conclusions Academic medicine faculty have differingviews on the impact and benefits ofcollaboration. Early career faculty faceconcerning obstacles to collaboration.Female faculty seemed more appreciativeof the process of collaboration, whichmay be of importance for transitioning toa more collaborative academicenvironment. A reevaluation of effectivebenchmarks for promotion of faculty iswarranted to address the often exclusivereliance on individualistic achievement. Acad Med. 2009; 84:1447-1453. Over the past several years, there has been a greater emphasis on facultycollaboration in academic medicine,particularly in research. The NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) Roadmapinitiative has provided incentives for suchcollaboration, 1and Darrell Kirch,2in his President's Address at the Association ofAmerican Medical Colleges (AAMC)annual meeting in November 2007, notedthe need for the culture of academicmedicine to change from one ofindividualistic achievement to one thatvalues and rewards collaboration and teamwork. Collaboration, as defined byChrislip and Larson, 3is \"a mutually beneficial relationship between two ormore parties who work together towardcommon goals by sharing knowledge,learning, responsibility, authority andaccountability for achieving results.\" Inthe fields of business and education,collaboration is widely and effectivelyutilized. Collaborative teamwork garnersgreater resources, recognition, andrewards when facing competition forfinite resources. 4 Few have studied collaboration in academicmedicine, where faculty collaboration isusually an intellectual endeavor that iscreative in nature. Successful academiccollaboration in medicine, as opposed tomore task-oriented instrumentalcollaboration, entails participants learningfrom and with one another. Although thecollaborative process seems appropriate inacademic medical research, an inherent contradiction exists: the promotion andadvancement of faculty in academetraditionally requires an individual bodyof work. 2We sought to understand how faculty in medical academe define andview collaboration and how they describethe atmosphere for collaboration in academic medicine. We were especiallyinterested in the influences of gender andcareer stage on perceptions aboutcollaboration. Method In 2007, as part of a larger qualitativestudy on faculty at diverse U.S. medicalschools, we selected five schools torepresent the diverse organizationalcharacteristics (i.e., public/private, NIHresearch intensive, primary careorientation/community orientation) ofthe then 126 medical schools in theUnited States. The sample includedrepresentation from each of thedesignated AAMC regions, with twoschools from the Northeastern regionwhere the bulk of medical schools areconcentrated. Faculty from two public andthree private schools, two research-orientedschools as determined by NIH funding, oneschool with a primary care orientation, and three with a community orientation participated in the study. Thedemographics regarding female andunderrepresented minority faculty inthese five schools were almost identical to Dr. Carr is professor of medicine and associate dean for student affairs, Boston University School ofMedicine, Boston, Massachusetts.

Vol. 84, No. 10 / October 2009 1447statistics regarding women and minorities at medical schools nationally. Participant criteria We used both stratified purposeful and chain referral sampling strategies (i.e.,interviewed faculty suggested otherfaculty who fit particular descriptions) toidentify medical faculty from the fiveC-Change (The National Initiative onGender, Culture and Leadership inMedicine) medical schools 5on the basis of their medical school affiliation, gender,race/ethnicity, department/discipline,and career stage. Participants wereresearch scientists, medical and surgicalsubspecialists, and generalist medicalfaculty holding doctoral degrees (84%MD/DO, 16% PhD). We interviewed 96faculty members who were in one of fourpossible career stages that we felt wouldprovide a thoughtful spectrum of medicalfaculty experience: (1) early career, thosewho were in their initial facultyappointment for two to five years, (2)\"plateaued,\" those faculty who had notadvanced as expected in rank andresponsibility and who had been facultymembers for 10 or more years, (3) facultyin leadership roles such as deans,department chairs, and center directors(identified below as \"senior\" faculty), and(4) former faculty who had left academicmedicine. Data collection and analysis We four authors personally conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews\u201415%in person and the remainder bytelephone. Interviews, typically one hour inlength, were audio-recorded andtranscribed verbatim. We used an interviewguide that we developed through a pilotseries of interviews. The guide includedquestions such as \u007f What is it about your work that energizes you? \u007f What do you see as valued in your institution? \u007f How does your institution encourage interdisciplinary collaboration? \u007f When have you felt most successful in your work? The data were coded and all names and identifying information were removed.We analyzed the data in aggregate byrepeatedly reading the interviewtranscripts to develop understanding andinterpret meaning. The transcribed narrative data were stored, coded, andsorted using Atlas.ti software. Analysisinvolved reducing or condensing data toidentify patterns and themes as theyemerged from the coded data. Theanalysis process was inductive and drivenby the Grounded Theory tradition. 6,7We drew and verified our conclusions bycontinually reviewing the transcripts andchallenging one another's findings untilwe developed consensus. Theinstitutional review board at each of theinvestigators' institutions (BrandeisUniversity, Boston University School ofMedicine, and East Carolina BrodySchool of Medicine) approved this study. Results Participant demographics We invited 170 faculty to participate. Eight individuals refused, primarilybecause of time constraints, and 54 didnot respond; we were unable to scheduleinterviews with 12 potential participants.We identified plateaued and early careerfaculty in advance through key informantinterviews. Identifying male plateauedfaculty was more difficult than locatingfemale faculty at a similar stage. Overall,those in leadership were more likely toagree to participate, and we foundsecuring interviews with early careerfaculty the most difficult (Table 1).However, the smaller number of earlycareer faculty in the study was due to thefact that we reached saturation and wereno longer obtaining new data from thisgroup. Female and underrepresented minority faculty were purposefullyoversampled, as were generalists, a groupcomprising general internal medicine,family medicine, and general pediatrics.Fifty-five percent of the participants plateaued group(n/H1100523) and among those who had left academic medicine (n /H1100524). The largest number of participants fell into thesenior leadership group (n /H1100528). Fewer were in the early career group (n /H1100521), because, as discussed above, we stoppedinterviewing such faculty when we nolonger obtained new data. Weinterviewed similar numbers of facultyfrom each school. Over 4,000 pages of data were recorded. In this manuscript, participants'quotations are identified by gender,degree, and the faculty group (definedabove) to which the participant belonged,as well as the area in which thecollaboration occurred (research,administrative, clinical, or educational). The results below are grouped by the seven emergent themes extracted fromthe data and presented in the followingorder: (1) the gendered meaning, value,and experience of collaboration, (2) careerstage perspectives on collaboration, (3)barriers to collaboration, (4) collaborationin research\u2014barriers and disadvantages,(5) collaboration in medical education, and(6) outcomes of collaboration. Gendered meaning, value, and experience of collaboration Faculty reflected on the meanings and experiences of collaboration in severalways. For some faculty, collaborationwas a reason for choosing a career inacademe. Several female faculty membersdescribed it as a way of working togetherand learning and growing in their work.Female faculty tended to value theconcept and process of collaboration atall career stages: It's fascinating and exciting to me to see how it's done elsewhere and get ideas . . .it's really a shared knowledge . . .collaboration to learn, impart knowledgeand look at things in a new way . . .broader than just what we each do asindividuals and you can actually reachmore people.Table 1 Faculty Participants (N /H1154996) by Career Stage and Gender in a 2007Qualitative Study of Collaborationin Academia Career stage*Female facultyMale faculty Early 14 7 ...............................................................................................

I think, moreand more, we think less about thedepartmental structure and more aboutcollaboration than ever before. \u2014Senior female physician (administrative collaboration) Compared with male faculty, more female faculty commented on theinterpersonal relationships associatedwith collaboration. The relationships thatcould result from collaboration wereimportant to faculty. Whether thecollaboration resulted in the positivebonds or whether these bonds helped tobring about collaboration was unclear,but relationships were clearly animportant aspect of the collaborationprocess, especially for female faculty inour study: I actually get energized by the relationships that I develop with bothmedical students and residents . . . as wellas relationships with other faculty. I do alot of community work and outreach, andso I think that's what draws me to it[collaboration] more than anything. It'sthe contacts that I develop with peopleand feel a bond with. \u2014Plateaued female physician (clinical and educational collaboration) Female faculty viewed collaboration as a sharing of ideas and knowledge and as away of looking at things from a newperspective. Male faculty often recountedmore pragmatic reasons for collaborationsuch as the provision of researchopportunities: I actually have been ask[ed] to join that group several times and have had othercollaborative things done because of it . . .and again . . . it came about because of mywork ethic and the way I do thingsclinically, and for being a team playerbecause it's very political. \u2014Early career male physician (clinical and research collaboration) Male faculty recognized that chances for collaboration could be political and thusintentionally positioned themselves to acquire these opportunities. Male facultyfocused on outcomes, such as researchopportunities, from their collaborativework, whereas female faculty typicallyfocused on the process of collaboration,the generation of ideas, and theenjoyment of actual participation. Faculty expressed the notion that a collegial, collaborative atmospherewould be the ideal environment inwhich to work in academic medicine.Collaboration was also seen as a meansof having faculty interaction as part ofthe process of decision making. It's a much better environment if there's collaboration, cooperation andsuppor t... .I really try to make a collaborative environment whereeverybody feels that they're part of thedecision makin g... it's a much better environment if there's collaboration andsupport. \u2014Senior female physician (administrative collaboration) Career stage perspectives The career stage of faculty influenced their perspectives on collaboration.Senior faculty in leadership positions,regardless of gender, viewedcollaboration as an opportunity forbrainstorming, collective decisionmaking, problem solving, and accessingother points of view. They expressed aconsistently positive view of theseopportunities: The chairs get together as a group to address common problem s...a n dt ot r y to evolve collegial, collaborative ways ofovercoming and addressing theseproblems. \u2014Senior male PhD faculty (administrative collaboration) Certainly at a high administrative level, we have a small core of administrativestaff . . . we have two or three hours of . . .brainstorming meetings every week wherewe really . . . wrestle with issues and try tomake decisions in a collaborative way. \u2014Senior male physician (administrative collaboration) Senior male faculty sometimes viewed the relationships stemming fromcollaboration as networking, a moreformal relationship to other colleagues,both at their institution and in the largercommunity of academic medicine.Part of it [collaboration] is a network of colleagues\u2014I mentioned locally, but alsonationally . . . we get together sporadically. . . they tend to be in leadership roles inother institutions and we support eachother in trying to affect these big complexinstitutions. \u2014Senior male physician (administrative collaboration) These faculty clearly enjoyed the process of collaboration and gained from theinput of other senior leaders in solvingadministrative problems in the workingsof academic institutions. Administrativecollaboration tended to be morepragmatic than collaboration in research,which more formally evaluates andstudies a scientific question by obtainingdata. I really loved faculty development and building programs and working with mycolleagues, fellow chairs, on just trying tobuild the institutio n... .I enjoyed it so much because I do like the interactionwith the faculty and other leaders in theinstitution. \u2014Senior female physician (administrative collaboration) For many senior faculty, a form of instrumental collaboration providedopportunities to interact with otherfaculty and to build interpersonal bondsor networks through collaboration. Unlike senior faculty leaders who endorsed and embraced collaboration intheir own work, early career faculty facedimportant impediments to collaboration.One of the major impediments wascriteria for career advancement. Barriers to collaboration Faculty tended to work in academic environments that did not pervasivelyvalue collaboration regardless of careerstage. Early career faculty, for example,tended to describe an environment thatwas one of competitive self-interestrather than collaboration and clearlyrecognized the lack of support forcollaboration: It's like playing high school football again, you know? Really it's the same sort ofmentality. You watch out for the otherperson, I'll help you, what can I do tohelp you get out [of work] sooner, ratherthan everybody . . . inacademic medicine, unfortunately, I seemore of that attitude than the former,meaning that it's everybody forGender Issues Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 10 / October 2009 1449themselves . . . I think more selfish than competitive. \u2014Early career male physician (research collaboration) I mean that would be a positive in my life if I felt we were all sort of on this teamworking towards this common goal, but Idon't have that. \u2014Early career male physician (clinical collaboration) The hierarchical nature of academic medicine served to inhibit opportunitiesand collegial environments for effectivecollaboration. In fact, for some facultythe traditional hierarchy was theantithesis of collaboration: What kind of structure would that (function- or purpose-drivenorganization) foster . . . it would I would think . . . a lotless hierarchical, a whole lot morecollaborative. \u2014Female physician who left academic medicine (research and educationalcollaboration) Hierarchy creates a structure that makes communication up the line more difficultfor junior faculty who would benefitfrom more interaction with senior andleadership faculty. Junior faculty sawsenior faculty as contributing to thehierarchical structure. A senior malephysician stated, \"I'm the boss, don'thesitate to talk to somebody who'skeeping me from ever having to talkto you.\" These junior faculty wereconcerned that departments mirroredsome of their more senior faculty whocould be averse to change, making it hardfor new ideas to take hold. An earlycareer stage female physician put itthis way: \"I think that the upperadministration does not appear to beaware of the problems we have, which Ithink is very strange, because at one pointthey had to be where we are now.\" And asenior male physician said, \"It's veryhierarchical [so] those at lower levelshave minimum input .... Certainly not into major strategic decisions at adepartmental level. It's all held at a veryhigh level.\" The lack of cooperation between departments in academic medicine alsoworks against effective collaboration asstated by this former faculty member: I would like to see people . . . be more curious and more respectful of eachother, so not be as guarded and defensive as specialties sometimes become. \u2014Male physician who left academic medicine (research collaboration) Collaboration in research Barriers. There were barriers to research collaboration as well, including thedifficulty faculty encountered learningabout the work of other researchers intheir institution with similar interests. It's [collaboration] great when it happens. I mean, but when it happens, it's becauseyou are sitting with somebody at lunch. . . it's because you are sitting there andtalking about your work and you think,\"Oh, I work on that. Let's do somethingtogether\" . . . that's how it happens. \u2014Senior female PhD (research collaboration) These informal pathways to research collaboration are common, and manyfaculty saw the potential of having moreformal ways to encourage collaboration,such as through institutional researchdatabases, rather than to have it occurthrough chance. Early career facultyinvolved in clinical research alsoexpressed low expectations of otherfaculty contributing and collaboratingwith them on their research: It's not that they don't want to be involved, it's just that they are really busyand to expect other people to care aboutwhat I'm doing, for the most part is\u2014Idon't. So I don't expect it, so I'm not verydisappointed by it . . . I think isolated . . .the only time isolated bothers me is whenI am trying to enroll patients in studiesthat I need my partners' patients ....I never get resistance, but I never get thelevel of support that would make this allbetter. \u2014Early career male physician (research collaboration) In addition to the concerns by some male faculty about the lack of cooperationfrom other faculty in furthering theirresearch studies, clinical faculty had otherconcerns. They identified the heavyclinical load expected by hospitals fromtheir physician staff as a barrier tocollaboration and wanted to ensure thatsomehow research collaboration wouldnot be stifled for clinical faculty: Cultivating that environment for collaborative work between that handfulof researchers who are struggling to gettime off from their clinical expectations.\u2014Early career woman PhD (research collaboration) A major barrier for research collaboration is faculty advancement.The system of promotion usually requiresan individual body of work that is clearlythat of the faculty member who is underconsideration for promotion. Althoughfaculty might wish to collaborate andrealize that they could gain greaterproductivity through collaboration, theyalso realize that they would be promotedor promoted earlier if their work werecompletely their own and separate fromtheir mentor's line of research.Collaboration in academic medicalresearch is the most difficult to achievebecause of this constraint. As oneplateaued female physician (researchcollaboration) stated, My model for research is more a group model and I still work very closely withmy scientific mentor, which is, you know,great, in terms of being able to use hisresources, where I haven't had them, butit also hurts you in that it keeps you fromlooking independent, which is part ofadvancement. Faculty were also aware of the contradictions between, on one side,this policy of independence and thereality of academic life and, on the other,collaboration and the need for academicmedicine to change. The goal, this whole goal of becoming an independent researcher which truthfully Ithink is kind of bunk at the end of theday. I think, to me, and I think the newInstitute Roadmap is acknowledging thatwe do get a lot more done when we worktogether, in group mission, greaterproductivity ....Y o u always felt like you were working together, helping oneanother. I have not seen that . . . . I think they [large labs that collaborate] are fewand far between. \u2014Early career male physician (research collaboration) Collaboration was valued and noted to provide a means of greater researchproductivity, but at the end of the day,faculty were very aware of the need tohave accomplished goals independently. Disadvantages. One faculty member observed that the pace of the work thatwas accomplished could be negativelyimpacted by collaboration. Investigatorsneeded to rely on other people tocomplete their work in a timely way.Faculty sensed a loss of control:Gender Issues Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 10 / October 2009 1450[When] you need to rely on other people . . . other factors come into play, like howhard others work. \u2014Early career female PhD (research collaboration) Working with others, therefore, had its limitations as well as advantages. Collaboration in medical education Many faculty enjoyed medical education because of the many possible avenues forcollaboration. They valued the excellenceof work that resulted from effectivecollaboration, as well as having apragmatic outcome such as a grant orcurricula. I wrote a bunch of curricula while I was there and changed some courses fairlydramatically, and I also liked talkingabout ideas and thinking about ideasand collaborating on projects with othercolleagues. \u2014Female physician who left academic medicine (educational collaboration) Faculty also noted that collaboration as part of the leadership structure of aresidency program was effective, valuable,and common to many programs. So when I was offered the position of training director, there was no associatetraining director and I advocatedaggressively to name an associate trainingdirecto r... .Ih a dal o to f resistance about that from my chair. Eventually she agreedand the program has been so much better. \u2014Early career male physician (educational collaboration) It's a lot of work, but when you see it [new curriculum] come together, or evenif it falls apart, it's such a learning processfor me, and I think for them, andhopefully that we are able to\u2014as agroup\u2014to impart some knowledge or atleast a new way of looking at somethingto groups of students, residents, or ourcolleagues. \u2014Plateaued female physician (educational collaboration) Outcomes Many faculty, researchers, clinicians, and educators, particularly male faculty,expressed the need for tangible outcomesfrom collaboration. They felt that if theyengaged in collaboration, there needed tobe something in it for them, whether itwas a publication, a grant, or curricula.Female faculty again imparted a sense ofenjoying the process as much as theoutcome (see above quotation), and of having the ability to choose faculty for theircommittee as a way of increasing theprobability of having more thoughtful andeffective members: What I liked about it was working with people from different backgrounds andcoming together to work on a commonproblem and the other people there mademe think of things in a way that I hadn'tbefore. And they were people I was able tohandpick . . . for being very thoughtfulpeopl e... . That was a project that involved a lot of intellectual energy, thathad an outcome, you know that had agrant, a product that was really achallenge to produce. \u2014Plateaued female physician (educational collaboration) This female faculty member has not advanced as expected, yet she issupportive of the idea of collaborationand finds the process in and of itselfvaluable, regardless of the outcome. Some faculty, often female, were generous with the outcomes that theyproduced collaboratively, as illustrated inthe following statement: So we set major goals, we worked together and one of the things that happene d... .I was very generous with authorship. If youdid something for the [research] project,you could be an author. And so that wayeverybody felt a part of it. \u2014Senior female physician (research collaboration) It's several different individuals collaborating to work together to achievea goal and publish. Just recently werecognized that there was a problem withstress, depression, and burnout . . . wehad an intervention that we studied as aresearch project. \u2014Senior female physician (research collaboration) Female faculty design opportunities that allow others to share in the outcome oftheir work; they value the process ofcollaboration, which they use as teambuilding with colleagues. Male faculty,particularly those still in the early stagesof their careers, did not express the ideaof providing such a shared outcome but,rather, a more competitive approach thatwould result in greater researchopportunities for taking on additionalwork (see \"Barriers to Research,\" the firstquote: \"It's everybody for themselves . . .I think more selfish than competitive\").There were no male faculty at any stage of their careers in this study who expressedvalue in the process of collaborationregardless of an outcome. Discussion Leaders have promulgated effectivecollaboration as facilitating excellence inresearch in academic medicine, but oftenneither the atmosphere nor theadvancement criteria in medicalinstitutions are conducive to suchcollaboration. The need to transform theindividualistic and competitiveenvironment to one that is collaborativeand cooperative has been voiced bysenior leadership in medicine. 1,2There is almost no literature about collaboration in academic medicine, despite theimportance of this concept. The lone,autonomous investigator who competesfor research grants and advancementhas long been the model for success inacademic medicine. Many of the earlycareer male faculty in our studyexpressed a competitiveness in theacademic environment that femalefaculty did not experience, recognize,or create. Rather, female facultyrevealed an enthusiasm about theprocess of collaboration, which was atodds with early career male faculty,who seemed outcome-oriented in theirvision of collaboration. The conceptsthat female faculty associated withcollaboration, such as learning andgrowing, sharing ideas, and gainingnew perspectives\u2014similar to thoseexpressed by Chrislip and Larson 3\u2014are at the heart of an effective process ofcollaboration. Our respondents described ways of collaborating that fit two of threedescriptions of collaboration detailedby Schneider 8: (1) brainstorming or collaboration by interest, in whichcollaborators spontaneously discuss acommon problem at hand\u2014this isdescribed by senior faculty whoapproach institutional problems through this approach\u2014and (2) collaboration bythe leader, in which the collaborators arechosen by the committee chair and thusoften have compatible values and comefrom similar working environments\u2014this type of collaboration is referred to inour study by a plateaued female physicianwho found it essential to have thoughtfulfaculty whom she had selected in hercommittee (first quote in the outcomeGender Issues Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 10 / October 2009 1451section). Schneider's third way of collaboration (not specifically mentionedby our participants) is collaboration byacuity, in which the collaborators areselected to create a balanced skill setamong the members. In addition to thesetypes of collaboration, we also noted aform of instrumental collaborationthrough which faculty worked on largeprojects with multiple-author papers,essentially completing work together butnot necessarily learning and growingtogether. Collaboration by acuity isparticularly important in academicmedicine because of the highlyspecialized nature and increasingcomplexity of medical knowledge. Thelone, autonomous investigator is at adisadvantage as collaboration is evenmore vital now than in times past. Both the lack of formal pathways in many institutions to facilitate collaborationamong faculty and the barriers betweendepartments hinder effectivecollaboration. One of our key findings isthat faculty readily concurred that thebest environment in academe is one inwhich cooperation, support, andcollaboration exist, yet few of our facultyparticipants, and particularly early careerfaculty, described such an environment attheir current institution. Paul T.P. Wong 9describes five types of \"toxic\" cultures that inhibitcollaboration: authoritarian-hierarchical,competing-conflicting, laissez faire,dishonest-corrupt, and rigid-traditional.Several aspects of academic medicinecontain features of these \"toxic\" cultures:the hierarchical and competitive aspectsof the culture, which faculty participants repeatedly noted as barriers tocollaboration; chairs who are notaccessible to talk with faculty; andthe competitive environment forindividualistic advancement sensed byearly career male faculty. In business,leaders have understood the importanceof a healthy corporate culture thatincludes trust building, transparency,accountability, and empowerment of theworkforce. A hierarchical culture doesnot permit the equal sharing of ideas sothat all participants can contribute, learn,and grow. Instead, in medical academethere is often the unilateral control of thechair or chief, resulting in lostopportunity for mutual learning, equalinput, and high-quality decisions. 9Whereas the hierarchy and competitiveness of academe areprominent to junior faculty, seniorfaculty have reached another stage intheir careers at which they tend to viewcollaboration as brainstorming;consequently, developing ideas andsolving problems are forms ofcollaboration. Initial brainstorming oftensets the tone for further work, whichinvolves agreeing on similar group values.Senior leaders in academic medicine arelikely to share a common set of academicand institutional priorities, which aid inmaking such sessions collaborative. 4 Senior leaders are at the top of thehierarchy and can follow a mutuallearning model in which there istransparency, sharing of information,decision making by building a consensus,and a greater commitment toimplementing such decisions. 10For effective collaboration to occur, the ideasof every person need to be respected andthe value of each person's contributionappreciated. From this mutual respectand appreciation, a shared field ofmeaning can emerge, 11and differences can be seen as opportunities forlearning. 10These qualities of effective collaboration seem to thrive in thebrainstorming of senior faculty. Leadersseem to accept collaboration as aneffective means to an end for themselvesin the roles that they play, but perhapsnot necessarily for junior faculty. Therole of the leader suggests thatadvancement has occurred to somedegree before a role change. Views oncollaboration may change once someonemeets at least initial advancement criteriaand moves into an academic leadershiprole, such as chair or dean. These senior faculty almost uniformly described a connection to colleagues, areadiness to collaborate with other seniorfaculty for problem solving, and anenhanced satisfaction from this process.Junior faculty expressed concerns bothabout the atmosphere in academicmedicine being adverse to sharing workand about their lack of connection toother faculty. This lack of connection,despite the greater ease ofcommunication through e-mail, faxing,and teleconferencing, suggests thatrelationship formation cannot beadequately achieved without directinterpersonal meetings and exchanges.Likewise, in a culture in which rank orjob title is important, it can be difficultfor a lower-ranking faculty member to access more senior faculty for thepurpose of collaboration. The disconnectbetween junior and senior faculty in ourstudy was vivid and problematic.Particularly concerning is that earlycareer faculty were very aware of thebarriers to collaboration and pessimisticthat effective, productive collaborationwas possible. They were highly aware ofthe hierarchy, as they were close to thebottom of it. Greater efforts are necessaryto support junior faculty and to create amore collaborative culture at all levels ofacademe. Female faculty remained enthusiastic and positive about collaboration, whereasmale faculty, particularly early careermale faculty, seemed much morepragmatic about collaboration, valuing itfor its outcomes. Nonetheless, these earlycareer male faculty still perceived theindividualistic and competitiveatmosphere in academe. Female facultyin this study expressed greater interest incollaboration than did their malecolleagues, with less concern for theoutcome than the processes and thelearning involved with the work. Notably, though, many of these femalefaculty had either plateaued or leftmedical academe. It is alsodisconcerting that it was easier to findplateaued female faculty compared withmale faculty. If effective collaborationis more valued, women may find iteasier to advance in their academiccareers and thus be less likely toplateau. Our study has a number of limitations. The in-depth and time-consuming nature of the interviews necessitated asmall sample size, so whether ourfindings are generalizable is not clear.Another investigator examining our datamay not extract the same themes, but wefound the themes consistent andcongruent. Our study also has significantstrengths. This work is the first oncollaboration in academic medicineand provides national information fromfive medical schools which are quiterepresentative of medical schoolsnationally by geography, inpublic-private status, anddemographically. The qualitativemethods reveal the experience of facultyin their own rich language and accordingto their own understanding. Gender Issues Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 10 / October 2009 1452Conclusions The descriptions of the academic environment provided by the faculty weinterviewed, especially junior faculty, areconcerning. Creating a supportive,collegial, and collaborative atmosphere inmedical academe needs to be a highpriority. Female faculty could be aparticularly valuable asset in thistransition because they seem to valuecollaboration, both the process and theoutcomes. Reciprocally, building a morecollaborative atmosphere could improvethe position of female faculty in academicmedicine. Better benchmarks to judge theaccomplishments of faculty are needed sothat the desire for and actual steps towardadvancement are not at odds with theincreasingly complex andinterdisciplinary process of academicwork. The criteria for promotion need tochange to reflect the value of effectivecollaboration.

Our objectives were (1) to review the most recent dataregarding HIV prevention, counseling, testing, and treatment, with a special focus on cost-effectiveness; (2) to discuss new findings regarding survival and general management of HIV,including a brief review of updated treatment guidelines and new antiretroviral medications; and (3) to discuss the intersection of HIV with other chronic diseases commonly encountered bygeneralist physicians. We included papers with both domesticand international relevance. We performed a literature search of peer-reviewed studies published since July 2006. Initially, we performed a PUBMEDsearch using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term \"HIV, \" limiting our search to English articles dealing with human subjects published in core clinical journals on or after July 1,2006. We narrowed our results to studies focusing on the following categories: prevention, counseling and testing, survival, management, and HIV and other chronic diseases. Additionally,we reviewed studies published since July 2006 in the major internal medicine journals and HIV specialty journals, and included articles based on recommendations by experts in thefield. Final selection of articles was by group consensus of HIVexperts and practicing HIV clinicians.PREVENTION: THE ROLE OF MALE CIRCUMCISION Gray RH, Kigozi G, Serwadda D, et al. Male circumcision for HIV prevention in men in Rakai, Uganda: a randomised trial. Lancet . 2007;369:657 - 666. More than 40 epidemiologic studies have suggested a benefi- cial effect of male circumcision in preventing HIV acquisitionamong heterosexual men. 1The biological explanation for this may be limiting the vulnerable mucosal surface. Several recent randomized controlled trials were performed to assess safety andefficacy of male circumcision in reducing female-to-male HIV transmission. 2,3Gray et al. reported on the largest of these trials, performed in Rakai, Uganda. This study enrolled 4,996 uncircumcised, HIV-negative men aged 15 -49 years who were randomly assigned to receive immediate circumcision or circumcision delayed for 24 months. The primary outcome was HIV incidence. Thistrial was stopped early after interim analysis showed signifi- cant efficacy for circumcision. In a modified intention to treat analysis, 24-month incidence was 0.66/100 person-years inthe immediate circumcision group versus 1.33/100 person- years in the control group, corresponding to a 51% efficacy (95% CI, 16% -72%; P=0.006). Accounting for to 55% (95% CI, 22% - 75%; P=0.003). HIV incidence was lower in the immediate circumcision group in all sociodemographic, behavioral, andsexually transmitted disease subgroups. This effect appearedto be stronger among men with two or more partners, extramarital partners, and during later follow-up periods. Moderate or severe adverse events were relatively rare. Alladverse events resolved with treatment. Behaviors were similar in both groups. The Rakai study findings are consistent with the other two circumcision trials performed in Africa. 2,3 One caveat is that circumcision in these studies was performed by trained personnel using sterile technique in well-equipped facilities. Complications might increase underless controlled conditions. Additionally, preliminary data from another study raise concern about potential increased HIV transmission to female partners of HIV-positive mencircumcised as adults, although this difference was notstatistically significant. 4Still, the World Health OrganizationReceived July 29, 2008 Revised October 7, 2008Accepted October 14, 2008Published online November 11, 2008JGIM 276and UNAIDS recommend that circumcision be considered in high-prevalence settings.5The Rakai study supports this approach. However, these conclusions should not be ex-tended to imply reduced transmission to circumcised men who have sex with men, or to women with circumcised HIV- positive male partners. COST-EFFECTIVENESS Paltiel AD, Walensky RP, Schackman BR, et al. Expanded HIV screening in the United States: Effect on clinical outcomes, HIV transmission, and costs. Ann Intern Med . 2006 Dec 5;145(11):797 -806 Sanders GD, Bayoumi AM, Holodniy M, Owens DK. Cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in patients older than 55 years of age. Ann of Int Med . 2008;148(12):889 -903. Goldie SJ, Yazdanpanah Y, Losina effectiveness of HIV treatment in resource-poorsettings -the case of Cote d 'Ivoire. N Engl J Med . 2006 Sep 14;355(11):1141 -53. During the last 3 years, there has been renewed emphasis on expanding HIV testing in primary care.6Studies have previously demonstrated that under most conditions in the US, cost-effectiveness ratios for routine HIV testing are substantially less than the commonly used benchmark of$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 7,8More recent research taking into account new testing and treatment strategies and effects on future HIV transmission hasstrengthened these findings. Paltiel and colleagues used cost-effectiveness modeling to incorporate the effects of testing and treatment on futuretransmission. The number of infections that one person may transmit depends on the number of infective contacts, the behavioral risk of each contact, the efficiency of transmission,and the lifetime duration of HIV infectivity. In theory, HIVtesting may decrease subsequent infections by decreasing risk behaviors and through viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy. However, testing and treatment might converselyincrease subsequent infections by disinhibiting behavior and prolonging life, leading to more contacts. They set the mean base lifetime transmission rate from a single infected individual (R 0) at 1.44. In their simulation model, they found that for a typical population (1% HIV prevalence) one-time screening had a cost-effectiveness ratioof $30,800 per QALY, and screening every 5 years a ratio of$32,300 per QALY. Assuming an adverse effect of HIV testing on future transmission (if testing were to increase transmis- sion), one-time screening still conferred a net health benefit,with the cost-effectiveness ratio increased, but still a good value at $44,200/QALY. Screening every 3 to 5 years became quite costly, with cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding$100,000/QALY. However, using more favorable assumptions (that testing would reduce transmission) improved estimatesof cost-effectiveness so that one-time routine HIV screening ratios remained below $50,000/QALY in settings where HIV prevalence was as low as 0.2%. One limitation is that themodel incorporates effects on transmission directly from the screened individual to others, but not on more distant downstream transmission. Sanders and colleagues focused on adults aged 55 - 75 years. In their Markov model incorporating prevalence, treatment, years and quality of life saved, transmission, andcosts, they found that for older adults with a spouse orother sexual partner, one-time s creening of populations with prevalence as low as 0.5% yielded favorable incremental cost-effectiveness in thos e 65 ($30,020/QALY) and those 75 years old ($41,520/QALY). Screening older adults with- out sexual partners was less cost-effective ($55,440/QALY for a 65 year old), but still approached the conventionalthreshold of $50,000/QALY. Goldie and colleagues studied cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings. In C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire, they compared treatment strategies not considered in developed settings, such as use of trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole pro- phylaxis without antiretrovirals or prophylaxis plus antiretro-viral therapy monitored with clinical criteria alone and notlaboratory tests. Using conservative assumptions, they dem- onstrated that for all antiretroviral strategies, those combined with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis were in each case more effective (greater life expectancy) and more efficient (less incremental cost per year of life gained). Prophylaxis alone was more efficient (incremental cost- effectiveness ratio of $240/year gained) than antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis without CD4 testing ($620/year gained) or antiretrovirals CD4 testing($1,180/year gained). However, prophylaxis without antiretro-virals was also less effective in terms of increased undis- counted life expectancy (1.6 months) than strategies that included antiretroviral therapy, either without CD4 testing(10.7 -45.9 months depending on criteria for initiation of therapy) or with CD4 testing (14 months). The authors used three times the local per capita GDP ($2,124) as a cost-effectiveness threshold. Using this threshold, each strategy was economically attractive. The conclusions held up well to sensitivity analyses, with the exception of variation in the costof antiretrovirals. Increases in antiretroviral costs had the greatest risk of driving costs per year of life saved significantly higher than the $2,124 GDP line. This study suggests thatdelivering HIV treatment can be economically reasonable inresource-limited settings. SURVIVAL Lohse, N, A Hansen, G Petersen, et al. Survival of persons with and without HIV infection in Denmark, 1995 -2005. Ann Intern Med 2007; 146:87 -95. For most studies of antiretroviral therapy, the endpoint is HIV RNA suppression, yet the most important clinicalindicator is impact on mortality rate. Lohse et al. use data from a population-based cohort study of all Danish resi- dents to investigate survival in persons with HIV in the eraof highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Each of 3,990 HIV-infected persons living in Denmark was matched277 Chaudhry et al.: Update in HIV Medicine JGIMwith 95 controls from the general population based on age, sex, and geographic region. Patients were observed for an average of 5.8 and 8.4 person-years, respectively. Analyseswere perfomed for three clinically relevant periods: 1995 - 1996 (pre-HAART), 1997 -1999 (early HAART), and 2000 - 2005 (late HAART) and for both those with and withouthepatitis C coinfection. The study found that perso ns with HIV infection had a median survival beyond age 25 o f 19.9 years, compared with 51.1 years in the general population. However, subgroupanalysis found that in the late HAART era (2000 -2005), survival beyond age 25 had increased to 32.5 years. Those patients who were hepatitis C negative and diagnosed in thelate HAART era had the best survival at 38.9 years beyond age 25. T h es t r e n g t ho ft h i ss t u d yi st h ea b i l i t yt oc a p t u r e accurate and comprehensive data for an entire population. There were no exclusion criteria, and all persons with HIV were included regardless of CD4 count, viral load, stage ofdisease, comorbidities, or treatment adherence. In addition, less than 3% of the cohort was lost to follow up. One potential limitation is that the measurement of survival fromage 25 likely leads to lead time bias as most patients werediagnosed after age 40 and so presumably did not have disease at age 25. A second limitation is that the limited observation period may be too short to extrapolate long-termsurvival. Finally, because of Denmark 's national health system, patients had excellent access to health care (>75% of patients were on HAART), and results may not begeneralizable. Despite these limitations, this study predicts that a nearly 20-year increase in life expectancy is achiev- able with HAART. MANAGEMENT When to Start In December 2007 the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) revised its guidelines for initiation of antire- troviral therapy. The recommendation is to initiate treatmentin patients with a history of an AIDS-defining illness or with CD4 lymphocyte count <350 cells/mm 3. This is a change from prior recommendations, which stated that asymptomaticpersons with CD4 count between 200 -350 cells/mm 3should be offered treatment, but did not explicitly recommend treatment in this group.9The DHHS also recommends antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 lymphocyte count among (1) pregnant patients, (2) individuals with HIV-associated nephropathy, and (3) HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected persons, if treatmentfor HBV is indicated. 10 New FDA Approved Medications In the past several years the FDA has approved a number of new antiretroviral medications. One important development is the multi-class drug combining the nucleoside/nucleotidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (NNRTI) efavirenz into a single pill. For appropriatepatients, this pill comprises a complete antiretroviral regimen to be taken once daily. 11Other developments include five newantiretrovirals and two new antiretroviral classes.12-21A detailed review of drug trials is beyond the scope of this review. However, a summary of selected major trials ispresented in the Table 1. Mallal, S, E Phillips, G Carosi, et al. HLA-B*5701 screening for hypersensitivity poten- condition, requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion.22It is estimated to affect 5 -8% of patients during the first 6 weeks of therapy. Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity are nonspecific and often similar to other drug side effects, which may lead to false-positive diagnoses.Previous studies have shown an association of MHC class I allele HLA-B*5701 and hypersensitivity. 23,24 This study tested the hypothesis that prospective HLA- B*5701 testing and excluding those found to be positive wouldreduce the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity. This pro- spective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was performed at 265 centers in 19 countries. The study had twoarms: (1) those receiving prospective screening, and if found to be HLA-B*5701 positive, excluded from abacavir-containing treatment and (2) a control group, receiving abacavir underusual care, with HLA test results reviewed after the study. Epicutaneous patch testing was used as a \"gold standard \"for hypersensitivity. A total of 1,956 subjects was evaluated: 980 prospective screening and 847 control subjects. Fifty-five were excluded from the prospective screening group after testing positive for HLA-B*5701. Results showed that 109 patients out of 1,956(5.6%) were HLA-B*5701 positive. The incidences of both clinical (0.40; 95% CI, 95% CI,0.00 -0.18) hypersensitivity reactions were lower in the prospective screening group. In multivariate analysis, only prospective screening was a significant negative predictor of hypersensitivity reaction. There were no immu-nologically diagnosed hypersensitivity reactions in the screened group. Current use of a protease inhibitor (PI) or introduction of a new NNRTI were predictors of clinicallydiagnosed hypersensitivity, not immunologically confirmed,suggesting that the symptoms were due to another drug, and not true abacavir hypersensitivity. The positive predictive value (PPV) of HLA-B*5701 for immunologically confirmedhypersensitivity was 47.9%, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. For clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity, the PPV was and the NPV was 95.5%. Nineteen of (38.8%) in the control group tolerated abacavir, sug- gesting that HLA B*5701 is necessary, but not sufficient for hypersensitivity. There are a few caveats. Although it performed well in this study, the patch test is for experimental proposes only. The population studied was largely Caucasian; however, otherstudies suggest HLA-B*5701 testing performs well in diversepopulations. 25Cost-effectiveness may vary across different settings. Prospective HLA-B*5701 testing can reduce the risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions and is now recom-mended by the DHHS for all patients before beginning an abacavir-containing regimen. 26278 Chaudhry et al.: Update in HIV Medicine JGIMTable 1.

Class of antiretroviral drugs and the risk of myocardial infarction. N Engl J Med 356;17, 1723 -1735; 2007 Cardiovascular disease is emerging as an important cause of morbidity and mortality among persons living with HIV. There is a demonstrated association between combination antiretro-viral therapy and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). 27The purpose of this paper was to investigate the association ofexposure to PIs and NNRTIs and the risk of MI. The authors analyzed data collected from the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) Study, an internationalcollaboration including over 20,000 HIV-infected individualsin Australia, Europe, and the US. This study population consisted of 23,437 HIV-infected patients. The authors calculated incidence rates of MI anddetermined the associations between MI and both PI and NNRTI exposure. Three hundred and forty-five patients had an MI during 94,469 person-years of observation. The inci-dence of MI increased from 1.53/1,000 person years in non-PI- exposed individuals to 6.01/1,000 person-years in individualsTable 1.

After adjusting for exposure to other medication class and for cardiovascular risk factors other than lipids, the relative rate of MI per year of PIexposure was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.10 -1.23). When additionally adjusted for lipid levels, it was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04 -1.18). The relative rate of MI per year of NNRTI exposure was 1.05 (95%CI, 0.98 -1.13) and adjusting for lipid levels was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93 -1.09). While there was no evidence of this association for NNRTIs, the number of person-years of exposure to PIs wasgreater than that of person-years exposure to NNRTIs. A limitation of this study is its observational nature; unmeasured confounders might contribute to the findings. Additionally, there is the possibility of \"channeling bias \" whereby patients considered to be at higher risk might be placed on regimens considered safer from a cardiac standpoint. Adjusting for cardiac risk factors ameliorates but cannot com-pletely account for this. Still, the results of this study confirm a relationship between duration of combination antiretroviral use and cardiovascular disease, and suggest that PI use is associatedwith MI, which may be in part attributable to lipid effects. The DAD Study Group. Use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and risk of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected patients enrolled in collaboration. Lancet . 2008; 371:1417 -1426. This study, also from the D:A:D Study Group, focused on NRTIs and MI risk. It included 33,347 individuals encompassing 157,912 person-years of follow-up. Poisson regression was usedto evaluate MI and exposure tozidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, and abacavir. The investigators adjusted for demographic factors, calendar year, cohort, cardiovascular risk factors, and cumulative expo-sure to other antiretrovirals. There were 517 patients with MI, corresponding to an event rate of 3.3 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 3.0 -3.6). Exposure to abacavir or didanosine in the past 6 months, but not cumulative exposure, was associated with an increased risk of MI compared to those with no recent use of those medica-tions. The relative rate of MI for recent abacavir use was 1.90(95% CI: 1.47 -2.45), and the relative rate of MI for recent didanosine use was 1.49 (1.14 -1.95). There was no increased risk of MI among patients w ho had been previously on didanosine or abacavir and been off these medications for more than 6 months compared to those who had never received them. After adjustment for predicted 10 year risk ofcoronary disease, 28recent use of abacavir and didanosine was still associated with increased rates of MI (1.89, 95% CI 1.47 - 2.45 for abacavir and 1.49, 95% CI 1.14 -1.95 for didanosine). No association was observed between MI and cumulative exposure to zidovudine, stavudine, or lamivudine. There are some limitations. The possibility exists that p e r s o n sw i t hh i g h e rc a r d i o v a s c u l a rr i s kd u et oo t h e rf a c t o r smight have been more likely to receive abacavir or didano- sine. However, after adjustment for risk factors, including predicted 10-year coronary risk, increased rates of MIpersisted for abacavir and didanosine. Additionally, the risk decreased after the drugs were discontinued, suggesting the increased risk is attributable to the drugs. Data for two othercommonly prescribed NRTIs, emtricitabine and tenofovir,were not presented in this analysis due to lack of sufficient follow-up time. The findings of this study merit additional investigation, which is underway. At this time, the DHHS has not changed their recommendations on the use of antiviral agents. 29Clinicians should take into consideration individual patient characteristicsand consider all available treatment options when deciding on the appropriate antiretroviral regimen for their patients. Patel, P., D. Hanson, P. Sullivan, et al. Incidence of types of cancer among HIV-infected persons compared with the general population in the United States, 1992 -2003. Ann Intern Med. 2008; 148:728 -36. HIV-infected individuals may be at an increased risk for certain cancers. Few studies have examined cancer incidence atdifferent stages of HIV infection or after the introduction ofHAART. This study compared the incidence of non-AIDS defining cancers among HIV-infected persons at all stages of infection and during different periods of HAART availability,compared with incidence in the general population. Additionally, the authors explored risk factors for certain cancers in HIV- infected persons. The authors compared the data from 54,780 HIV-infected persons [47,832 from the Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease (ASD) Project and 6,948 from the HIV OutpatientStudy (HOPS)] who contributed 157,819 person-years of observation from 1992 to 2003 with 334,802,121 person-years of the general population from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,and End Results (SEER) program of the National CancerInstitute. They determined standardized rate ratios (SRRs) for each and found the incidence for the following non-AIDS- defining cancers to be significantly higher in the HIV-infectedpopulation: anal (SRR 42.9; 95% CI, 34.1 to 53.3), 11.2 to 35.9), Hodgkin lymphoma CI, 11.6 to CI, 5.7 to10.1), to 3.6), 1.9 to 3.4), CI, 1.6 to 3.8), colorectal (SRR 1.8 to 2.9), and renal (SRR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7).Among HIV-infected for melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal, anal, and prostate cancer increased significantly over time, despite the introduction ofHAART during the study period. However, anal cancer was the only type of cancer for which the relative incidence for HIV- infected persons compared with the general population in-creased over time. In terms of risk factors, acquisition of HIV through male- male sex was associated with increased risk for Kaposi 's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Use of antiretro- viral therapy was associated with decreased risk for KS, non- Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical, lung, breast, and colorectalcancer; low CD4 nadir was associated with increased risk of KS, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical, anal, colorectal, and lung cancers. Hepatitis B or C coinfection was associated with increased risk of liver cancer. Limitations include (1) no formal evaluation of cancer data in these cohorts, (2) inadequate tobacco data, and (3) the cohorts are not representative of the overall HIV-infectedpopulation in the US. Still, the study suggests that HIV-infected281 Chaudhry et al.: Update in HIV Medicine JGIMindividuals are at an increased risk for certain cancers com- pared to the general population. Risks for some of these cancers may be reduced with currently available prevention strategies,and further work is needed to explore new strategies.

A complete understanding of the etiology of HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not yet been achieved, although factors related to the virus, per se, and use of ART appear to be related. Alcohol use is common among HIV-infected patients and has biological effects on fat distribution, yet alcohol's relationship to HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not been examined. The goalof this clinical study was to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on lipodystrophy in HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems. This was a prospective study (2001e 2006) of 289 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems. The primary outcome was self-reported lipodys- trophy, which was assessed at one time point (median 29 months after enrollment). Alcohol use was assessed every 6 months and classied as: abstinent at all interviews; $1 report of moderate drinking but no heavy drinking; 1 or 2 reports of heavy drinking; or $3 reports of heavy drinking. Multivariable logistic regression models were t to the data. Fifty-two percent (150/289) of subjects reported lipodystrophy.Alcohol consumption was: 34% abstinent at all interviews; 12% $1 of moderate drinking, but no heavy drinking; 34% 1e 2 reports of heavy drinking; and 20% $3 reports of heavy drinking. Although not statistically signicant, subjects with alcohol use had a higher odds of lipodystrophy (adjusted odds ratios and 95% condence moderate drinking, 2.36 reports of heavy drinking, 1.34 2.60]; $3 reports of heavy drinking, 2.07 [0.90, 4.73]). Alcohol use may increase the odds of developing HIV- associated lipodystrophy among subjects with alcohol problems. However, larger studies are needed to fully elucidate the role and impactof alcohol consumption on the development of this common long-term complication of HIV infection and its treatment. /C2112009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Lipodystrophy; HIV; Alcohol consumption Introduction Despite dramatic improvements in morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), several important long-term complications of thedisease and its treatment, including lipodystrophy syndrome,have been described. HIV-associated lipodystrophy(abnormal body fat distribution, often with hyperlipidemiaand/or glucose intolerance) is common, with a prevalenceranging from 20% to 80% in patients on ART ( Sattler, 2003 ). Between 20% and 50% of HIV-infected patients will report at least one sign of lipodystrophy within the rst 2years of starting ART ( Galli et al., 2002; Heath et al., 2002 ). The abnormal fat distribution is typically character- ized by fat accumulation in the neck, breasts, and abdomen,and fat loss in the face, buttocks, and extremities. Hyperlip-idemia and glucose intolerance may contribute to the riskfor cardiovascular and other atherosclerotic disease as patients age. In addition, patient's quality of life and adher- ence to ART may be adversely affected by lipodystrophythrough decreased self-esteem and stigmatization ( Blanch Elsevier All rights reserved. doi: 10.1016/j.alcohol.2008.09.004Alcohol 43 (2009) 65 e71 The cause of HIV-associated lipodystrophy is unclear, but it appears to be multifactorial in origin, involving host factors (Martinez et al., 2001b), HIV itself (Mujawar et al.,2006), and ART drug effects. The latter are particularlynotable with the use of the nucleoside analogue reversetranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors(Caron et al., 2001). ART may have an impact on liver lipid transport, glucose homeostasis ( Ben-Romano et al., 2003), and adipose tissue directly et al., 2001 ). The NRTIs specically affect mitochondrial DNA replica-tion (McComsey and Walker, 2004), which may explainthe prominence of abnormal fat distribution in thissyndrome because of the central role of mitochondria infat cells and the high content of mitochondria in brownfat in particular (Brinkman et al., 1999; Villarroya et al.,2007). Alcohol use is common among HIV-infected patients, and there are reasons to hypothesize that it may affectthe development of lipodystrophy. Alcohol has multipleeffects on metabolism, including changes in energy intake(A r m e l l i n ie ta l . ,1 9 9 3 ). An intriguing link can be found between alcohol use and mitochondrial DNA replicationin an uncommon disease referred to as multiple symmet-rical lipomatosis (MSL). First described by Madelung in1888 as a case series of lipomas in patients with chronic alcoholism, MSL is characterized by nonencapsulated lipomas in a symmetrical distribution, typically in thesubcutaneous fat of the back of the neck and the proximallegs and arms ( Brinkman et al., 1999; Enzi et al., 1977 ), with sparing or wasting of fat in the distal arms and legs(Coin et al., 2005). In a more recent case series, alcohol intake of over 50 mL per day was observed in 29 of 31patients with MSL ( Enzi et al., 2002 ). However, it is now known that many patients with MSL also have eithermutations in mitochondrial DNA or abnormal mitochon-drial function ( Klopstock et al., 1997; Schoffer and Grant, 2006), which leads to the hypothesis that heavy alcoholuse in people with reduced mitochondrial functionproduces an increased risk of abnormal fat growth. Inaddition, several investigators have suggested that HIV-associated lipodystrophy itself resembles MSL because of the similar patterns of abnormal fat distribution ( Brink- man et al., 1999; Hengel et al., Halabe, 1999), and Brinkman et al. ( Brinkman et al., 1999) have hypothesized that mitochondrial toxicityunderlies both syndromes. This association betweenalcohol use and MSL suggests the need to investigatewhether heavy alcohol consumption contributes to thedevelopment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. The goal of this study was to assess the association between alcohol consumption and lipodystrophy inHIV-infected adults with alcohol problems. The relation-ship of these two common conditions has received littleattention in this patient population. We examined thisissue using data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected persons with current or past alcohol problems.Materials and methods Study design and participant recruitment Subjects were participants in HIV-Longitudinal Inter- relationships of Viruses and Ethanol (HIV-LIVE), a prospective, observational cohort study of HIV-infectedpatients with current or past alcohol problems. Data werecollected at baseline and every 6 months thereafter for upto 42 months. Four hundred subjects were recruited from the following sources: (1) 38% previouscohort study at Boston Medical Center (BMC) with iden-tical inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Samet et al., 2004 ); (2) 22% ( n588) from the Diagnostic Evaluation Unit ( Sa- met et al., 1995 ), an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients at BMC; (3) 8% ( n531) from the HIV Primary Care and Specialty Clinics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC); and (4) 32% ( n5127) through flyers distributed in health-care centers, homeless shelters, and drug treatment programs; advertisements in newspapers; andreferrals from other HIV-LIVE subjects. Eligibility criteria were: (1) antibody byWestern blot; (2) screening questionnaire ( Buchsbaum et al., 1991; Mayeld et al., 1974 ) or diagnosis of lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence based on a study physician investigator clin-ical assessment; (3) ability to speak English or Spanish; and(4) at least one contact person. Exclusion criteria were: (1)score of !21 on the Folstein et al., 1975; Smith et al., 2006 ), or (2) trained interviewer assessment that the patient couldnot comprehend informed consent or answer the interview questions. In addition to the exclusion criteria noted for the HIV-LIVE study, the present analyses also excluded patients reporting moderate or severe isolated abdominalobesity to avoid confounding by age-related centraladiposity. Enrollment began August 2001 and ended July2003. Eligible subjects who wished to participate providedwritten informed consent prior to enrollment. Most inter-views took place at General Clinical Research Centers. The institutional review boards of BMC and BIDMC approved this study. Additional privacy protection wassecured with a Certicate of Condentiality from theDepartment of Health and Human Services to protectsubjects from release of research data under court orderor subpoena. Subject assessment Subjects received an interviewer-administered assess- ment at baseline and 6-month intervals, conducted in English or Spanish, including questions on demographics,HIV risk behaviors, alcohol consumption, and ART use inthe past 30 days. Lipodystrophy was evaluated at a single66 D.M. Cheng et al. / Alcohol 43 (2009) 65 e71follow-up visit using a questionnaire developed by Carr et al. ( Carr et al., 2003 ). These questions supplemented the standard assessment and were instituted in 2004. Due to the sequential study accrual, subjects were administeredthe supplemental assessment at different follow-up times.Fat loss and/or fat gain in the face, front, or sides of neck,back or base of neck, arms, breasts, waist, buttocks, andlegs were assessed. The severity of any reported fat gain/loss was rated as mild, moderate, or severe. The presence and location of any fat lumps was also evaluated by research associatee administered subject questionnaire. Past month alcohol consumption was assessed using a vali-dated calendar method ( Sobell and Sobell, 1996 ). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview AlcoholModule ( Robins et al., 1988 ) was administered following study enrollment to determine current (past 6 months)and lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse and dependence. We recorded CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels at each interview. Values were obtained by phlebotomy ifnot available from clinical records within 4 months of theinterview. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was measuredusing commercially available assays, either by branched-chain DNA or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-basedassays. Depressive symptoms were measured using theCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES- D); a $23 was used to denote substantial depres- sive symptoms in persons with chronic diseases ( Cook et al., 2002 ). ART use was assessed with the question, ''Have you ever taken antiviral medications for your HIV?'' Outcomes The primary outcome was self-reported lipodystrophy since diagnosis of HIV infection. It was dened as a response of moderate or severe changes in any of the following param-eters: fat loss in the face or arms; fat gain in the back or base ofthe neck; increase in breast size; decrease in fat on buttocks orlegs; or lipomatosis. The presence of lipodystrophy wasbased on an objective case denition previously developedand validated by Carr et al. (2003) but excluded clinical char- acteristics not generally recognized as manifestations ofHIV-associated lipodystrophy (i.e., fat gain in face, fat loss/gain in the front or sides of neck, fat loss in the back or baseof neck, fat gain in arms, decrease in breast size, increase infat on buttocks or legs, and decrease in waist size). Consistentwith the denition by Carr et al., patients reporting''moderate or severe isolated abdominal obesity'' wereexcluded from analyses to avoid confounding by age-related central adiposity. Three secondary outcomes were also examined: lipohypertrophy (dened as a response ofmoderate or severe fat gain in the back or base of the neckor increase in size of breast); lipoatrophy (dened asa response of moderate or severe fat loss in the face or arms,or decrease in fat on buttocks or legs); and reporting both fatgain (i.e., lipohypertrophy or lipomatosis) and fat loss (i.e.,lipoatrophy) since the diagnosis of HIV infection. The lastoutcome is a more stringent denition of lipodystrophy as it requires a report of both fat gain and fat loss, whereas the primary denition requires a report of either fat gain or fatloss. Primary independent variable At each study interview, alcohol use in the past 30 days was classied as heavy, moderate, or abstinent. Heavy alcohol use was dened as O14 drinks/week or $5 drinks on one occasion for men !66 years old, and O7 drinks/ week or $4 drinks on one occasion for men $66 years old and all women ( National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2005 ). Moderate alcohol use was dened as any drinking less than heavy amounts. The main inde- pendent variable was alcohol consumption, measuredacross all available study interviews between study enroll- ment and the follow-up visit when lipodystrophy was as- sessed. The longitudinal information collected on alcoholuse was combined, and subjects were classied into oneof the following four alcohol consumption categories: absti-nent at all available interviews; at least one report ofmoderate drinking but no heavy drinking; one or two inter-views in which heavy drinking was reported; and three ormore interviews in which heavy drinking was reported. Based on the denition of the highest drinking category, subjects who did not complete at least three study inter-views were excluded from analyses. Potential confounding factors The following potential confounders were included in the analyses: gender; age; race/ethnicity (black, white, other); hepatitis C RNA status (positive vs. negative); current depressive symptoms (yes vs. no); ART use (evervs. never); cocaine use past 6 months (yes vs. no); CD4 cellcount; and lifetime alcohol dependence diagnosis (no diag-nosis, abuse, dependence). Covariate values for depressivesymptoms, CD4 cell count, and cocaine use were takenfrom the follow-up interview at which lipodystrophy wasassessed. All other covariates were taken from study enrollment. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to assess the bivariate relationship between subject characteristics and lipodystro- phy for the study sample at enrollment. Chi-square andFisher's exact tests were used as appropriate to assess the bivariate associations. We examined the relationship between alcohol consumption and lipodystrophy by ttingmultivariable logistic regression models. Unadjusted andadjusted models controlling for all potential confoundingfactors were t to the data. Analyses of all secondaryoutcomes were also conducted using logistic regressionmodels. To minimize the potential for collinearity, we as-sessed correlation between pairs of independent variables67 D.M. Cheng et al. / Alcohol 43 (2009) 65 e71and veried that no pair of variables included in the same regression model was highly correlated (i.e., rO0.40). All analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and a signicance level of 0.05. Analyses were performed usingSAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Sample size considerations Among the 289 study subjects, 99 reported past month abstinence at all study visits, 34 had at least one report of past month moderate drinking but no heavy drinking, 98had one to two reports of heavy drinking during the pastmonth, and 58 had three or more such reports of heavy drinking. Consistent with the observed proportion of 50% reporting lipodystrophy among the reference group of thoseabstinent at all visits, the available sample sizes allow ourstudy 80% power to detect an odds ratio as small as 2.8for$3 episodes of heavy drinking, 2.4 for 1 e2 episodes of heavy drinking, and 3.7 for moderate but no heavydrinking. Power calculations were based on c 2tests using a signicance level of 0.05. Results Of the 400 HIV-LIVE subjects, 326 (82%) completed the follow-up study interview in which lipodystrophy was assessed. Of the 326 subjects who completed the lipodys-trophy questionnaire, 30 were excluded because of isolatedabdominal obesity and seven were excluded for havingfewer than three study visits at the time lipodystrophywas assessed. This resulted in a nal study sample of 289HIV-infected subjects with current or past of alcohol prob- lems. Among the study sample, the proportion that was assessed at the baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, and 60%, respectively. Characteristics of the study sample at study enrollment are shown in Table 1 . The majority were male (74%) and non-white (68%). The age range of the subjects was20.9e70.7 years, with a mean of 42.9. At study enrollment, 46% reported cocaine use in the past 12 months, 48% hadsubstantial current depressive symptoms (CES-D $23), 50% were hepatitis C RNA positive, and 87% had evertaken ART. CD4 cell count ranged from 8 to 1809 cells/mm 3, with a median of 404. The proportions in each alcohol consumption category were as follows: 34% wereabstinent at all interviews; 12% had at least one report ofpast month moderate drinking, but no heavy drinking; 34% had 1 e2 reports of past month heavy drinking; 20% had$3 reports of past month heavy drinking. Among the 289 study subjects, 150 (52%) had loss. The median follow-up timeat which lipodystrophy was assessed was 29 months afterstudy enrollment (interquartile range 20 e31 months). The mean and median number of interviews that occurredbetween enrollment and the time that lipodystrophy was assessed was 5 (interquartile range 4 e6 interviews) and the mean and median number of interviews that occurred overall (i.e., including interviews that occurred followingassessment of lipodystrophy) was 7 (interquartile range6e8 interviews).Table 1 Characteristics of the subjects at study bivariate associa-tions with lipodystrophy ( N5289) Variable Number (%)Number (%) reportinglipodystrophy by characteristic Alcohol consumption a Abstinent at all interviews 99 (34%) 50 (51%)$1 Report of moderate drinking 34 (12%) 18 (53%) 1e2 Reports of heavy drinking 98 (34%) 49 (50%) $3 Reports of heavy drinking 58 (20%) 33 (57%) Gender Male 214 (74%) 104 (49%) Female 75 (26%) 46 (61%) Hepatitis C RNA Positive 143 (49%) 79 (55%) Negative 145 (51%) 70 (48%) Center White 92 (32%) 55 (60%) Black 138 (48%) 69 (50%) Other 59 (20%) 26 (44%) Antiretroviral therapy use* Never 37 (13%) 12 (32%) Ever 251 (87%) 137 (55%) Recent cocaine use No 156 (54%) 83 (53%) Yes 133 (46%) 67 (50%) Age (years) b 21e40 117 (40%) 59 (50%) 41e48 96 52 Lifetime alcohol diagnosis No diagnosis 37 (13%) 19 (51%) Abuse 55 (19%) 25 (45%) Dependence 193 (68%) 104 (54%) Recent alcohol diagnosis No diagnosis 249 (87%) 131 (53%) Abuse 7 (2%) 3 (43%) Dependence *P!.05 for bivariate association with lipodystrophy. aReport is based on assessment of alcohol use in the past month at each research interview. bBased on tertiles from study sample. cn5271.68 D.M. Cheng et al. / Alcohol 43 (2009) 65 e71In multiple logistic regression models controlling for potential confounders, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% condence intervals (CIs) for lipodystrophy were 2.07(0.90, 4.73) for $3 reports of any past month heavy drinking; 1.34 (0.69, 2.60) for 1e 2 reports of any past month heavy drinking; and 2.36 (0.89, 6.24) for any past month moderatebut heavy ( Table 2). Factors signicantly associ- [95% CI: 1.02, 1.25]per 100 unit increase). Secondary analyses excluding depres-sive symptoms as a covariate produced similar results (AOR[95% CI]: $1 report of moderate drinking, 2.23 [0.86, 5.78]; reports of heavy drinking, 1.46 [0.76, 2.80]; and $3 reports of heavy drinking, 2.14 [0.95, 4.82]). In secondaryanalyses of the effect of any reports of past month drinking(yes vs. no), the AOR and 95% CI for lipodystrophy was 1.63 (0.89, 3.22). The estimated associations between alcohol consumption and each of the secondary outcomes are reported in Table 3. For lipohypertrophy, subjects in each drinking category had a higher odds of reporting lipohypertrophy compared tothose who were abstinent at all interviews (AOR CI]:2.51 3.25] for 1e 2 reports of heavy drinking; and 3.52 [1.07, 11.54] for moderate but no heavy drinking), with thelast comparison being statistically signicant. For lipoatro-phy, reports of and 1.15 [0.44, 3.01] for moderate but noheavy drinking. For reporting both fat gain and fat loss,subjects with 1 e2 reports of heavy drinking had increased odds of the outcome, but no association was statistically signicant. Discussion Lipodystrophy syndrome is common in HIV-infected patients, is multifactorial in origin, and is associated with decreased self-esteem, stigmatization, and possibly an increased risk of cardiovascular and other atherosclerotic disease. Alcohol use is also frequent among HIV-infectedpersons. Based on the link between chronic alcoholismand the development of abnormal fat growth in patientswith mitochondrial replication decits, as seen in MSL,we hypothesized that alcohol use increases the risk ofHIV-associated lipodystrophy. Exploration of this associa-tion has not been an active area of clinical HIV investiga- tion. Our results suggest the potential of a clinically important relationship between alcohol and lipodystrophyamong a cohort of HIV-infected subjects with alcohol prob-lems. Subjects with multiple reports of heavy drinking hadtwice the odds of reporting lipodystrophy compared tothose reporting abstinence, although these ndings werenot statistically signicant. Alcohol consumption may beassociated with the secondary outcome lipohypertrophy, where a statistically signicant result was observed for moderate drinking compared to abstinence. In the present study, alcohol use was prospectively examined at 6-month intervals using a comprehensive,validated instrument. In addition, we used a denition forlipodystrophy based on the objective case denition vali-dated by Carr et al. (2003 ). Several factors that may be associated with HIV-associated lipodystrophy, such as ART use, depressive symptoms, and cocaine use, were ac- counted for in the regression analyses to minimize thepotential for confounding. The ndings that both ART useand depressive symptoms were associated with lipodystro-phy provide face validity for the cohort and the denitionused to examine the association between alcohol use andlipodystrophy. These ndings are consistent with themedical literature that suggests that ART use likely playsTable 2 Adjusted odds ratios for lipodystrophy based on multivariable logistic regression analyses of 289 HIV-infected subjects with current or past alcohol problems VariableAdjusted odds ratio (95% condence interval) Alcohol consumptiona Abstinent at all interviews Report of moderate drinking 2.36 (0.89, 6.24) 1e2 Reports of heavy drinking 1.34 (0.69, 2.60) $3 Reports of heavy drinking 2.07 (0.90, 4.73) Gender Male 1.00 Female 1.83 (0.95, Positive 1.00 Negative 0.90 Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression !23 (1.30, 4.15)* Race White 1.00 Black 0.64 (0.34, 1.19) Other 0.60 (0.28, 1.29) Antiretroviral therapy use* Never 1.00 Ever 2.64 (1.10, 6.36)* Recent cocaine use No 1.00 Yes 1.36 (0.69, 2.68) Age (per 10 year increase) 1.42 (0.95, 2.13) CD4 Count (per 100 cells/mm3increase) 1.13 (1.02, 1.25)* Lifetime alcohol diagnosis No diagnosis 1.00 Abuse 0.42 (0.16, 1.10) Dependence 0.72 (0.32, 1.61) *P!.05. aReport is based on assessment of alcohol use in the past month at each research interview.69 D.M. Cheng et al. / Alcohol 43 (2009) 65 e71an etiologic role in the development of lipodystrophy (Ben-Romano et al., 2003; Caron et al., 2001 ); depressive symptoms may be a consequence of the undesirable bodilychanges that dene this syndrome ( Blanch et al., 2004; Martinez et al., 2001a ). The primary limitation of the present study is that our denition of lipodystrophy relied solely on self-report anddid not include a physical assessment by a clinician. Thepotential for measurement error from the self-reportedoutcome may have biased our estimates. However, if thereis reporting bias, we would expect an under-reporting oflipodystrophy. Thus, if there was a positive associationbetween alcohol use and lipodystrophy, such under-reporting would bias our results toward the null hypothesis of no association. A second limitation of the study was a lack of power to detect associations of the observedmagnitude. This study is a secondary data analysis andwas not designed to determine the impact of alcohol on lip-odystrophy. However, these data provide estimates of themagnitude of the alcohol effect and will be useful indesigning future studies that will more denitively assessthe effect of alcohol use on HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Another limitation of the study is the potential for misclassication of alcohol consumption status given thatsubjects were observed for the past 30 days rather thanthe past 6 months at each study visit. However, we useda validated measure for assessing alcohol consumptionand one that has been shown to be correlated with assess-ments of longer timeframes ( Carey et al., 2004; Koppes et al., 2000 ). There is also the potential for residual confounding due to uncontrolled confounders or misclassi-cation of confounders, which may have biased the resultsof this study. Finally, the observational study design and thepossibility that lipodystrophy could have occurred prior toalcohol consumption limit our ability to establish a causalrelationship between alcohol consumption and develop-ment of lipodystrophy. Instead, the results describe theassociation between the pattern of alcohol use prior to the assessment of lipodystrophy. Of note, if subjects decreased their consumption after developing lipodystrophy, wewould expect to see a negative association betweendrinking and lipodystrophy, not the positive associationobserved in the study. Nonetheless this study, novel forits evaluation of this research question, providespreliminary, hypothesis-generating data that may be usefulin planning future clinical studies. Alcohol use in HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems may increase the likelihood of developing HIV-associated lipodystrophy. However, larger studies areneeded to fully elucidate its role and impact on the devel- opment of this common long-term complication of HIV infection and its treatment.

Key Points 1.1 Know that breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among women in the U.S . 1.2Know that age alone remains the greatest risk factor for breast cancer, and most new breast cancer cases occur in women with no other known predictors . 1.3Recognize that mammography remains the most widely studied breast cancer screening modality and the only available screening modality that has been shown to reduce mortality . 1.4 Recognize that the best evidence of routine mammographic screening efficacy exists for average-risk women aged 50 to 69 years. 1.Sldentify patients at increased risk for breast cancer who require tailored screening strategies based on personal history (Le., thoracic irradiation) or family history (Le., known or suspected hereditary breast cancer syndromes) . ., 2. Population at Risk 2.1 Recognize that breast cancer incidence and death rates increase most significantly with advancing age and that most cases of breast cancer occur in women aged 40 years and older with no known predisposition (average risk), which supports routine screening in this population . Evidence: Excluding nonmelanoma cancers of the skin, breast cancer is the most common female cancer (26% of all new cancers) and the second most common cause of cancer death (15% of all cancer deaths) in women in the U.S. It is estimated that in 2008 there will be 182,460 new cases of invasive breast cancer, 67,770 new cases of in situ breast cancer, and 40,480 breast cancer deaths (1: 2). Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women aged 20 to 59 years, with 13,368 deaths in 2005 (1). The cumulative lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer is 12.3% (or 1 in 8 women). This is considered the average risk (~; ~). Age is one of the most significant risk factors for breast cancer. The risk at age 70 is more than 10 times the risk at age 30 (2; ~). The median age at diagnosis for breast cancer from 2001 to 2005 was 61 years, and the median age at death was 69 years (~). PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

From 2000 to 2004, 95% of new cases of breast cancer and 97% of breast cancer deaths occurred in women aged 40 years and older. The majority of new cases (approximately 70%) were in women aged 55 years and older (~). Comments: More than 50% of new breast cancer cases occur in women without known predictors (2). 2.2 Identify women with a family history of breast cancer, either maternal or paternal, and realize that patients with known or suspected hereditary breast cancer syndromes require tailored screening strategies and genetic counseling . Evidence: Epidemiologic data on 193 breast cancer cases accrued from a cohort of 7508 women in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study indicate that a positive family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of breast cancer (RR, 2.6) (2). A cross-sectional study of 389,300 women undergoing screening mammography showed that the rates of breast cancer detection in women with a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative were increased and were similar to the cancer detection rates in women at average risk who were 10 years older (Z). A meta-analysis of 74 published studies found that the magnitude of pooled risk is further stratified by certain features of the family history, including degree of relatedness to the affected family member, number of affected family members, age of the affected family member, presence of bilateral cancer in affected family members, and family history of ovarian cancer. The relative risks were as follows: one first-degree relative, 2.1 (CI, 2.0 to 2.2); one first-degree relative under age 50, 2.3 (CI, 2.2 to 2.5); one first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer, 9.8 (CI, 2.0 to 24.9); one second-degree relative, 1.5 (CI, 1.4 to 1.6); two first-degree relatives, 3.6 (Ct, 2.5 to 5.0); first-degree relative with ovarian cancer, 1.27 (CI, 0.9 to 1.8) (\u00a7). Data from a population-based, case-control study of women with a family history of breast cancer that included 4730 women aged 20 to 54 years with breast cancer and 4688 control subjects found that the risk for women with one or more affected relatives is always higher than that for the general population. This risk decreases and approaches the rate for the general population as the age at onset for the relative increases. Most importantly, the risk of early-onset breast cancer is highest when there is a family history of early (premenopausal) breast cancer in a first-degree relative. The risk for women with second-degree relatives with a history of breast cancer is half that of those with a first-degree relative with a history of breast cancer (.a).

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STKI1). Approximately 80% to 90% of known inherited breast cancer syndromes involve a BRCAI or BRCA2 mutation C1Q)\u00b7 The combined prevalence of BRCAI and BRCA2 mutation is 1 in 40 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (11). The risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 is estimated to be 65% and 45% for BRCAI and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively (12; ,U). Comments: When family history appears to be the primary risk factor, the individual risk assessment models (Cancer and Steroid Hormone study [CASH] and BRCAPRO) may help to determine the age at which to initiate screening and the appropriate frequency and modality (!t; 14). The American Cancer Society now recommends routine screening with annual MRI alternating every 6 months with mammography for women with a greater than 25% risk of developing breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/genetics_screening.pdf) recommends referral to a cancer genetics professional if there is a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer suggestive of an inherited syndrome. 2.3 Recognize that although the greatest risk for recurrence is within 5 years of diagnosis, breast cancer survivors remain at increased risk for recurrence or development of a new primary throughout their lifetime . Evidence: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project found a cumulative rate of local recurrence of 14% 20 years after breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. This rate went up to 39% if radiation therapy was not administered (15). An Italian study of 2233 women treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation showed a local recurrence rate of 1% per year, with distant recurrences found most frequently in the second year and declining each year thereafter, such that recurrence rates were 1.5% in the fifth year and 1 % in the tenth year (1\u00a7). A review of the Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group data from 3585 women found a recurrence rate of 2% per year, with the greatest recurrence in the second year (17). A review of 16 cohort studies found that women with a history of breast cancer also have an increased risk of developing a new cancer in the contralateral breast. This risk of developing a second primary tumor is two to six times the risk in the general population and is even higher for patients with a hereditary cancer syndrome (la). Comments: In the U.S., 85% of all patients with breast cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis, corresponding to an estimated 2 million women (~).

Evidence: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, which included over 6000 female survivors and 111 cases of breast cancer, showed that young female survivors treated with chest radiation are at an increased risk for breast cancer compared with women in the age-matched general population. Breast cancer risk in childhood Hodgkin's disease survivors treated with chest radiation therapy had an observed standardized incidence ratio of 26.3 compared to 4.8 among all survivors who did not receive chest irradiation (20). Atypical ductal hyperplasia is believed to be a precursor to invasive cancer and represents a midpoint in the histologic continuum of proliferative breast disease between usual ductal hyperplasia and DCIS. A 2005 review of the literature found that women with a history of one or more breast biopsies showing atypical hyperplasia have a four- to six-fold increase in their lifetime breast cancer risk (21). Data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project show that women with lobular neoplasia on a breast biopsy have a risk of developing breast cancer in either breast of approximately 1% per year (22). Comments: Based on the high risk of breast cancer in women who received radiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and 35 years, annual breast MRI screening has been recommended as an adjunct to mammography by an expert panel convened by the American Cancer Society (23). 2.5 Recognize that despite a lower incidence of breast cancer among blacks compared with whites, mortality rates are higher in blacks than in any other racial or ethnic group, especially among young \u00ab40 years) black women, in part due to underutilization of routine screening . Evidence: From 2000 to 2004, the overall incidence rate of breast cancer among black women was 118.3 in 100,000 compared to 132.5 in 100,000 among white women (unadjusted for age) (1). The overall mortality rate among black women with breast cancer from 2000 to 2004 was 33.8 in 100,000 compared to 25 in 100,000 among white women (2.). Data from nine SEER databases between 1995 and 2004 showed that the age-adjusted incidence of invasive breast cancer for black women under age 40 was significantly higher than that for white women (RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.10 to 1.23]). The age-adjusted mortality rate for black women PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N. Independence Mall West, Philadelphia. PA 19106-1572, USA.

Compared to white women, black women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with regional or distant disease, have a lower relative 5-year survival rate, and have a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with tumors with poorer prognosis (24). Breast cancer disparities have been attributed to a complex interplay of biologic tumor characteristics along with racial and social inequalities, leading to unequal access to timely, quality cancer care (25). Comments: None. 2.6 Recognize that although breast cancer risk is associated with hormonal influences, such as early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, or the use of certain exogenous hormones, these alone may not influence screening recommendations . Evidence: Early age at menarche \u00ab12 years) and late age at menopause (>54 years) are associated with relative risks of breast cancer of 1.5 and 2.0, respectively (2\u00a7; 27). An analysis of over 7500 women in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that nulliparity and late age at first full-term pregnancy (>30 years) are associated with relative risks of 1.8 (CI, 1.1 to 2.9) and 1.9 (CI, 1.1 to 3.3), respectively (\u00a7.). Meanwhile, women who have their first child before age 20 have a 50% reduction in lifetime breast cancer risk compared with women who do not have children (28). Two meta-analyses based largely on older studies showed a small increase in the relative risk of breast cancer with oral contraceptive use. The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer study found a relative risk of 1.07 (CI, 1.02 to 1.13) for women who had ever used oral contraceptives compared to those who had never used them (29). A more recent meta-analysis found an increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer, with a relative risk of 1.19 (CI, 1.09 to 1.29) (30). However, the more recent Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences study found no association between past or present oral contraceptive use and breast cancer (RR, 1.0 [CI, 0.8 to 1.3]) (~). Data from the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized, controlled trial including 16,608 postmenopausal women, found that associated with a 26% excess of breast cancer (hazard ratio, 1.26 [CI, 0.83 to 1.92]) (32). Comments: An individual's relative and absolute risk of developing breast cancer can be calculated using a multivariate risk prediction model, such as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail model).

Effectiveness/Harms of Screening Tests 3.1 Recognize that the sensitivity and specificity of identifying breast lumps with BSE are too low to justify its use in routine screening . Evidence: A review by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force estimated a 20% to 30% sensitivity of BSE alone as a screening modality for breast cancer (~). The sensitivity of BSE has been found to decrease with age (41% for women aged 35 to 39 and 21% for women aged 60 to 74) (33; 34). In a study of lump detection in silicone breast models, the sensitivity was 40% to 89%, and the specificity was 66% to 81% (~). Although the accuracy of BSE has been shown in some studies to increase with formal training and with the thoroughness of the exam (.:i\u00a7; ;IT), other studies have shown no improvement with additional instruction (38). Comments: None. 3.2 Recognize that although the sensitivity of CBE is only 54%, CBE can detect many of the cancers that are not visualized by mammography .., See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. Evidence: CBE had a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 94% in a review of pooled data from six large, controlled breast cancer screening trials in which CBE was included as part of the breast cancer screening regimen. In this review, CBE alone detected between 5.2% and 29% of breast cancers that mammography missed (~). In the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York Randomized Controlled Trial, Edinburgh Randomized Trial of Breast Cancer Screening, and the Canadian National Breast Screening Study-1 and -2, the sensltlvlty of combined screening with mammography and CBE was higher than that of mammography alone (40; 41; 42; 43; 44). In a study of over 750,000 CBEs provided to low-income women in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, 5% of cancers were found in patients with abnormal CBE results recorded but mammographic results that were reported as negative or benign. SensitiVity and specificity in this group for CBE were 58.8% and 93.4%, respectively (45). In a study of 61,688 women aged 40 years and older, CBE detected an PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N. Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA 19106-1572.

Sensitivity increased when CBE was added to screening mammography in women of all ages, from 6.8% in women aged 50 to 59 years with dense breasts to 1.8% in women aged 60 to 69 years with fatty breasts (~). Sensitivity can also be evaluated for the detection of lumps embedded in silicone breast models. CBE sensitivity as measured on silicone models ranged from 40% to 71%. CBE duration and use of correct CBE technique correlated significantly with lump detection accuracy in silicone models (39). Data from both clinical studies and studies using silicone models suggest that additional factors, such as age, obesity, breast size, and baseline breast nodularity, also affect CBE sensitivity (39; 47). Comments: The MammaCare\u00ae method is the preferred technique for CBE and has been validated in a randomized, controlled trial. The technique consists of several components, including patient positioning so that the breast tissue is flattened against the patient's chest, examining all of the breast tissue beginning in the axilla and extending down the midaxillary line to the bra line and then moving medially in vertical strips to cover all the tissue between the clavicle and the bra line to the sternum, and using the pads of the three middle fingers to palpate each area of breast tissue in three small circles using three different pressures (superficial, intermediate, and deep) (36; ~; 1\u00a7.). The American Cancer Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also support the use of this standardized approach to CBE (\u00a7). 3.3 Appreciate that the sensitivity of routine screening mammography ranges from 71% to 96% and varies by a number of patient, technical, and provider factors, whereasthe specificity ranges from 94% to 97% . See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. See table Randomized, Controlled Trials of Screening Mammography. Evidence: The majority of information about the operating characteristics of mammography is derived from reviews of data from eight randomized, controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of screening mammography among 490,000 women over an average of 14 years of follow-up (g,; 44; 50). The sensitivity of screening mammography is lower for women in their 40s compared with women aged 50 years and older (~; Q1). The positive predictive value of mammography increases with age, from 1% to 4% for women in their 40s to 20% for women in their 70s (52). The positive predictive value varies widely across studies, depending on how a \"positive mammogram\" is defined (e.g., a mammogram requiring \"further evaluation\" or a mammogram requiring \"biopsy evaluation\"). The sensitivity of screening mammography is lower in women with denser breasts (~; 21). PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

The sensitivity of screening mammography is lower in women on hormone replacement therapy. A number of studies have shown that the sensitivity of screening mammography is reduced by 7% to 21% in current hormone replacement therapy users compared to never or former users, partly due to the changes in breast density resulting from hormone use (\u00a7; ~; M; ~; ~; 57). The sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography are unchanged by a woman's family history of breast cancer; however, because the disease is more prevalent in women with a family history of breast cancer, the positive predictive value of mammography is higher in this population (Z). The sensitivity of screening mammography also is affected by the quality of mammography, the number of mammographic views, the experience of the radiologist, and the choice of follow-up evaluation for abnormal test results (,2). Comments: Because the sensitivity of mammography is not 100%, palpable breast lumps and other breast symptoms still should be evaluated completely (e.g., biopsy) in the presence of a normal mammography result. 3.4 Know that overall cancer detection rates for digital mammography are similar to those for traditional film (analog) mammography . See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. Evidence: Four large, prospective studies involVing over 85,000 women compared the use of film mammography vs. digital mammography and showed little difference in the overall cancer detection rates. The Oslo I study conducted in 2000 obtained both film and digital mammography in 3683 women. Film mammography detected 28 of 31 cancers, whereas digital mammography detected 23 of 31 cancers (P=0.23) (.2.e.). Another study obtained both film and digital mammography in 6736 women. Of the 42 cancers detected after 1-year follow-up, 27 were detected with digital mammography and 33 were detected with film mammography (P<0.1O) (~). The Oslo II study randomly assigned 25,263 women to either digital or film mammography and found slightly higher cancer rates for all women with digital mammography vs. film mammography (59% vs. 41%; P<0.06). Digital mammography performed slightly better in women aged 50 to 69 years, but there was no difference in women aged 40 to 49 years (60). The largest study, the Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial, obtained both digital and film mammography in 49,760 women. The overall sensitivity of film mammography was not different from that of digital mammography (52% vs. 55%); however, the sensitivity of digital mammography was higher than that of film mammography in women under age 50 (67% vs. 44%) and women with dense breasts (57% vs. PIER is copyrighted (e) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Comments: The advantages of digital mammography over film mammography include easier storage and retrieval, the ability to manipulate images, the potential for lower average radiation exposure, and the capacity for real-time teleradiology (sending films off site for immediate interpretation). However, these advantages come at a significant increase in cost (up to four times the cost of film mammography). Traditional film mammography is still a very acceptable modality for breast cancer screening. Digital mammography may provide an increase in detection rates for young women or those with dense breasts. 3.5 Be aware that current evidence suggests that the use of computer-aided detection systems contributes minimally to improvement in cancer detection rates, mainly in the detection of in situ rather than invasive cancer. \" See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. Evidence: A large pre- and postobservational study (n=429,345 mammograms) compared the performance of mammography at 43 mammography facilities. Seven of these facilities implemented computer-aided detection during the study period from 1998 to 2002 (n=31, 186 mammograms). Among these seven facilities, there was a nonsignificant increase in the sensitivity (from 80.4% to 84%) before and after implementation of computer-aided detection, a significant decrease in the specificity (from 90% to 87%) and the positive predictive value (from 4.1% to 3.2%), and a 20% increase in the biopsy rate (P<0.001). There was also a trend toward an increase in the cancer detection rate, which was limited to DCIS, did not include invasive cancers, and was not statistically significant (22). A study compared 10,267 mammograms, originally read in 1996,236 of which detected cancer (83% invasive, 15% in situ) after 3 years of follow-up. At a later date, for purposes of the study, each set of films was either double read by two radiologists or single read with computer-aided detection by four radiologists. The overall rate of cancer detection with a single read plus computer-aided detection was higher (49.1%) than that for the double read without computer-aided detection (42.6%; P=0.02) (~). A prospective study compared radiologist-only interpretation of screening mammograms to evaluation with computer-aided detection after radiologist reading. Of the 12,860 women in the study, the radiologists recalled 830 (6.5%), whereas computer-aided detection resulted in an additional 156 patients recalled (7.9% total). Biopsy was recommended for 124 women. Detection rates for invasive cancer were 29 without computer-aided detection and 31 with computer-aided detection; DCIS was detected in 12 women without computer-aided detection and 18 women with computer-aided detection. Detection of invasive cancer was PIER is copyrighted (e) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N. Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA 19106-1572. USA.

Over a 3-year period, a single academic system with six sites and 24 radiologists evaluated 59,139 mammograms with computer-aided detection and 56,432 without. Rates of cancer detection were 3.49% with computer-aided detection and 3.55% without computer-aided detection (P=0.68). rates were similar (11.62% vs. 11.05%) (QQ.). Comments: Computer-aided detection involves the use of a computer-based system that scans mammographic images and uses algorithms to mark areas of concern. It can be used with digital images or film images that are then digitized. The typical system places an average of three marks on a set of bilateral craniocaudal and medial lateral oblique images (64). Computer-aided detection is approved by the FDA and is covered by Medicare and many third-party insurers. 3.6 Know that among high-risk women, the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced breast MRI is higher (77% [GI, 70% [GI, 37% to 41%]). See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. Evidence: The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Screening Study obtained annual MRls and mammograms between 1999 and 2003 for 1909 women aged 25 to 70 years with hereditary breast cancer (greater than 15% lifetime risk by Claus criteria), 358 of whom were known to have a BRCAl or BRCA2 mutation. MRI sensitivity was 71% overall (70% in mutation carriers) compared with 40% (30% in mutation carriers) for mammography. Specificity was 99% for mammography and 96% for MRI (Q\u00a7). In a study of 236 women with a known BRCAl or BRCA2 mutation, the sensitivity of mammography was 36% compared with 77% for MRI and 27% for ultrasound. Specificity was 93%, 95%, and 99% for MRI, ultrasound, and mammography, respectively (67). A prospective, multicenter, cohort study in the UK offered 649 women aged 35 to 49 years annual screening with both mammography and MRI for 2 to 7 years. All of the women were at high risk, with a strong family history of breast cancer or a known mutation. Thirty-five cancers were detected during the study. The sensitivity of mammography was lower (40%) than that of MRI (93%) and was much lower for women with a personal or family history of a BRCAl mutation (23% vs. 92%), in whom 13 of the cancers were identified. Specificity was 81% for MRI compared with 93% for mammography (Qa). A cohort of 529 women with a greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer underwent screening with mammography, MRI, and ultrasound. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 years, 43 cancers (34 invasive) were detected. Sensitivity was 91% for MRI compared with 33% for mammography and 40% for ultrasound. The specificities for both MRI and mammography were 97% (69). PIER is copyrighted (e) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N. Independence Mall West. Philadelphia, PA 19106-1572. USA.

PIER users should compare the date of the last update on the website with any printout to ensure that the information being referred to is the most current available. A meta-analysis of these studies calculated the sensitivity of MRI to be 77% (CI, 70% to 84%) compared with 39% (CI, 37% to 41%) for mammography. The specificity of MRI was 86.3% (CI, 80.9% to 91.7%) compared mammography (ZQ). Comments: Four large prospective non-randomized studies and seven smaller studies have been reported, plus one meta-analysis. All compare the sensitivity and specificity of MRI and mammography when both are used annually for screening high-risk women with hereditary breast cancer Three of the aforementioned studies also included screening ultrasound of the breast, which had sensitivities similar to those of mammography. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Screening Study found that MRI was more sensitive in detecting invasive cancers, especially those that are small, hormone receptor negative, and nonductal. Mammography was better at detecting DCIS. The American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (http://www .nccn. org/professionals/physician _gIs/POF /breast -screen ing.pdf) have released guidelines regarding the use of breast MRI as a screening tool in high-risk women. The American Cancer Society recommendations include women with an estimated lifetime breast cancer risk of 20% or higher, as defined by prediction models that are based largely on family history, such as the BRCAPRO and Claus models (23; 78). The sensitivities reported for screening mammography in these studies are lower than those reported in the evidence for sensitivity of routine screening mammography and detection rates for digital mammography due to the younger ages of the populations studied. 3.7 Understand that currently there is no evidence for the use of contrast-enhanced breast MRI as a screening tool for average-risk women. {I Evidence: There are no clinical trials of the use of MRI to screen for breast cancer in average-risk women. Comments: The American Cancer Society specifically recommends against screening MRls for women at average risk for breast cancer, which is defined as a lifetime risk of less than 15% (23). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician-9ls/PDF/breast-screening. pdf) do not recommend MRI for average-risk women (78). 3.8 Understand that currently there is no evidence to recommend the use of ultrasound to screen women at high risk for breast cancer .

See table Operating Characteristics for Breast Cancer Screening Tests. Evidence: In a study of 236 women with a known BRCAJ or BRCA2 mutation, the sensitivity of ultrasound was 27% compared with 36% for mammography and 77% for MRI (67). A cohort of 529 women with a greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer underwent screening with mammography, MRI, and ultrasound. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 years, 43 cancers (34 invasive) were detected. Sensitivity was 91% for MRI compared with 33% for mammography and 40% for ultrasound. The specificities for both MRI and mammography were 97% (Q.9.). In a study of women at high risk for breast cancer (over 50% with a personal history and a 5-year risk of at least 1.7% according to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool) with dense breast tissue. the sensitivities of mammography and ultrasound each were 50% and increased to 77% when the modalities were used in combination. The specificities of mammography and ultrasound alone were higher (96% and 92%, respectively) than in combination (89%). The false-positive rate using ultrasound was higher (12%) than that of mammography (9.6%) (79). Comments: Ultrasound appears to add little to screening mammography in high-risk women. 3.9 Realize that the major harm associated with all screening modalities is a high false-positive rate, which may lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures . Evidence: The majority of abnormal screening mammograms (80% to 90%) lead to false-positive test results that initiate additional diagnostic imaging and/or biopsy (Q; 34; 44; QQ). Over a decade of annual screening, a woman has a 50% cumulative risk of navinq at least one false-positive mammography result. Among women who do not have breast cancer, almost 20% will undergo breast biopsies during this 1a-year screening interval (80). The risk of haVing a false-positive mammography result varies Widely and is based on both patient factors and radiologist and/or system factors. The risk is highest in younger women because the specificity of mammography is lower and because breast cancer is less common in this population (81). Current evidence shows that computer-aided detection may increase the false-positive rate of mammography (62). The recall rates associated with digital mammography appear to be slightly higher than those for film mammography. Recall rates vary widely between studies, from 3.7% to 4.6% in the Oslo I and II studies (Q\u00a7; Q,Q) to 8.5% to 12% in American trials (~; Q,1).

Although there is as much as a doubling of the cancer detection rate with the addition of MRI to mammography, the recall rate and biopsy rate are also twice as high (66; \u00a7.\u00a7.). This is due to the lower specificity of MR', as seen in all of the large MRI screening studies. In the MRI screening studies, recall rates (for additional imaging) range from 8% to 17%, and biopsy rates range from 3% to 15%. The majority of patients recalled for additional imaging were able to be evaluated without the need for biopsy (Q\u00a7; 68; 70). Several studies suggest that the highest false-positive rate is in the first round of screening and that the recall rates decrease to less than 10% in subsequent rounds of screening (Q\u00a7; 82; 83). Comments: None. 3.10 Realize that false reassurance due to false-negative mammography findings is low among women aged 50 to 65 years and increases among younger women . Evidence: Screening mammography has been found to have a false-negative rate ranging from 5% to 30%. The risk of a false-negative mammography result is higher in younger women because mammography is less sensitive in this population (Q; 34; 44; 50). Comments: None. 3.11 Know that the available evidence suggests that the radiation risk from mammography is low compared to the benefit of routine screening, but no prospective studies have been conducted . Evidence: Established benefit from annual mammography far outweighs the theoretical risk from radiation exposure. It has been estimated that annual mammographic screening of 100,000 women for 10 consecutive years (starting at age 40) would result in 40 lives saved and a maximum of eight breast cancer deaths occurring during their lifetime (84). A case-control study involving 1600 patients with breast cancer and 1600 control subjects without breast cancer who were matched for BRCA mutation found no association between ever having undergone screening mammography and risk of breast cancer, even among BRCAl and BRCA2 carriers (85). Comments: Modern mammography systems require <0.2 rad per exposure for an average-sized breast (.\u00a7\u00a7.). This is in comparison to high-dose radiation exposure for treatment of Hodgkin's disease, which exposes the breasts to as much as 100 to 2000 rad (87).

ED Evidence: Several studies have demonstrated the impact of false-positive mammography results on patient anxiety level. In a study of 8854 women undergoing mammography, 47% of those with a false-positive result reported anxiety related to the mammographic findings and concern regarding breast cancer. Anxiety levels were persistently elevated at 3 months, although they had decreased from levels measured at 3 weeks after the mammogram (1i\u00a7.). Similar findings in another study of 308 women suggest that almost 20% of the women with adverse psychological effects from mammography had an impaired ability to perform daily activities (89). Elevated anxiety levels can continue for up to 18 months (~) and appear to persist despite an additional evaluation excluding the diagnosis of breast cancer (88; ~). A study in the UK found that women with false-positive mammography results had significantly greater adverse psychological consequences compared to women who had received a clear result at their initial mammogram when surveyed 1 month before their next routine breast screening appointment 3 years later (ill,,), A prospective cohort study examining psychological distress in a group of Finnish women aged 50 years and older showed intrusive thinking and anxiety regarding breast cancer 12 months after a false-positive mammography result; however, 98.7% of the women with false-positive results intended to re-attend screening (92). In a Swedish study of 509 women recalled for further investigation after mammographic screening, there was a high prevalence of anxiety before the recall visit but no evidence of increased long-term anxiety or depression at 12 months (93). A cross-sectional survey of 479 women found that there was a good understanding of the possibility of false-positive test results in screening mammography and that women seem to accept false-positive results as a consequence of screening (94). Two systematic reviews have examined the psychological effect of mammographic screening. The first reviewed 10 studies and determined that anxiety appears to be the most common consequence of mammography, with the most significant effects on women requiring further investigation because of abnormal results (95). A second systematic review included 11 studies that assessed anxiety and 6 studies that assessed worry and found that false-positive mammography results may have persistent, small effects on some women's psychological well-being and behavior. No long-term symptoms of depression were noted in women with false-positive mammography PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

In the U.S., women with false-positive results as opposed to normal mammographic findings were more likely to return for routine screening (96). Immediate reading of screening mammograms was associated with less anxiety among women with false-positive mammography results 3 weeks after mammography compared to an educational intervention targeting coping skills (88). Comments: None. 3.13 Recognize that many women report pain from mammography, yet few report that the pain would impact their future screening behavior.. Evidence: In a study of 954 women undergoing mammographic screening in the Netherlands, 72.9% reported mammography as painful; however, only 2.7% indicated that the pain would deter them from undergoing future mammographic screening (97). In a survey of 597 women, 35% of women reported discomfort and 6% reported pain during mammography. No effect on satisfaction or intention to re-attend screening was noted (98). In a random sample of 883 Finnish women undergoing mammographic screening, 61% reported pain or discomfort. Among those reporting pain or discomfort, there was no evidence of intent to avoid further screening; however, the study did note that the 5 women (1%) who were undecided on further screenings had experienced severe or moderate pain during mammography (99). Comments: None. 3.14 Understand that overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant disease, mainly DC/S, is possible with screening mammography . Evidence: Population-based data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry showed that the rate of DCIS increased from 3 per 100,000 person-years to 34 per 100,000 person-years over the last 20 years due to the increased use of screening mammography (100). Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected by screening mammography are DCIS. There is no way to predict which cases will progress to invasive cancer; however, it is estimated that only 10% to 32% of DCIS lesions will progress to invasive cancer (1Q1). Comments: None. 4.

Evidence: Mammography identifies cancer at earlier stages (102; 103). SEER data from 1983 to 1992 show a decrease in the diagnosis of late-stage tumors. Treatment at an early stage directly affects survival rates (j~). A study conducted by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium between 1996 and 2000 evaluated the pathologic outcomes of 786,846 women aged 40 to 89 years after screening mammography. The majority of invasive tumors were small: 35% were between 0 mm and 10 mm in size. and 36% were between 11 mm and 20 mm in size. Furthermore, 78% were pathologically lymph node-negative tumors in comparison to the 66% prevalence observed in the SEER data of the same time period (105). Data on 24,740 breast cancer cases recorded in the SEER registry showed that tumor size and axillary lymph node status were two of the most important prognostic indicators (.1.QQ). Comments: As tumor size increases, survival decreases, regardless of lymph node status. As lymph node involvement increases, survival also decreases, regardless of tumor size. Other factors, such as patient age, race, hormone receptor status, medical comorbidities, patient preferences, and access to care, also affect survival rates. The overall reduction of breast cancer mortality with time supports the beneficial effect of early detection from screening (107). 4.2 Realize that breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy is equivalent to mastectomy in patients with early-stage disease, and, therefore, both treatment options should be explored . Evidence: A randomized, controlled trial in 701 patients with breast cancer measuring <2 cm in diameter and no palpable axillary lymph nodes compared Halsted radical mastectomy to \"quadrantectomy\" with axillary dissection and radiotherapy and found no difference in disease-free or overall survival (.1..Q.e.). Several large cohort studies found no significant differences in overall survival, disease-free survival, or survival free of disease at distant sites between patients who underwent total mastectomy and those treated by lumpectomy alone or by lumpectomy plus breast irradiation with a mean PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Radiation therapy following lumpectomy resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of local recurrence of breast cancer (109). Comments: Choice of therapy in a particular patient is based on many factors, including tumor size, axillary node status, tumor hormone status, family history and/or genetic profile (e.g., BRCAI, BRCA2, TP53) , patient age, patient comorbidities, patient preference, and access to care. 4.3 Recognize that overtreatment of clinically insignificant breast cancer is possible and may lead to an increase in morbidity. I) Evidence: A systematic review of six randomized, controlled trials found that screening mammography leads to an estimated 30% increase in overtreatment. For every 2000 women undergoing screening over 10 years, only 1 woman will have her life prolonged, and 10 healthy women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and treated unnecessarily (11Q). Using incidence data from two mammographic screening trials (the Swedish Two-county Trial and the Gothenburg Trial), modeling methods found that fewer than 5% of cases diagnosed at first screen and less than 1 % of cases diagnosed at subsequent screens are being overdiagnosed. Overall, approximately 1% of all cases diagnosed in screened populations were estimated to represent overdiagnosis (111). Data from the Netherlands show an increase in screening-detected cases of DCIS in women aged 50 to 74 years since the introduction of screening and a decline in incidence at around age 80. Modeling estimated that 3% of the total incidence would otherwise not have been diagnosed clinically (112). Comments: Because the reported incidence of death from breast cancer in patients diagnosed with DCIS is less than 2%, no prospective data currently exist to determine whether there are observed small differences. The question of whether DCIS is diagnosed too frequently or treated too aggressively in the U.S. depends on whether these practices result in better outcomes. The outcome of greatest interest, of course, is breast cancer mortality, but because the reported incidence of death from breast cancer in patients diagnosed with DCIS is less than 2%, it will be difficult to detect differences between large populations in which there are multiple variables in addition to the method of diagnosis and treatment that might account for any observed small differences. 4.4 Know that the most common complications of axillary lymph node dissection for early-stage breast cancer are lymphedema, nerve injury, and shoulder dysfunction and that the use of sentinel node biopsy has been associated with a lower risk of these postsurgical complications .

Evidence: A randomized, controlled trial compared sentinel node biopsy with axillary lymph node dissection in the management of patients with early-stage breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to either standard treatment with axillary lymph node dissection (n=405) or sentinel node biopsy (n=424). At 18 months, the patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection had experienced more arm swelling (14% vs. 7%) or numbness (19.0% vs. 8.7%) compared to those who underwent sentinel node biopsy. Axillary lymph node dissection was also associated with a decrease in quality of life compared to sentinel node biopsy (113). Another randomized, controlled trial in 298 patients with early-stage breast cancer compared axillary lymph node dissection with sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection if necessary. A significant reduction in postoperative arm swelling, rate of seroma formation, numbness, and loss of sensitivity to light touch and pinprick was observed in the sentinel node biopsy group (114). A prospective, multicenter study in Switzerland compared sentinel node biopsy alone with sentinel node biopsy and completion axillary lymph node dissection. A total of 659 patients with early-stage breast cancer were included in the study, 449 of whom underwent sentinel node biopsy alone, and 210 of whom underwent sentinel node biopsy and completion axillary lymph node dissection. Sentinel node biopsy was associated with a lower incidence of lymphedema (3.5% vs. 19.1%), impaired shoulder range of motion (3.5% 11.3%), shoulder/arm pain (8.1% vs. 21.1%), and numbness (10.9% vs. 37.7%) compared to sentinel node biopsy and completion axillary lymph node dissection. Median follow-up was 31 months for patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy alone and 29.5 months for those undergoing sentinel node biopsy and completion axillary lymph node dissection (115). Comments: None. 4.5 Know that the complications of radiation therapy are generally mild and are decreasing with modern techniques . Evidence: Common short-term side effects of radiation therapy include fatigue and skin erythema (116). Late complications of radiation therapy are rare with modern delivery dosing and techniques but include pulmonary fibrosis, brachial plexopathy, lymphedema, ischemic heart disease, and an increased risk of second malignancies (117).

Outcomes 5.1 Understand that screening mammography remains the most studied of all available breast cancer screening modalities and the only modality that is associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality, which is estimated to be greatest among women aged 50 to 69 years. Evidence: Eight randomized. controlled trials of screening mammography involving over 475,000 women have provided breast cancer mortality data with up to 20 years of follow-up. Results indicate relative risks for breast cancer mortality ranging from 0.76 to 1.02 among controversial systematic review in 2000 and 2001 excluded three trials based on \"poor\" or \"flawed\" designs and found no reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with screening mammography for women in any age category (RR, 0.97 [CI, 0.82 to 1.14]). In 2006, an updated systematic review with additional data found a relative risk of 0.80 (CI, 0.73 to 0.88) for six trials combined (1.1Q; 128). A Swedish study expanded an earlier analysis and compared breast cancer mortality in the prescreening and postscreening periods among women aged 40 to 69 years in six counties and women aged 50 to 69 years in a seventh county. After adjustment for selection bias, there was a mortality reduction from 44% to 39% among women who underwent screening (129). A systematic review of eight screening trials conducted by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2002 found that the use of routine mammography was associated with an overall relative risk of 0.84 for mortality from breast cancer (~). Reductions in breast cancer mortality associated with screening mammography were observed for women aged 39 to 74 years, with greater reductions seen in women aged 50 to 70 years compared to women aged 40 to 49 years (RR, 22% vs. 15%). The decrease in mortality after 14 years of follow-up for women who began screening in their 40s (RR, 0.85 [CI, 0.73 to 0.99]) was lower than that seen for women aged 50 years and older (RR, 0.78 [CI, 0.70 to 0.87]) (~). Whether the smaller mortality benefit in women in their 40s is due to screening that occurs before or after the age of 50 is less clear (the \"age creep\" phenomenon). The UK Age trial, which involved 161,000 women, was one of the first trials to address this issue, The trial compared breast cancer mortality rates among women aged 39 to 41 years who were randomly assigned to either annual mammographic screening or usual care. At 10.7 years of follow-up, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a mortality benefit of mammographic screening (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.66 to 1.04]) (130). The difference in mortality benefit for younger women in their 40s can also be examined by looking at the number needed to screen to prevent PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Based on relative risk estimates from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review of eight randomized, controlled screening trials, the number needed to screen for women in their 40s (approximately 1800 women undergoing mammography for 14 years) is over twice the estimated number needed to screen (850 women) for women in their 50s. In addition, over half of the women would have at least one false-positive mammography result, requiring additional imaging or biopsy, during this time (~). Breast cancer screening also was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in an analysis of four randomized, controlled trials conducted in Sweden. These trials followed a combined total of 247,010 women for approximately 16 years, during which time the relative risk for overall mortality was 0.98 (CI, 0.96 to 1.00) (118). Comments: There are no controlled trials evaluating the impact of the newer screening imaging modalities (MRI, ultrasound, and digital mammography), mainly because the ability to study their effects in the absence of screening mammography is not possible. Mammography may be less effective for women in their 40s than for older women because the incidence of breast cancer and the overall accuracy of mammography are lower in younger women. If benefit is considered in terms of cumulative years of life saved rather than simply lives saved, this would reflect the benefit of averting premature deaths in younger women who are raising children and/or are active in the workforce. Nonetheless, these smaller benefits need to be weighed against an increase in the risks of mammography in this same age group, such as higher rates of false-positive test results and overdiagnosis of DCIS. 5.2 Know that there are insufficient data from randomized, controlled trials of screening mammography to confirm a mortality benefit among women over age 70. Evidence: Only two randomized, controlled trials (the Malmo Mammographic Screening Trial and the Swedish Two-county Trial) included women between the ages of 65 and 74 years. When their data are pooled, the summary relative risk in women aged 65 to 74 years is 0.78 (CI, 0.62 to 0.99) (118). Comments: The results of these studies may not be generalizable to the general population based on the extensive comorbidity in these age groups. Women with breast cancer and more than three comorbid medical conditions are 20 times more likely to die of a cause other than breast cancer within 3 years. The effects of comorbidity were independent of age, disease stage, tumor size, histologic type, type of treatment, and race (131).

Evidence: The Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 included over 39,000 women aged 50 to 59 years who were randomly assigned to annual screening with mammography and CBE or CBE alone. At 13-year follow-up, there was no impact on breast cancer mortality with the addition of annual mammographic screening to CBE, with 107 deaths in the combined screening group and 105 deaths in the CBE-only group. A total of 622 invasive and 71 in situ cancers were found in the combined screening group, and 610 invasive and 16 in situ cancers were identified in the CBE-only group. Mammography was able to detect a cancer 2.1 years earlier than CBE alone but with no impact on survival. CBE performance in the study was standardized and was longer in duration than most clinical examinations done in practice. There were approximately three times as many biopsies and more diagnostic tests done in the combined screening group (43). The Canadian National Breast Screening Study-1 randomly assigned 50,430 women aged 40 to 49 years to screening with mammography and CBE or no screening. CBE detected 59% of the cancers, 32% of which were detected by CBE alone and 27% of which were detected by combined screening. Although there was a more favorable size distribution for cancer detected by mammography alone compared to that detected by CBE, there was no difference in breast cancer mortality after 11 to 16 years of follow-up (42). In the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, data on over 750,000 CBEs done in low-income women in the U.S. showed that CBE detected 5.1% of cancers that were not found on mammography (45). Comments: The independent contribution of CBE and mammography to the reduction in mortality from breast cancer due to screening is unknown, but it is likely that CBE contributes modestly. Several organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, continue to recommend combined CBE and mammography for breast cancer screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends mammography every 1 to 2 years beginning at age 40, with or without CBE. CBE may also have a role in women who choose not to partake in mammographic screening programs. 5.4 Realize that SSE alone as a screening modality does not reduce mortality from breast cancer.S PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Therefore, PIER users should compare the date of the last update on the website with any printout to ensure that the information being referred to is the most current available. Evidence: In a randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the feasibility of SSE in China, there was no reduction in mortality from breast cancer. A total of 266,064 women were randomly assigned to a SSE instruction group or a control group. SSE performance was monitored closely for the 5-year duration of the trial. The total duration of follow-up was 10 years. Compared to women in the control group, women in the SSE instruction group did not have cancers detected at an earlier stage. More breast biopsies were done in the SSE instruction group compared to the control group (132). A Russian study randomly assigned 120,310 women aged 40 to 64 years to a SSE program or a control group and found no differences in the stage of breast cancer detection or mortality after 10 years of follow-up. It was noted, however, that more women in the SSE group sought advice on suspected breast lesions than those in the control group (133). A meta-analysis of the effect of regular SSE on breast cancer mortality or rates of advanced breast cancer included 20 observational studies and three clinical trials. There was no difference in the death rate in studies in which cancer was detected by SSE (pooled RR, 0.9 [CI, 0.72 to 1.12]), and none of the trials of SSE training showed a lower mortality rate in the SSE group (pooled RR, 1.01 [CI, 0.92 to 1.12]) (1M). Comments: The two existinq randomized, controlled trials evaluating SSE were conducted in settings without other breast cancer screening modalities, such as mammography. Thus, these trials indicated that SSE confers no breast cancer mortality benefit compared to no screening at all. However, no randomized trial has evaluated whether SSE adds additional mortality benefit when used in conjunction with other screening modalities, such as mammography and CSE. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against performing or teaching SSE. The American Cancer Society recommends that providers discuss SSE with their patients and provide appropriate instruction in SSE if the patient chooses this option. SSE should be performed using the MammaCare\u00ae method. Women should be counseled to be aware of changes in their breasts and seek medical advice if they are concerned. 6. Timeline 6.1 Understand that data consistently support the use of routine mammography in women aged 50 to 70 years, but that, due to a lack of data, controversy remains regarding the optimal frequency for all women as well as the appropriate starting and stopping time for women in their 40s and those over age 70, respectively .

Therefore, PIER users should compare the date of the last update on the website with any printout to ensure that the information being referred to is the most current available. Data from a U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review of six clinical trials show that for women over 50, screening mammography can lead to a 22% reduction in breast cancer mortality (\u00a7). Looking at trial data from women aged 40 to 49 years, a meta-analysis showed a significantly beneficial trend over time (135). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review also found a 15% decrease in breast cancer mortality in this age group (\u00a7). Only two of the major randomized, controlled trials of mammography included women over age 65; these data suggest that screening is beneficial for women up to age 74 (118). Optimal frequency of mammographic screening in all age groups is uncertain. Clinical trials evaluating screening mammography used intervals of approximately 18 months, ranging from 12 to 33 months (\u00a7; QQ). There are well-documented age differences in growth rates of primary breast cancer, such that women under age 50 have the shortest tumor volume doubling time (80 days) compared with women aged 50 to 70 years (157 days) and those over age 70 (188 days). To observe a beneficial effect of screening in women under age 50, more frequent screening than in the older age group is necessary (~). A framework has been developed positing that patients with life expectancies of less than 5 years are unlikely to derive any survival benefit from cancer screening (ill). Comments: The interval between the time when a tumor develops and when it becomes clinically significant is thought to increase with age (the sojourn time). This may mean that early detection is most beneficial in younger women, and less beneficial in older age groups. 6.2 Understand that screening intervals for certain high-risk patients, such as those with a positive family history, a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or LeiS, or a history of thoracic radiation, are often tailored and based on expert opinion . See table Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines by Screening Modality. Evidence: The optimal age to begin screening women with a family history of breast cancer is unknown (138). Current recommendations for women with an inherited predisposition to breast cancer include annual mammography and breast MRI starting at age 30 (23; 78). It is currently recommended that women with a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or LCIS begin annual mammographic screening at the time of diagnosis, regardless of age, if not already initiated. Such patients should also consider risk reduction strategies, such as chemoprevention (~). It is currently recommended that women with a history of thoracic radiation exposure begin annual mammography 8 to 10 years after PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Comments: Currently there is no evidence for the use of early or alternative breast cancer screening regimens in women with other traditional risk factors for breast cancer, such as early menarche, late menopause, or dense breasts on mammography. Women with an inherited predisposition to breast cancer should consider medical and surgical risk reduction strategies for management of breast and other associated cancer risks. Women with a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or LCIS also should consider risk reduction strategies, such as chemoprevention (~). See module Chemoprevention of Breast Cancer. 6.3 Be aware that annual MRI is recommended for women over age 30 with a genetic mutation or beginning 5 to 10 years younger than the youngest family member with breast cancer when the lifetime risk is greater than 25%. (I Evidence: It is currently recommended that women with genetic mutations begin screening with annual mammography and MRI at age 25 ( 2.3.; l\u00a7). It is currently recommended that women with a family history of premenopausal cancer but no identified genetic mutations begin screening 5 to 10 years younger than the youngest family member with breast cancer (l\u00a7). If the lifetime risk of breast cancer is 20% to 25%, annual MRI is recommended in addition to annual mammography (23; 78). Comments: The optimal age to initiate breast cancer screening in high-risk women is unknown. Additional information on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for breast cancer is available from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/genetics_screening.pdf). 7. Cost-Effectiveness 7.1 Appreciate that screening mammography has an acceptable cost per life-year saved compared with other screening strategies. Evidence: Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening mammography, with the cost per life-year saved ranging from $18,800 to $20,200 (139; 140). A Markov model-based study evaluating the cost-effectiveness of four mammographic screening schedules that varied in terms of patient age and frequency found that all were within a generally accepted range of PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

The most cost-effective schedule involved annual mammographic screening from age 40 to 49 years followed by biennial mammographic screening from age 50 to 79 years, which resulted in a marginal cost per life-year saved of $16,100 (141). Age-targeted use of digital mammography appears to be cost effective; however, breast density-targeted digital mammography is not (142). Comments: None. 7.2 Recognize that the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening is affected by the frequency of mammography, the age of the screened population, and whether mammography is coupled with CBE.8 Evidence: A study evaluating the cost-effectiveness of screening mammography using a Markov model noted that the marginal cost per life-year saved is lowest in women aged 50 to 69 years and higher in women aged 40 to 49 years due to the lower incidence of breast cancer in the younger age group. Cost-effectiveness is further decreased in women aged 80 to 84 years despite the increased breast cancer rate in the elderly because of the concurrent shorter life expectancy (143). A systematic literature review concluded that extending biennial mammographic screening for women after age 65 up through age 75 or 80 would be at a cost of $34,000 to $88,000 per life-year gained. The most cost-effective approach to screening older women was one that targeted healthy women rather than those with competing life-shortening illnesses (144). A retrospective analysis of costs incurred in current U.S. breast cancer screening programs recommending annual to biennial mammography for women aged 40 years and older determined that over 10 years, 947.5 million quality-adjusted life-years resulted at a cost of $166 billion over the screened women's lifetimes (145). Among the screening scenarios examined, annual mammography from age 40 to 80 was the most expensive, costing $58,000 per additional quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with alternative strategies with longer intervals between screenings. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to factors affecting quality of life, such as false-positive test results and mammography-related pain. Annual mammography and CBE for women aged 50 to 79 years reduces total costs by 35% as compared to biennial mammography and annual CBE (HQ).

Patient Education 8.1 Know that not all women are well informed about breast cancer screening . Evidence: Many women have inaccurate knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding breast cancer screening. A survey of rural women concluded that, overall, a significant proportion of women had low levels of breast cancer screening knowledge and inaccurate beliefs regarding screening. In particular, minority women tended to have the lowest levels of knowledge regarding breast cancer screening (147). Several interventions have been shown to improve women's knowledge of breast cancer screening, including mailed educational pamphlets (lli). Comments: Population surveys and persistent disparities in breast cancer screening rates indicate that significant groups of women remain poorly informed about the benefits of screening. 8.2 Know that a personal recommendation from a health care provider is the best method to increase mammography adherence; direct patient education interventions have shown a minimal or no increase in mammography adherence . Evidence: Published studies indicate that a physician recommendation remains critical in encouraging mammography compliance for all women, regardless of age and ethnic group (149; 1..Q.Q). Several randomized, controlled trials of brief, office-based patient education have shown minimal or no benefit (all DRs <1.8) (151; 152; 153; 154; 155). One study showed a moderate benefit of multiple educational interventions tailored to individual patients (OR, 1.93 to 3.55) (156). An effect size synthesis of nine randomized, controlled trials specifically educating patients on their personalized cancer risk showed a weak benefit (OR, 1.31 [Cl, 0.98 to 1.77]) on subsequent screening adherence (157). Interventions to increase physician recommendations, including audit and physician reminders, were found to have a stronger effect on mammography adherence than patient education interventions C1.Q.6l Comments: None. 9.

Evidence: Patients at high risk for breast cancer include those with a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative, especially if the cancer was premenopausal, male breast cancer, or bilateral breast cancer (.6.); those with a family history of two or more second-degree relatives (\u00a7.); and those with a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or LeiS (\u00a31; 22).

Guidelines American Cancer Society, 2008 American Cancer Society guidelines for the early detection of cancer These guidelines recommend discussing monthly BSE beginning at age 20 (patient's choice), performing CBE every 3 years from age 20 to 39 years and yearly after age 40, and obtaining mammography yearly beginning at age 40. Women at high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should undergo mammography and MRI yearly starting at age 30. Women at moderately increased risk (15% to 20%) should discuss the option of MRI with a yearly mammogram American Cancer Society, 2007 American Cancer Society guidelines for breast screening with MRI as an adjunct to mammography These gUidelines recommend discussing the option of MRI in addition to yearly mammography with women at moderately increased risk (15% to 20%). American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2003 Breast cancer screening This guideline recommends CBE yearly as part of the physical exam for all women and mammography every 1 to 2 years for women aged 40 to 49 years and yearly after age 50. BSE is recommended despite a lack of definitive data. No information is provided for MRI. American College of Physicians, 2007 Screening mammography for women 40 to 49 years of age: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians This guideline recommends that the decision to obtain mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years be made on an individualized basis using risk assessment and shared decision-making. For women aged 40 to 49 years who do not wish to partake in shared decision-making, mammography should be done every 1 to 2 years. No information is provided for MRI. Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, 2001 Preventive health care 2001 update: screening mammography among women aged 40-49 years at average risk of breast cancer Based on this review, mammography every 1 to 2 years is recommended for women over age 50, and CBE with mammography every 1 to 2 years is recommended for women aged PIER is copyrighted (c) 2009 by the American College of Physicians. 190 N.

Weekly April 3, 2009 / Vol. 58 / No. 12 department of health and human services Centers for disease Control and PreventionMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report www.cdc.gov/mmwr Sociodemographic Differences in Binge Drinking Among Adults \u2014 14 States, 2004 Binge drinking, defined in this study as consuming five or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion ,* was responsible for 43,731 (54.9%) of the estimated 79,646 alcohol-attributable deaths each year in the United States during 2001- 2005 . Healthy People 2010 calls for reducing the prevalence of binge drinking among adults from the 16.6% baseline in 1998 to 6.0% ( 1). An overarching goal of Healthy People is to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population .\u00a7 To assess binge drinking by sex, age group, race/ ethnicity, education level, and income level, CDC analyzed data from an optional module of the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, the most recent data available on binge drinking prevalence, frequency, and intensity (i.e., the number of drinks consumed per binge episode). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the prevalence of binge drinking was more common among men (24.3%), persons aged 18-24 years (27.4%) and 2534 years (24.4%), whites (17.5%), and persons with household incomes >$50,000 (17.4%). However, after adjusting for sex and age, the highest average number of binge drinking episodes during the preceding 30 days was reported by binge drinkers whose household income was <$25,000. (4.9), and the highest average number of drinks per binge episode was reported by non-Hispanic blacks (8.4) and Hispanics (8.1). These findings underscore the need to implement effective population-based prevention strategies (e.g., increasing alcohol excise taxes) and develop effective interventions targeted at groups at higher risk.BRFSS conducts annual state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone surveys of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged >18 years, collecting data on health condi - tions and health risk behaviors, including binge drinking. In 2004, an optional survey module with additional questions on binge drinking was administered in 14 states .\u00b6 Binge drinking was defined as having consumed five or more alcoholic drinks on one or more occasions during the preceding 30 days. For this report, responses to questions regarding the prevalence, frequency, and intensity of binge drinking were analyzed, beginning with the question, \"Considering all types of alco - holic beverages, how many times during the past 30 days did you have five or more drinks on an occasion?\" Those who acknowledged at least one occasion were then asked, \"During the most recent occasion when you had five or more alcoholic beverages, about how many beers, including malt liquor, did you drink? ...about how many glasses of wine, including wine coolers, hard lemonade, or hard cider, did you drink? ...about how many drinks of liquor, including cocktails, did you have?\" After excluding persons with missing or incomplete informa - tion, data from 62,684 respondents in the 14 states were used INSIDE 305 Tobacco Use Among Students Aged 13-15 Years \u2014 Baghdad, Iraq, 200 8 308 Progress Toward Interruption of Wild Poliovirus Trans\u00ad mission \u2014 Worldwide, 200 8 312 Use of Northern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccines by Travelers to the Southern Hemispher e 313 QuickStat s* In 2006, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System definition of binge drinking for women changed from five alcoholic drinks to four drinks on one occasion.

Response rates for each state were calculated using Council of American Survey and Research Organizations (CASRO) guidelines. Response rates ranged from 39.0% (California) to 63.2% (Minnesota) (median: 54.1%, and cooperation rates ranged from 59.9% (California) to 86.9% (Minnesota)(median: 74.9%) .** The prevalence of binge drinking was calculated by dividing the total number of respondents who reported at least one binge drinking episode during the preceding 30 days by the total number of BRFSS respondents in the 14 states. Analysis by state was not performed because of multiple subgroups with fewer than 50 respondents. The frequency of binge drinking was calculated by averaging the number of episodes reported by all binge drinkers during the preceding 30 days. The intensity of binge drinking (i.e., number of drinks per binge episode) was calculated by averaging the number of drinks consumed by binge drinkers during their most recent episode. All data were weighted to produce population-based estimates according to age-, race-, and sex-specific state population counts and to the respondent's probability of selection. Data were adjusted to the standard age and sex distribution of 2004 BRFSS respondents to provide estimates for race/ethnicity, education level, and annual household income level. Statistical significance was determined by pairwise linear contrasts of the estimates ( 2). In 2004, the overall unadjusted prevalence of binge drink - ing among adults in the 14 states was 15.9% ( Table 1 ). Binge drinking prevalence among men (24.3%) was three times higher than among women (7.9%). Men who reported binge drinking also reported a significantly higher average number of binge drinking episodes during the preceding 30 days (4.6) than women (2.9) and a significantly higher number of drinks consumed during their most recent binge episode (8.3 versus 6.9). Binge drinking prevalence decreased with advancing age, from 27.4% among respondents aged 18-24 years to 3.7% among respondents aged >65 years. In contrast, among binge drinkers, respondents aged >65 years reported the highest aver - age number of binge drinking episodes during the preceding 30 days (6.8). The number of drinks consumed during the most recent binge decreased with advancing age, from 9.8 among adults aged 18-24 years to 6.4 among those aged >65 years. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of binge drinking among non-Hispanic whites (17.5%) was significantly higher than the prevalence for Hispanics (14.4%) and non-Hispanic blacks (10.9%) ( Table 2 ). Overall, among binge drinkers, the frequency of binge drinking episodes and the number of drinks ** The response rate is the percentage of persons who completed interviews among all eligible persons, including those who were not successfully contacted. The cooperation rate is the percentage of persons who completed interviews among all eligible persons who were contacted.Vol. 58 / No. 12 MMWR 303 consumed during the most recent binge episode were similar among racial/ethnic populations; however, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics reported a higher intensity of binge drinking (8.4 and 8.1 drinks per binge episode, respectively) than whites (6.9). College graduates had significantly lower age- and sex- adjusted prevalence of binge drinking (14.5%) than high school graduates or those with some college or technical school (both 17.1%) (Table 2). Respondents who did not graduate from high school reported the lowest binge drinking prevalence (14.2%) but, along with high school graduates, the highest fre - quency of binge drinking episodes (4.6) and the highest num - ber of drinks consumed in the most recent episode (7.8). In contrast, binge drinking prevalence increased with income level and was highest among respondents with annual household incomes >$50,000 (17.4%) (Table 2). However, the number of drinks consumed per episode was significantly lower among respondents whose household income was >$35,000 compared with those whose household income was <$25,000.

Editorial Note: Binge drinking is a risk factor for numerous adverse health and social outcomes, including alcohol poi - soning, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, sexually transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, suicide, interper - sonal violence, and motor vehicle crashes ( 3). This report indicates that binge drinking is common among U.S. adults, especially among whites, males, persons aged 18-34 years, and those with household incomes >$50,000. These sociode - mographic characteristics stand in contrast to characteristics for many other health risk factors (e.g., smoking and obesity), where prevalence tends to be higher among minorities and persons with lower education and income ( 4). The findings in this report highlight the need for assessing the frequency and intensity of binge drinking among binge drinkers in addition to the prevalence of binge drinking in the general population. These additional measures are important because the risk for adverse outcomes (e.g., alcoholic liver dis - ease or traffic fatalities) increases with the frequency of binge drinking and with the amount consumed per binge episode. Furthermore, reductions in the frequency and intensity of binge drinking generally might be expected to occur before reductions in the prevalence of binge drinking. One plausible reason why binge drinking is more prevalent among whites and persons at higher income levels is that, unlike smoking, binge drinking has not been widely recog - nized as a health risk, subjected to intense prevention efforts, and socially stigmatized ( 5). The differences in binge drinking among population segments also likely reflects cultural factors and differences in state and local laws ( 6) that affect the price, availability, and marketing of alcoholic beverages. Finally, the increase in prevalence of binge drinking with increasing income levels likely reflects the fact that persons with higher household incomes have more disposable income available to spend on alcohol. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the 14 states that administered the optional binge drinking module are not necessarily representative of all 50 states; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to the entire U.S. population. Second, BRFSS data are self-reported; alcohol consumption generally, and excessive drinking in particular, are underreported in surveys because of recall TABLE 1.

Finally, in 2005, BRFSS changed the definition of binge drinking for women from five or more drinks per occasion to four or more drinks per occasion; the prevalence of binge drinking among women would have been higher using the new definition ( 8). These findings support the need to implement effective population-based strategies (e.g., increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting the number of retail outlets where alcohol is sold in a particular geographic area, and maintaining and enforcing age 21 years as the minimum age for legal drinking) ( 9,10) to prevent binge drinking. In addition, the frequency and intensity of binge drinking should be routinely monitored to guide the development and evaluation of culturally appropri - ate binge drinking prevention and intervention strategies for groups at greater risk.

FIELD ACTION REPORT American Journal of Public Health | May 2009, Vol 99, No.5 788 | Field Action Report | Peer Reviewed | Doe-Simkins et al.RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSE have increased since the early 1990s because of lower-cost, higher-purity heroin and pre-scription opioid abuse. 1-5 from 1990 to 2006, annual opioid overdose-related fatalities increased over 6-fold, from 94 to 637. 6,7 In response, the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) passed a regulation that authorized the development of an overdose pre-vention program with naloxone distribution through its mobile needle-exchange program. This program is innovative, because it includes the distribution of intranasal naloxone by trained, nonmedical public health workers to potential overdose bystanders for administration to overdose victims. Legal and regulatory barriers to implemen-tation are detailed in the box on page 791. Naloxone, an opioid antago- nist, reverses opioid heroin or from Administering naloxone hydrochloride (naloxone) during an opioid overdose reverses the overdose and can prevent death. Although typically delivered via intramuscular or intravenous injection, naloxone may be delivered via intranasal spray device. In August 2006, the Boston Public Health Commission passed a public health regulation that authorized an opioid overdose prevention program that included intranasal naloxone education and distribution of the spray to potential bystanders. Participants were taught by trained nonmedical needle exchange staff. After 15 months, the program provided training and intranasal naloxone to 385 participants who reported 74 successful overdose reversals. Prob-lems with intranasal naloxone were uncommon. Overdose prevention education with distribution of intranasal naloxone is a feasible public health intervention to address opioid overdose. Am J Public Health. 2009;99:788-791. Y. Walley, MD, MSc, Andy Epstein, RN, MPH, and Peter Moyer, MD, MPH FIELD ACTION REPORT The BPHC started an overdose prevention program with intra-nasal naloxone distribution as a result of the successful experience of the city's emergency medical services use of the nasal spray as a prehospital treatment for opioid overdose; the concept was also seen as an attractive option because intranasal delivery of the drug eliminates the risks of needle-stick injuries and needle disposal. BPHC implemented the program through the needle-exchange program because program partici-pants were considered particularly likely to witness overdoses. PROGRAM CURRICULUM All participating needle-exchange program staff\u20142 nurses and 4 nonmedical public health workers\u2014completed 8 hours of didactic training, a knowledge test, and at least 4 supervised bystander-training sessions. Both the staff training and bystander training were adapted from exist-ing program curricula from other cities that primarily used needle-based naloxone. 8,14,17-21 The 15-minute bystander training included techniques in overdose prevention. Staff com-pleted a checklist (available as a supplement to the online article at http://www.ajph.org) to ensure participant comprehension. Over-dose prevention kits included instructions; 2 luer-lock, prefilled opioid receptors. It is the stan- dard treatment used by medical personnel. It has no abuse po-tential, and its only contraindica-tion is a prior allergic reaction, which is rare. 8 Although typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly, it can be admin-istered intranasally. 9-13 Strong interest in overdose prevention training and access to naloxone exists among potential overdose bystanders, including family members 14 and drug-using part- ners.15 Overdose prevention pro- grams with naloxone distribution that train and distribute naloxone to people who are likely to wit-ness an overdose have been successfully implemented in several communities, includ-ing Chicago, 16,17 New York,18,19 San Francisco,20 Baltimore,15,21 and New Mexico.8 A 6-program study demonstrated that trained bystanders were similarly skilled as medical experts in recog-nizing opioid overdose situa- FINDINGS Needle-exchange partici- pants have experienced and witnessed high rates of over-doses. Needle-exchange participants can successfully recognize an overdose and use intranasal naloxone to reverse potentially fatal opioid overdoses. With the support and regula- tion of the local public health authority, overdose prevention programs can provide training and distribute intranasal nalox-one without a direct clinical health care provider-patient encounter. Overdose prevention programs that include the distribution of intranasal naloxone by non-medical personnel are feasible for city public health depart-ments. May 2009, Vol 99, No. 5 | American Journal of Public Health Doe-Simkins et al. | Peer Reviewed | Field Action Report | 789 FIELD ACTION REPORT FIELD ACTION REPORT syringes with 2 mg/2 mL nalox- one hydrochloride; and the mu-cosal atomization device. Partici-pants were instructed to deliver 1 mL (1 mg) to each nostril of the overdose victim. Because most opioid agonists have a longer half-life than naloxone, if overdose symptoms returned, victims could be treated with the second dose. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS From September 2006 to De- cember 2007, during each by-stander training, staff completed an enrollment form, recording respondents' demographics and overdose risk factors. When par-ticipants returned to the needle-exchange program, staff com-pleted a form detailing overdoses witnessed, use of naloxone, and whether additional doses were needed. Data were maintained in a Microsoft Access 2003 data-base (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). We compared enrollment data from participants who re-ported overdose reversals with those who did not with the t test of means and the 2 or Fisher exact test. We used SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all tests of comparison. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION Over 15 months, the program provided education and intra-nasal naloxone to 385 poten-tial bystanders. At enrollment (Table 1), heroin was the most frequently used drug, followed by cocaine, methadone, benzo-diazepines, and alcohol. Opioids were used on a mean of 24.1 of the last 30 days. Cocaine was the drug used most commonly in combination with heroin.

Follow-up contact was made at least once with 278 (72%) participants, 222 of whom re-ported no overdoses witnessed and no need for additional doses of naloxone. Among the 57 participants who requested addi-tional doses, 7 had the naloxone lost, stolen, or confiscated, and 50 administered naloxone while observing an overdose (Figure 1). Among the 50 participants (13%) who reported revers-ing an overdose, 74 successful reversals were reported. Except for mean age (43 vs 39 years; P < .05), there were no signifi- cant differences between those participants who reported revers-ing an overdose and those who did not (data not shown). Emer-gency medical personnel were involved in 21 of the 74 (28%) reported overdoses and were not involved in 39 (53%) reported overdoses. Involvement by emer-gency medical personnel was not reported in the remainder (data available as a supplement to the online article at http://www.ajph.org). Two previous studies of naloxone distribution programs have reported similar rates of emergency medical personnel in-volvement (10% to 31%). 20,23 Among follow-up contacts, problems were uncommon. During 4 overdoses, bystanders could not connect the mucosal atomization device to the sy-ringe, although each resulted in successful reversal. Two admin-istered naloxone nasally directly from the syringe, 1 injected the naloxone intramuscularly, and 1 did not administer naloxone, but delivered rescue breathing and physical stimulation until Boston Emergency Medical Ser-vices arrived. Two bystanders reported that naloxone induced withdrawal symptoms, but, in both cases, the victim did not use additional opioids to allevi-ate symptoms. Two bystanders observed the naloxone wearing off: 1 readministered it after 90 minutes, and 1 reported that the victim became resedated after 20 minutes, when Boston Emergency Medical Services assumed care. Two people had naloxone confiscated at a home-less shelter, 1 reported being expelled from a residential drug treatment program for having the substance, and 3 reported negative interactions with emergency medical personnel, American Journal of Public Health | May 2009, Vol 99, No.5 790 | Field Action Report | Peer Reviewed | Doe-Simkins et al.

Of the 74 reported reversals, 4 reports were of bystanders not initially enrolled in the program who used intranasal naloxone obtained from peers who were enrolled. Thus, there was some peer-to-peer overdose knowledge and skill transfer beyond the program. The BPHC overdose-prevention naloxone distribution program was implemented without substantial additional funding. Space, printing costs, and staff time were provided by the existing needle-exchange program. Naloxone kits cost ap-proximately $25. NEXT STEPS The BPHC naloxone distribution program is a feasible, successful program that includes distribution of intranasal naloxone by non-medical staff. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has identified overdose prevention as a major focus area for new pub-lic health initiatives and has ex- panded the program to 5 addi-tional sites that target needle-exchange participants, staff at substance abuse treatment pro-grams, homeless shelters, and families and friends of opioid users.

Legal and Regulatory Barriers to Implementing an Overdose Prevention Program With Intranasal Naloxone Distribution by Nonmedical Personnel Barrier Response Nonmedical personnel are not authorized to distribute prescription medication and are not authorized to administer a prescription medication to a person who has not been prescribed the medication.\u0081 The standard of care for the use of naloxone has for decades included use by prehospital personnel in nonclinical settings operating under standing orders from physicians who are neither on-site nor directly supervising. \u0081 Other life saving prescription medications, such as epinephrine injectors for anaphylactic shock,24 and other devices, such as automated external defibrillators, are used by bystanders and nonmedical personnel. \u0081 Other states, such as New Mexico, New York and Connecticut, have addressed this by passing laws that limit the liability of medical and nonmedical personnel who administer and distribute potentially lifesaving medication. 25 \u0081 A study of 6 programs that train bystanders to recognize and respond to opioid overdose by using naloxone has demonstrated that trained potential bystanders are similarly skilled as medical experts in recognizing opioid overdose situations and when naloxone is indicated. 22 \u0081 A local public health regulation was passed by BPHC, the City of Boston's board of health, identifying the overdose-prevention naloxone distribution program as an official public health program and assuming liability for the work of medical and non-medical personnel involved in the program. \u0081 Under the medical license of the Medical Director of Boston Emergency Medical Services, potential bystanders received a standard curriculum about overdose prevention with instructions and demonstration of how to properly use the medication. Receipt of this curriculum was documented by BPHC staff. Intranasal delivery of naloxone is an off-label method. \u0081 Prescriptions drugs may be and are routinely given for any indication not explicitly prohibited by law.25,26 \u0081 While no large scale randomized clinical trials have been conducted, intranasal naloxone has been evaluated in several research studies, with little evidence of adverse events. 9-13 A small randomized trial comparing intranasal with intramuscular delivery of naloxone used by emergency personnel demonstrated that intranasal delivery had a longer time to clinical response (8 minutes vs 6 minutes), but less agitation or irritation (2% vs 13%). 11 \u0081 Intranasal naloxone is a first-line treatment for opioid overdose among emergency medical personnel in the local Boston community. 25.

We investigated HIV screening and its predictors in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) system among such individuals in care. Our primary outcome was retrospective evidence of screening for HIV infection, adjusting for patient demographics and important comorbiddisease. Of the 371,749 sample patients with histories of substance use disorders using VA services, 20% had evidence of HIV screening.Screening was lowest among those with alcohol use disorders alone (11%) and highest among those treated in substance use programs (28%) or receiving inpatient care (28%). The findings suggest a low recognition of substance use disorders (especially alcohol use) as risk factors for HIV. Quality improvement initiatives to increase risk factor recognition and screening among patients with substance use disorders will yieldbenefits in the fight against HIV. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Screening for HIV in individuals with drug and alcohol use disorders is a longstanding and broadly endorsed qualityof care recommendation ( Branson et al., 2006; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2001; NationalInstitute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA], 2002 ). Too often, however, HIV screening of substance users is notdone or is done too late ( Branson et al., 2006; Owens et al.,2007; Samet et al., 1999, 2001 ). In data from a large managed care organization, more than half of HIV-infected individuals already had advanced disease when diagnosed (suggested by CD4 cell counts b350), although 26% had HIV risk factors documented more than 1 year beforediagnosis ( Klein et al., 2003 ). Although risky injection drug use practices directly increase the risk of HIV transmission, noninjection druguse also indirectly increases risk substantially by increasingdisinhibition that leads to other directly risky behaviors (Neaigus et al., 2001; Strathdee & Sherman 2003 ). Among heroin and/or cocaine users in a state cross-sectional survey,the HIV seroprevalence was found to be similar in injectionand noninjection drug users (in the 12% -17% range; DesJournal of Substance Abuse Treatment 37 (2009) 286 -291 Corresponding author. Brigham and Women's Hospitalist Service, 75 Francis St, PBB-B-428, Boston, MA 02115, USA. Tel.: +1 -see front matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jsat.2009.03.003Jarlais et al., 2007 ). Alcohol abuse has also been associated with HIV risky behaviors and sexually transmitted diseases(Cook & Clark, 2005; Ehrenstein et al., 2004; Rees et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2000 ). Screening of high-risk groups is essential to improving access to effective treatment and reducing HIV transmission ( DiClemente et al., 2002; Marks et al., 2005; 2003; Paltiel et al., 2005; Yeni etal., 2004 ). However, most studies examining HIV screening rates among substance users have been in relatively small orgeographically limited samples, and few have focused onscreening among patients with alcohol use disorders ( Liddi- coat et al., 2004; Owens et al., 2007; Samet et al., 1999 ). The U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system provides care yearly to approximately 5 million military veterans, including many with substance usedisorders who are the focus of this study ( Justice et al., 2006 ). Our primary objective was to determine the rate of HIV screening (i.e., HIV status assessment, as defined byhaving been tested for or diagnosed with HIV during adefined period) retrospectively among veterans with sub-stance use disorders seen for VA care nationally. We also sought to determine whether HIV screening rates differed either by type of substance use disorder (alcohol as opposedto illicit drugs, i.e., cocaine, opiate and/or amphetamine) orby use of different medical care treatment venues (primarycare [PC], emergency department [ED], outpatient substanceuse clinic/program, and inpatient care). 2. Methods 2.1. Study population Patients were selected from the 4,974,979 in the VA Medical Inpatient and Outpatient Data Sets of the National Patient Care Database who used specified VA health care services within a 12-month identification period from June 1,2004, to May 31, 2005. Health care services use was definedas at least (a) one outpatient care visit (defined by thepresence of at least 1 of 75 clinic codes for visits to PC andmedicine subspecialty clinics, general mental health andsubstance use clinics/programs, and EDs) or (b) one inpatientcare stay (defined by presence of any data in the VA Medical Inpatient Data Set, which included data on residential substance use programs and domiciliary stays). Patients seen during the 12-month identification period were included in the analysis if they had a diagnosis of one ormore substance use disorders in the past and if they used VAhealth care services in the identification period at least onceafter diagnosis to ensure there was clinical opportunity toassess for HIV. Substance use disorder histories were identified retrospectively based on presence of Interna- tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 ) diagnostic codes within a 68-month look-back period(October 1, 1999, through May 31, 2005). Patients wereincluded if they had at least 2 documented inpatient/outpatient ICD-9 diagnostic codes for one or more of the following: (a) alcohol (8 codes) or illicit drug abuse/dependence (31 codes) or (b) a medical condition indicatingsubstance abuse/dependence, for example, \"Alcohol-related Liver Disease \"(20 codes). These criteria led to a final national sample of 371,749 patients (7% of all VA patients seen in the identification period). 2.2. Main independent variables and covariates The main study independent variable identified the category of substance use (alcohol use, illicit drug use, orboth) using ICD-9 codes within the 68-month look-back period. Other independent categorical variables focused on use of different health care services in the 12-monthidentification period, namely, PC/ED use, use of outpatientsubstance use clinics/programs, and receipt of inpatient care.Covariates included categorical variables for patient demo-graphics and type of health insurance (if any, e.g., Medicaid,Medicare, or private) within the 12-month identificationperiod, and for presence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and sexually transmitted disease diagnoses by ICD-9 codes within the 68-month look-back period. 2.3. Primary outcome measure HIV screening was defined as any retrospective evidence of clinical HIV status assessment. As such,using the VA Decision Support System laboratory file for HIV tests, we defined patients as having been screened for HIV if they had any evidence in the VA electronic medicalrecord of ever having been tested for or diagnosed withHIV within the 68-month look-back period. The definitionwas intentionally as inclusive as possible, given dataavailability. Patients were classified as tested if they had atleast one HIV laboratory test of any kind (HIV antibody orplasma HIV RNA concentration). They were classified as diagnosed with HIV if they had any of four possible ICD-9 codes for HIV/AIDS. 2.4. Statistical analyses We performed bivariate analyses to explore the associa- tion between our primary outcome measure, HIV screening,and each of the key independent variables and covariates. To determine the most significant predictors of HIV screening, we estimated a generalized linear mixed model accountingfor main VA health care facility used as a random effect andother potential confounders as fixed effects. Given the generally consistent trends in HIV screening rates on comparison of bivariate and multivariate model analyses, inour results below, we chose to highlight the absolute HIVscreening rates found in bivariate analyses. Details on the generalized linear mixed model analysis can be found on the VA Center for Health Quality Outcomes & EconomicResearch (CHQOER) Web site ( Dookeran et al., 2009 ).287 N.M. Dookeran et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 37 (2009) 286 -291This research was approved by institutional review boards at Boston University and the Edith Nourse Rogers MemorialVA Hospital. 3. Results 3.1. Patient characteristics Among the 371,749 veterans with substance use disorders in this study, the two most common disorderswere those of alcohol use (96%) and cocaine use (36%) (Table 1 ). More than half of the study population (57%) had histories of alcohol use disorders alone; 39% hadhistories of both illicit drug and alcohol use disorders(Table 2 ). Most patients (69%) had been seen in PC at least twice in the 12-month identification period. About onequarter (26%) had been in an outpatient substance useclinic or program, and 29% had received inpatient care. Veterans with substance abuse in our study were mostly male (97%), older (54% more than 54 years old), White (51%), and not currently married (72%). Most had housing(69%), lived within 30 miles of their primary VA carefacility (59%), and reported incomes lower than twice thepoverty line (55%). Most (71%) had no health insuranceother than VA membership and almost a quarter (22%) hadhepatitis C infection. 3.2. Overall HIV screening rates among patients with substance use disorders Only 20% of all veterans in care with a substance use disorder history had any retrospective evidence of HIVscreening in VA records. Patients with both illicit drug andalcohol use disorders were screened the most (32%),followed by those with illicit drug use disorders alone (25%), and those with alcohol use disorders alone (11%) (Table 2 ).3.3. HIV screening rates by patient characteristics Although Table 2 shows that patients with any ED visits had the highest HIV screening rates (24% and 25%), inmultivariate mixed modeling (detailed results available online), HIV screening was most likely among those who had had at least two PC visits as well as any ED visits(Dookeran et al., 2009 ).Table 2 also shows higher HIV s c r e e n i n gr a t e sa m o n gp a t i e n t sw h oh a db e e ni na n youtpatient substance use programs and among those whohad received any inpatient care. Patients who were younger,female, Black, or not currently married, and patients wholacked housing or lived within 30 miles of the VA, also had higher HIV screening rates. 4. Discussion In our nationwide retrospective study of a veteran population, the most striking finding was that only 20% of patients with illicit drug and/or alcohol use disorders in VAcare between 2004 and 2005 had evidence of ever havingbeing screened for HIV. We found this despite longstandingquality of care guidelines recommending HIV screening insubstance abusers and the fact that the VA, the largestintegrated health care delivery system in the United States,is a leader in performance and overall quality of care ( Asch et al., 2004; Branson et al., 2006; NIAAA, 2002; Oliver, 2007 ). We found evidence of HIV screening in only 11% of patients with alcohol use disorders alone and in 25% to 28%of those with illicit drug use disorders. Even among thosewith more access to care (greater use of PC and ED services,use of substance use programs, or any inpatient care), fewerthan one third had evidence of HIV screening. Thesefindings support the need for more widespread interventions to expand routine voluntary HIV screening nationally, within and outside of the VA ( Goetz, Hoang, et al., 2008; Sanders et al., 2005 ). Our findings are from an exceptionally comprehensive sample: more than 350,000 veterans with substance abusefrom VA facilities throughout the United States. In comparison, among veterans with illicit drug use disordersat four selected VA medical centers, 48% had evidence of testing ( Owens et al., 2007 ). The lower percentage we found nationally is quite similar to results from two nationalsurveys showing that 22% and 27% of individuals with HIVrisk behaviors self-reported HIV testing, respectively ( CDC, 2004 ). The higher but still suboptimal HIV screening rates at selected VA sites could be because the facilities are moreurban, more academic in focus, or may serve patients withdifferent socioeconomic profiles. There are many potential obstacles to HIV testing. In our study, even among those with the highest utilization of PCand the ED, only 24% had been screened for HIV. In PC andother clinical settings in which substance abusers receivecare, the focus may be on addressing more urgent and Table 1 Retrospective HIV screening rates among veteran patients with different types of substance use disorders Substance use disorder history (October 1999 -May 2005) n% screened for HIV Any alcohol use Yes 357,576 19No 14,173 25 Any illicit drug use Cocaine use Yes 132,354 33No 239,395 12 Opiate use Yes 67,723 35 No 16 Amphetamine use Yes 24,586 37 No 347,163 18288 N.M.

Dookeran et al. / Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment 37 (2009) 286 -291emergent substance use and medical presenting complaints, thus pushing HIV testing lower in clinical priorities. Theremay also be logistical and administrative barriers toperforming HIV testing, such as limited time and resourcesfor obtaining the written, informed consent required in the VA system during the period of our study. Low HIV screening rates also may reflect less under- standing of HIV risk among patients with certain substanceuse disorders and sociodemographic characteristics not oftenthought of as associated with HIV. For example, lowerscreening rates in patients with alcohol use disorders may berelated to patients and/or providers not recognizing theincreased HIV risk (and the need for screening) in these patients ( Cook & Clark, 2005; Ehrenstein et al., 2004; Rees et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2000 ). The high prevalence of heavy alcohol use in both veterans and nonveterans (7.5% and6.5%, respectively) accentuates this concern ( National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2005 ). Similarly, the VA user population is older, and although cultural norms maysuggest that HIV risk-taking \u2014and therefore HIV infection \u2014is rare in older adults, there are in fact growing numbers of HIV-infected older persons in the United States. HIV testing of older adults is cost-effective on a societal level and isclearly indicated ( Paul et al., 2007; Sanders et al., 2008 ). Although we believe our study design identified most cases of HIV screening, our results may have been influencedby several factors. Patients may have been tested earlier thanthe 1999 -2005 period during which we looked for evidence of HIV screening. Additionally, in this analysis, we looked at rates of ever having been screened rather than tracking changes in HIV screening by time. Thus, it is possiblescreening rates may have improved in the latter years of thestudy period with increasing uptake of guidelines. Our datadid not allow us to identify patients who refused HIV testing.To the extent that test refusal accounts for low screening rates,this may suggest need for better public education about thebenefits of early HIV diagnosis. We were also unable to identify veteran patients screened for HIV outside of the VA. We have no direct data on howmany veteran HIV tests were missed because of this.However, regional VA data (southern Nevada and Califor-nia) collected from an electronic clinical reminder found thatless than 2% of the patients in PC with identified HIV riskwho were not tested, reported previous tests outside the VAas the reason ( Goetz, Hoang, et al., 2008 ). Finally, to conduct a study of this size, scope, and inclusiveness, we used the presence of two ICD-9 diagnostic codes rather than direct clinical assessments to identify substance use disorders inVA patients ( Miller et al., 2004 ). Substantial efforts are underway to increase low rates of HIV testing within the VA, including improved targetedapproaches toward those with substance use disorders andother HIV risk factors, and implementation of more routine HIV screening as now recommended by the CDC. Targeting those at high risk continues to be important to counselpatients about risk behaviors, increase acceptance of screen-ing, and pursue more frequent screening in those at highest risk ( Branson et al., 2006; Millen et al., 2008 ). Prioritizing those at highest behavioral risk can be an efficient use oflimited health care dollars ( Holtgrave, 2007 ). Although behavioral health services and substance abuse services in the United States are often fragmented, poorly reimbursed, and delivered in settings where systematic quality assess-ment and improvement are difficult, the VA is an exceptionto this ( Anaya et al., 2004; Goetz, Bowman, et al., 2008; Rubenstein et al., 2000; Yano et al., 2007 ). Our results support greater integration of HIV screening services intocare for patients with substance use disorders, including themany veterans in care with alcohol abuse. There is a need to create more venues for screening (such as walk-in testing) and to better standardize, streamline, and increase thecapacity for testing ( Goetz, Hoang, et al., 2008; Valdiserri, & Holodniy, 2008 ). HIV testing in substance abusers may be streamlined by use of rapid HIV testinginstead of conventional enzyme immunoassay in someclinical settings ( Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR], 2007 ). To conclude, our nationwide retrospective study found that only 20% of patients with substance use disordersreceiving care in the VA had HIV status assessed, despite2001 CDC and 2002 NIAAA guidelines recommendingHIV screening at the time of the study. Although newCDC guidelines call for expansion to opt out routine HIVtesting, there is still great need for more aggressivemeasures to improve the recognition of those at high risk, such as substance abusers, and to minimize the barriers to HIV screening within these groups. Otherwise, efforts toincrease testing rates generally may focus on morecompliant patients in low-risk groups. Greatest priorityshould be placed on integrating HIV screening into thecare of patients with substance use disorders in manyclinical settings, increasing capacity for HIV screening, aswell as facilitating long-term continuity of care for these vulnerable populations.

The evaluation of pain management attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge deficits among practice experienced healthcare providers has been well documented, especially in the setting of cancer patients.\":\" However, there is a lack of published data comparing pain management confidence and competence between medical trainees and attend\u00ad ing physicians in an acute care academic medical setting. Although pain management guidelines exist on our hospital intranet, the Department of Medicine has no formal pain management curricu\u00ad lum, and there exists a perceived need to improve physicians' pain management competence at our institution. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate physician confidence and compe\u00ad tence regarding three selected pain management skills and assess the use of the hospitals pain man\u00ad agement guidelines. METHODS To assess and evaluate physicians' confidence and competence regarding effective pain manage\u00ad ment practices at our medical center, we developed a comprehensive questionnaire that was electroni\u00ad cally mailed to all interns (early in their first year of training), senior medical residents, and clinical attending physicians at our medical center. To max\u00ad imize the questionnaire response rate, the electronic survey was sent on two occasions over one month. During this time period, there were no formal pain medicine educational activities provided at our institution. This study was approved by the Boston Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The questionnaire was three pages in length and contained several sections. First, physicians were asked to rate their general knowledge on a five point Likert scale (none, minimal, adequate, above aver\u00ad age, superior) and experience (none, little, moder\u00ad ate, considerable, extensive) with managing pain in hospitalized patients. Respondents were also asked to rate their perceived comfort level with eight core pain management skills, which have been identified in previously published reports.6,9-11 They are: pain management in the elderly patient population, pain management in a patient with a history of substance abuse, managing patients with chronic-continuous pain, opioid titration, equianalgesic dose conversion, breakthrough dosing calculations for a patient with continuous pain, PCA prescribing, and prevention! management of opioid side effects. Physicians iden\u00ad tified their comfort level as: uncomfortable, some\u00ad what uncomfortable, somewhat comfortable, and comfortable. The study investigators chose three of the eight core pain management skills as they covered areas of greatest perceived difficulties at our medical center among medical trainees. They included managing chronic continuous pain, equianalgesic dose con\u00ad version, and breakthrough pain dosing. Physicians were then provided with three case vignette exer\u00ad cises which had been previously developed at our institution and tested for validity and reliability.12.l3 Each exercise corresponded to one of the three selected core pain management skills and assessed the physician's competence in this area. To ascer\u00ad tain the utilization of the comprehensive system wide pain management resources, physicians were also asked about their awareness of, and how fre\u00ad quently they have used the hospital's pain manage\u00ad ment guidelines. The Fisher's exact test was used to compare the self-reported confidence and competence measures for each pain management skill independently between physician groups and for the pair wise comparison of confidence and competence within physician groups. To preserve the overall level of significance at p = 0.05, a Bonferroni correction threshold of p = 0.025 was applied for the individ\u00ad ual competence and confidence measures between physician groups, treating each of the three pain management skills independently. A correction of p = 0.017 was applied for the pair wise comparison of competence and confidence within physician groups. Journal of Opioid Management 53 May/June 2009 170 RESULTS All medical physician staffs received the ques\u00ad tionnaire (n = 304). Overall, 30 percent (91/304) of the physicians completed the survey and returned the electronic questionnaire which included 60 percent (34/57) of the medical interns, 21 percent (01145) of the senior medical residents, and 26 percent (27/102) of the attending physicians. Compared with the attending physicians and sen\u00ad ior medical residents, the interns reported a lower level of pain management knowledge and experi\u00ad ence (Table 1). Only 23 percent of the physicians surveyed were aware of the hospital's pain manage\u00ad ment guidelines, Of those subjects who were aware of these guidelines, only 45 percent reported ever utilizing them. The senior residents reported being less confi\u00ad dent than attending physicians but more confident than interns with most of the pain management skills. Compared with attending physicians, the senior res\u00ad idents reported a similar degree of comfort toward managing patients with chronic-continuous pain (p = 0.36), performing equianalgesic conversions (p = 1.0), and determining appropriate breakthrough dosing (p = 0.42). In contrast, the interns were sig\u00ad nificantly less confident than the senior residents with the same pain management competencies; 12 vs 69 percent (p < 0.001)' 26 vs 62 percent (p = 0.006), and 23 vs 53 percent (p = 0.02)' respectively. There were few significant differences noted between physician groups on the competency assessment (Figure 1). The attending physicians scored higher than the senior residents on all three core pain management skills: managing patients with chronic-continuous pain (p = 0.1), performing equianalgesic conversions (p = 0.79), and determin\u00ad ing appropriate breakthrough dosing (p = 0.04). The senior residents scored lower than the interns on managing chronic continuous pain and perform\u00ad ing equianalgesic dose conversion (p = 0.1, P = 0.29, respectively) but not on determining appropriate breakthrough dosing (p = 0.53), though none was statistically significant. An inverse relationship between senior medical residents self-reported confidence level and com\u00ad petency assessment was noted for both the chronic continuous pain and equianalgesic conversion competencies (69 vs 23 percent, p = 0.006 and 62 vs 33 percent, p = 0.04, respectively). In con\u00ad trast, a linear relationship was observed between the interns confidence level and competency assessment for the same pain management skills [(12 vs 45 percent, p = 0.004); (26 vs 50 percent, p = 0.07)].

Journal of Opioid Management 5:3 DISCUSSION The results of our study highlight the need for further comprehensive pain management education efforts targeting all acute care medicine physicians at our institution. We were not surprised to find that May/June 2009 172 ------------------------,--------------------- ----------------------------------, inexperienced interns would be less confident with their pain management skills compared with their senior colleagues. However, the unexpected dispar\u00ad ity between the senior residents' overconfidence and their relatively poor skill competency warrants fur\u00ad ther examination. Despite these findings, this phe\u00ad nomenon may not be unique to our institution. In a study comparing the confidence and accuracy of medical diagnoses among physicians in training, Friedman et al. found that inexperienced medical stu\u00ad dents were least comfortable with their medical diag\u00ad nosis, while residents were more likely to be over\u00ad confident, yet less accurate than faculty physicians.\" Compared with the interns and senior residents, the attending physicians generally exhibited better performance on the objective knowledge assess\u00ad ment, however, pain management competence even here was inadequate. Although our study' results did not demonstrate a significant difference in knowledge between the three physician groups for each of the pain management skills in an acute care medical setting, our findings of pain knowl\u00ad edge deficits are consistent with similar published studies.9,IO,15-1? On the basis of a palliative care knowledge assessment completed by 81 physician trainees, Mortimer et al. discovered that 75 percent of respondents were unable to correctly perform an equianalgesic dosage conversion.l'' Von Gunten et al. also observed poor housestaff performance on a cancer pain knowledge assessment questionnaire prior to an intervention program designed to improve pain management skills.'? Several important limitations of this study should be considered. One is the issue of response bias. It is possible that those physicians who chose not to complete the questionnaire were less confident in their knowledge of pain management. The low response rate and small sample size also makes it difficult to identify true differences between groups and caution must be exercised when interpreting the results of nonsignificant findings. Finally, the authors recognize that the assessment of physicians' competency in pain management skills through the use of an objective survey tool may not correspond with actual clinical decision making. As the study questionnaires were anonymous, it was not possible to evaluate physician competence in the clinical practice setting. Despite these limitations, educational initiatives are clearly needed to address overall low perform\u00ad ance in pain management skills at our institution. These initiatives must target the discrepancy between physician confidence and relatively low level of com\u00ad petency, irrespective of the level of training. System wide resources that were developed as a means to ensure optimal pain management, such as our hos\u00ad pital-specific pain management guidelines, are cur\u00ad rently underutilized and clearly insufficient. Rather, these resources should be developed within exist\u00ad ing decision support methodologies (real time alerts for inappropriate dosage form selection, dose range checking, template pain management order sets, etc) to enhance physician work flow and improve pain management performance. Recent pain man\u00ad agement initiatives at our institution have included the addition of a Department of Neurology consult service and a grand rounds symposium, which included several focused pain management sessions provided by each physician discipline. The adop\u00ad tion of case-based learning strategies and those that utilize emerging technology such as clinical simula\u00ad tors could also be employed to assess physician knowledge and competency as a measure of effec\u00ad tive pain management pracrices.P-\" I Mark A.

Despite great progress in the diagnosis and treat - ment of unstable coronary syndromes, it is esti - mated that 785,000 Americans will have new acute cardiac events and 470,000 will have recurrent events this year. 1 Central to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes is the adhesion and activation of platelets leading to aggregation, thrombus formation, and vessel occlusion. Un - fortunately, the absolute risk of recurrent vascu - lar events among patients taking platelet inhibi - tors remains relatively high.1 The observation that platelet-dependent throm - bosis occurs despite treatment with platelet in - hibitors has led to a large number of studies as - sessing the cause of these treatment failures. Often termed \"resistance,\" treatment failure in patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel has been ascribed to myriad causes, including nonadher - ence to drug regimens, inadequate doses of drugs, and coexisting medical conditions. Such a lack of response to therapy may affect 5 to 45% of pa - tients. 2 It has also become apparent that herit - able factors play a major role in determining endogenous platelet function3 a n d t h a t t h e platelet-activation response varies widely among patients. However, genetic variants in platelet re - ceptors have not been consistently shown to in - fluence platelet function, alter drug response, or be associated with cardiovascular disease. 4 For clopidogrel, an inhibitor of platelet P2Y12 receptor, there are data suggesting that genetics may affect drug responsiveness and efficacy. The responsible genetic variant appears to occur not in the expected P2Y 12 receptor but, rather, in an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the drug. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires acti - vation by specific hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes. The genes encoding the CYP-depen - dent oxidative steps are polymorphic, and previ - ous studies have shown that carriers of the spe - cific alleles of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 have a diminished response to the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel.5-8 A reduced response to clopido - grel has been specifically associated with the CYP2C19*2 allele, which causes loss of function, in patients after coronary-stent placement9 and after myocardial infarction without ST elevation.10 It is consistent with these pharmacodynamic find - ings that prasugrel, another P2Y12 inhibitor, to be unaffected by variability in CYP2C19 isoenzymes.11 (At the time of this writing, pras - ugrel was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.) It is also consistent with the im - portance of hepatic enzymes that the coadminis - tration of omeprazole, which is metabolized by CYP2C19, has been shown to decrease the platelet-inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. 12 Two articles in this issue of the Journal con- tribute to our understanding of the genetic vari - ation in these enzymes in regulating the actions and efficacy of clopidogrel. In a study conduct - ed by the French Registry of Acute ST-Elevation or Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) investigators (ClinicalTrials.gov num - ber, NCT00673036), Simon et al. 13 report on a cohort of more than 2200 clopidogrel-treated patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction. The investigators, who looked at the re - lationship between genetic variants that are po - tentially relevant to platelet function and clinical outcome during a 1-year period, found that pa - tients carrying any two CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3, *4, or *5) had a higher event rate. Carriers of the ABCB1 variant that modulates clopidogrel absorption also had a modestly in - creased rate of events. However, they found no association with polymorphisms of P2Y 12 or gly - coprotein IIb/IIIa or with coadministration of omeprazole. In another study, Mega et al.14 investigated the association between genetic variants in CYP genes, the plasma concentration of active metab - olite, and platelet function in healthy subjects. In a subsequent analysis, they examined the as - sociation between CYP genetic variants and car - diovascular outcomes in nearly 1500 patients who presented with an acute coronary syndrome and who were treated with clopidogrel during the earlier Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeu - tic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarc - t i o n ( T R I T O N - T I M I ) 3 8 ( N C T 0 0 0 9 7 5 9 1 ) . T h e y found that in healthy subjects, carriers of at least one CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele had de - creased levels of the active clopidogrel metabo - lite and less reduction in platelet aggregation, as compared with noncarriers.

In addition, subjects in TRITON-TIMI 38 who carried the CYP2C19*2 allele had a risk of stent thrombosis that was three times that of noncar - riers. In this study, the event curves diverged soon after treatment with clopidogrel, a finding that was consistent with the potential immediate loss of a platelet-inhibitory effect. Inconsistent with these observations is the fact that no trend was found for increased bleeding among noncarriers of the CYP2C19 variant; however, the numbers of patients were small and the definition of hem - orrhage was potentially too stringent to discern a difference. Several of the findings in these studies are in - consistent with those of past reports. Previously, carriers of CYP3A4 were also noted to have a re - duced response to clopidogrel. 8 Although there were some differences in the populations studied, the clinical end points in the current studies13,14 should supersede surrogates for thrombosis. Also, as described by Simon et al., the use of proton- pump inhibitors had no effect on the clinical re - sponse to clopidogrel. The causes of the discrep - ancy in this finding between the study by Simon et al. and the previous reports are unclear. How - ever, until this question can be answered in a larger set of patients with clear clinical outcomes, the use of clinical outcomes, as opposed to plate - let-function testing, provides some reassurance. These two studies raise many pivotal questions. Could the loss of effect that was seen with the genetic variant be overcome by increasing the dose of clopidogrel? The mean dose in the French study was 300 mg per day; in TRITON-TIMI 38, a stan - dard dose of 300 mg per day was given, with a discharge dose of 75 mg per day in both stud - ies. Would patients with a loss-of-function CYP variant have improved platelet function and clini - cal outcomes (thrombosis and hemorrhage) with an alternative platelet inhibitor (such as prasug - rel) that does not require similar hepatic trans - formation? Would genetic testing and adjustments in the dose or type of therapy enhance efficacy? The data currently available cannot answer these questions. Until a prospective study is completed demonstrating how best to treat patients, par - ticularly those who have poor metabolism of clopidogrel, it is not clear that routine genetic testing will be clinically or fiscally advantageous. In summary, these studies demonstrate that patients with loss-of-function genetic variants have altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel and an increased car - diac risk that persists after adjustment for other known potential risk factors. What is striking about these two studies is their concordance de - spite distinct differences in populations of pa - tients. The fundamental observations are similar: that loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles are associ - ated with an increased risk of acute cardiovascu - lar events, particularly among patients undergo - ing percutaneous coronary intervention. Since these genetic variants are common in the general population, this observation is not trivial. To op - timally guide the selection of therapy, we must await further information concerning genetic test - ing, the role of extended genotypic classification, dose adjustment, and the effect of tailored ther - apeutic selection on thrombotic and hemorrhagic outcomes across a wide spectrum of patients in clinical practice.

In this issue of the Journal, Pope et al.1 provide data that once again reinforce this fundamental concept. In an analysis that corre - lates reductions in fine particulate matter (i.e., par - ticles less than 2.5 m in aerodynamic diame - ter, or PM2.5) in the air with life expectancies, the investigators found that a decrease in the concen - tration of PM2.5 of 10 g per cubic meter is as - sociated with an increase in life expectancy of 0.77 year. Their analysis is based on correlating reductions in particulate air pollution over the past several decades with increases in life expec - tancy in 217 counties in 51 metropolitan areas in the United States. Although ecologic in na - ture (i.e., reflecting associations between air pollution and life expectancy at the county rather than the individual level), these results appear to be robust with respect to adjustment for changes in socioeconomic, demographic, and smoking pat - terns occurring over the same period. The finding is comparable with previous pre - dictions of reductions in life expectancy of 1.11 years in the Netherlands, 2 1.37 years in Finland,3 and 0.80 year in Canada4 resulting from increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations of 10 g per cu - bic meter. However, the strength of the study by Pope et al. resides in its ability to demonstrate an increase in life expectancy resulting from actual reductions in particulate air pollution. This find - ing provides direct confirmation of the population health benefits of mitigating air pollution and greatly strengthens the foundation of the argu - ment for air-quality management. 5 This work could be extended to take into ac - count quality of life. For example, Coyle et al.4 estimated that an increase of 10 g per cubic meter in PM2.5 co n cen tra ti o ns w o ul d l ea d to a quality-adjusted reduction in life expectancy of 0.60 year, as compared with the unadjusted re - duction of 0.80 year. The work by Pope et al. rep - resents an important contribution to the large and growing body of evidence linking ambient air pollution with adverse health outcomes. At the global level, the World Health Organization 6 estimates that 1.4% of all deaths and 0.8% of dis - ability-adjusted life-years are the result of par - ticulate air pollution. The short-term health effects of particulate and gaseous air pollutants have been well document - ed, largely through time-series studies relating short-term elevations in ambient levels of such pollutants to increases in morbidity and mortality from cardiorespiratory conditions. A recent com - bined analysis of time-series data from 124 of the largest cities in North America and Europe pro - duced an estimated increase in the rate of death from any cause ranging from 0.2 to 0.6% for an increase in ambient PM 10 concentrations of 10 g per cubic meter,7 depending on the assumed lag time between exposure to particulate matter and death and on the method used for seasonality control, the form of the temporal smoothing func - tion, and degree of smoothing. Risk estimates for Europe and the United States were similar but were higher in Canada. The long-term effects of exposure to \"criteria\" air pollutants (particulate matter, ozone, sul - fates, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide) have been documented in large-scale cohort studies, including the Harvard Six Cities Study 8 an d th e Am erican Cance r S oc i e ty C an ce r Trenk D, Hochholzer W, with adverse 1-year clinical outcome of elective percutaneous coronary intervention with cytochrome 10. p450 polymorphisms on platelet reactivity after treatment with clopidogrel in coronary syndrome.

The authors used an imprecise end point \u2014 namely, the dose predicted to achieve a stable international normalized ratio (INR). The inves - tigators conclude that their model would be most helpful in the case of patients for whom the sta - ble, therapeutic warfarin dose is less than 22 mg or more than 48 mg per week, but would be less useful for patients requiring intermediate doses. Although the genetic data improved the accuracy of available models for predicting warfarin dose, whether the addition of genetic testing can reduce the risk of bleeding or thrombosis, or both, is the key question, and the answer remains unknown. In clinical practice, careful monitoring allows individualized dose adjustment during the initia - tion of warfarin therapy. Genetic testing cannot eliminate important hazards such as fragmented transitions of care, concomitant antiplatelet ther - apy, and socioeconomic barriers to frequent INR measurement. Moreover, the findings of the only high-quality, comparative trial of genotyp - ing among patients starting warfarin therapy cast serious doubt on the hypothesis that genetics-based warfarin dosing will reduce adverse out - comes. 2 These facts, along with a recent analysis of the cost-effectiveness of genetics-based war - farin dosing,3 leave us highly uncertain about whether patients stand to benefit from genetic testing in routine practice.

The authors reply: We agree with Garcia and Hylek that it is uncertain whether genetic-based warfarin dosing will improve outcomes, and this dosing approach cannot solve the other manage - ment problems related to warfarin dosing (e.g., fragmented care). Randomized, controlled trials comparing genotype-guided care with a nongenet - ic approach are planned in the United States, Eu - rope, and Korea and will be a critical step in showing that genotype-based dosing can improve anticoagulation control. Ultimately, very large trials may be needed to determine the effect of genotyping on clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, it is not difficult to envision that genetics-guided warfarin dosing could improve important and costly outcomes, such as extra clinic and emergency room visits. Even a reduction in minor bleeding could improve a person's qual - ity of life and decrease the need to discontinue a highly effective therapy. Our study suggests that the use of genetics might benefit nearly half the patients who are initiating warfarin therapy. Thus, there is the potential that genetic-guided warfa - rin dosing could prove to be cost-effective, particu - larly among patients at high risk for hemor rhage. In addition, as the cost of genotyping decreases, cost-effectiveness could be further enhanced. In response to Shil and Strohm's point about age, our algorithms do estimate lower doses in the elderly. We also agree that there are other fac - tors, both genetic and nongenetic, that may influ - ence warfarin dosing requirements, particularly at the extremes. Although we do not yet have all the answers regarding the value of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in clinical practice, our study provides an understanding of its potential benefit. Like most diagnostic tests, genetic testing will not benefit all persons. Clinicians must assess the current level of evidence and decide whether to implement genetics-guided warfarin dosing in practice now, await the results of the INR-focused clinical trials to adopt this approach, or adopt it only once dif - ferential clinical outcomes have been document - ed. Many diagnostic tests are widely adopted in practice before differential clinical outcomes have been documented; whether this will occur with warfarin dosing remains to be seen. Teri E.

Understanding stud ents' prior knowledge, attitudes and personal exposure to IPV will aid educators in desi gning more effective curriculum. As interprofessional educational e fforts proliferate, understanding di fferences across disciplines will be critical. Findings: Students in the schools of Me dicine, Nursing and Rehabilitati on at a university in Ontario attend an annual daylong interprofessional IPV tr aining. To measure perceived role and comfort with IPV and prior personal exposure, we administer ed a brief Likert scale survey to a convenience sample of students over three years. 552 students completed the survey; the overall response rate was 73%. The majority (82%) agreed that it was thei r role to intervene in cases of IPV; however Rehabilitation students expressed lower overall comfort levels than did their peers in other schools (p < .0001). Gender, age and prior training on the subject were not si gnificant predictors of comfort. Seven percent reported lifetime IPV and one-fifth had wi tnessed IPV, but these exposures did not predict comfort in adjust ed logistic regr ession models. Conclusion: While the majority of profession al students believe it is their role to address IPV in clinical practice, comfort level va ried significantly by field of st udy. More than one fifth of the students reported some personal exposure to IPV. However th is did not impact their level of comfort in addressing this issue. Educators n eed to take students' preexisting attitudes and personal exposure into account when pla nning curriculum initiatives in this area. Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pattern of coercive behavior in which one person attempts to control anotherthrough threats or actual use of physical violence, sexualassault and verbal or psychological abuse. [1] Nearly one-third of Canadian women experience IPV in their lifetimeand 21.2% report IPV in the preceding 5 years. [2,3] In Canadian family practice settings, the estimated preva-lence is 14.6%. [4] IPV has well-established adverse health effects, [5-7] and results in frequent and regular contact between victims and healthcare providers. [4,8] It has thusbecome widely accepted that training of healthcare pro-fessionals is imperative. [9,10] Yet, the sensitive nature ofIPV creates challenges for educators who train health pro-fessions students.

[13] Given the well-documented difficulty many healthcare providers have with inquiry for IPV, [15-17] itwould not be surprising to find a dearth of effective rolemodels available during clinical training. Further adding to these challenges is the possibility of per- sonal exposure to IPV among students. Students who have been victims may experience a range of responses to IPVcurricular content including anxiety, vicarious retraumati-zation and feelings of helplessness. [11,14] Medical stu-dents with personal histories of violence express concernabout their future efficacy in aiding patients who have had similar experiences. [18] Nonetheless, students who report histories of abuse favor IPV training. [19] In orderto provide effective learner-centered curricula, educatorsneed to understand the potential extent of IPV exposureamong students. Curricula to address IPV have proliferated over the last 15 years [9,20] and are most commonly reported in medical and nursing school settings. [21-24] Fewer citations arefound for the field of physical therapy and rehabilitation.[25,26] The prevalence of IPV among US medical students is between 6-12% for women [18,19] and 7% for men[27,28] In a US study of nursing students, 8%reported experiencing IPV[29] Among practicing physi-cians and nurses in Ontario, nearly 50% reported eitherpersonally experiencing or witnessing a close friend or rel-ative experience abuse. [16] Thus, it is also probable that some proportion of Canadian students will have been exposed to IPV, [11,14,18] but to our knowledge, rateshave not been reported in the literature. Aims of the Study The main objectives of the study are to explore how stu- dent comfort in addressing IPV is impacted by 1) gender, 2) program of study and 3) prior personal experience ortraining. A secondary aim was to measure students' under-standing of the dynamics of abusive relationships andascertain whether this differs across program of study. Stu-dents in the schools of Nursing, Medicine and Rehabilita-tion attending a one-day workshop on IPV completed a brief survey in order to provide some preliminary data to address these study questions. Methods A daylong interprofessional workshop on IPV is heldannually at a large university in Ontario, Canada. Stu- dents from the Schools of Nursing, Medicine and Physical Rehabilitation attend the mandatory workshop. Studentsare warned of the potential for disturbing material andoffered on-site resources. Counselors attend the workshopand are available to assist any student in immediate needof support. A voluntary brief, confidential Likert-scale sur- vey was distributed to students at the morning break dur- ing the one-day workshop over the three study years(2003-2005). The medical and rehabilitation studentswere in their second year of graduate training, the nursingstudents were in the third year of an undergraduate pro-gram. Attendees answered basic demographic questions about age, country of origin and current school. They were also asked about any prior training pertaining to IPV. Weincluded two questions about students' personal experi-ence and history of witnessing of IPV: 1) \"Have you ever been physically abused by an inti- mate partner?\" 2) \"Have you ever directly witnessed physical abuse in a relationship?\" We also queried students about their level of comfort with inquiry about IPV. Response categories for comfort was createdwith the two agreement categories being used to modelpresence of comfort in addressing IPV. Summary anddescriptive statistics were performed to examine basicdemographic characteristics, attitudes toward and preva- lence of IPV. The secondary aim of characterizing stu- dents' understanding of abusive relationship dynamicswas addressed by measuring agreement with the state-ment, \"I don't understand why victims remain in abusiverelationships.\" Bivariate analyses examined whether ratesof IPV varied by gender, country of origin and school. We examined potential predictors of student comfort with inquiry for IPV using logistic regression analysis. Thismodel was adjusted for age, gender, country of birth; priortraining for IPV, school, year the survey was taken and his-tory of IPV or being a witness to IPV. The UniversityResearch Ethics Board approved the study. All analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.1 (Cary, N.C.). Results Over a three-year period, a total of 552 students com- pleted the survey; 37% of the students were medical stu-dents, 33% were rehabilitation students and theremaining 30% were nursing students (Table 1). The over- all response rate was 73%. The majority of the health pro- fessions students attending the workshops over the threeyears were female (n = 415/552, 76%). Most of the stu-dents reported no prior IPV training (n = 338, 61%); forthose who had training, the most common source wasundergraduate education (n = 86/214, 40%). Medical stu- dents had the highest rate of previous training. (Table 1) The majority of students (82%) in all schools expressed the belief that it was their role to intervene on behalf ofabused patients (Table 1), but the rehabilitation studentsBMC Research Notes 2009, 2:191 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1756-0500/2/191 Page 3 of 5 (page number not for citation purposes)expressed a lower self-report of comfort level than both nursing and medical students (Table 2). Similarly, the rehabilitation students were more likely to endorse a lack of understanding as to why someone would remain in anabusive relationship (Table 1). In the adjusted analyses,the only significant predictor of student-reported comfortwas enrollment in either nursing or medical school. Gen-der, age, prior report of IPV training, year of workshop attendance and personal history of IPV were not predic- tors of comfort with IPV inquiry (Table 2). Overall, a total of 38 students (7%) reported lifetime IPV; the majority of these were female (n = 30/38, 79%). How-ever, this was not statistically significant ( 2 = 3.77, p = .15). Medical students had the highest rate of lifetime IPV (Table 1). Fewer foreign-born students (4%) reported IPVthan did their Canadian counterparts (7%). One fifth of all the students witnessed IPV at some point in their lives; the highest percentage was again found among medical students (Table 1). More female studentsreported witnessing IPV, however the difference was not statistically significant ( 2 = 3.63, p = 0.16). Discussion While the majority of students in our study agreed that it is their role to address IPV in clinical practice, knowledgeand attitudes varied across schools. Age, prior training andeven personal exposure to IPV did not change the relation- ship between field of study and comfort level with this issue. Rehabilitation students expressed lower comfortlevels that may, in part, correspond to their report of lessprior IPV training; however in logistic regression analysis,field of study remained a significant predictor of comforteven when prior training was controlled for. While reha- bilitation students clearly viewed addressing IPV as part of their professional purview, their expressed comfort leveland understanding of the dynamics of abusive relation-ships lagged behind those of nursing and medical stu-dents. This finding is unlikely due to level of study alonesince rehabilitation students were second year postgradu- ate students comparable in age to the medical students, while the nursing students were younger undergraduates.Table 1: Characteristics of Students by Professional School N = 552 Variable Medical N = 208 (%)Rehabilitation N = 181 (%)Nursing N = 163 (%)P value Mean Age (SD)\u00a7 24 (3.8) 25 (2.6) 21 (4.5) < .0001 Gender (REFERENCE = female) 103 (50%) 158 (87%) 154 (94%) < .0001 Born in Canada 175 (84%) 159 (88%) 137 (85%) .51 Prior IPV training (REFERENCE none)139 (67%) 103 (57%) 96 (59%) Personal IPV 50 (24%) (22%) .71 Summary of Attitudes and Comfort: percenta ge responding Agree Strongly or Agree \"I don't understand why victims remain in abusive relationships.\" 36 (17%) 38 (21%) 19 (12%) .02 \"It is my role to intervene if a patient has been abused.\" 171 (82%) 145 (80%) 136 (83%) .24 \"I feel comfortable asking patients about 99 (48%) 56 (31%) 78 (48%) < .0001 \u00a7Standard deviation is given in parentheses for age variable only.

Personal exposure to IPV was asignificant predictor of reduced comfort in unadjustedanalyses, but this relationship did not remain significantwith adjustment for potential confounders. While prior work has shown that female medical students were more likely than their male counterparts to reportprior IPV exposure, [18] this finding did not achieve sta-tistical significance in our study. Interestingly, the schoolreporting the highest rates of IPV (Medicine) was also the group with the highest percentage of male students. Rates of exposure to lifetime IPV are known to increase with age,but in our study, age alone was unlikely responsible formedical students' higher reported IPV rates since the meanage of rehabilitation students was comparable. It is notable that the rate of lifetime IPV measured in this study is significantly lower than that reported in Canadian population studies but comparable to estimates amongU.S student cohorts. One possible explanation for this isthe \"healthy worker effect\" theory, which posits that thosewith abuse histories may have lower educational attain-ment due to the adverse effects of the abuse, and thus be less likely to participate in professional training, lowering the rate of IPV in such populations. [28,30] Anotherpotential contributing factor is underreporting of abusehistory by students due to our administration of the sur-vey in an open lecture hall with proximate seating of otherstudents. Foreign-born students' reported rates of IPV are similar to those of Canadian- born students. Since we did not querylength of residency in Canada, we were unable to assessthe level of acculturation of these students which mayimpact rates of IPV. Lower rates of IPV have been found among foreign born women in population-based studies in Canada [2] but the foreign born students enrolled inCanadian professional schools likely have higher levels oflanguage proficiency and literacy than their counterpartsin the general population. Limitations This study has a number of limitations. Because the surveywas administered during the workshop, students mayhave had privacy concerns when completing it, possiblyresulting in response bias. We could not query 12 month(current) IPV separately because students attending thetraining who had intimate relationships with fellow stu- dents could have been seated together in the lecture hall, limiting the safety of inquiry about current IPV. Selectionbias may have occurred because questionnaire comple-tion was voluntary. Another concern is our measurement of IPV. Due to the need for brevity, we used one question to ascertain prior exposure to physical IPV and one toquery witnessing IPV. Neither question has been vali-dated. The lack of questions about emotional abuse alsolikely underestimated the true prevalence of IPV in thispopulation. The students from the different schools were all at different levels in their training, thus unmeasured effects of clinical experience could have impacted some oftheir expressed knowledge and attitudes about IPV. More-over, interprofessional educational initiatives remainunusual, so the findings from this study may not readilygeneralize to other more traditional teaching settings. Conclusion Our study presents novel data regarding Canadian profes-sional students and IPV which may aid educators develop-ing curriculum in this field. While the majority of allstudents believed that it was their role to address IPV; fur-ther study of rehabilitation students, who will go on to work with vulnerable populations, is needed to explain why this group differs in expressed comfort and under-standing of the dynamics of abusive relationships. While we may have underestimated the true prevalence of IPV in this cohort, our study affirms that a proportion of Canadian health professions students are likely to have experienced IPV. IPV may also be a more salient issue formale students than previously described. Our findingsrequire replication with validated, confidential measures.Study of this issue across Canadian institutions could alsobetter inform educational initiatives in this challenging field. Future work should examine which teaching meth- ods may be most effective for learners who have been vic-tims or witnesses to IPV.

The predictors of poor retention in HIV care are not well understood, especially from US nationwide data-sets. We determined the predictors of poor retention in HIV care among a group of US veterans and examined whether poor retention was confounded by other predictors of survival. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,619 male US veterans who started antiretroviral therapy after January 1, 1998. Poor retention in HIV care was de ned as having had at least 1 quarter-year without any primary care visit in the year after starting antiretroviral therapy. Survival was assessed through 2002. Logistic regression and Cox models were constructed. Results: Thirty-six percent of patients had poor retention in care. In multivariable analysis, younger age, Black race/ethnicity, CD4 cell count >350 x10 6/L, hepatitis C infection, and illicit drug use were predictive of poor retention in care. Having a chronic medical comor-bidity and being identi ed as a man having sex with men (MSM) were associated with improved retention in care. In multivariable survival analyses, poor retention in care was not a confounder or moderator for other variables that predicted sur-vival. Conclusions: Retention in HIV care is an independent predictor of survival. As routine HIV screening increases, more people with the characteristics predictive of poor retention in care will be identi ed. Interventions to improve retention in care are needed.

Email: tpg@bcm.tmc.eduHIV-infected patients who are poorly adher- ent to physician visits are less likely to receive HAART, have lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), are more likely to develop an infection with resistance to HAART, and are less likely to achieve HIV suppression. 1-5 Using national data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, we recently showed that poor retention in HIV care was predictive of less desirable changes in CD4 cell count and HIV RNA concentration (\"viral load\") while on ART and worse overall survival. 6 Others have reached similar results7 and extended them to patients newly entering care for HIV infection.8 Given these ndings, interventions to improve retention in care are urgently needed. Little is known about the predictors of poor retention in HIV care, especially from US nation-wide patient datasets. We sought to determine the factors predictive of poor retention in care among a group of US veteran patients. It is important to determine predictors of poor retention so that interventions used in the context of clinical trials or quality improvement initiatives can be targeted, especially since such projects often have limited resources. We also sought to determine whether retention in care explains the effects of other pre-dictors of poorer survival with HIV infection, including baseline HIV disease severity, race/eth-nicity, substance use, psychiatric comorbidity, and socioeconomic instability. If, for example, it was known that retention in care mediates the effect of substance use on survival, interventions targeted at reducing substance use might be particularly suc-cessful at improving survival. *Dr. Morgan is currently at University of Texas Health Science Center Houston School of Public Health.METHODS The methods for this study are fully described elsewhere.6 Briefl y, we used the VA's Immunology Case Registry to conduct a retrospective cohort study involving persons newly identi ed as hav- ing HIV infection during 1997-1998 at any VA hos-pital or clinic in the United States. To be included in the study, patients had to have started ART after January 1, 1997, seen a clinician at least once after receiving their rst ART prescription, have a baseline CD4 cell count result available, and have survived for at least 1 year. Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of the number of quarters during the year in which they had at least one HIV primary care visit. Survival was assessed through 2002 using VA databases and the National Death Index. Because data were available for only a small number of women, they were excluded. Because HIV RNA concentration was missing for 383 (14.6%) of the subjects and was not likely miss-ing at random, we did not include that variable in the analyses. We examined baseline characteristics using data up to and including the rst HIV primary care visit after ART was started. To determine the pres-ence of medical, substance use, and socioeconomic conditions, we examined International Classi ca- tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes ( Table 1 ). We selected ve of the most common chronic medical comorbidities among veterans for individual study (diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) to determine whether the need for chronic medical care for those conditions infl u- ences retention in HIV care. Because the preva-lence of each condition was relatively uncommon at baseline (hypertension was most common, at 9.7%), we created a variable that represented the presence of any one of these conditions. There is no single ICD-9 code for \"AIDS,\" so it was de ned by the presence of the ICD-9 codes for many of the 1993 AIDS-de ning conditions. We estimate that between 70% and 80% of AIDS-de ning condi- tions would be captured by these ICD-9 codes. 9,10 Hepatitis C virus infection was de ned as a posi- tive antibody test result. HAART use was de ned as the use of a protease inhibitor, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir within 30 days of the rst ART prescription.Because our previous work showed that an HIV primary care visit during the rst year after starting ART in fewer than four quarters was associated with a statistically signi cant decrease in survival, 6 we dichotomized retention in care at four quarters or fewer than four quarters to assess the independent predictors of poor retention in care. Categorical data were compared with the chi-square test, and a multivariate logistic regres-sion model was created. To assess the impact of retention in care on other known predictors of survival with HIV infection, we used the method of Baron and Kenny to determine whether reten-tion in care was a moderator in that relationship. 11 First, in a Cox proportional hazard model that did not include the variables representing retention in care, we determined what those other predictors of survival were in our dataset. Next we determined whether these predictors were associated with retention in care using the logistic regression mod-els described previously. Finally, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model of survival that included these variables and the variables repre-senting the number of quarters in care to assess whether the relationship between those predictors and the outcome was moderated by retention in care. Statistics were analyzed with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Baylor College of Medicine and Af li- ated Institutions, as well as by the VA. Individual informed consent was not required. RESULTS The cohort included 2,619 patients. Sixty-four percent were seen in all four quarters, and 36% were seen in fewer than four quarters. As shown in Table 1 , in univariate analysis, younger age, HIV risk factor other than men having sex with men (MSM), Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, higher CD4 cell count, hepatitis C infection, illicit drug use, and alcohol abuse were predictors of poor retention in care, while the presence of any of the chronic medical comorbidities and a his-tory of AIDS predicted good retention in care. In multivariable analysis, younger age, Black race/ethnicity, CD4 cell count >350 x10 6/L, hepatitis C infection, and illicit drug use were predictive of being seen in fewer than four quarters during the 300 HIV C LINICAL TRIALS \u0081 10/5 \u0081 S EPT-OCT 2009Table 1.

Having a medical comorbidity and being identi ed as MSM were associated with improved retention in care. To determine whether retention in care moder- ates the effect of other characteristics associated with poor survival with HIV infection, we con-structed multivariable models. Using the method of Baron and Kenny, 11 we ran three sets of models (Table 2 ). First, in a model that did not include the variables representing the number of quarters in care, we found that increasing age, decreasing CD4 cell count, and chronic medical comorbid-ity were predictive of poorer survival (columns 7 and 8 of Table 2 ). Next we showed that these variables, among others, were associated with retention in care (columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 ). Finally, we constructed a model that included these variables and the variables representing the P REDICTORS OF RETENTION IN HIV C ARE \u0081 G IORDANO ET AL. 301number of quarters in care (columns 9 and 10 of Table 2 ). Increasing age, decreasing baseline CD4 cell count, any chronic medical comorbidity, and poorer retention in care were strongly predictive of increased hazard of death ( p .01), while illicit drug use was weakly predictive of decreased hazard of death ( p = .03). In comparing the sur- vival models with and without the retention in care variables, none of the adjusted hazard ratios or p values changed substantially when adjusted for the number of quarters in care, indicating that retention in care is independently predictive of survival and is not confounded by other variables nor is it a mediator in the pathway by which they affect survival. DISCUSSION We studied retention in care in the VA health care system, a system that has few barriers to care for eligible veterans. Thirty-six percent of veterans had poor retention in care at 1 year, and we found that the predictors of poor retention in care are younger age and less advanced HIV disease, Black race, and substance use. MSM and men with chronic medical conditions had better retention in care. Retention in care appears to be an independent predictor of sur-vival that is not a confounder and does not mediate the effects of other predictors of survival. The finding that Black patients had more dif- ficulty remaining in care, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status, disease severity, age, and other factors, is discouraging. The VA health care system provides access to low-cost care, though some copayments and other real and opportunity costs are incurred by the patient. We could not account for these costs in the analysis, and it is possible that these costs were a barrier for more of the Black patients than the other patients. Unmeasured noneconomic barri-ers may also contribute to this finding, includ-ing for example different levels of mistrust or stigma. 12-14 More work is needed to fully explain this observation, because differences in retention in care may contribute to race-based disparities in outcomes. 15,16 The other predictors of poor retention in care were substance use or its markers, such as hepa-titis C infection. Others have found substance use associated with poor retention in care. 17 These fac- tors also often cause dif culty with adherence to ART. Adherence to ART and retention in care are, in fact, related behaviors: both are chronic, com-plex behaviors requiring accurate information, internal and external motivation and support, and an array of behavioral skills, including regu-lar interaction with and navigation of the health care system. These conceptual similarities and the overlapping predictors suggest that interventions to improve adherence might bene t from focus on retention in care and vice versa. In contrast, medi-cal comorbidities and more advanced HIV disease were predictive of better retention. This nding offers some assurance that the sickest patients are getting the care they need. Psychiatric disease was not associated with either retention in care or survival. Treatment for psychiatric disease may be at least partially responsible for these negative ndings. Adjusting for retention in care had little effect on the hazard ratios for the other variables in the model, indicating that it is not a confounder or mediator of their effects. In other words, substance use or more advanced HIV disease at baseline does not lead to worse survival through poorer reten-tion in HIV care. Retention in care is associated with adherence to ART, 6 which clearly impacts survival; retention in care is easily and accurately ascertained in routine care and should be consid-ered when identifying patients at high risk for poor outcomes. Further work is needed to disentangle the effects of retention in care and adherence to ART, but clearly they are both important forms of adherence to HIV care. This study supplements and improves upon our earlier work in a number of ways. First, we herein report the results of a multivariable model of the predictors of poor retention in care. Second, the earlier report used a comorbidity index 18 rather than speci c comorbidities; the latter are more use- ful clinically. To our knowledge, no other studies have assessed the impact of medical comorbidities on retention in care. Third, the present study dem-onstrates that retention in care is an independent predictor of survival, not a mediator or confounder for other predictors of survival with HIV infection. The study has limitations. We could not account for incarceration or transfer out of VA care, though the latter is unlikely for patients accessing ART through the VA. 19 These data are from early in the HAART era, but it is not likely that patterns and associations we observed would be substantially 302 HIV C LINICAL TRIALS \u0081 10/5 \u0081 S EPT-OCT 2009Table 2.

As reviewed earlier, potentially important infl uences on retention in care could not be assessed in this retrospective cohort study. We could not capture all AIDS-de ning conditions, as noted in Table 1 . This limitation may account for the low prevalence of a history of AIDS and its poor prognostic value in predicting survival in our data. The analyses excluded all patients who died within 1 year of their rst visit after starting ART, so the low prevalence and poor prognostic ability are not completely unexpected. Retention in HIV care is an important, inde- pendent predictor of survival with HIV infection. Persons at highest risk for poor retention in care are young, otherwise healthy, Black patients with less advanced HIV disease who use illicit drugs. As HIV screening becomes routine, 20 more people with these characteristics will be identi ed and retaining them in care may be dif cult. Interven- tions to improve retention are needed.

BACKGROUND: Sustainability \u2014the routinization and institutionalization of processes that improve the qual- ity of healthcare \u2014is difficult to achieve and not often studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sustainability of increased rates of HIV testing after implementation of a multi- component intervention in two Veterans Health Admin- istration healthcare systems. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental implementation study in which the effect of transferring responsibility to conduct the provider education component of the intervention from research to operational staff was assessed. PATIENTS: Persons receiving healthcare between 2005 and 2006 (intervention year) and 2006 and 2007 (sustainability year). MEASUREMENTS: Monthly HIV testing rate, stratified by frequency of clinic visits. RESULTS: The monthly adjusted testing rate increased from 2% at baseline to 6% at the end intervention year and then declined reaching 4% at the end of the sustainability year. However, the stratified, visit-specific testing rate for persons newly exposed to the interven-tion (i.e., having their first through third visits duringthe study period) increased throughout the intervention and sustainability years. Increases in the proportion of visits by patients who remained untested despitemultiple, prior exposures to the intervention accounted for the aggregate attenuation of testing during the sustainability year. Overall, the percentage of patientswho received an HIV test in the sustainability year was 11.6%, in the intervention year 11.1%, and in the pre- intervention year 5.0% CONCLUSIONS: Provider education combined with informatics and organizational support had a sustain- able effect on HIV testing rates. The effect was most pronounced during patients 'early contacts with the healthcare system.KEY WORDS: HIV testing; provider education; sustainability; VA hospitals. J Gen Intern Med 24(12):1275 -80 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-1120-8\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 INTRODUCTION There is a growing literature on the types of interventions required to improve healthcare quality1. To reap long-term benefits, the gains brought about by such programs must be sustained beyond the initial interventional period. However,achieving sustainability (i.e., the routinization and institution- alization of improved processes), is difficult and may be dependent on characteristics of the intervention that are notexamined during the trial that demonstrates effectiveness. Sustainability is not often studied, and when it is, the results are often disappointing 2-4. Herein we report on the sustainability of a successful intervention to increase HIV testing. The clinical benefits of identifying and treating asymptomatic human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) infected individuals are firmly establishedand more cost-effective than many other general population preventive services 5-14. However, 21% of the 1.1 million HIV- infected persons in the United States remain undiagnosed15. Similarly, only 30% to 50% of Veterans Administration (VA) patients with known, documented risk factors for HIV infection have been tested16,17. Therefore, we previously implemented a multi-modal intervention based upon computerized decision support, provider education and feedback, and organizational changes that significantly increased HIV testing rates in at-riskindividuals who receive care at VA medical facilities 18. Over a one-year period, implementation of this program increased the cumulative rate of ever being tested for HIV from 20.1% to 53.7% (p<0.001). In contrast, there was no change in threecontrol facilities. Once the interventional year was over, we turned project responsibility over to preexisting primary care clinical leader-ship. This leadership chose to dramatically reduce the labor- intensive provider education campaign and merged what little that remained into routine clinical management (e.g. weeklystaff meetings). They did, however, continue the largely \"fixed \" changes in the systems infrastructure for HIV testing, which Received May 21, 2009 Revised August 21, 2009Accepted September 02, 2009 Published online October 2, 2009 1275required substantially less support to maintain (i.e. the computerized decision support, feedback reports, and mainte- nance of organizational changes). We now report on theintervention 's sustainability in the second, sustainability year of this project. METHODS As previously described18, the intervention program was put in place for one year in two of the five geographically separate VA regional healthcare systems (HCS) in southern Nevada andCalifornia. HCS A and B were comprised of 12 and five sub-facilities, respectively, in which primary care were provided by mixtures of academic and non-academic staff physicians, postgraduate medical trainees and mid-level providers. Thisstudy was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. In brief, the components of the intervention were: 1.) A continuously updated, electronic clinical reminder that identifies patients at increased risk for HIV infection and encourages providers to offer HIV testing to such indivi- duals. This reminder is triggered by HIV risk factorsavailable in the VA electronic medical record. Theseinclude evidence of Hepatitis B or C infection, illicit drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, homelessness, and Hepatitis C risk factors 18. Once triggered, the reminder was resolved by ordering an HIV test, recording the result of an HIV test performed elsewhere, or indicating that the patient was not competent to consent to testing or refusedHIV testing. Once resolved, the reminder was no longer triggered. 2.) An audit-feedback system: Providers were given quarterly reports of clinic-level HIV testing performance 19. 3.) The reduction of organizational barriers : Under federal laws specific to the VA, written, informed consent and pre- test HIV counseling have been required for all HIV tests20. To expedite this process we encouraged nurse-based rather than physician-based pre-test counseling, use of streamlined HIV counseling, and both telephone notifica-tion and brief post-test counseling after negative HIV test results 18,21. 4.) A provider education (activation) program: This included academic detailing, social marketing, and educational materials22,23. The academic detailing component in- volved regular informal discussions by project staff toencourage providers to prioritize the performance of HIVtesting 24,25. Social marketing involved having physician and nursing clinical opin ion leaders encourage HIV testing by primary care healthcare providers26. Finally, we developed and distributed educational hand-outs, pocket cards and posters to promote HIV testing and increase provider comfort and abilities to provide pre- andpost-test HIV counseling. All aspects of the program were implemented in the first month of the intervention year at HCS A and HCS B and maintained during the subsequent 11 months. In support ofthe provider education program, members of the study teammade frequent visits to the clinics to informally promote HIV testing in one-on-one ad hoc meetings with primary care providers. In addition, senior members of the study teamregularly attended clinic and facility-wide meetings of primary care physicians, nurses and clinic leadership to promote HIV testing. The study team did not participate in provider education activities during the second (sustainability) year of the study and instead fully transferred responsibility for this activity toclinic leadership. Qualitative evaluation indicated that provid- er education activities were much reduced and merged into routine clinical management activities such as staff meetings.Leadership did maintain other aspects of the intervention,including quarterly feedback reports of the rate of HIV testing, and the electronic clinical reminder. Organizational changes that had eased the documentation requirements for HIVtesting and broadened the number of people authorized to initiate testing and counselin g persisted. Distribution of educational activities, pocket cards and handouts continuedat a reduced rate Our primary analytical goal was to assess the trajectory of the monthly rate of HIV testing during the intervention andsustainability years. In addition, we assessed changes in the proportion of patients who agreed to be tested. Data sources. We obtained administrative and clinical data, including patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnostic codes and health factors of the inpatient and outpatientencounters from August 2004 to July 2007 from a pre- existing regional VA database 18. The medical records were linked across the data files by encrypted identifiers. Study population. We evaluated outcomes during clinical visits of patients who were identified as being at-risk for HIV infection but had not been offered HIV testing (i.e., the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder had been previously been resolved).Visits by eligible patients were removed from the databasesubsequent to the month during which the reminder was resolved. Statistical methods. To assess the adjusted rates of HIV testing and refusal, we performed logistic regression analyses in which the unit of analysis was the patient who was seen at the VHA facilities in each month, had HIV risk factors, but the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder had not previously been resolved.The dependent variables were performance of HIV testing anddocumentation of patient refusal to be tested. The independent variables included patient demographic and clinical factors such as age, race and ethnicity, marital status, lack ofhousing, co-payment status, being at-risk for hepatitis C, hepatitis C infection, hepatitis B infection, illicit substance use and sexually transmitted diseases 18.T h et w oV H A healthcare systems comprised of 17 facilities where the patients were seen. To adjust for any systemic effects on patient likelihood of accepting or refusing HIV testing, weincluded facility-level annual patient loads and baseline HIV testing rates in the pre-intervention period as independent variables. Finally, we adjusted the covariance of the regressionmodel for patient clustering within facilities using theGeneralized Estimating Equation method. The data analysis was generated using SAS v9.1 proc genmod (SAS version 9.1. SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).1276 Goetz et al.: Sustainability of an HIV Testing Intervention JGIMRESULTS Table 1compares the demographic features and factors of patients with known risk for HIV infection who received care in the intervention and sustainability years. In the sustainability year, at-risk patients were somewhat younger and less oftenmarried. This largely represents an influx of veterans from recent military campaigns into VA care 27-30. Otherwise there were no meaningful differences in demographic and clinicalcharacteristics between the two years. The number of patients in the sustainability year was lower than in the intervention year as all patients in whom the HIV Testing Clinical Reminderwas resolved in the intervention year were excluded from the analyses of the sustainability year. We previously reported that our multi-modal intervention more than doubled the rate of HIV testing rates among at-riskindividuals 18. The percentage of at-risk patients who received an HIV test was 11.1% in the intervention year versus 5.0% in the year prior to the intervention (p<0.001). In the sustain-ability year, 11.6% of at-risk patients were tested. To better assess whether this result represented actual sustainability of the intervention, we assessed the trajectory of the monthly HIVtesting rates 31,32. This rate increased from 2% at baseline (prior to implementation of the program) to 6% in month 12 (Fig. 1). Although the monthly testing rate declined in the sustainability year, the rate in month 24 remained more than twice the baseline rate (4% versus 2%). These results were consistent across all patient subgroups (data not shown). As only patients in whom the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder remained unresolved were eligible for testing in the sustainability year, the previous analyses are susceptible to bias from differ- ences in system-, provider- or patient-level characteristics forpatients in whom the reminder was or was not resolved in the intervention year. To reduce this bias, we analyzed HIV testingrates by the order of visits since the start of the intervention period (i.e. first visit, second visit, etc.). This analysis was prompted by discussions with providers which indicated that amore comprehensive approach to detecting undiagnosed diseaseis taken in new patients. As shown on Figure 2a, the HIV testing rate was consistently greatest on a patient 's first visit during the study period (i.e., on the first possible exposure to the interven-tion). For such patients, the testing rate increased from 2% at baseline (pre-intervention) to 6% on month 1; the rate continued to increase throughout the 24-month observation period. Foreach subsequent visit, the magnitude of the increase in the HIV testing rate was less than for patients having their first visit, but remained greater than during the prestudy period for patients Table 1.

Proportion of outpatient visits grouped by visit number.1277 Goetz et al.: Sustainability of an HIV Testing Intervention JGIMhaving their second to fourth visits. Time series analyses demonstrated that the probability of being tested increased over time for patients having their second or third visits. Minimalincreases were seen on the fourth visit and the testing rate on the fifth and later visits did not increase. Over time the proportion of patients being seen on their first to third visits decreased whilethe proportion being seen on visit number four and greater increased (Fig. 2b). This change in patient distribution explained the attenuation of the rate of HIV testing in the overall popula-tion. Further analyses did not identify any demographic, clinicalor facility characteristics that differed between persons who were or were not tested for HIV by their fourth visit (data not shown). As discussed in METHODS, the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder can be resolved by performing an HIV test or by documenting that the patient refused to be tested. While allowing for patient choice with respect to HIV testing, minimization of the refusal rate is animportant goal; once \"refused \"is selected, the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder did not prompt providers to re-offer HIV testing during future visits. However, we hypothesized that some\"refusals \"might actually reflect provider discomfort offering an HIV test 33,34, and therefore that the refusal rate might decrease as providers gained more HIV testing experience. We found that there was a substantial, continuous decrease in the HIV test refusal rate (Fig. 3). The net result was that among persons in whom the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder was resolved, the likelihood that reminder resolution resultedin HIV testing increased from 17% of all reminder responses in the first month of the intervention to 60% in the final month. DISCUSSION We previously demonstrated that implementation of an inte-grated package of quality improvement interventions that utilizes decision support, a provider education (activation)campaign, feedback reports and organizational changes more than doubled HIV testing rates for at-risk individuals 18. These results were robust with dramatic increases in the likelihood ofbeing tested for HIV being observed across patient-level, provider-level and subfacility-level factors. Furthermore, the fraction of HIV test results that were positive remainedconstant (0.45%) and well within the range at which HIV testing costs less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year when societal benefits of testing are considered 6.We now report on the sustainability of this program during the twelve-month period after overall responsibility for the interventional program was transferred to preexisting clinicalmanagement, who chose to greatly deintensify the provider education campaign and other labor and time-intensive aspects of the intervention 18,35. Remarkably, we found that the rate of HIV testing continued to increase for patients making their first, second or third visits during the sustain- ability period. These results indicate that despite the de-emphasis of the provider education campaign, when thefrequency of medical contact is considered, the program 's impact on HIV testing rates was fully sustainable. The observation that overall testing rates declined was related tothe changing make-up of the study population as patients with their first through third visits accounted for 100% of the study population in month 1, 54% of the population in month 12 and41% of the population in month 24. We also found that the rate at which patients refused HIV testing decreased over time. Correspondingly, the likelihood ofhaving the HIV Testing Clinical Reminder being resolved by HIV testing increased. These results suggest that providers became more proficient at offering and discussing HIV testsand may have integrated HIV testing into their normalpractice. Others have observed that normalization of HIV testing is associated with increased patient acceptance of testing 36,37. The importance of reporting the sustainability of health care interventions and of choosing appropriate measurement metrics is receiving increasing attention32. Our results indicate that assessments of the sustainability of the outcome of an inter- vention are critically dependent on the mode of analysis. We found that when applied to homogeneous patient population (asdefined by prior use of VA healthcare), increased HIV testingrates were sustained after de-emphasis of the provider educa- tion campaign and continued to increase among patients newly exposed to the intervention (Fig. 2a). This suggests that our intervention has become part of the institutional culture of our facility, does not overburden providers and fits the implement- ing culture and variations of the patient population 32. Stratified analysis by the number of visits during each year reveals that our intervention was least sustained among established patients who had not previously been offeredtesting. We conclude that interventions that aim to maximize sustainability should consider a \"tail\"of provider education or other components focused on patients who do not receiverecommended services on the first exposure. Also, further workneeds to be done to determine the determinants of repeated non-performance. We believe that such failures are likely due to systemic barriers or a lack of provider agreement/knowledge.Notably, although theoretical 38-40and empirical observa- tions22,23,41-43demonstrate that the use of provider education (or activation) campaigns are necessary to transform groupnorms and maximize quality improvement, there is far less literature regarding the importance of maintaining these activ- ities to sustain whatever gains are achieved during their use 32. The strengths of our sustainability analysis include, as recommended, use of a time-series analysis of monthly rates of HIV testing which allowed us to better assess the trajectory of HIV testing rates32,44. Furthermore, we examined the effectiveness of the intervention in an unselected population of at-risk veterans receiving care in a routine, real-world clinical setting. Figure 3 . The vertical bars depict the adjusted rates at which patients with HIV risk factors underwent tests or were stated to refuse testing. The lines indicate the proportion of patients who were offered HIV testing and then underwent testing.1278 Goetz et al.: Sustainability of an HIV Testing Intervention JGIMLimitations include the fact that the sustainability analysis was done immediately after the withdrawal of study personnel from active maintenance of the intervention. It is thereforedifficult to distinguish between lingering improvements from the implementation and true persistence of effects from institutionalization 45. Moreover, this study was undertaken within the quality improvement infrastructure in the VA, which includes an electronic medical record, clinical reminder soft- ware and familiarity with performance measurements. Al-though such tools are increasingly common, this interventionmight not be generalizable to other healthcare systems. Another limitation is that while sustainability can be defined as continued use of the core elements of the interventions, andpersistence of improved performance 32, we did not formally evaluate the continued use of the core elements of the interventions or their individual contributions to the success-ful sustenance of the intervention. However, surveys of the two HCSs involved in this project indicate that the organizational changes that favor HIV testing and the HIV Testing ClinicalSoftware package have been maintained. Another limitation is that there was still room for improvement and it is unknown whether the rates of HIV testing would have increased furtherhad the provider activation campaign been continued. Fur-thermore, while guidelines now recommend that all patients be offered HIV testing and that yearly testing be offered to persons who continue to engage in high risk activities 14,46-48, this intervention was targeted to ensure one-time testing in patients with known risk factors. This strategy was purposely undertaken to prioritize testing for patients at the highestknown risk for HIV infection and in deference to concerns that a program to promote HIV testing in all patients would be impractical in the VA as long as written informed consent wasrequired for testing. Finally, the achieved rate of HIV testingremained less than desired. It will be important to determine the effect of removal of the written informed consent require- ment for VA HIV testing in August 2009 on the rates of HIVtesting 49. In conclusion, we found that when assessed in homoge- neous patient populations, the impact of implementation ofthe coordinated use of a computerized clinical reminder, feedback reports, provider education and organizational change is sustainable after cessation of external support ofthe provider education component. Maintenance of the gains after withdrawal of support by the research team suggests that the organizational and behavioral changes that led to theenhanced performance of HIV testing were successfully insti-tutionalized. These findings have substantial implications for the assessment and sustenance of quality improvements programs for clinical preventive services and beyond.

S. Ash, PhD; Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD Background :Racial and ethnic minorities generally re- ceive fewer medical interventions than whites, but ra-cial and ethnic patterns in Medicare expenditures and in-terventions may be quite different at life's end. Methods :Based on a random, stratified sample of Medi- care decedents (N=158 780) in 2001, we used regres-sion to relate differences in age, sex, cause of death, totalmorbidity burden, geography, life-sustaining interven-tions (eg, ventilators), and hospice to racial and ethnicdifferences in Medicare expenditures in the last 6 monthsof life. Results :In the final 6 months of life, costs for whites average $20 166; more). Similar differences existwithin sexes, age groups, all causes of death, all sites ofdeath, and within similar geographic areas. Differencesin age, sex, cause of death, total morbidity burden, ge-ography, socioeconomic status, and hospice use ac-count for 53% and 63% of the higher costs for blacks and Hispanics, respectively. While whites use hospice mostfrequently (whites, 26%; blacks, 20%; and Hispanics,23%), racial and ethnic differences in end-of-life expen-ditures are affected only minimally. However, fully 85%of the observed higher costs for nonwhites are ac-counted for after additionally modeling their greater end-of-life use of the intensive care unit and various inten-sive procedures (such as, gastrostomies, used by 10.5%of blacks, 9.1% of Hispanics, and 4.1% of whites). Conclusions :At life's end, black and Hispanic dece- dents have substantially higher costs than whites. Morethan half of these cost differences are related to geo-graphic, sociodemographic, and morbidity differences.Strikingly greater use of life-sustaining interventions ac-counts for most of the rest. Arch Intern Med. 2009;169(5):493-501 RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARI - ties pervade US healthcare. 1-9Many studies show blacks and Hispanics receiv- ing fewer medical services and spending less than whites. For ex-ample, minorities receive fewer cardiac pro-cedures, prescriptions for life-saving medi-cations, and narcotic medications for painrelief. Despite efforts by policy makers to ad-dress these disparities, they persist. 5,10At the end of life, however, this pattern may be re-versed. 11Several studies have found higher Medicare costs and service use for non-whites at life's end. 2,12-16These studies ex- amined differences in sociodemographic andgeographic factors as contributors to thesedisparities. Shugarman et al 14reported that in the 2 years before the last year of life,spending by blacks was significantly lower.However, in the last year, this deficit\"flipped\"; estimated final-year spending was19% higher for blacks than for whites(P=.10). They did not study Hispanics. In analyses restricted to Medicare Part A (hospital bills) and hospital referral re-gions (HRRs) with substantial numbers ofblacks, several studies by researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NewHampsire, have attributed most of black-white cost differences to geography: ba- sically, more blacks live in regions withhigh hospital use. 2,15However, even after geographic differences were controlledfor, costs in the last 6 months of life re-mained 29% higher for blacks than forwhites. 2 To better understand the racial differ- ences in end-of-life care and to extendcomparisons to Hispanics and other mi-norities, we constructed a national ran-dom sample of nearly 160 000 Medicaredecedents, oversampled for nonwhites. Wetallied all Medicare costs (Parts A and B)in the final 6 months of life and quanti-fied the effects on racial and ethnic costdifferences of a range of factors, includ-ing age, sex, preexisting comorbidities(from the penultimate 6 months), causeof death, geography, and socioeconomicindicators, as well as markers for conser-vative or aggressive use of end-of-life in-terventions (eg, hospice, intensive care unit[ICU], or ventilator use).

To ensure complete health and healthcare records, we required enrollment in \"traditional\" fee-for-service Medicare, for which services were individually billedthroughout 2000, with both Medicare Parts A and B entitle-ment (for inpatient and ambulatory care) continuously for 12months preceding death, as well as a positive match in the Na-tional Death Index. We excluded beneficiaries in the end-stage renal disease program and those residing in Puerto Ricoor other nonmainland territories, because care for these groupsis administered quite differently than for others in Medicare.After these exclusions, there were 158 780 decedents in the ana-lytic sample. The proportions excluded among Hispanics (55%)and others (47%) were much higher than among whites (24%)and blacks (32%), principally owing to the exclusion of resi-dents of Puerto Rico, to the high rates of non-National DeathIndex match for Hispanic decedents, and to the higher rates ofPart B coverage among whites. OUTCOMES Our primary outcome is total Medicare-covered health care ex-penditures at the end of life: specifically, in the 180 days (6months) preceding death. For each beneficiary, we added Medi-care-allowed payments for all covered services, including hos-pital and skilled nursing facility care, hospice and home healthservices, physician services, and durable medical equipment pur-chases. We also examined intermediate outcomes, such as totalcosts by type of service, and any use of hospice or selected life-sustaining procedures, such as ventilators. 11 OTHER VARIABLES Covariates included age, sex, race, total morbidity burden inthe penultimate 6 months of life, geographic location, andsocioeconomic status, as well as direct concurrent contribu-tors to, or proximate causes of, final 6-month costs, such ascause of death, hospice use, and receipt of specific, intensivelife-sustaining procedures. Age, sex, and race were obtainedfrom Medicare's denominator file, using its racial/ethnic cat-egories of white, black, and Hispanic, grouping everyone elseinto \"other,\" which included Asian (37%), North AmericanNatives and unknown (33%). Socioeco-nomic status was proxied by (1) median income of thepatient's zip code of residence, and (2) whether the patientreceived Medicaid assistance (buy-in) to pay Medicare Part Bpremiums. Morbidity burden was summarized using (1) theCharlson comorbidity score and (2) a Diagnostic Cost Groupprospective relative risk score (DxCG version 6.1 for SASWindows). Each score was based on International Classifica- tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9- CM), diagnoses recorded during the 6 months preceding the last 6 months of life. 17,18The Charlson score assigns points to 19 disease conditions; scores in these data range from 0 to 37.The DxCG software organizes all ICD-9-CM codes into 184 \"condition categories\" and summarizes their expected impacton future expenditures via a relative risk score (RRS); an RRSof 1.00 refers to average expected next-year expendituresamong all Medicare beneficiaries (not just decedents)observed for 1 year. Because the choice of morbidity measuredid not affect estimates of racial/ethnic differences, we report analyses using only the more predictive RRS. To see the effect of aggressive end-of-life care on differ- ences in expenditures, we used surgical procedure codes andother markers in the Medicare inpatient file during the last 6months to identify decedents with any (nonpsychiatric) ICUadmission, and each of 10 intensive life-sustaining interven-tions: cardiac catheterization, implantation of a cardiac assis-tance device, pulmonary artery wedge monitoring, cardiopul-monary resuscitation or cardiac conversion, gastrostomy, bloodtransfusions, dialysis, and use ventilators, intra-venous antibiotics, and cancer chemotherapies. 13We identi- fied these procedures using the clinical classifications soft-ware (CCS) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,excluding carotid sinus stimulation (code 99.64); finally, weidentified chemotherapy use from diagnoses and procedures,as described elsewhere. 19 We examined differences in expected costs by where decedents had lived, in 3 ways. First, we classified the countyof residence descriptively, using Beale rural-urban continuumcodes to distinguish \"metropolitan counties by size and non-metropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and proxim-ity to metropolitan areas.\" 20We also mapped the zip code of residence into Dartmouth Atlas-based HRRs and hospital ser-vice areas aggregations of more than3000 HSAs that distinguish geographic regions whose resi-dents access the same hospital(s) and physicians. 21We rely prin- cipally on models that use HSA (as so-called fixed effects in-dicators), because each HSA defines a small geographic clusterof persons who typically rely on the same hospital systems. Ina sensitivity analysis, we quantify the modest differences asso-ciated with coding place of residence by county, HRR, or HSA. ANALYSIS We used STATA version 9.2 for all analyses, which are weightedto adjust for oversampling of nonwhites. 22We summarized out- come and covariate variables for all Medicare decedents andcompared them by race and ethnic group (using /H9273 2and analy- sis of variance to test for differences). We used regression toestimate differences by race/ethnicity in total end-of-life ex-penditures after accounting for differences in covariates. Mod-els successively added covariate sets: age and sex only (modelB); underlying cause of death determined from death certifi-cates and morbidity (using RRSs) in the 6 months before thefinal 6 months (model C); geography (using HSAs, model D);socioeconomic status (model E); hospice use (model F); anduse of the ICU and 10 intensive procedures during the end-of-life period itself (model G). The order in which explanatoryvariables are added affects the size of the contribution attrib-uted to each. We first adjusted for pure patient characteristics(age, sex, and medical problems) and then for geographic andsocioeconomic indicators. We included geography early in thesequence to focus on differences by race among (otherwise simi-lar) persons who face the same health care delivery systems. 23 Finally, we examined differences in the use of specific ser-vices only after all these factors that might otherwise con-found associations between race and procedure use had beenaccounted for. For example, to the extent that nonwhites usemore aggressive interventions because they have the sameutilization patterns as their white neighbors, we wanted thatto be attributed to geography. By entering utilization vari-ables last, the estimated effects focus exclusively on cost dif-ferences that arise because nonwhites have different utiliza-tion patterns than their neighbors. We also explored theeffect of sequencing on the apparent importance of differentsets of variables.

All rights reserved.Because of large sample sizes, racial/ethnic differences are almost always statistically significant at the P/H11021.05 level. There- fore, we only explicitly remark on it when race and ethnic dif-ferences are not significant. RESULTS Among the 158 780 decedents, blacks and Hispanics were younger than whites and more often lived in metropoli-tan areas with a population of more than 1 million( Table 1 ). The cause of death was similar across racial groups. However, the site of death differed, with blacksand Hispanics dying more often than whites in hospi-tals and less often in nursing homes.DO EXPENDITURES DIFFER BY RACE AND ETHNICITY? Black and Hispanic decedents have significantly higher end-of-life Medicare Parts A and B expenditures thanwhites ( Table 2 ). White decedents average $20 166 in the last 6 months of blacks, $26 704 (32% more);and Hispanics, $31 702 (57% more). These racial dis-parities persist within strata defined by age, sex, morbidity-burden level, and cause and site of death. End-of-life ex-penditures for blacks are significantly higher than forwhites in almost every state ( Figure 1 ) and in cities as well as rural areas (Table 2). Interestingly, several south-eastern states have both the lowest overall spending andTable 1.

Spe-cifically, the average end-of-life expenditures in the larg-est metropolitan areas are $24 700 for all races; in areaswith population numbering 250 000 to 1 million, theyare $18 700; and in rural areas, they are $17 100.

Blacks' costs are $6538 higher than whites' costs; His-panics' $11 536 higher, and other minorities'costs are $5307 higher. Model B controls for age and sex. These 2 factors re- duce the cost differences between blacks and Hispanicsand whites by about 10%. Model C also controls for mor-bidity burden and cause of death and reduces these dif-ferences by another 7% to 9%, with nearly all of the re-duction attributable to morbidity burden. Using theCharlson index instead of the DCG morbidity measureproduced very similar reductions. Additionally accounting for place of residence by in- cluding HSAs in model D brings unexplained extra costsdown to only $2924 for blacks (together eliminating 55%of the raw difference for blacks), $3705 (eliminating 68%of the raw difference) for Hispanics, and $2103 (elimi-nating 60%) for decedents of other races. Using eitherHRR or county as the geographic unit instead of HSA inmodel D yields similar findings. Adding socioeconomicindicators (zip code, median income, and Medicaid buy-in) yields very modest further reductions in cost differ-ences by race and ethnicity (model E). In total, between55% and 68% of the raw differences in end-of-life ex-penditures between whites and the other 3 groups areaccounted for by differences in demographics, morbid-ity, geography, and socioeconomic indicators, with ge-ography contributing the largest part. HOW MUCH OF THE REMAINING COST DISPARITY IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY SPECIFIC END-OF-LIFE INTERVENTIONS? Most of the remaining racial and ethnic differences in end- of-life costs can be attributed to differences in the use ofhospital-based, life-sustaining interventions ( Table 4 ). Blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely to beadmitted to the ICU (32.5% for blacks, 39.6% for His-panics, and 27.0% for whites). Minorities also receive sig-nificantly more intensive procedures, such as resuscita-tion and cardiac conversion (4.4% of blacks, 4.0% ofHispanics, and 2.7% of whites), mechanical ventilation(18.0% blacks, 21.0% Hispanics, and 11.6% whites), andgastrostomy for artificial nutrition (10.5% blacks, 9.1%Hispanics, and 4.1% whites). In contrast, whites areslightly more likely to receive inpatient cancer chemo-therapy (7.9%) than either blacks (7.6%) or Hispanics(7.4%) and are more likely than blacks, but not Hispan-ics, to receive cardiac catheterization, cardiac balloonassistance devices, and pulmonary artery pressuremeasurements. 5,9 Hospice is used more frequently by whites (26%) than blacks (20%) or Hispanics (23%) and is associated withan average reduction in end-of-life expenditures of $784per beneficiary overall (model F, Table 3). However, dif-ferential hospice use has essentially no effect on racialand ethnic differences in end-of-life costs (model F). Finally, controlling for the use of all 10 life- sustaining interventions, such as ICU admissions, ven-tilators, and gastrostomies (model G), eliminates morethan half of the remaining differences between whites andeach of the other groups (Table 3). Of the original $6538excess cost for black over white decedents, only $997 (15%) remains after this final adjustment, while for His-panics, only $1902 (16%) of the original $11 536 costs over whites remains \"unexplained.\" Most ofthe life-sustaining interventions are associated with strik-ingly higher total costs. For example, among otherwisesimilar persons, those who use the ICU cost $12 000 morethan those who do not; the use of gastrostomy adds$22 800, and mechanical ventilation adds $15 200. COMMENT This study of nearly 160 000 Medicare decedents and theirtotal Medicare (Parts A and B) costs in the last 6 monthsof life shows substantial differences by race and ethnic-ity. While there are differences in the magnitude of theircost differences with whites, all 3 groups of nonwhite de-cedents are similar to whites in their causes of death, butthey incur substantially higher Medicare expenditures.In each group, before differences in specific services usedare considered, the largest part (between 38% and 58%across the 3 nonwhite groups) of the total excess cost overwhites is explained by geography. After all other factorsare controlled for, the use of aggressive end-of-life in-terventions, such as ICU care, ventilators, and gastros-tomies, accounts for between 21% and 33% of the dif-ference in total end-of-life costs. Differences in hospiceuse contribute little to racial and ethnic differences in totalend-of-life costs, both because estimated savings from hos-pice are small (less than $800) and because differencesin use by race are modest (20% for blacks, 23% for His-panics, and 26% for whites). Using a large and nationally representative sample that linked Medicare data with cause-of-death data from theNational Death Index, this study confirms and extendsfindings regarding black-white differences in costs at theend of life. Raw costs of health care in the last 6 monthsof life are 32% higher for black Medicare beneficiariesthan those for white decedents. Our findings contrast withthose of numerous non-end-of-life studies in which mi-norities received fewer services and especially fewer tech-nologically intensive interventions. 1-10Medicare expen-4550 3540 202530 15 25 20 15 30 35 40 45 50 Spending by Blacks, \u00d7 $1000 Figure 1.

All rights reserved.ditures for Hispanics were even higher: fully 57% higher than for whites. Because racial and ethnic differences in cause of death are minimal, they do not contribute to racial differencesin end-of-life costs. However, geography is very impor-tant, whether measured as HRR, HSA, or county of resi-dence. Blacks and Hispanics are far more likely than whitesto live in large urban areas, where medical care in gen-eral, and end-of-life care in particular, is more expen-sive than in smaller cities and rural areas. In part, Medi-care costs for black and Hispanic decedents are higherbecause more of them live and die in higher-cost loca-tions. However, even within the same geographic loca-tions, black and Hispanic decedents have notably higherend-of-life Medicare costs than their white neighbors. Incontrast to previous studies, our method of using indi-cators for each geographic unit instead of area-level mea-sures, such as county hospital beds and physician sup-ply, adjusts not only for measured geographical factorsrelated to variations in practice patterns but also for un-known, and therefore unmeasured, factors. 2,23 Despite the cumulative importance of age, sex, cause of death, geography, morbidity burden, and socioeconomicstatus on decedent costs, 45% of the excess costs for blacksand 32% of the excess costs for Hispanics are not ex-plained by these factors. Most of this residual difference isaccounted for by more end-of-life ICU admissions and life-sustaining interventions for nonwhites. Black Medicare de-cedents are significantly more likely to receive resuscita-tion, mechanical ventilation, and gastrostomy for artificialfeedings than are white decedents, even when they residein the same HSA or county. 11Hispanics are even more likely than blacks to receive ICU care, mechanical ventilation, di-alysis, and cardiac catheterization. While black, Hispanic, and other minority decedents receive more intensive life-sustaining interventions at theend of life, blacks receive less cancer chemotherapy, car-diac catheterization, and other aggressive cardiac inter- ventions, such as balloon assistance devices, than whites.The lower level of cardiac and oncologic interventionsfor blacks may be because such interventions require ac-cess to subspecialists\u2014oncologists and cardiologists\u2014with whom blacks may have fewer prior relationships.It is not clear why the same is not true for Hispanics. In-deed, why blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities re-ceive so much more of many intensive, life-sustaining in-terventions now emerges as an important area for furtherresearch. Differences in the use of aggressive end-of-life inter- ventions may reflect patient preferences. 24-26Some stud- ies have found minorities to be (1) more reluctant thanwhites to have do-not-resuscitate orders, (2) more likelyto prefer life-sustaining treatments at the end-of-life, and(3) less likely to use hospice. 27-35Such differences in pref- erences and use of high-technology interventions at theend of life are in contrast with other life stages, in whichwhites get more intensive interventions. 10Even if such racial preferences are real, they are not a \"first cause\";they raise important policy issues. Are health care resources for nonwhites misallocated over a lifetime, with racial and ethnic minorities receiv-ing fewer life-extending and life-enhancing interven-tions than whites throughout their lives 1-10but more at the end, when there is less opportunity to improve thequantity and quality of life? Perhaps the use of aggres-sive, hospital-based interventions at the end of life is awell-considered preference. However, even if such in-terventions are a choice, the decision to use them maystem less from settled views than from distrust of the medi-cal care system or from economic constraints. 10Non- whites who receive timely, effective care throughout theirlives may find it easier to reject cardiac resuscitation, me-chanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition at the end. 36,37 We also know that blacks receive lower-quality primary121416 810 4 26 0 4 5 61.41.92.11.8 1.72.22.6 2.1 2.02.73.1 2.4 2.53.54.0 3.13.75.26.0 4.88.911.113.9 11.3 321 No. of Months Before Death Average Medicare Expenditure, \u00d7 $1000White Black Hispanic Other Figure 2.

Indeed, we found in this Medi-care population that more primary care visits just be-fore the last 6 months of life are associated with lowercosts and less hospital use at the end of life. 41 This study has limitations. First, the Medicare claims files contain few clinical descriptors. The findings maynot generalize to Medicare managed care, to patients with-out Medicare coverage, or to patients who do not self-identify as black or Hispanic. Previous work has indi- cated that sensitivity of Medicare data in identifyingminorities is good for blacks but less so for Hispanics. 42 But specificity (the proportion of identified minorities cor-rectly classified) is high for both. The Hispanic effect thatwe found on end-of-life costs pertains directly only tomainland Hispanics identified as such in Medicare's da-tabase. Percentage reductions in racial and ethnic ex-penditure differences attributed to individual covariatesare only rough guides to their relative importance, es-pecially because how a variable affects a model dependson what other factors have previously been accountedTable 3.

Nonetheless, the primacy of \"geography\" and \"ag- gressive interventions\" in accounting for differences inend-of-life costs is a robust finding. Medicare expendi-tures do not capture all health care expenditures, espe-cially pharmaceuticals and long-term nursing home costs,which may displace some hospital care. Medicare dataalso do not capture the resources expended by privateor government supplemental insurers or financial or in-kind support from families. 43Importantly, we had no di- rect data on patient preferences for the various interven-tions at the end of life. While the models control for mostother variables known to influence medical service use\u2014age, sex, race, geography, cause of death, and morbidityburden\u2014patient preference, overt or covert racism in howthe same providers treat patients, and differences in whichproviders and systems of care are accessed might all con-tribute to these differences in health care system use atthe end of life. In conclusion, blacks and Hispanics die of similar causes, but the costs involved in their last 6 months oflife are substantially higher than those of whites. Al-though 40% to 60% of these excess differences are asso-ciated with geography, ie, living in high-medical-expenditure areas, substantial differences remain, evenafter adjustment for many patient characteristics in ad-dition to geographic variables. Strikingly higher rates ofuse of intensive end-of-life treatments such as ICU andventilators account for most of these residual differ-ences. Therefore, at life's end, minorities often receivemore expensive but not necessarily life-enhancing care.It is unclear how much of this was actively sought, orthe extent to which racial and ethnic differences are prin-cipally driven by how choices are presented or how theyare \"heard.\" These would be fruitful questions for fu-ture research.

Kressin, PhD, and Said A. Ibrahim, MD, MPH Amidst national efforts to understand and eliminate pervasive racial and ethnic health disparities,1,2research has documented the del- eterious effects of perceived racial or ethnic discrimination on the health of patients. There is strong and consistent evidence that patients who perceive racial or ethnic discrimination are atgreater risk for poor health, as dened by a hostof health outcomes (e.g., mortality, depression,self-assessed health status) and health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, substance abuse). 1-7 Moreover, racial or ethnic discrimination that occurs specically within health care settings isassociated with poorer health status, lower pa- tient satisfaction with care, and, in some cases, less health care utilization. 3,8-15 To support the development of targeted interventions to reduce instances of discrimi- nation and minimize the negative consequences of perceived discrimination for those most at risk, it is necessary to identify vulnerable patientpopulations or health care settings in whichpatients are more likely to perceive discrimina-tion. A higher prevalence of perceived racialdiscrimination in health care settings has al-ready been found in some patient populations, such as racial/ethnic minorities and those who have limited economic resources. 3,12,16-19 We examined rates of perceived discrimina- tion for another patient population: military veterans. Veterans are a minority population (about 10% of US adults20) with unique health care needs. Not only do those serving in the military face substantial physical and psycholog- ical challenges that put their health at risk, but those who have served also become part of aculture of veterans that can shape the way theyinteract with the health care system. 21-23One way to gauge whether the health care system adequately adapts to the needs of this patient population is to compare reports of perceived discrimination in health care among veterans and nonveterans. We also compared the prevalence of per- ceived racial discrimination in health careamong veterans who received health care from the Veterans Affairs (VA) health caresystem with veterans who received care out-side of this system. Unique features of the VAhealth care system make it an interestingsetting in which to examine rates of perceiveddiscrimination. The VA patient population includes a disproportionate number of pa- tients who belong to racial and socioeconomic groups that are at increased risk of experi-encing discrimination. 24,25This might suggest that perceived racial discrimination would be more prevalent among VA patients than among others. However, the VA has undertaken sub- stantial efforts in recent years to improve itsdelivery of health care, including addressing potential racial/ethnic disparities in care. 26-28 These changes have yielded extraordinary im- provements across a variety of quality indica-tors, 29making the VA a model health care system both nationally and internationally.30-32 These developments might suggest that patientsin the VA health care system would be less likelythan would other patients to perceive racial discrimination. We explored potential differ- ences in perceived racial discrimination amongVA and other patient populations with data from a national survey. METHODS We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national telephone survey conducted annually to mon- itor health conditions and risk behaviors of US adults.33It uses state-level sampling plans and data weights to obtain a sample that repre- sents the population of households with tele- phones within each state. Complete BRFSS data les are publicly available on the BRFSSWeb site. 33We analyzed 2004 BRFSS data from the District of Columbia and states (Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Mississippi, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) that administered the optional Reactions to Race module, whichincluded a question about whether respondentsperceived racial discrim ination while seeking health care in the past 12 months. Measures The outcome of interest was perceived racial discrimination in health care, whichObjectives. We compared rates of perceived racial discrimination in health care settings for veteran and nonveteran patients and for veterans who used the Veterans Affairs health care system and those who did not. Methods . Data were drawn from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We used logistic regression to examine whether perceived racial dis-crimination in health care was associated with veteran status or use of VeteransAffairs health care, after adjusting for patient characteristics. Results . In this sample of 35902 people, rates of perceived discrimination were equal for veterans and nonveterans (3.4% and 3.5%, Among veterans (n=3420), perceived discrimination was more prevalent among patients who used Veterans Affairs facilities than among those who did not (5.4% vs 2.7%; OR=2.08; 95% CI=1.04, 4.18). However, this difference after adjustment for patient characteristics (OR=1.30; 95% CI=0.54, 3.13). Conclusions . Perceived racial discrimination in health care was equally prev- alent among veterans and nonveterans and among veterans who used theVeterans Affairs health care system and those who did not.

Possible responseswere worse than other races; the same asother races; better than other races; worse thansome races, better than others; and only en-countered people of the same race. We excluded the latter 2 responses from our analyses be- cause relatively few people chose these re-sponses (0.3% each) and they did not unam- biguously indicate the presence or absence ofdiscrimination. ''Worse than other races'' re-sponses were coded as having experienceddiscrimination. Responses of ''the same as otherraces'' and ''better than other races'' were coded as not having experienced discrimination. The primary predictors were veteran status and whether veteran respondents used VA medical facilities in the past12 m onths. Veteran status was assessed with the yes or no item, ''Have you everserved on active duty in the United States Armed Forces, either in the regular military or in aNational Guard or militar y reserve unit?'' Re- spondents who answered yes were asked whetherthey were currently on active duty or in a NationalGuard or reserve unit, ret ired from military ser- vice, medically discharged from military service, or discharged from military service. To assess VAhealth care utilization, veterans were asked, ''In thelast 12 months have you received some or all ofyour health care from VA facilities?'' Possible answers were yes, all; yes, some; and no VA healthcare received. Analyses o f VA health care utiliza- tion included the subsamp le of veteran patients who reported receiving all or none of their medicalcare from VA facilities; those who received somecare from the VA (n=422) were excluded be-c a u s ew ec o u l dn o td e t e r m i n ew h e t h e rh e a l t hc a r ediscrimination reported by these patients occurred in VA or non-VA settings. Respondents who were on active duty or in a National Guard or reserveunit were also excluded from these analysesbecause they were not eligible to receive healthcare at VA medical facilities.

Race/ethnicity was cate- gorized as White, African American, Hispanic, other (Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacic Islander, American Indian, or Alaska Native), or multiple (more than 1 racial/ethnic group). Other andmultiple racial/ethnic groups were excludedfrom the analyses because of the relatively smallsize of these groups (3.2% and 1.4% of respon-dents, respectively) and because their heteroge-neity made drawing conclusions difcult. Racial salience was included because it has been shown to be positively associated with perceptions of racial discrimination. 3It was assessed by the item, ''How often do you think about your race?'' Possible responses were never, once a year, once a month, once a week, once a day, once an hour, and constantly. Responseswere collapsed into 3 categories: once a month or less, once a week, and once a day or more. Health care coverage was assessed with the yesor no item, ''Do you have any kind of health carecoverage, including health insurance, prepaidplans such as HMOs, or government plans suchas Medicare?'' Affordability of medical care wasassessed with the yes or no item, ''Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of the cost?'' Self-reported hea lth status was assessed with the item, ''Would you say that in generalyour health is excellent, very good, good, fair, orpoor?'' Responses were dichotomized into ex-cellent, very good, or good versus fair or poor. Statistical Analyses We summarized respondent characteristics for veterans and nonveterans and compared them using the c2test. We used logistic regression models to estimate the crude association betweenveteran status and the prevalence of perceived racial discrimination, and to estimate the associa- tion after adjusting for respondent characteristics. We conducted similar analyses on the sub- sample of veteran respondents, with VA healthcare utilization as the primary predictor. Specif- ically, we compared respondent characteristics for those who used VA medical facilities withthose who did not. We then used logistic re-gression models to estimate the crude and ad- justed associations between VA utilization andperceived racial discrimination. To explore whether the associations be- tween veteran status or VA utilization andperceived racial discrimination varied acrossracial/ethnic groups, we ran additionalmodels to test for interactions between race/ ethnicity and veteran status, as well as be- tween race/ethnicity and VA utilization. Theseinteractions were not signicant and are notreported here.TABLE 1\u2014 Continued Rhode Island 4.5 5.1 District of Columbia 22.4 18.2Wisconsin 22.3 25.0 Note.

In all analyses, we incorporated the BRFSS weighting and design variables into the models with Stata/IC version 10.0 for Win- dows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). RESULTS The study sample included 35902 respon- dents, who represented 15865750 people when data were weighted to reflect state popu- lations. Veterans and nonveterans differed sig- nicantly ( P<.001) on almost all background characteristics (Table 1). For example, veterans were more likely than were nonveterans to be White (84.5% versus 79.3%) and male (93.1%versus 40.6%) and to have health care coverage(90.8% versus 84.1%). Veterans were also sig-nicantly older: 32.5% of veterans and 13.5%of nonveterans were older than 65 years. Analyses comparing veteran VA health care users and nonusers included a subsample of 3420 respondents, who represented 1547552 people when data weights were applied (Table2). VA users and nonusers differed signicantly(P<.04) on the majority of background char- acteristics. VA users were more likely thanwere nonusers to be African American (22.9%versus 10.0%), Hispanic (3.9% 2.2%),and middle aged (23.4% aged 45-54 years, and 30.9% versus aged years). also dif- signicantly from nonusers on severalvariables indicative of socioeconomic status.VA users had lower incomes than did nonusers(20.4% versus 4.9% had annual incomes be-low $15000), were less educated (1 1.6% versus 5.7% did not nish high school), were less likely to have health care coverage (81.9%versus 91.5%), and were more likely to reporthaving to forgo medical care because of cost(12.0% versus 8.6%). VA users were also more likely than were nonusers to report fair or poor health status (37.8% versus 16.1%). Perceived racial discrimination in health care was reported by 3.4% of veterans and 3.5%of nonveterans. This difference was not characteristics(OR=0.92; 95% CI=0.66, 1.28; Table 3). In the adjusted model, higher odds of perceived discrimination were signicantly associated with African American race, greater racial salience,male gender, younger age, an annual income ofless than $15000, having a high school diploma,having to forgo medical care because of cost,and fair or poor health status (Table 3). In the veterans subsample, reports of per- ceived racial discrimination in health care were signicantly more common among VA usersthan nonusers (5.4% versus 2.7%; P<.03). In a model that did not take into account additional respondent characteristics, veterans who re-ceived health care from the VA were 2.08 (95%CI=1.04, 4.18) times as likely to report per-ceived racial discrimination as veterans whoreceived health care from non-VA facilities (Ta-ble 4). After we controlled for respondent char- acteristics, however, the likelihood of reporting perceived discrimination was not signicantly different for VA users and nonusers (OR=1.30;95% CI=0.54, 3.13). In the adjusted analysis,higher odds of perceived discrimination weresignicantly associated with African Americanrace, greater racial salience (thinking about raceonce a day or more), age (25-34 years), anannual income of less than $15000, and fair or poor health status (Table 4). DISCUSSION We used data from a national survey to ex- amine whether rates of perceived racial discrim- i n a t i o ni nh e a l t hc a r ev a r i e da c r o s sd i f f e r e n t patient populations and health care settings. Spe- cically, we compared the prevalence of per- ceived discrimination among veterans and non- veterans and among veterans who received carein VA and non-VA health care systems. We foundthat rates of perceived racial discrimination inhealth care were low overall and did not differ forveterans and nonveterans. To our knowledge, thisis the rst study to compare rates of perceived racial discrimination in health care for veterans and nonveterans. Our ndings suggest that, de-spite the unique experiences and health careneeds of veterans, those who have served in themilitary are not more likely to perceive racialdiscrimination in health care settings. We also found that, in the subsample of veterans who were eligible to receive health care from VA medical facilities, veterans who received all of their care in the VA system weretwice as likely to report perceptions of racial discrimination in the health care setting thanwere veterans who received their care outsideof the VA system. This difference, however,was eliminated after we controlled for differ-ences in patient characteristics, such as race, indicators of socioeconomic status, access to health care, and health status. Our ndings are consistent with 2 previous studies that found no differences in rates ofTABLE 2\u2014 Continued Cost of medical care prohibitive in past 12 mo .04 No 88.0 91.4 Yes 12.0 8.6 Health status <.001 Excellent, very good, or good 62.2 83.9 Fair or poor 37.8 16.1 State <.001 Arkansas 18.2 11.8Colorado 14.0 21.5Delaware 3.5 4.4District of Columbia 3.4 1.7Mississippi 15.9 10.4 Rhode Island 4.2 4.5South Carolina 26.8 21.3 Wisconsin 14.0 24.5 Note.

American Journal of Public Health |July 2009, Vol 99, No. 7perceived racial discrimination in health care between VA users and nonusers.13,34The issue of perceived racial discrimination among vet- erans received national attention when a report was released in 2007 indicating that more than 50% of African American veterans could recall asituation in which they experienced discrimina-tion wherever they received health care services,in either VA or non-VA facilities. 34Although the overall rate of perceived discrimination docu- mented in that study was much higher than in our study, that report found no differences in perceived discrimination between veterans whoreceived care at VA facilities and those who didnot. The earlier report was greatly limited by itsreliance on a small convenience sample of 141A f r i c a nA m e r i c a nv e t e r a n sw i t h i nas i n g l eg e o - graphic location. Another study examined the prevalence of racial discrimination in health care among patients drawn from university, community,and VA clinics. 13Although examining the prev- alence of discrimination across different health care settings was not the focus of the study, the authors reported that the prevalence of per- ceived racial discrimination was not signicantly different among those recruited from VA clinics than among those from university or communityclinics. That study was limited by its inclusion ofpatients from only 3 VA facilities and 2 non-VAhealth care systems; it also did not account for thepossibility that patients received care from morethan 1 health care system. Our study, which used data from a national survey and included respondents from several states, provided more robust evidencethat the prevalence of racial discrimination inhealth care settings does not differ betweenveterans and nonveterans or between patientswho receive care at VA facilities and thosewho do not, once differences in characteristics of VA users and nonusers are taken into account. Although we found signicantlyhigher odds of perceived discrimination among VA users than among nonusers in unadjustedanalyses, this difference was likely attributableto the higher prevalence of patient character-istics that put patients at higher risk of dis-crimination (e.g., minority race and lower so- cioeconomic status) among VA users rather than to systemic differences between VA andnon-VA health care settings that increased thelikelihood of discriminatory experiences.

Our study had several limitations. Because only a subset of states administered the Reac- tions to Race module that we analyzed, oursample was not representative of the entire USpopulation. Furthermore, although the study sample was representative of the states from which respondents were drawn, it was notrepresentative of veterans within those states. The ndings may therefore not be generaliz-able to the entire population of US veterans,nor was it possible to assess potential nation-wide geographic differences in perceived dis-crimination with the available BRFSS data. Another limitation was that the BRFSS survey only assessed perceived r acial discrimination in health care. It is possible that other types ofperceived discriminat ion are more common in VA than in non-VA settings. For example, 1 studyfound that gender discrim ination in health care was more commonly reported among women recruited from VA facilities than among those recruited from non-VA facilities. 13It is also possi- ble that veterans who receive care in non-VA settings may be more likely to perceive discrim- ination related to their veteran status than are t h o s ew h or e c e i v ec a r ei nt h eV A ,b u tw ec o u l dnot examine this possibility within this data set. Finally, our focus on discrimination in VA and non-VA settings represented a crude attempt to examine whether discrimination varied across different types of health care settings; infor-mation that would allow a more in-depth ex-ploration of features of specic settings orfacilities in which discrimination was perceived most often was not available. Future studiesshould examine whether rates of perceiveddiscrimination are associated with additional features of health care settings, such as location, size, or the proportion of racial/ethnic minorityor female providers. Our study used the best available data to explore whether rates of perceived racial discrim-ination in health care var ied among veterans and nonveterans and among veterans treated in VAand non-VA settings. Our ndings of signicant differences in unadjusted rates of perceived dis- crimination between vete rans treated in VA set- tings and those treated in other settings suggestthat the VA serves a special patient population thatTABLE 4\u2014Crude and Adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of Perceived Racial Discrimination in Health Care Among Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System Users and Nonusers: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2004 Reported Discrimination, % Crude ORa(95% CI) Adjusted ORb(95% CI) VA health care utilization VA user 5.4 2.08 (1.04, 4.18) 1.30 (0.54, 3.13) VA nonuser (Ref) 2.7 1.00 1.00 Race/ethnicity White (Ref) 1.6 1.00 (1.70, 2.0 1.00 1.00 wk 4.1 2.11 (0.80, 11.5 6.46 (3.67, 11.39) 2.57 (1.02, 6.49) Gender Women 1.00 Men 3.1 0.98 (0.42, 2.29) 2.10 2.05 (1.02, 4.12) 4.99)55-64 3.2 1.96 (1.03, 3.73) 1.93 (0.77, 4.85) 65 (Ref) 1.7 1.00 1.00 Income, $ < 15 000 9.0 6.40 (2.77, 14.78) 3.55 (1.26, 10.0) 15 2.93 1.33 (0.47, 3.4 2.28 999 2.6 1.71 (0.72, 1.21 (0.45, 3.25)> 50 000 (Ref) 1.5 1.00 Education < High school 2.9 1.56 (0.55, 4.44) 0.83 (0.17, 3.96)High school graduate 4.2 2.33 (1.22, 4.44) 1.83 (0.78, 4.29) Some college 3.3 1.82 (0.91, 3.65) 1.26 (0.49, 3.24) College degree (Ref) 1.9 1.00 1.00 Health care coverage Yes (Ref) 2.6 1.00 1.00No 8.5 3.55 (1.79, 7.01) 0.85 (0.37, 1.93) Cost of medical care prohibitive in past 12 mo No (Ref) 2.4 1.00 1.00Yes 9.9 4.44 (2.47, 7.99) 1.82 (0.77, 4.33) Health status Excellent, very good, or good (Ref) 2.4 1.00 1.00Fair or poor 6.2 2.64 (1.61, Note.

Introduction Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in the relationship between literacy and health outcomes. Health literacy is dened as ''the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions'' [1]. Limited health literacy has been associated with poverty, limited educa- tion, minority status, immigration, and older age [2]. In a nationally representative household survey of 19,000 adults, it was estimated that 36% of the U.S. adult population have limited health literacy skills [2]. A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that adults with limited health literacy have less knowledge of disease self-management and health-promoting behaviors, report poorerhealth status, are less likely to use preventive services, are more likely to be hospitalized, and have worse health outcomes for certain chronic conditions [1]. It has been hypothesized that the relationship between health literacy and medication adherence may mediate the effect on specic health outcomes. However, several adult studies assessing the relationship between health literacy and adherence have produced varied results [3-9] . Some studies suggest worse adherence among individuals with limited health literacy [9]; others report no association [7]or even better adherence [4]. Few studies have assessed the relationship between caregiver health literacy and child health outcomes. Limited caregiver literacy skills have been associated with poorer pediatric outcomes in asthma and diabetes [10,11] ; however, few data are available regarding caregiver health literacy and medication adherence in children. As part of a larger randomized controlled trial, we had the opportunity to assess the impact of caregiver health literacy on adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants. Reducing iron deciency among vulnerable populations is one of the objectives of Healthy People 2010 [12], with toddlers being one of the sub-populations of particular concern. Based uponPatient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 376-380 ARTICLE INFO Article history: Received 23 September 2008 Received in revised form 9 March 2009 Accepted 18 March 2009 Keywords: Health literacyMedication adherenceIron deciencyABSTRACT Objective: To determine whether or not limited caregiver health literacy is associated with adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants.Methods: 110 caregiver/infant dyads were enrolled in a prospective study to assess the relationship between caregiver health literacy and adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen for infants. Households were contacted biweekly over a 3-month period. Adherence was based upon caregiverreport. High adherence, our primary outcome, was dened as the administration of the multi-vitamin with iron on 5-7 days over the past week. Results: As measured by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), 18% of caregivers had limited health literacy skills. Caregivers with limited health literacy skills were morelikely to have higher adherence than caregivers with adequate health literacy, after adjusting for a number of possible confounding variables (AOR = 2.13; 95% 1.20-3.78). Conclusion: Caregivers with limited health literacy were twice as likely to report high adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants as caregivers with adequate health literacy in adjusted analysis. Practice implications: Health literacy may exert a differential influence on adherence depending upon the complexity of the desired health behavior. /C2232009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2009.03.016NHANES IV data (1999-2002), the prevalence of iron deciency among U.S. children aged 1-3 years is estimated to be 8% [13]. Children in lower socioeconomic and minority groups have disproportionately high rates of iron deciency [14], with some studies reporting rates of almost 20% [15,16] . Iron deciency anemia has been associated with lower cognitive test scores in numerous studies [17,18] and several studies have demonstrated a persistence of poorer cognitive outcomes at school-age and adolescence [17,19,20] . Both limited health literacy and iron deciency are associated with many of the same risk factors such as poverty, lower parental education, and minority status [2,17] . Iron deciency anemia in infants has been found to be negatively associated with both level of maternal knowledge of anemia and adherence to iron supplementation [21]; this provides theoretical support for an association between caregiver health literacy and adherence to iron supplementation in infants. This study sought to determine whether or not limited caregiver health literacy was associated with adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants. It was hypothesized that infants of caregivers with limited health literacy skills would demonstrate poorer adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron supplement than infants of caregivers with adequate health literacy skills. 2. Methods This study assessed the association between caregiver health literacy and adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants as part of a randomized controlled trial designed to compare levels of adherence among two different multi-vitamin with iron formulations. Adherence was based upon caregiver report and was collected bi-weekly over a 3-month study period. At each follow-up visit, caregivers were asked, '' On how many days in the past week did you give (child's name) the drops/sprinkles ?'' Approval and monitoring for this study was provided through the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Caregivers provided written informed consent for themselves and their infant. 2.1. Sample As part of the larger randomized controlled trial, caregivers of healthy infants, aged 5-7 months, were recruited during their 6- month well child visits at two urban pediatric primary care clinics. Caregiver/infant dyads were randomized to receive one of two formulations of a daily multi-vitamin with iron supplement - either a commonly used liquid formulation or a ''sprinkles'' formulation which is mixed into a baby's solid food. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish, depending on caregiver preference. Exclusion criteria included a history of conditions associated with iron deciency or anemia, use of vitamin or iron supplements within the month prior to enrollment, prematurity, multiple gestations, or low birthweight ( <2500 g). Enrollment for the prospective trial began in June 2005 and continued until March 2006. Of the 150 families who were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial, 40 did not complete the health literacy screen; of these 14 (35%) had completed the study prior to June 2005 when literacy screening was introduced, 20 (50%) were lost to follow-up or withdrew prior to completing the health literacy screen, and six (15%) had missing health literacy data. The cohort for the current analysis included data from the remaining 110 families ( Fig. 1 ). There were no signicant differences between the 110 caregivers who completed the health literacy screen and 40 who did not on the following caregiver variables: age, gender, education level, race/ethnicity, and child's health insurance type.However, compared to caregivers who did not complete the health literacy screen, those who completed the screen were more likely to be born outside of the U.S. (66% vs. 44%; p= 0.01). 2.2. Data collection Baseline data including demographic information, dietary history, and anthropomorphic measurements were collected via a closed-ended orally administered survey. Bilingual research assistants also provided caregivers with oral and written instructions on how to administer the multi-vitamin with iron supplement. Written instructions were provided in English and Spanish and were written at less than a 5th grade reading level. Research assistants contacted caregivers on a biweekly basis over a 3-month period between their child's 6-month and 9-month well-child visits, for a total of six possible assessment points. Contact with caregivers alternated between telephone calls andhome visits. A closed-ended survey was orally administered to the caregiver at each point of contact and included questions regarding the infant's adherence to the multi-vitamin and iron regimen, easeof administration, and side effects. Attempts were made to collect all survey information from a single caregiver, but this was not always possible .The health literacy screen was administered in- person during one of the home visits or at the 9-month well child check-up, depending on when the research assistants had more time. Families received an additional supply of drops or sprinkles packets during the home visits. A closed-ended survey was administered to caregivers at the end of the study to inquire about any concerns regarding the use of the multi-vitamin with iron supplements. 2.3. Measures Health literacy, the primary independent variable, was measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), a 36-item reading comprehension test [22]. The S-TOFHLA consists of two medically related passages with keywords missing. Utilizing a modied Cloze procedure, subjects select the appropriate word for each omitted word from a list of four choices. The S-TOHFLA has good internal consistency (Cronbach's a= 0.97) and is well correlated with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (Spearman correlation 0.81) and the full Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (Spearman correlation 0.91), two other measures of health literacy [23]. It is available in English and Spanish. S-TOFHLA scores are categorized as ''adequate'', ''marginal'', and ''inadequate'', based upon standardized cut-off values [22,23] . Prior to analysis, limited health literacy was dened as scores in the ''marginal'' or ''inadequate'' range; adequate health literacy was dened as scores in the ''adequate'' range. Fig. 1. Flowchart for study enrollment.L.K. Hironaka et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 376-380 377Adherence, our primary outcome, was measured by caregiver report and dened as high adherence (yes vs. no) for administra- tion of the multi-vitamin with iron supplement on 5-7 days of the preceding week [24]. Other independent covariates were evaluated for inclusion in multivariate models based upon theoretical evidence of possible confounding. These included caregiver age (years), caregiver gender (female or male), caregiver country of birth (US or non- US), language of S-TOFHLA administration (English or Spanish), child's health insurance (public or private), child's race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, White/other), duration of time in the study (interview number), caregiver concerns regarding the multi- vitamins (yes or no), side effects (dark stools, constipation, stained teeth, diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain), and randomized assignment to drops or sprinkles. 2.4. Analyses Bivariate chi-square tests of independence and differences of means t-tests were utilized to compare socio-demographic variables with caregiver health literacy levels. As each family contributed between one and six assessments of adherence, generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an exchangeable variance-covariance matrix was used in all analyses of adherence [25]. GEE regression adjusts for a variable number of observations per subject as well as for the correlation between observations contributed by a single subject. First, to evaluate the association between health literacy and high adherence, a simple GEE logistic regression model was performed. An evaluation of a potential interaction between health literacy and interview number was not found to be signicant, so an interaction term was not included in the following model. A GEE multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between high adherence and caregiver health literacy, adjusted for possible confounders. Caregiver age, gender, language of S-TOFHLA administration, insurance type, and interview number were excluded from the nal model because they were determined not to be confounders. Caregiver country of birth was highly concordant with health literacy and was not included in the nal model. The nal model contained the following variables: health literacy, randomization assignment, race/ethnicity, and, caregiver education. Additional analyses were then performed to assess the possibility of confounding by caregiver concerns regarding the multi-vitamin supplements (yes vs. no) and by the presence of specic side effects. Although attempts were made to collect all follow-up inter- view data from the primary caregiver enrolled in the study, this was not always feasible given the involvement of multiple caregivers. Of the 110 families enrolled in the study, multiple caregivers provided follow-up information in 11 families (10%). A sensitivity analysis was performed on the multiple logistic regression model limiting our sample to data collected from the caregiver who completed the baseline data collection and S- TOFHLA. This restricted analysis included 394 of the 574 observations. All statistical tests for association were performed at the 0.05 signicance level. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2002-2003). 3. Results Limited health literacy was observed in 20 of 110 caregivers (18%). Over 90% of the caregivers were women. For the limited health literacy group, 60% completed all six assessment points; for the adequate health literacy group, 70% completed all six assessment points. There was no statistically signicant differencein the number of missed assessment points between the two health literacy groups ( p= 0.29). Caregivers with limited health literacy were more likely to be born outside of the U.S. than caregivers with adequate health literacy (90% vs. 61%, respectively, p= 0.01). Caregiver health literacy had no statistically signicant associations with caregiver age, gender, language of S-TOFHLA administration, type of health insurance, race/ethnicity, or randomization assignment (drops vs. sprinkles) ( Table 1 ). High adherence was reported in 32.7% (188) of the 574 observations. Contrary to the study hypothesis, caregivers with limited health literacy were more likely to report high adherence than caregivers with adequate health literacy on unadjusted analysis (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.23-3.88). Caregivers with limitedhealth literacy reported using multi-vitamins with iron on an average of 3.7 days per week compared to caregivers with adequate health literacy who reported using them on an average of 2.4 days per week. Caregivers with limited health literacy consistently reported higher adherence at each assessment point (Fig. 2 ). Results from the multiple logistic regression ( Table 2 ) con- tinued to demonstrate increased odds of high adherence among caregivers with limited health literacy skills (AOR = 2.13; 95% 1.20-3.78). The sensitivity analysis revealed a similar trend in all results. There were no differences in terms of race/ethnicity, health literacy, education, being born in the US, randomization assign-ment, or insurance type between this subgroup and the larger group including data from multiple caregivers. The odds of high adherence among caregivers with limited health literacy skills was somewhat reduced (AOR = 1.88; 95% 0.96-3.67).Table 1 Sociodemographic characteristics according 110)Adequate female with high adherence by caregiver literacy.L.K. Hironaka et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 376-380 378To determine whether side effects confounded the relationship between health literacy and adherence, each side effect covariate was added to the model. There were no signicant changes in the AOR for health literacy. A similar analysis was performed to determine whether caregiver's concerns about the multi-vitamin with iron affected the results. When caregiver concern was added to the model, the magnitude of the association between limited health literacy and high adherence increased (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.37-4.20). 4. Discussion and conclusion4.1. Discussion This study evaluated the relationship between parental health literacy and adherence of infants to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen. In a cohort of 110 participants, 18% of participating caregivers demonstrated limited health literacy skills. Contrary to the study hypothesis, in adjusted analysis, caregivers with limited health literacy were twice as likely to report high adherence to a daily multi-vitamin with iron regimen in infants as caregivers withadequate health literacy skills (AOR = 2.13; 95% 1.20-3.78). This relationship was maintained when variables for side effects and concerns about the multi-vitamin with iron were included in the model. This study adds to the literature by assessing the relationship between caregiver health literacy and medication adherence in pediatric patients. Although previous studies have evaluated the role of caregiver health literacy and pediatric outcomes in the areas of asthma [7], Type 1 diabetes [8], child health care utilization [26], and adherence to recommendations following an acute care visit [27], few studies have assessed the relationship between caregiver health literacy and pediatric medication adherence. There are several limitations to this study. First of all, adherence was based upon caregiver report of multi-vitamin use over the past 7 days. There was not another measurement or biomarker for multi-vitamin with iron intake. In a sample with higher literacy skills, self-report via questionnaires or diaries may have yielded improved results [28]. However, given the focus on health literacy, it was necessary for all caregiver reported data to be collected via interview. An additional limitation relates to the fact that in 11 of the 110 families, more than one caregiver provided data on adherence. To evaluate the possibility that this introduced bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis, which was consistent with our main ndings. Moreover, as part of the study protocol, caregivers were asked biweekly about adherence to a multi-vitamin with iron regimen. The most likely effect of frequent contact by researchers would be an overall increase in adherence and reporting of adherence. While unlikely, it is possible that frequent contact would differentially influence caregivers with limited health literacy. It is also possible that weakly associated covariates in combination could exert a signicant impact on our ndings. However, based upon our analyses, there was not adequate justication to include other covariates in the model. The presenceof unmeasured confounding could have also affected the results. Finally the S-TOFHLA, the measurement of health literacy skills, assessed reading comprehension but did not assess numeracy skills. Use of a more comprehensive measure of health literacy might have revealed different results. The overall rate of limited health literacy in this study was signicantly lower than other estimates [2,29] . In contrast to results from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) and other studies, this study observed no association between health literacy and demographic variables such as the level of caregiver education or type of health insurance [1,2,29] . The lack of statistically signicant associations may have been due to sample size limitations or lack of variability within a possible confounding variable. These results must be viewed in the context of a growing literature assessing the complex relationship between health literacy, medication adherence, and disease outcomes. Studies of medication adherence have produced variable results [3-9] . It has been suggested that the relationship between health literacy and adherence may vary depending upon the complexity of the treatment regimen, the amount of self-monitoring required, and even the degree of disease severity [30]. In this study, the daily administration of vitamins was relatively simple. Factors such as self-efcacy and social stigma have also been shown to mediate the relationship between health literacy and medication adherence [5,31] . At a systemic level, the complexities of the medical system, the culture of medical care, and the growing literacy-based demands placed on a patient may have substantial effects on the individual or family with limited health literacy skills - the impact of which could be mitigated by a health care system that is designed to promote patient education and self-care management [32,33] . Overall, relatively few caregivers reported high adherence regardless of their health literacy status. As important as it is to consider the factors that promoted improved adherence in the limited health literacy group, it is equally important to consider which factors contributed to poorer adherence in the adequate health literacy group. In this example, it is possible that improving adherence will be less dependent upon leveling the eld between those with limited and adequate health literacy than on utilizing a different approach to promoting health behavior change. 4.2. Conclusions The relationship between health literacy and medication adherence is likely complex. Limited literacy often coexists with other social vulnerabilities [33], and the relationships between these various social vulnerabilities may explain some of the variability represented in the health literacy and medication adherence research. As health literacy research moves forward, it will be important to gain a greater understanding of these complex interrelationships and how to target interventions at both the individual and community level to improve health outcomes [33]. 4.3. Practice implications Health literacy may exert a differential influence on adherence depending upon the complexity of the desired health behavior. Future interventions to promote adherence should consider the critical points where health literacy may influence these desired behaviors. Conflict of interest The authors of this study have no conflicts of interest to disclose.Table 2 Adjusted odds ratios for high adherence to multi-vitamins and iron.

Hylek, M.D., M.P.H.1 ABSTRACT The burden of atrial brillation (AF) worldwide is projected to increase substan- tially over the next few decades in part due to an aging population. AF increases the risk of stroke approximately vefold. The population-attributable risk for stroke by age is considerable: 1.5% for those individuals 50 to 59 years of age compared with 23.5% forthose/C2180 years of age. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) like warfarin have been shown to greatly reduce the risk of stroke. However, despite their proven efcacy, VKAs remainunderused, particularly among elderly patients with AF. The preponderance of evidencefrom randomized trials and observational studies attests to higher bleeding rates amongelderly individuals with AF. Antiplatelet therapy is not effective for stroke prevention inAF and is also associated with signicant bleeding risk. Strategies to optimize the effectiveness of VKAs and improve their safety proles among elderly patients in clinical practice are direly needed. An understanding of the pathological changes that predispose tohemorrhage, hazards of polypharmacy, and factors that contribute to variability in doseresponse will facilitate a more informed use of these medications in clinical care. KEYWORDS: Atrial brillation, stroke, anticoagulant therapy, prevalence of atrial brillation (AF) is projected to increase markedly over the next fewdecades. In the United States, the prevalence of AF isexpected to exceed 10 million individuals by 2030. 1 Older age is a potent risk factor for AF. Approximately10% of individuals /C2180 years of age have AF. 2The morbidity and mortality related to AF is well recog-nized. In aggregate, AF increases the risk of stroke approximately vefold. The population-attributable risk for stroke by age is considerable: 1.5% for thoseindividuals 50 to 59 years of age compared with 23.5%for those /C2180 years of age. 3,4Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been shown to greatly reduce the risk ofstroke. 5However, despite their proven efcacy, VKAs remain underused, particularly among elderly patientswith AF.WARFARIN USE AMONG ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATIONMultiple studies attest to the underuse of VKA amongelderly individuals with AF. The Stockholm CohortStudy on Atrial Fibrillation reported that 54% of indi-viduals without contraindications were prescribed war-farin at hospital discharge. The investigators found amarked decrease in use of warfarin among individuals >80 years of age. 6Strikingly similar results were re- ported from a study conducted in the United States of 21teaching, 13 community, and 4 Veterans Administrationhospitals during the same time period. Among patientswith AF and no obvious contraindication, warfarin use atdischarge was 54%. Age /C2180 years and perceived bleed- ing risk were negative predictors of warfarin use. 7The Euro Heart Survey also showed that age >75 years was a 1Department of Medicine, Research Unit-Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

Aggregate rates of major hemorrhage among participants of randomizedtrials and observational cohorts have been reassuringlylow. However, a full accounting of inclusion and ex-clusion criteria and end-point de nitions is critical for an informed interpretation of these data. Because the val-idity of a randomized controlled trial is threatened bynonadherence, loss to follow-up, dropouts, and treat- ment crossovers, trials tend to enroll less sick and more compliant individuals with lower bleeding risk to bestensure internal validity. These realities prompt concernsabout the comparability of trial populations and patientscared for in routine practice. 9In addition, in contrast to early AF trials, more recent trials have preferentiallyenrolled patients already taking VKA. This is an addi-tional source of bias because these patients tend to be less acutely ill and have already demonstrated an ability to tolerate anticoagulant therapy. Observational cohortstudies are also vulnerable to this bias. Inception cohortstudies of patients newly taking VKA are time intensivedue to their reliance on incident cases. It is also challeng-ing from a logistical perspective to identify and track anindividual from the time of the rst dose.MAJOR HEMORRHAGE AMONG ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATIONThe preponderance of evidence from randomized trialsand observational studies supports higher bleeding rates among elderly individuals with AF. 10,11To interpret published rates, it is important to determine the de ni- tion of major hemorrhage and whether or not there wasadequate representation of the age group in question.Thresholds to classify a bleeding episode as major varywidely. Less subjective de nitions require evidence of red blood cell transfusion or change in hemoglobin, but thehemoglobin criterion ranges from a 2 g/dL decrease to a 5 g/dL decrease. 12,13Denitions that use hospitalization as a sole criterion tend to bias toward higher bleedingevent rates in the elderly population. Uniform reportingof hemorrhage is critical to better discern drug safetyproles across different patient subgroups. To determine the degree of selection bias among study participants, it isimportant to discern the proportion of patients enrolledfrom the denominator population of potentially eligible subjects. This percentage, in addition to the absolute number, helps to de ne the external validity of the study population. The spectrum of aging spans the youngestold to the frailest old, and baseline risk varies considerablyacross these patient strata. 14Biological age is not neces- sarily re flected by chronological age, and for this reason, there is no strict age cutoff for use of VKA.

Major hemorrhage and tolerability of warfarin in the rst year of therapy among elderly patients with atrial brillation. Circulation 2007;115:2689 -2696).ANTITHROMBOTIC AFFIRM trial (Atrial Fibrillation Follow- up Investigation of Rhythm Management), the risk ofmajor hemorrhage increased by /C245% per year of age. 15 More recently, elderly patients were found to be at greatest risk for bleeding complications in the Amadeus trial that compared VKA to idraparinux, a once-weeklyinjectable factor Xa inhibitor. 16Higher rates of major hemorrhage were also reported among patients /C2180 years of age newly taking warfarin for AF (Fig. 1).17This inception cohort study con rmed the rst 90 days to be the most risk-prone period and highlighted the paradoxof warfarin discontinuation among patients at the highest risk for stroke. Of patients who were /C2180 years of age, 26% stopped warfarin within the rst year for perceived safety concerns (Fig. 2). PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR MAJOR HEMORRHAGEThe etiology of hemorrhage in older individuals is multifactorial. Pathological changes associated with aging render patients susceptible and these biologicaleffects in conjunction with increased vulnerability topolypharmacy and increased rates of invasive proceduresunderlie much of the bleeding that is experienced inclinical practice. Hemorrhage may herald the presence ofan occult that amenable to inter- vention. Vascular ectasias are particularly problematicbecause the bleeding is often recurrent and de nitive treatment elusive. Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage The rate of lower gastrointestinal bleeding increasesprecipitously with age by an estimated 200-fold fromthe third to the ninth decade. 18The differential diagnosis differs from that of younger individuals andmost commonly includes diverticulosis, ischemic col- itis, malignancy, and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding occursamong individuals >60 years of age. Peptic ulcer disease remains the most common etiology amongboth young and old adults. Antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory drugs are potent risk factors for gastro- intestinal hemorrhage. In addition, there is a differ-ential detrimental effect of aspirin by age with men age /C2180 years the most prone to gastric mucosal compli- cations. 19To the extent that indications for antiplatelet and/or anti-in flammatory agents increase with age, particularly percutaneous coronary interventions andosteoarthritis, these readily available medications con-stitute a salient example of the hazardous sequelae of Figure 2 Risk of stopping warfarin in the rst year on the basis of perceived safety concerns by age.

Intracranial Hemorrhage Older age is also a potent risk factor for intracranialhemorrhage. 20Leukoaraiosis, also termed white matter disease, is a chronic subcortical vasculopathy that wasfound to be an independent predictor intracranial hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95%condence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.3) in the Stroke Prevention In Reversible Ischemia Trial (SPIRIT), in addition to age and anticoagulation intensity. 21 The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and leukoaraiosis increase with age and heightens the riskof intracerebral hemorrhage. The contribution of fall risk to intracranial hem- orrhage is controversial and a challenging area to study.Underlying mechanisms for the increased propensity forfalls among elderly individuals have been well de- scribed. 24Polypharmacy is often implicated because speci c medications like a-blockers or tricyclic antide- pressants or combinations of these agents, diuretics, or vasodilators may cause ortho-static hypotension and exacerbate underlying autonomicdysfunction. Impaired balance may also be attributableto sarcopenia, decreased proprioception, or loss of visualacuity. Perhaps the most de nitive study to date, Gage and colleagues reported rates of intracranial hemorrhage among Medicare bene ciaries deemed to be high fall risk through physician documentation of ''frequent falls, '' ''history of falls, '' ''multiple falls, ''or''tendency for falls '' in the medical record. 25Longitudinal follow-up of this AF cohort revealed versus 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0 -1.3) for those individuals without this designation. Of note, rates of ischemic stroke were 13.7% versus 6.9%, respectively, supportinguse of anticoagulant therapy in the presence of multiplestroke risk factors. OPTIMAL CHOICE OF ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY AMONG ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Current guidelines recommend VKA for individualswith a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attackand for those patients with two or more of the followingrisk factors: /C21age 75 years, hypertension, diabetes mel- litus, heart failure, or left ventricular dysfunction. 26Un- treated, the estimated risk of stroke in the presence oftwo of these risk factors is 4% (95% CI, 3.1 to 5.1) per year and increases by /C2450% with each additional risk factor. 27Randomized trials have de nitely shown that aspirin, including dual antiplatelet therapy, is not effec-tive for high-risk patients compared with VKA. 28Therate of vascular events among AF patients randomized to aspirin plus clopidogrel was 5.64% per year versus 3.63%for patients randomized to VKA in the Atrial Fibrilla-tion Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular trial. 29Rates of major hemorrhage were not cantly different in the two groups: 2.4% versus 2.2%, More recently,the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of theAged (BAFTA) study found warfarin to be superior toaspirin in the prevention of stroke (1.8% versus 3.8% peryear) among patients age /C2175 years for whom there was clinical pretrial uncertainty about which of the two treatments should be used. As found in ACTIVE-W, rates of major hemorrhage in both arms were similar(1.9% versus 2.2% per year), effectively dispelling is innocuous and saferthan warfarin. 30Based on the available evidence, there is a limited, if any, role for aspirin therapy for strokeprevention in AF. STRATEGIES TO REDUCE RISK OF MAJOR HEMORRHAGE AMONG ELDERLYPATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATIONOlder patients are at the highest risk of stroke, and AF-related strokes are associated with a 30-day mortality of24%. 4,31Given the morbidity and mortality, it is imper- ative that strategies to minimize hemorrhagic complica- tions be implemented. Attentive management of hypertension with goals of /C20130/80 mm Hg decrease the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.32 Hazardous drug combinations of VKA plus aspirinshould be avoided, when possible, because the risk ofgastrointestinal hemorrhage increases dramatically (ad-justed relative risk, 6.48; 95% CI, 4.25 to 9.87). 33 Aspirin also increases the risk of intracranial hemor- rhage.34For elderly patients on VKA, choice of coronary stent, bare metal versus drug eluting, should incorporatebleeding risk parameters to minimize exposure to dualantiplatelet therapy. 35Addition of proton pump inhib- itors as prophylaxis in this setting has recently beenquestioned because these agents may decrease the effec-tiveness of clopidogrel. 36,37 Warfarin dose requirements decline with age.38 Older age is also associated with a slower rate of recoveryfollowing an episode of excessive anticoagulation. 39 Hospitalization induces changes in diet and medications,and discharge transitions are often fraught with frag-mentation. For all of these reasons, the initiation periodof VKA confers the highest risk of serious bleeding, andvigilant monitoring of anticoagulation intensity is para-mount. A recent analysis casts doubt on the overall cost effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing to off- set this risk of early adverse events. 40Timely dose adjustment and frequent testing during the rst month of VKA therapy is absolutely essential to optimizeANTITHROMBOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IN ELDERLY PATIENTS /HYLEK 551patient safety. In addition, although paracetamol (acet- aminophen) is the preferred antipyretic and pain relieverof choice, it is known to potentiate the anticoagulanteffect of VKA with protracted use of larger doses. 41The touted mechanism is interference with enzymes of the vitamin K cycle. Decompensated heart failure, liverdisease, chemotherapy, and amiodarone are otherpowerful potentiators of warfarin 's effect. 42 Assessment of patient fall risk should be con- ducted and interventions implemented to minimize thisrisk. Soft tissue injuries and excessive bruising oftenprecipitate cessation of warfarin therapy. If postural hypotension persists despite medication adjustment, other remedial measures need to be instituted likecompression stockings or mineralocorticoid therapy.Cognitive dysfunction is not a contraindication to anti-coagulant therapy providing reliable dosing can beachieved with the assistance of a caregiver or otherstructured medication dispensing plan. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Risk strati cation among patients with AF remains suboptimal. 43Whether or not inclusion of biomarker, echocardiographic, and genetic data will improve dis-crimination awaits large population-based studies. Validprediction models for intracranial hemorrhage are direlyneeded, but the rarity of this outcome will continue to challenge this directive. Cerebral microbleeds as de- tected by gradient-echo magnetic resonance imagingshow promise as a marker for intracerebralbleeding on anticoagulant therapy. 44,45Critical ques- tions that will ensue include overall cost effectiveness ofthis approach and performance threshold of a cutoffscore that would justify withholding antithrombotictherapy in high-risk patients with AF. Whether or not newer anticoagulant drugs with different molecular targets, wider therapeutic windows,shorter half-lives, and less dietary and drug interactionswill be safer in elderly patients with AF awaits theconclusion of ongoing clinical trials and subsequentvalidation in large population-based studies.

Received: January 30, 2009 Accepted: February 2, 2009 Haemost 2009; 101: 417-418 By human nature we focus more intently upon the harm that we may cause by doing too much than the harm that we may allow by doing too little (1, 2). It is well known that while vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are highly effective in pre-venting thromboembolic events, their use can also lead to serious haemorrhagic complications (3-7), some of which may be dis-abling or fatal. This very real risk is almost certainly part of the reason why VKA are underutilized in many patients with atrial fibrillation (8). Heightened fear of haemorrhage also evokes a heightened avoidance of elevated International Normalised Ratio (INR) as evidenced by the fact that, in most studies, pa-tients spend more time below than above the target INR range (9-14). The research literature also reflects this tendency to focus on overanticoagulation, with previous studies contributing to a much greater understanding of the causes of high INR than low INR. This tendency may also reflect a difference in perceiv-ed risk: the daily risk of an adverse event is almost certainly greater when the INR is high (15) than when it is low (16). Never-theless, subtherapeutic anticoagulation is associated with more frequent and more severe strokes and represents a more impor-tant phenomenon than our limited understanding of it might sug-gest (17). In this issue, Rombouts et al. (18) report their findings on the frequency of low INR and risk factors for low INR among pa-tients cared for by the Leiden Thrombosis Service. Of 13,443 pa-tients initiating VKA therapy, 7,419 met the study eligibility criteria for stability defined as four consecutive INR deter-minations within the target range. Within four weeks of this stable period, 12% of patients had a subtherapeutic INR, a pro-portion that approximately doubled by eight weeks, and reached 50% after 40 weeks. Use of acenocoumarol (22% of the cohort) doubled the risk of a subtherapeutic INR compared to phenpro-coumon and shortened the time to occurrence. The median time to first low INR was 13 weeks versus 51 weeks, respectively. Higher target intensity and use of VKA therapy for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were also associated with increased risk. The authors additionally found that 30% of low INR episodes were preceded by an invasive procedure, haemor-rhage, or elevated INR. This study highlights the common occurrence of subthera- peutic INR levels and provides a clear estimate of the incidence of low INR in a meticulously constructed inception cohort of pa-tients deemed stable on anticoagulant therapy. Nearly one-fourth of patients in this study experienced a low INR within two months of a period marked by stability (four consecutive INR de-terminations in the target range). It is notable that 45% of the in-itial cohort never achieved stable INR which emphasises the challenges inherent to VKA and the gross underestimate of low INR that occurs in routine practice. Importantly, the authors also found that nearly one-third of low INR episodes resulted from clinically justified interventions to minimise risk of haem-orrhage, and therefore, reflective of informed clinical care rather than substandard anticoagulation management. In this study, acenocoumarol was associated with a twofold increase in risk for low INR (adjusted hazard ratio [HR ] 2.14) compared to phenprocoumon. Fihn et al. had previously reported more time in the therapeutic range with phenprocoumon com-pared to acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon has been shown to exhibit less INR variability over a 24-hour period (19, 20). Poten-tial mechanisms for these observations include differences in pharmacokinetics (the half-life of acenocoumarol is 8-11 hours versus 5-6 days for phenprocoumon), pharmacogenetics, and timing of blood sample collection in relation to dose. Phenpro-coumon is less affected by CYP2C9 polymorphisms compared to other VKA (21). Extrapolating from time-in-range analyses and known ef- fects on INR variability, the authors suggest preferential use of phenprocoumon in clinical practice. However, the study was not 417References 1.Spranca M, Minsk E, Baron J. Omission and comis- sion in judgement choice. 76-105. 2.Hayward MM, et al.

The risk of bleeding complications in patients with cytoch-rome P450 differences in clinical outcomes (two throm- boembolic events occurred) and published data are conflicting on the overall safety of phenprocoumon compared to acenocou-marol. Widely disparate results range from increased major bleeding with phenprocoumon to an isolated increase only in minor bleeding, to no difference in bleeding, and to decreased bleeding compared to acenocoumarol (10, 22-24). Without de-finitive data on efficacy and safety, treatment recommendations based on surrogate endpoints should be interpreted with caution. As acknowledged by the authors, the retrospective design of the study prohibited a detailed assessment of other potential risk factors for low INR, particularly medication adherence and die-tary change. The authors invoke non-adherence due to patient perception of risk as a potential explanation for the differential rates of low INR by indication for therapy. After adjustment for covariates, patients receiving a VKA for thromboprophylaxis had the highest rate of first low INR (HR 1.88), followed by sec-ondary prevention of VTE (HR 1.36), atrial fibrillation (refer-ence category), and mechanical heart valves (HR 0.69). A more comprehensive accounting of the reasons for unintentional low INR values in routine practice is needed to facilitate interven-tions to improve time in the therapeutic range. Understanding the precipitants of low INR is long overdue, and from that standpoint alone, this study is an important con-tribution. However, many pivotal issues regarding thromboem-bolism and low INR remain unexplored. Is risk affected by the length of the subtherapeutic period? What is the association be-tween low INR, factor VIIa and molecular markers of thrombin activation? What ultimately drives thrombus formation and em-bolisation? Is the risk of low INR modified by the clinical con-text? Do concomitant medications attenuate or magnify the risk of low INR and what is the effect of temporal changes in throm-bogenicity? Answers to these questions will provide important insights to fundamental mechanisms. In the interim, optimiz-ation of anticoagulant therapy as guided by innovative investi-gation such as that by Rombouts et al. remains a pressing need.

Sanchez, PharmD, BCPS; Anna E. Johnson, RN; Shaula R. Forsythe, MA, MPH; Julie K. O'Donnell, MPH; Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, MD, MA, MPH;Christopher Manasseh, MD; Stephen Martin, MD, MEd; and Larry Culpepper, MD, MPH Background: Emergency department visits and rehospitalization are common after hospital discharge. Objective: To test the effects of an intervention designed to min- imize hospital utilization after discharge. Design: Randomized trial using block randomization of 6 and 8. Randomly arranged index cards were placed in opaque envelopeslabeled consecutively with study numbers, and participants wereassigned a study group by revealing the index card. Setting: General medical service at an urban, academic, safety-net hospital. Patients: 749 English-speaking hospitalized adults (mean age, 49.9 years). Intervention: A nurse discharge advocate worked with patients during their hospital stay to arrange follow-up appointments, con-firm medication reconciliation, and conduct patient education withan individualized instruction booklet that was sent to their primarycare provider. A clinical pharmacist called patients 2 to 4 days afterdischarge to reinforce the discharge plan and review medications.Participants and providers were not blinded to treatment assign-ment. Measurements: Primary outcomes were emergency department visits and hospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. Secondaryoutcomes were self-reported preparedness for discharge and fre- quency of primary care providers' follow-up within 30 days ofdischarge. Research staff doing follow-up were blinded to studygroup assignment. Results: Participants in the intervention group ( n/H11005370) had a lower rate of hospital utilization than those receiving usual care(n/H11005368) (0.314 vs. 0.451 visit per person per month; ratio, 0.695 [95% CI, 0.515 to 0.937]; P/H110050.009). The inter- vention was most effective among participants with hospital utili-zation in the 6 months before index admission ( P/H110050.014). Ad- verse events were not assessed; these data were collected but arestill being analyzed. Limitation: This was a single-center study in which not all poten- tially eligible patients could be enrolled, and outcome assessmentsometimes relied on participant report. Conclusion: A package of discharge services reduced hospital uti- lization within 30 days of discharge.

One in 5 hospitalizations is complicated by postdis- charge adverse events (1, 2), some of which may lead to preventable emergency department visits or readmis-sions. Despite this nding, hospital discharge procedureshave not been standardized (3). In addition, the decliningpresence of primary care providers (PCPs) in hospitals hasnot been adequately accompanied by systems to ensurethat patient data are transferred to subsequent caregivers(4, 5). For example, discharge summaries frequently lackcritical data and are not sent to the PCP in a timely fashion(6, 7), resulting in outpatient clinicians being unaware oftest results that were pending at discharge (8) and evalua-tions that were scheduled to be done after discharge not being completed (9). Similarly, patients are often left un-prepared at discharge; many do not understand their dis-charge medications and cannot recall their chief diagnoses(10). With more than 32 million adult discharges in theUnited States each year (11), these deciencies in the tran-sition of care increase illness, unnecessary hospital utiliza-tion, and cost. Some peridischarge interventions have shown a reduc- tion in hospital readmission rates and cost (12-14), emer-gency department visits (15), and postdischarge adverseevents (16), whereas some have shown little or no effect(17-20). Peridischarge interventions have also shown im-proved PCP follow-up and outpatient work-ups (21) andhigher patient satisfaction (15). Most of these studies havefocused on specic diagnoses (14, 22, 23) or highly se-lected populations, such as geriatric adults (12, 13, 19, 24).Some have focused on specic aspects of the discharge,such as increasing access to primary care follow-up (25),connecting with transitional nursing services (26), or im-proving patients' ability to advocate for themselves afterdischarge (12). To date, no study has evaluated a standard- See also: Print Editors' Notes .............................1 7 9 Web-Only Appendix TableConversion of graphics into slidesAnnals of Internal Medicine Improving Patient Care 178 \u00a9 2009 American College of Physiciansized discharge intervention that includes patient education, comprehensive discharge planning, and postdischarge tele-phone reinforcement in a general medical population. In 2004, we began an in-depth examination of hospi- tal discharge, for which we designed a package of servicesto minimize discharge failures\u2014a process called reengi- neered discharge (RED) ( Table 1 ) (3, 27). We did a ran- domized, controlled trial to evaluate the clinical effect ofimplementing RED among patients admitted to a generalmedical service. METHODS Setting and Participants We conducted a 2-group, randomized, controlled trial of English-speaking patients 18 years of age or older whowere admitted to the medical teaching service of BostonMedical Center, Boston, Massachusetts\u2014a large, urban,safety-net hospital with an ethnically diverse patient pop-ulation. Patients had to have a telephone, be able to com-prehend study details and the consent process in English,and have plans to be discharged to a U.S. community. Wedid not enroll patients if they were admitted from a skillednursing facility or other hospital, transferred to a differenthospital service before enrollment, admitted for a plannedhospitalization, were on hospital precautions or suicidewatch, or were deaf or blind. Boston University's institu-tional review board approved all study activities. Randomization Each morning, a list of admitted patients was reviewed for initial eligibility (hospital location, age, date and timeof admission, and previous enrollment). Last names of po-tential participants were ranked by using a random-num-ber sequence to determine the order in which to approachpatients for enrollment. A trained research assistant thenapproached each patient and further determined eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Figure 1 ). By using block randomization (28) with varying block sizes of 6 and 8, we randomly arranged index cards indi-cating either the usual care or intervention group. Weplaced the cards in opaque envelopes labeled consecutivelywith study numbers. We assigned eligible participants whoconsented to enrollment to a study group by revealing theconcealed index card. This process continued until 2 par-ticipants were enrolled each day of the week (or 3 partici-pants if the rst 2 participants were randomly assigned tothe usual care group). This protocol ensured that researchassistants could not selectively choose potential participantsfor enrollment or predict assignment. Participants ran-domly assigned to usual care received no further interven- tion. There were 40 participants in the usual care groupand 38 in the intervention group who were enrolled but nolonger met inclusion criteria at discharge (most commonlybecause they were discharged to a nursing facility). Becausethe primary analysis was by intention to treat, we includedthese participants in the analysis, with the exception ofthose who died before index discharge, requested to beremoved, or were previously enrolled ( Figure 1 ). Interventions Nurse discharge advocates (DAs) carried out all aspects of the in-hospital intervention. We hired 6 part-time DAsto work with intervention participants to ensure coverageby 1 DA 7 days a week, 5 hours a day. We trained all DAsto deliver the RED intervention by using a manual con-taining detailed scripts, observation of relevant clinical in-teractions, and simulated practice sessions. The primarygoals of the DA were to coordinate the discharge plan withthe hospital team and educate and prepare the participantfor discharge. At admission, the DA completed the REDintervention components outlined in Table 1 . Additional information about the DA training manual is publishedelsewhere (3) and can be found on our Web site (www.bu.edu/fammed/projectred/index.html). With information collected from the hospital team and the participant, the DA created the after-hospital careplan (AHCP), which contained medical provider contactinformation, dates for appointments and tests, an appoint-ment calendar, a color-coded medication schedule, a list oftests with pending results at discharge, an illustrated de-scription of the discharge diagnosis, and information aboutwhat to do if a problem arises. Information for the AHCPwas manually entered into a Microsoft Word (Microsoft,Redmond, Washington) template, printed, and spiral-bound to produce an individualized, color booklet de-signed to be accessible to individuals with limited healthliteracy. By using scripts from the training manual, the DAused a teach-back methodology (29) to review the contentsof the AHCP with the participant. On the day of dis-charge, the AHCP and discharge summary were faxed tothe PCP.Context Emergency department visits and rehospitalizations are common after hospital discharge. Contribution This trial demonstrated that a nurse discharge advocateand clinical pharmacist working together to coordinatehospital discharge, educate patients, and reconcile medica-tions led to fewer follow-up emergency visits and rehospi-talizations than usual care alone. Caution The trial was conducted at a single center, and not alleligible patients were enrolled. Implication A systematic approach to hospital discharges can reduceunnecessary health service use. \u2014The EditorsImproving Patient Care A Reengineered Hospital Discharge Program to Decrease Rehospitalization www.annals.org 3 February 2009 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 150 Number 3 179A clinical pharmacist telephoned the participants 2 to 4 days after the index discharge to reinforce the dischargeplan by using a scripted interview. The pharmacist hadaccess to the AHCP and hospital discharge summary and,over several days, made at least 3 attempts to reach eachparticipant. The pharmacist asked participants to bringtheir medications to the telephone to review them andaddress medication-related problems; the pharmacist com-municated these issues to the PCP or DA. Outcomes Measures and Follow-up At the time of recruitment, research assistants collected baseline data, including sociodemographic characteristics;the Short Form-12 Health Survey, Version 2 (30); thedepression subscale from the Patient Health Question-naire-9 (31); and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy inMedicine (32). We calculated the Charlson ComorbidityIndex score by using primary and secondary diagnoses re-corded on the index admission discharge summary (33).We determined the number of hospital admissions andemergency department visits in the 6 months before indexadmission through medical record review (Boston MedicalCenter hospital utilization) and participant report (allother hospital utilization). The primary end point was the rate of hospital utili- zation\u2014the total number of emergency department visitsand readmissions per participant within 30 days of theindex discharge. Any emergency department visit in whicha participant was subsequently hospitalized was counted asa readmission. Secondary end points were self-reportedpreparedness for discharge, rate of primary care follow-upvisits, and knowledge of discharge diagnosis. We collectedoutcome data by review of the hospital's electronic medicalrecords (EMRs) and by contacting participants by tele-phone 30 days after discharge. We obtained dates of sub-sequent emergency department visits and readmissions atBoston Medical Center from the EMRs and collected thoseat other hospitals through participant report. For partici-pants who could not be reached within 60 days after dis-charge, we assumed that they were alive and relied on hos-pital EMRs for primary outcomes. Research staff doingfollow-up telephone calls and reviewing hospital recordswere blinded to study group assignment. Discharge advo-cates and pharmacists recorded time spent working witheach participant. Statistical Analyses On the basis of unpublished pilot data from the gen- eral medical service at Boston Medical Center from July2003 to June 2004, we estimated that with a readmissionincidence rate of 0.197 visit per person per month and anemergency department visit incidence rate of 0.17 visit perperson per month (combined hospital utilization rate of0.367 visit per person per month), we needed to enroll 750participants to detect an incidence rate reduction of 0.25visit per person per month in the primary outcome andachieve 80% power, with a 2-sided /H9251level of 0.05.Table 1. Components of Reengineered Hospital Discharge In-hospital component (discharge advocate) 1. Educate patient about relevant diagnoses throughout hospital stay.2. Make appointments for clinician follow-up and postdischarge testing. Solicit input from patient about convenient date(s) and time(s) for appointments. Coordinate appointments with physicians, testing, and other services.Discuss reason for and importance of physician appointments.Confirm that patient knows location and transportation plan and review barriers to keeping appointments. 3. Discuss with patient any pending in-hospital tests or studies completed and who will follow-up with results. 4. Organize postdischarge services. Be sure patient understands the importance of such services.Make appointments at times convenient for patient.Discuss the details about how to receive each service. 5. Confirm medication plan. Reconcile the discharge medication regimen.Explain what medications to take, emphasizing any changes in the regimen. Review each medication's purpose, how to take it correctly, and important side effects. Be sure the patient has a realistic plan about how to obtain medications. 6. Reconcile the discharge plan with national guidelines and critical pathways. 7. Review appropriate steps for what to do if a problem arises. Instruct how to contact the primary care provider (or coverage) by providing contact numbers for evenings and weekends. Instruct on what constitutes an emergency and what to do in the case of an emergency. 8. Transmit discharge summary to physicians and services accepting responsibility of patient's care that contains the following: Reason for hospitalization with specific principal diagnosis.Important findings.Procedures done and care, treatment, and services provided to patient.Patient's condition at discharge.Complete and reconciled medication list (including allergies).List of acute medical issues, tests, and studies for which confirmed results are pending at the time of discharge and require follow-up. Information about input from consultative services, including rehabilitation therapy. When creating this document, the original source documents\u2014 laboratory, radiology, operative reports, and medicationadministration records\u2014should be in the transcriber's immediatepossession and be visible when it is necessary to transcribeinformation from 1 document to another. 9. Assess the degree of understanding by asking the patient to explain in his or her own words the details of the plan.

We measured person-time inmonths, making total person-months equal to the numberof participants in each study group. We used the Poissontest and proportions test to test for signicance of primaryoutcomes and secondary outcomes, respectively. We con-ducted a sensitivity analysis and excluded outliers withhigh subsequent hospital utilization. We generated cumulative hazard curves for time to multiple events (emergency department visits and readmis-sions) and compared them by using a log-rank test. Wemeasured the time-to-event from the index discharge date.This method corresponds to the Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld(34) marginal data model for ordered multiple events,which allows each event to have a separate underlying haz-ard (35).We did subgroup analysis with Poisson regression by using total hospital utilization number per participant asthe dependent variable. We determined subgroups a prioriand included depression diagnosis (36), previous hospitalutilization (37), health literacy level (38), sex, and age. Toevaluate potential interactions between these variables andthe intervention, we included interaction terms in the Pois-son regression. We used 2-sided signicance tests. We con-sidered Pvalues less than 0.05 to be statistically signicant. All data were analyzed with S-Plus, version 8.0 (Insightful,Seattle, Washington), and Intercooled Stata, version 10(StataCorp, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS Study Sample During the study period from 3 January 2006 to 18 October 2007, we admitted 5489 patients and assessed3873 for eligibility ( Figure 1 ). Because of a lack of avail- able research staff, we did not assess 1616 patients. Ofthose assessed for eligibility, 1049 did not meet eligibilitycriteria, 120 were previously enrolled, 527 declined to par-ticipate, 474 were unavailable in their hospital room at thetime of enrollment, and 954 were not approached becausethe maximum number of enrolled participants was reachedthat day. We enrolled and randomly assigned 749 partici-pants: 376 in the usual care group and 373 in the inter-vention group ( Figure 1 ). For primary and secondary out- come analyses, we excluded 11 participants on the basis ofparticipant request ( n/H110057), death before index discharge (n/H110053), and previous enrollment ( n/H110051), which left 368 in the usual care group and 370 in the intervention group.Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were sim-ilar across study groups ( Table 2 ). Process Measures In the intervention group, we discharged 346 of 370 (94%) participants with a primary care appointment, 306(83%) left with an AHCP, 197 (53%) had their medica-tions reconciled with the ambulatory EMR and had theirupdated medication list included in their AHCP, and 336(91%) had their discharge information sent to their PCPwithin 24 hours after discharge. The pharmacist reached228 (62%) of the intervention participants a median of 4days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 6 days) after dischargeand completed medication review with 195 (53%) inter-vention participants. The pharmacist found that 126 of195 (65%) intervention participants who completed med-ication review had at least 1 medication problem and 103(53%) needed corrective action by the pharmacist, such ascontacting the participant's PCP. In the usual care group, we discharged 127 of 368 (35%) participants with a primary care appointment; dataon medication reconciliation and discharge summarytransfer to the PCP were unavailable. Outcome Follow-up We obtained participant-reported outcome data by telephone for 615 of 738 (83%) participants a median of32 days (IQR, 30 to 36 days) after discharge. We reachedsimilar proportions of intervention (307 [83%]) and usualcare (307 [83%]) group participants ( P/H110050.87). Likewise, similar proportions of intervention (12 [3%]) and usualcare (7 [2%]) group participants reported hospital utiliza-tion at hospitals other than Boston Medical Center ( P/H11005 0.36). Hospital Utilization In the intervention group, 56 (15.1%) participants had 1 hospital utilization and 24 (6.5%) had more than 1hospital utilization. These 80 (21.6%) participants had116 hospital utilizations (61 emergency department visitsand 55 readmissions) during 370 person-months of fol-low-up (0.314 visit per person per month). In the usualcare group, 69 (18.8%) participants had 1 hospital utiliza-tion and 30 (8.1%) had more than 1 hospital utilization.These 99 (26.9%) participants had 166 visits (90 emer-gency department visits and 76 readmissions) during 368person-months of follow-up (0.451 visit per person permonth) ( Table 3 ). Intervention participants had a lower rate of hospital utilization than usual care participants (in-cidence rate ratio, 0.695 [95% CI, 0.515 to 0.937]); P/H11005 0.009). After we repeated the analysis excluding 1 usualcare participant with more than 8 hospital utilizations, hos-pital utilization between study groups remained statisticallysignicant ( P/H110050.028). Approximately 30% of partici- pants in each study group with any subsequent hospitalutilization had more than 1 subsequent hospital utilization. Figure 2 shows the cumulative hazard curves compar- ing hospital utilization in the 2 groups over the 30 daysafter discharge ( P/H110050.004). Subgroup analyses revealed that the intervention was more effective at reducing hospital utilization for partici-pants with greater hospital utilization in the previous 6months ( Pfor interaction /H110050.014). Secondary Outcomes Participants receiving the intervention could identify their index discharge diagnosis (242 [79%] vs. 217 [70%]participants; P/H110050.017) and PCP name (292 [95%] vs. 275 [89%] participants; P/H110050.007) more often than usual care participants. Intervention participants also reported ahigher PCP follow-up rate than usual care participants(190 [62%]) vs. 135 [44%]; P/H110210.001). Intervention group participants reported being more prepared for dis-charge at 30 days ( Table 3 ). Each component of the AHCP tool was highly rated by intervention participants(Appendix Table , available at www.annals.org). Time Spent Providing Intervention The DA spent a median of 42.5 minutes (IQR, 30 to 60 minutes) speaking directly with each participant, bothcollecting participant information and teaching the AHCPbooklet. The DA made a median of 3 attempts (IQR, 2 to5 attempts) per participant to call or page interns. An ad-ditional estimated 45 minutes was spent reviewing the par-ticipant's EMR, communicating with the medical team,and preparing the AHCP. Therefore, total DA time wasestimated to be 87.5 minutes per participant. Estimatedweekly DA time (following 14 participants per week) was20.4 hours or approximately 0.5 full-time equivalent. The pharmacist postdischarge telephone calls took aImproving Patient Care A Reengineered Hospital Discharge Program to Decrease Rehospitalization 182 3 February 2009 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 150 Number 3 www.annals.orgmedian of 14 minutes (IQR, 10 to 19 minutes), with 10 (6 to 18) additional minutes spent on call preparation, missedcalls, and resolving problems identied during calls. It tookthe pharmacist a median of 2 attempts (IQR, 1 to 3 at-tempts) to reach participants by telephone. Median totalpharmacist time was approximately 26 minutes (IQR, 18to 36 minutes) per participant. Estimated weekly pharma-cist time (following 14 participants per week) was 6.1 hours or approximately 0.15 full-time equivalent. Outcome Cost Analysis The actual cost of emergency department visits totaled $21 389 for the usual care group and $11 285 for the in-tervention group.

Follow-up PCP appointments weregiven an estimated cost of $55, on the basis of costs froman average hospital follow-up visit at Boston Medical Cen-ter. The estimated cost of primary care outpatient visitswithin 30 days after discharge totaled $8906 for 44% of368 usual care participants and $12 617 for 62% of 370intervention participants. The difference between studygroups in total cost (combining actual hospital utilizationcost and estimated outpatient cost) for 738 participantswas $149 995\u2014an average of $412 per person who re-ceived the intervention. This represents a 33.9% lower ob-served cost for the intervention group. DISCUSSION The RED intervention decreased hospital utilization (combined emergency department visits and readmissions)within 30 days of discharge by about 30% among patientson a general medical service of an urban, academic medicalcenter. More intervention group participants reported see-ing their PCP for follow-up within 30 days and reportedhigher levels of preparedness for discharge. In addition, theintervention was successful in reducing hospital utilizationamong participants who frequently used hospital services.These data support implementation of a comprehensiveprogram for hospital discharge among similar hospitals. Our intervention includes patient-centered education, comprehensive discharge planning, and postdischarge rein-Table 3.

The RED intervention has 3 core ele-ments: the DA, the AHCP, and the follow-up telephonecall by those of the pharmacist. Because these elementswere bundled, we could not clearly determine the degreethat each part contributed to the effects demonstrated. Noprevious studies have evaluated this trio of interventionstogether, although the roles of the DA and the pharmacistbuild on previous literature (12, 15, 16, 19). For example,peridischarge nursing support services have been shown toimprove discharge for patients with heart failure (14, 23,39, 40). Coleman and colleagues (12) used a nurse \"tran-sition coach\" to demonstrate reduced readmissions at 30and 90 days among elderly patients. Naylor and coworkers(13, 19) found that nurse specialists involved during andafter discharge also effectively reduced acute readmissions. Several studies have analyzed pharmacist interventions. Dudas and colleagues (15) randomly assigned patients toreceive a telephone call by a pharmacist after discharge anddemonstrated fewer emergency department visits. Schnip-per and coworkers (16) used pharmacist counseling beforeand after discharge and showed reductions in preventableadverse drug events and medication-related readmissionsand emergency department visits. Al-Rashed and col-leagues (41) found that predischarge pharmacist-basedcounseling for elderly patients followed by a postdischargehome visit resulted in fewer unplanned primary care visitsand fewer readmissions. The techniques used to teach the AHCP, its content, and its format (for example, pictures, color, and large font)were informed by the literature on limited health literacy(42, 43). Overall, the intervention improved patient com-prehension of key elements of self-care: 30 days after dis-charge, intervention participants were better able to iden-tify their primary diagnosis and reported betterunderstanding of their diagnosis, medications, and ap-pointments. The content, format, and teaching of dis-charge preparation tools deserve further attention becausefew studies have assessed the effect of patient education onsubsequent hospital utilization. Because intervention group participants were more likely to report seeing their PCPs after discharge and wetransmitted discharge information to PCPs promptly afterdischarge, the intervention optimized the chance thatPCPs could identify and address outstanding issues. In ad-dition, the pharmacist follow-up telephone call identiedany problems that a patient was having after discharge andrelayed those issues to the PCP. Previous studies have sug-gested that improved access to community-based follow-upalone may not be enough to reduce hospital readmissions(18, 25). We provide evidence that when combined withother elements of RED, improving PCP follow-up mayhelp reduce hospital utilization. Implementing this discharge intervention required about 1.5 hours of nursing time and 30 minutes of phar-macist time per participant. Because some of the DA ac-tivities were redundant with those of existing hospital per- sonnel, implementation of the RED intervention usingexisting hospital staff would require less time per patient.Also, because information was manually entered to createeach AHCP, hospital information technology solutionscould be developed to make this process more efcient.Despite this, we demonstrated hospital utilization cost sav-ings averaging $412 per discharge. These gures do notinclude the cost of the intervention, which involved 0.5full-time equivalent for a nurse and 0.15 full-time equiva-lent for a clinical pharmacist. If adopted broadly, this in-tervention could produce substantial effects on health carenancing (44). However, an important challenge for pro-grams like RED is that health providers, who are best sit-uated to implement such a program, may have no nancialincentive to do so. Hospitals serving capitation-based pa-tient populations may benet nancially from reducingunneeded rehospitalization. Under the fee-for-servicescheme, the payer will benet even after paying the fullcost of the intervention. Hospitals will also benet fromdecreasing the rehospitalization rate as an important qual-ity-improvement target, and investment in strategiesproven to work will be attractive to payers. The NationalQuality Forum is reviewing new metrics of quality caresurrounding readmission rates (45), and programs likeRED may be used to improve health care organizations'quality ratings. Our study has limitations. Because of stafng limita- tions, we were only able to enroll 2 to 3 participants perday, and we could not enroll participants on some week-ends and holidays. Because of the nature of our urban,underserved patient population and exclusion of patientscoming from nursing homes, the study sample wasyounger and had fewer comorbid conditions than those inother studies; thus, our results may not be generalizable toall patient groups. Also, we relied on participant self-reportfor outcomes that we could not gather from EMRs, nota-bly data on PCP follow-up and visits at hospitals otherthan Boston Medical Center. Previous studies have sug-gested that patient reports of emergency department andhospital use correlate well with electronic records from 6months to 1 year (46, 47). Ritter and colleagues (48) dem-onstrated that patients tended to underreport outpatientvisits over 6 months compared with electronic charts andfound no demographic or health-related predictors of un-derreporting. In our case, recall bias should be expected tobe nondifferential because our study was randomized, wereached both study groups equally, and outcome assessorswere blinded to study assignment. We assumed that studyparticipants not reached by telephone for an outcome as-sessment were alive for 30 days after the index discharge,and we relied on hospital EMRs to gather primary out-comes. Therefore, we did not capture deaths or hospitalutilizations at institutions other than Boston Medical Cen-ter for this limited number of participants. For the costanalysis, we could not determine a generalizable cost for Improving Patient Care A Reengineered Hospital Discharge Program to Decrease Rehospitalization www.annals.org 3 February 2009 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 150 Number 3 185the intervention because costs vary widely by institution and location. Similarly, we could not estimate the down-stream cost implications of avoided emergency departmentvisits and readmissions. Still, we present the actual costs for3 important types of directly related medical utilization.The cost of hospital utilization and outpatient visits alsocannot be easily generalized. Our goal is to provide thedirect comparison that can be made for these key costsbetween study groups, and we observed a 33.9% reductionin these costs. In summary, the RED program successfully reduced hospital utilization, improved patient self-perceived prepa-ration for discharge, and increased PCP follow-up. In2007, the National Quality Forum Consensus StandardsMaintenance committee identied hospital discharge as acritical area for improvement. The resulting NationalQuality Forum \"Safe Practice\" was based largely on theprinciples of the RED program (49). Our study providesdata supporting the implementation of the discharge stan-dards promoted by the National Quality Forum.

Kraemer, Kenneth J. Smith, Mark S. and Richard Saitz Background: The %carbohydrate decient transferrin (%CDT) test offers objective evidence of unhealthy alcohol use but its cost-effectiveness in primary care conditions is unknown. Methods: Using a decision tree and Markov model, we performed a literature-based cost- effectiveness analysis of 4 strategies for detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adult primary care patients: (i) Questionnaire Only, using a validated 3-item alcohol questionnaire; (ii) %CDT Only; (iii) Questionnaire followed by %CDT (Questionnaire-%CDT) if the questionnaire is negative;and (iv) No Screening. For those patients screening positive, clinicians performed more detailed assessment to characterize unhealthy use and determine therapy. We estimated costs using Medi- care reimbursement and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We determined sensitivity, speci-city, prevalence of disease, and mortality from the medical literature. In the base case, wecalculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2006 dollars per quality-adjusted life year ($ QALY) for a 50-year-old cohort. Results: In the base case, the ICER for the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy was $15,500 QALY compared with the Questionnaire Only strategy. Other strategies were dominated. When theprevalence of unhealthy alcohol use exceeded 15% and screening age was <60 years, the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy costs less than $50,000 QALY compared to the Questionnaire Only strategy. Conclusions: Adding %CDT to questionnaire-based screening for unhealthy alcohol use was cost-effective in our literature-based decision analytic model set in typical primary care conditions. Screening with %CDT should be considered for adults up to the age of 60 when the prevalenceof unhealthy alcohol use is 15% or more and screening questionnaires are negative. Key Words: Carbohydrate Decient Transferring, Alcohol Use, Primary Care. THE UNITED STATES Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for unhealthy alcohol use, including at-risk drinking, problem drinking, alcoholabuse, and alcohol dependence (U.S. Preventive Services TaskForce, 2004). The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism (NIAAA) denes at -risk drinking as >14 drinksper week or 5 or more drinks on a single occasion for men and >7 drinks per week or 4 or more drinks on a single occa-sion for women or those aged over 65 (National Institute ofAlcohol and Alcoholism, 2005). Among the multiple question- naires available to screen for unhealthy alcohol use, AUDIT- Consumption (AUDIT-C) offe rs a 3-item inventory of the quantity and frequency of unhea lthy alcohol use (Fiellin et al., 2000). It is generally sensitiv e (81 to 94%) and specic (82 to 86%) but can be subjected to inaccurate or untruthfulresponses.(Bradley et al., 2003, 2007; Gordon et al., 2001). Serum biomarkers such as the %carbohydrate decient transferrin (%CDT) test can provide objective evidence ofunhealthy alcohol use. Heavy daily consumption of alcoholfor 2 weeks or more triggers a positive test. Studies have found that %CDT has high specicity (77 to 100%) but vari- able sensitivity (10 to 85%) (B erner et al., 2006; Koch et al., 2004; Miller and Anton, 2004). Performance estimates vary depending on whether the goal of screening is to detect veryheavy drinking (>60 to 80 g of ethanol or more than 5 to 7drinks per day) or the at-r isk amounts dened above. %CDT has been widely used in Europe (Miller and Anton, 2004) and the United States Food and Drug AdministrationFrom the Hospital Medicine Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine (AK), Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (KLK, KJS, MSR), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;Section of Decision Sciences and Clinical Systems Modeling, Univer- sity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (KJS, MSR), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Clinical Addiction Research and Education Unit,Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston Medical Center, andDepartment of Epidemiology and Youth Alcohol Prevention Center, Boston University School of Public Health (RS), Boston, Massachusetts.

Although %CDT has the advantage of being an objectivetest, it has a low positive predi ctive value if used as the sole screening tool (Aertgeerts et al., 2001) and is expensive(Coulton et al., 2006). Nevertheless, multiple experts havesuggested that alcohol biomarkers like %CDT can be usefulin clinical settings including pr imary care (Miller et al., 2006). There are few published data about who should be tested with %CDT, how %CDT should be integrated with question-naires such as AUDIT-C, and for which patient groups%CDT screening is most cost-effective. Decision analysis is a systema tic explicit, quantitative way of making decisions in health care that can lead to bothenhanced decisions and better outcomes for patients (Hunink et al., 2001). In its most basic form, the modeler builds a deci- sion tree and inputs the probability and value of each out- come derived from some combination of original data andthe published medical literature. The modeler then associatescosts and effects with each outcome. Cost-effectiveness maythen be calculated as the cost divided by the benet, the latterbeing expressed in disease-specic units such as the number ofstrokes averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained,or in monetary units itself. When monetary units are used tocalculate benet, the analysis is termed a cost-benet analysis. Dillie and colleagues (2005) a ssessed the cost-benet of %CDT screening in primary care but focused on diabetic andhypertensive patients and did not assess the value of adding%CDT to established screeni ng questionnaires. We con- ducted a comprehensive, litera ture-based decision analysis computer model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of %CDTtesting both alone and combined with questionnaire to screen for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care. METHODS Framework and Decision Model We conducted our analysis following the recommendations of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Hea lth and Medicine (Panel on Cost- Effectiveness), (Russell et al., 1996; Siegel et al., 1996; Weinsteinet al., 1996). We adopted a societal perspective, including costs and effects incurred both by patients r eceiving care and institutions pro- viding care. The target population included adult men and women (ages 18 to 100 years) in primary care. The time horizon, or periodover which costs and effects were aggregated, was from screeninguntil death or age 100 years. We modeled 4 strategies for detec ting unhealthy alcohol use in pri- mary care using TreeAge Pro 2007 Suite software (TreeAge SoftwareInc., Williamstown, MA). The 4 str Only, using AUDIT-C; (ii) %CDT only; (iii) Questionnaire followed Fig. 1. Decision tree of four strategies to screen for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care. ( A) A clinician can screen a primary care patient once for unhealthy alcohol by one of four strategies. ( B) Once a patient tests positive by a screening test, he or she moves into the full assessment phase. In the full assessment, clinicians ask questions to determine if the test result is a true or false positive and determine if there is an alcohol disorder. Then, th ere is a probability that the clinician delivers a treatment (brief intervention fo r at-risk drinking or abuse) or refers to specialty alcohol treatment for alcohol depen- dence. Finally, there is a chance that the treatment succeeds, placing the unhealthy drinker into a safer health state. Patients then enter the Markov model i no n eo fs i xh e a l t hs t a t e s( s e eF i g .2 ) .2 KAPOOR ET AL.by %CDT (Questionnaire-%CDT) if the questionnaire is negative; and (iv) No Screening (case-nding only in which the clinician does not screen but discovers unhealthy u se through the course of caring for a patient; Fig. 1). The Question naire Only strategy models current guidelines from national organi zations including the USPSTF and NIAAA. The Questionnaire-%CDT st rategy allows direct assess- ment of the cost-effectiveness of adding %CDT to the current recom-mended questionnaire-based screening strategy. The initial part of the decision mod el simulated one-time screening, assessment, and intervention for the spectrum of unhealthy alcoholuse, including at-risk drinking, alcohol abuse, and dependence. ForAUDIT-C, we considered a score of 5 (out of a possible 12 points) positive for a man and 2 positive for a woman (Bradley et al., 2003, 2007; Gordon et al., 2001). The cut-off for %CDT was 2.6% as rec-ommended by the manufacturers (A xis Shield ASA, Oslo, Norway; Berner et al., 2006). We assumed all screen-positive patients com- pleted a full clinical assessment (i.e ., the gold standard) for unhealthy alcohol use. Following this asse ssment, we modeled the probability that a patient would receive a brief intervention and the probability that a delivered intervention was successful. For alcohol dependence, we also modeled the probability that a patient would receive formalalcohol treatment which includes a c ourse of cognitive behavioral (or similarly effective) therapy. If brief intervention were successful, a patient with at-risk drinking or alcohol abuse converted to safe drinking. If formal alcohol treatme nt worked, a patient with alcohol dependence converted to a recove ry state. Such conversions are also possible in untreated groups. This ''screening effect'' is a benecial reduction in drinking that occurs from the mere detection and veri- cation of disease. Because we are uncertain if this effect would occurin real world (as opposed to research) conditions, we only applied this effect to the No Screening stra tegy in the base case, biasing the analysis against screening strategies.Patients nished the initial alcohol screening and intervention part of the model in 1 of 6 mutually exclusive alcohol-related health states (Fig. 2). We then used a Markov model to track the transitionsamong these 6 health states f r o mt h et i m eo fs c r e e n i n g intervention until death. The time frame of the rst part of the model (Fig. 1) is the time it takes for screening, assessment, and treatment to occur (i.e., rangingfrom a single clinic visit for an individual who screens negative or screens positive and receives brief in tervention at the screening visit, and up to multiple visits for an individual who is alcohol-dependentand receives alcohol treatment). The ''time frame'' of the second partof the model, the Markov model (Fig. 2), is from the time immedi- ately after screening assessment intervention until death or the age of 100 years. Probabilities and Health State Utilities For each probability estimate we s earched Medline (1950 to spring 2007), spoke with experts, and consulted the documents of authori- ties such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For each parameter, we chose the highest qua lity evidence available but when there was uncertainty about the tru e value among equally good data, we made a conservative choice that biased against %CDT screening. For %CDT performance, we included data from a study of primarycare patients in Germany screened for at-risk drinking (Berner et al.,2006). There was no such study from a population in the U.S. Because research on %CDT has mostly involved testing for very heavy alcohol use (e.g., >80 g ethanol or 6 drinks day for a man and >40 g ethanol or 3 drinks day for a woman), we also calculated the cost-effectiveness of %CDT testi ng using discrete diagnostic per- formance estimates for detecting very heavy drinkers compared with the remaining unhealthy drinking population. For these %CDT per-formance estimates, we us ed a large, multi-cente r international trial of patients from a range of recrui tment settings (not primary care; Holder, 1998) (Table 1). For efcacy of brief interventi on, we used estimates from a 5 to 10 minute brief intervention trial (Ockene et al., 1999). We operation- alized efcacy with 2 variables f or the transition from the at risk drinking or abuse state to safe state. The transition rate in the groupreceiving screening and brief intervention was 39%. The same transi-tion in the group receiving scree ning alone was 28% indicating a net effect of 11%. We derived health state transi tion probabilities from 2 well- established longitudinal studies conducted in the U.S. (Kerr et al., 2002; Schuckit et al., 2001). To calc ulate survival, we consulted the published literature (Arias, 2006; Dawson, 2000). To calculate quality-adjusted survival, we mult iplied survival by health state utilities previously measured by our group (Kraemer et al., 2005). Utilities represent a degree of preference for 1 health state (scored between 0 and 1) versus a perfect health state (utility of 1). Costs We calculated initial costs for screening and treatment in 2006 U.S. dollars. Our estimates for sc reening costs represent current Medicare reimbursement for physician time and lab testing (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, 2006a,b). To aggregate direct health carecosts in the future, we used data fro m the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2004). We also did not include cost incurred to people injured by the index patient nor productivity gains for treated patients experiencingimproved health. For alcohol dependence and abuse, we assigned amultiplier to the baseline annual costs provided by MEPS. There are conflicting reports about the costs for at-risk drinking and so we a s s u m e da t - r i s kd r i n k i n gh a dn oe f f e c to nd i r e c th e a l t hc a r ec o s t s(multiplier = 1.0; Dillie et al., 2005; Holder, 1998; Mertens et al., 2005).

To calibrate tran- sition rates for the above health s tates, we performed 1,000 model simulations starting with the previo usly mentioned transition rates. From the simulations, we calcula ted the proportion transitioningout of abstinence over a lifetime in 4 age and gender strata for which there was published information available (Adams and Schoenborn, 2006). Similarly, we ca lculated the proportions transi- tioning into dependence in these strata and compared these values to the published information (Daw son et al., 2005).

We thenrepeated simulations, each time adj usting transition rates until the proportions approximated the published data. We did not nd information about the age of transition for other health states andused the published (uncalibrated) rates in those cases. Analysis We calculated the incremental cos t-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the difference in costs between the l east expensive strategy and the next least expensive strategy divi ded by the difference in their effec- tiveness (measured both in unadjusted life years and QALYs). Theratio is expressed as how much addi tionally it costs (in dollars) to achieve an additional QALY. Polic y makers are interested in the ICER value because it accounts for the fact that there was a lessexpensive option when making a sel ection from competing programs (Hunink et al., 2001). Interpreting the results of cost-effectiveness analysis can be problematic, makin g it difcult to decide whether to adopt a diagnostic test or treatme nt. The threshold for adoption in the Unites States is thought to be somewhere between $20,000 QALY and $100,000 Q A L Y ,w i t hat h r e s h o l do f $50,000 QALY frequently proposed (Bell et al., 2006). In the base case, we examined the cost-effecti veness in a hypothetical cohort of 50 year olds. We then repeated t h i sa n a l y s i si n2 5 y e a ro l d sa n d 75 year olds. We discounted all future health costs and QALYs by 3%. We conducted 1-way and selected 2-way sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of uncertainty in individual parameter values on the ICER for the Questionnaire-% CDT strategy compared with the Questionnaire Only strategy. We also performed probabilistic sensi- tivity analysis (a process that invol ves specifying distributions for model input parameters and the n sampling simultaneously from these distributions to assess the joi nt effect of input parameter uncer- tainty). RESULTS Model predicted proportions of transition out of the non- drinker state and of dependenc e onset calibrated well, falling within 2% of published probabilities (Table A1).

The Questionnaire Only strategy dominated the No Screening strategy in virtually all age cohorts. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that at the $50,000 QALY threshold, the Questionnaire -%CDT strategy was favored in 64% of the simulations compared to the Questionnaire Onlywhich was favored 35% of the time (Fig. 5). DISCUSSION Our analysis indicates that adding %CDT to questionnaire based one-time screening is cost- effective in typical primary care conditions. In 50 year olds, the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy costs $15,500 per QALY gained when compared tothe Questionnaire Only strate gy. Compared with the Ques- tionnaire Only strategy, the Qu estionnaire-%CDT strategy was favored at a threshold of $50,000 QALY when the prev- alence of unhealthy alcohol use exceeded 15% and the age atscreening was <60 years. The Questionnaire Only strategydominated the No Screening s trategy in virtually all age cohorts. Screening with the % CDT test alone was not cost- effective. We provide evidence for intens ifying screening to detect unhealthy alcohol use in primary care by adding a %CDTtest when questionnaire screening is negative. Our analysisFig. 3.

We found that adding %CDT toquestionnaire screening was cost -effective (achieved better outcome but at a higher, though generally acceptable, cost)but not cost-saving. Some peopl e informally summarize such interventions as ''good value.'' Unlike the previous analysis, we accounted for incomplete follow-up of %CDT, potential need for a second visit to address the positive result, and poorprovider performance in deliver ing treatment (Burman et al., 2004; Saitz et al., 2003). Our analysis also included the longterm cost and effects of screening with %CDT and includedpatient time costs and out of pocket expenses (i.e., the societalperspective). The base case ICER value of $15,500 QALY compares favorably with the cost -effectiveness of other cur- rently accepted screening p rograms\u2014e.g. one-time HIV screening ($33,000 QALY) (Paltiel et al., 2006) or colonos- copy every 10 years compared with annual fecal occult bloodtesting or no screening ($12,000 to 18,000 life year; Pignone et al., 2002). Our conclusion also differed from Coulton and colleagues (2006) who found the cost per patient screened was 20-foldgreater for %CDT compared with questionnaire based screening in Welsh males. This group did not, however, ana- lyze the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding %CDT toquestionnaire-based screening as in the current study and didnot account for potential downstream costs saved, mortalityavoided, and quality of life improved. There are several limitations to this work. There is no single estimate for the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use in pri- mary care. Prevalence varies by gender, race, ethnicity, geog- raphy, and duration but has been reported in multiple studies (Manwell et al., 1998; Taj et al., 1998) to be more than 20%using the current NIAAA denition we adopted for our anal-ysis. We chose prevalence estim ates from a study by Manwell and colleagues (1998) in which 21,282 patients in Wisconsinwere screened for unhealthy al c o h o lu s e .T h a ts t u d yr e p o r t e d a90-day prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use of 23%, com- bined for all ages and both genders. The study included oneof the largest U.S. primary care samples available and it pro-vided data about the spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use. Oursensitivity analysis suggests t he Questionnaire-%CDT strat- egy would still be cost-e ffective (at the $50,000 QALY thresh- old) in a lower prevalence scenario when the age at screening is less than 60 years. There is also no single way to administer brief intervention and therefore no single estima te for the transition rate from at-risk drinking to safe drinking levels. We believe our choicefor the value of the transition rate (i.e., 39%) after brief inter-vention was conservative. Other studies such as Project Treat(Fleming et al., 1997) using a longer initial BI and incorporat-ing follow-up contacts have described the effect to be larger but we believe a one-time, 5 to 10 minute intervention was the one most likely to resemble how physicians actually con-duct brief intervention. Comparisons with other brief inter-vention trials such as those included in a recent systematicreview (Beich et al., 2003) are limited by exclusion of subjectswith lower levels of risky alcohol. Another limitation of the Ma rkov modeling technique we used is that the transition probabilities depend only on the current state and not on the history of past states. For exam- ple, individuals in the at-risk drinking state in a given 1-yearcycle had the same probability of transitioning into otherstates regardless of their drinking state in prior cycles. We didnot have information about the rate of transition from safe toat-risk drinking for an individual with a prior history of at-risk drinking compared with someone without this history.We obtained information about transitions in drinking behav- ior from a study by Kerr and colleagues (2002) based on the National Health Nutrition Examination Survey. Transitionrates provided by Kerr and colleagues represent the rate oftransitions at the aggregate level. This includes individualswith and without a prior history of at-risk drinking. We Fig. 5.

QALY, quality adjusted life year.8 KAPOOR ET AL.therefore believe that the transition rates we used are an accu- rate representation of the transitions fr om safe to at-risk drinking, at the aggr egate level. For individuals with a history of alcohol dependence, this ''amnestic'' property of Markovmodels was mitigated by the high rate of relapse built into theRecovery state. Other limitations include absence of conditional diagnostic test performance data for %CDT (i.e., the sensitivity and specicity in a population already having tested negative by questionnaire). We believe bi omarker screening has a diag- nostic performance that is inde pendent from questionnaire performance. Our estimate fo r %CDT performance to detect unhealthy alcohol use was a conservative choice from thelimited trials set in general primary care. Had we chosen touse discrete diagnostic performance data for detecting veryheavy drinkers, as in the previ ously mentioned sensitivity analysis, the economic implications would not have changed substantially. We also did not have information about the effectiveness of brief intervention or alco hol treatment in a group testing negative by questionnaire. Brief i ntervention is likely to be less successful in a group testing negative by questionnaire. Suchindividuals may be feigning low risk use or they may be infre-quent risky drinkers, and in ei ther case less likely to change, although the exact magnitude of th e differential effectiveness is not known. We did not have information about the clinical effect of ordering a blood test in patien ts denying unhealthy alcohol use. Patients who take offense from being asked to conrmtheir reported drinking behavior with %CDT may decidenot to discuss their alcohol use or other medical problems asfreely with their provider. They may even decide to sever relations with this provider. We believed the frequency of these untoward consequences would be low and therefore did not model any costs for the deterioration or discontinua-tion in the patient-provider rel ationship. We feel the decision to not to model these costs, howe ver, was still a conservative choice given that mention of objective corroboration of aperson's report with %CDT will likely prime an admissionof unhealthy use for a large p ercentage of primary care patients, thereby obviating the need and cost for the test. In addition, at least 1 study sug gests that the use of %CDT can provide motivation for some pa tients to reduce their alcohol use (Fleming et al., 2004). The exact direction of the biasimposed by our balanced modelin g assumptions (i.e., that all patients who screened negative by the questionnaire wouldundergo the blood test and that no patient would voluntarilydisclose their drinking status upon broaching the issue of bi- omarker screening) is unknown and represents area for future inquiry. Lastly, we did not model all possible consequences of a false-positive %CDT result. There is no consensus for theworkup of elevated %CDT results and false-positive resultsmay occur in patients underreporting alcohol use (i.e., thegold standard interviews us ed to assess performance are imperfect). Future research should assess %CDT perfor-mance and treatment effectiven ess in a cohort testing negative by questionnaire, patient and provider acceptability of theQuestionnaire-%CDT strategy , and the implications of false- positive %CDT results. In conclusion, adding %CDT to questionnaire based one-time screening for unheal thy alcohol use was cost-effec- tive in typical primary care conditions and, at minimum,clinicians should screen all p atients with a questionnaire. Some clinicians may consider ordering %CDT after a nega- tive screening questionnaire for adults up to age 60 whenthe prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use is 15% or more.However, despite its cost-effec tiveness, issues around effec- tiveness of brief intervention in a questionnaire negativegroup, patient acceptability of blood testing in this samegroup, and management of false-positive results should bebetter studied before we can recommend widespread use of %CDT.

They represent a community-based adaptation ofurban health systems to the specific needs of homeless persons. This article examines whether post-hospital discharge to a homeless medical respite program was associated with a reduced chance of 90-day readmission compared to other disposition options. Adjust- ing for imbalances in patient characteristics using propensity scores, respite patients were the only group that was significantly less likely to be readmitted within 90 days compared to those released to Own Care. Respite programs merit attention as a potentially efficacious service for homeless persons leaving the hospital. KEYWORDS discharge planning, health services, homeless, read- mission, retrospective studies The homeless, estimated to number 744,000 at a single point in time (NationalAlliance to End Homelessness, 2007), are subject to poor health status and excess mortality (Levy & O'Connell, 2004), and are also more likely to report being unable to obtain needed health care (Kushel, Vittingoff, & Haas, 2001). Homeless individuals experience high rates of hospitalization and prolonged length of stay relative to housed persons, and face distinct challenges forcomplete medical recovery after an acute medical hospitalization (Levy et al., 2004). Neither shelters, which often require vacating the premises during day- light hours, nor the streets support adherence to post-hospital medical recom- mendations (e.g., elevating an infected leg, administering insulin, adhering to a diet, or seeing a doctor). Lack of appropriate post-hospital disposition options for homeless inpatients may lead to unexpected hospital readmissions, espe- cially for homeless persons with no safe place to heal. The videotaped incident of a 63-year-old homeless woman transported via taxi from a suburban hospi- tal to Los Angeles's skid row, and released to the street in gown and slippers, pricks the conscience, but national publicity regarding this common commu- nity challenge is rare (Winton & DiMassa, 2006). In response to this challenge, 48 communities across the United States and Canada have adopted homeless medical respite programs; Boston, inparticular, has offered respite care and 24-hour accommodations for home- less persons for nearly two decades. Nationally, respite services vary accord- ing to local needs and funding, but typically include a bed, meals, transportation to appointments, and care by a wide range of clinicians famil- iar with caring for homeless persons (Buchanan, Doblin, Sai, & Garcia, 2006). Respite programs exemplify a more general principle of customizing clinical practice and systems of care to respond to the unique needs and life circum-stances of persons experiencing homelessness.130 13 April 2009Although respite programs could be justified on the basis of pragmatic necessity alone, their continued operation and financial support remains tenuous, as medical respite care for homeless individuals, unlike hospicecare, is not a recognized or reimbursed category of service among major health payers such as Medicare and Medicaid. Hospitals and health plan administrators considering proposals for respite programs would like to see evidence of efficacy in either reducing costs, improving health outcomes, or at the very least, reducing the demand for scarce acute hospital beds. To date, both financial and logistic barriers have precluded the use of a random- ized controlled trial to study medical respite care, and observational data cur- rently provide the only evidence relating to these questions. Observational data from a Chicago respite program suggested that discharge from a county hospital to a local respite program was associated with significantly fewer days of hospital care during the subsequent12 months, compared to persons referred to respite but not accepted due to lack of space (Buchanan et al., 2006). Chicago's respite accepted only patients of low medical acuity, and thus excluded individuals requiring 24-hour nursing supervision or onsite physician services. By contrast, Boston's respite program provides 24-hour nursing supervision, daily visits by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, onsite physician supervision, in-house dental and psychiatric care, and case management. Equipped for patients in more substantial need, the program has helped free up acute inpatient services in local hospitals since 1985. Because of high local need, Boston's respite unit has typically run above 90%capacity. As a result, some hospitalized homeless patients have been dis- charged from the safety net hospital back to their customary living environ- ments (e.g., streets and shelters), and to other care settings such as private nursing homes and a publicly funded recuperative hospital. The latter options are similar to approaches used in communities where no home- less-customized respite program exists, and therefore provide a natural com- parison that could complement the study reported by Buchanan et al. (2006). In this report of data collected over 3 years in Boston, we compared 90-day hospital readmission among patients discharged to respite versus other set- tings, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics, including burdenof illness. METHOD Participants We used administrative data to retrospectively identify a cohort of homeless persons, 18 or older, surviving at least one non-maternity, medical or surgical hospital admission to Boston Medical Center during July 1, 1998-June 30, 2001. Each subject's first eligible admission in this April 2009was analyzed, thereby permitting statistical methods appropriate for independent and uncorrelated data. Because housing status is not regularly documented in medical records, we identified individuals as homeless if they had at least one outpatient encounter at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) within /C6365 days of the index admission to Boston Medical Center (BMC), an approach used by others (Martell et al., 1992). BHCHP serves over 7,000 homeless individuals annually, identified from over 60 outreach sites. A convenience sample of 10 individuals' clinical records found 9 had explicit mentions of ''homeless'' or ''living on the streets'' in the hospital discharge summary; some participants could have been homeless before or after the hospitalization but not on the day of hospitalization. Boston's respite program (''Respite'' hereafter) included 90 beds for men and women at the time of these data, receiving 1,600 admissionsyearly, with 30-35 %from inpatient medical hospitals, the remainder from emergency departments, shelters, the streets, and outpatient clinics. Its services include daily medical care, 24-hour nursing, a psychiatrist, case management, in-house dental care, and medication administration. It serves a severely distressed population: among 306 randomly reviewed records of men admitted to respite, 90 %had active substance abuse disorders (not including current tobacco or past drug =alcohol) and 53 %had a DSM-IV non-addiction psychiatric diagnosis. Among 104 women, 75 %had active substance abuse disorders and 85 %had non-addiction psychiatric diag- noses. Seventy-seven percent of male and female admissions were home- less more than one year. Persons with four or more major medical illnesses, active substance abuse, and a non-substance abuse psychiatric diagnosis accounted for 40 %of male and 55 %of female respite admissions, respectively (O'Connell & Swain, 2001). Procedure In general, a decision to discharge a hospitalized patient to Respite involved the combined inputs of caregivers (residents, attending physicians, nurses, case managers, Boston Health Care for the Homeless visiting staff, shelterpersonnel), the patient, and potential receiving facilities (the Respite, shelters, and other potential settings, such as nursing homes). Typically hospital staff propose Respite for patients requiring additional service (e.g., dressing changes), observation, or a safe nonhomeless environment as a pre- requisite to medical recovery outside of the hospital. Importantly, payment had little influence on disposition given the high rate of insurance among patients seen by BHCHP (85 %, mostly Medicaid) and the availability of multi- ple public and private funding mechanisms for both Respite and Other Planned Care, including a state-funded secondary care hospital as well asan uncompensated care pool (Bovjberg & Ullman, 2002).132 BMC's Medical Information System identified 858 persons who had a BHCHP outpatient visit within /C6365 days of an index hospi- talization. We re-queried BMC's Medical Information System for all hospital andhospital-based ambulatory encounters from January 1, 1998 (6 months prior to July 1, 1998) to June 1, 2002 (11 months after June 30, 2001). This permitted us to: Apply exclusions: Of 858 patients, 14 were hospitalized for childbirth (mother and infant care is not available through Respite), 35 did not survive to hospital discharge, 41 had unplanned medical discharges against advice, and 3 records could not be found (likely due to interval changes in identi- fiers). We also excluded 22 who had been readmitted within 24 hours of discharge, because it is fairly common for discharges to other facilities to be redirected to Respite during the first post-dicharge day. Identify endpoints: We then identified BMC readmissions within 90 days of hospital discharge. Death within that 90-day period was compiled from BHCHP's Homeless Death Database and the Massachusetts' Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (1998-2001). The 8 persons who died (2 Respite, 3 Own Care, and 3 Other Care) were not included in the analysis of readmission outcome, leaving 735 (134, 171, and 430, respectively). Obtain diagnostic information: We captured diagnoses from all BMC encounters for the index admission and the 6 prior months, including inpatient care, BHCHP's own primary care clinic at BMC, emergency, and outpatient specialty services. Measures One of three discharge dispositions was identified for each participant: Respite. This category included persons referred to Respite up to one day after hospital discharge. Delayed referrals occurred when street =shelter clinicians encountered a newly discharged patient who appeared to require a place (i.e., Respite) in which to recover. Including such indivi- duals in the Respite group reduced misclassification of disposition status. Own Care. Homeless patients described in administrative hospital records as discharged ''home'' (the administrative system did not include a field for discharge to streets and shelters). Other Planned Care. Non-Respite patients discharged to supervised recup- erative care (e.g., skilled nursing facilities, chronic care hospitals, or home health care). The primary study endpoint was inpatient hospital readmission /C2090 days from discharge, a timeframe appropriate for judging the adequacy of dis- charge planning. A key interest was to compare readmission for Respite ver-sus discharge to streets or shelters (Own Care), the default in mostHomeless Medical Respite 133Downloaded By: 2009communities. However, other post-discharge settings including nursing homes (Other Planned Care) were considered, because these are often relied on in the absence of a Respite program (Gundlapalli et al., 2005). Financial costs were estimated for all patients based on charges at the referring hospital (Boston Medical Center). For Respite patients, we esti-mated costs related to Respite care through reference to (a) average reimbur- sement to the Respite (per patient day) during the period studied and (b) the duration of each Respite stay. All figures were inflation-adjusted to 2002 dollars, and do not include costs for Other Planned Care facilities, or system-wide costs resulting from discharge of homeless, medically ill indivi- duals to shelters or streets (e.g., ambulance, additional emergency room visits, additional shelter-based services, and jails), because the latter costs were not available. Although hospital charges tend to overstate hospital costs (thereby inflating the cost savings from reduced hospital days), this bias maybe offset by the failure to count the money saved through likely reductions in these other publicly funded services. Additional covariates, drawn from the hospital readmission literature (Corrigan & Martin, 1992) included: age, sex, race =ethnicity, length of the index hospital admission, presence in the record of drug and alcohol abusediagnostic codes during the admission or the preceding 6 months, and medical illness burden. The latter was estimated using the Diagnostic Cost Groups (DCG) risk score (Ash et al., 2000), calculated from all medical and psychiatric diagnoses coded during the index admission and during the prior 6 months ofinpatient and outpatient care at Boston Medical Center, including onsite pri- mary care and mental health services from BHCHP. The DCG method, often used by health plans to predict high-cost patients, generates a numerical esti- mate for expected health service utilization, and has been shown to predict mortality, utilization, and health costs (Petersen, Pietz, Woodard, & Byrne, 2005). DxCG 6.1 for Windows software was used, applying a DCG model calibrated to Massachusetts Medicaid experience for 2000-2001. Data Analysis The primary unadjusted analysis compared 90-day readmissions among per- sons discharged to Respite, Own Care (i.e., streets and shelters), and Other Planned Care. In the absence of a prospective randomized controlled trial, the adjusted analysis relied on a statistical technique (propensity scores) to match groups inregard to their likelihood of being discha rged to Respite. Propensity adjustment reduces the bias affecting retrospective observational comparisons (Braitman &Rosenbaum, 2002; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983), and is simplest to apply to 2- group comparisons. Therefore, each subject's propensity to be discharged to Respite versus Own Care was calculated wit h multivariable logistic regression, using the covariates listed earlier. For the 13 April 2009observations were weighted according t o the propensity score so that the two groups being compared had the same overal l propensity to be assigned to either discharge disposition. Speci fic weights were computed as: 1 =(propensity to be discharged to Respite) for each Respite observation, and 1 =(1-propensity to be discharged to Respite) for each Own Care observation (Hirano & Imbens, 2001). This method is similar to propensi ty score approaches that match indivi- duals having similar propensities (but who r eceived different treatments). Instead of dropping unmatched participants, however, it retains all subject data. With propensity-weighted data, we computed the association between discharge disposition (Respite versus Own Care) and 90-day readmission using a logistic regression model that included the covariates of age, race, sex, index hospital length of stay, DCG score, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Secondarily, both the propensity score and logistic regression analysis were repeated to compare readmissions for Other Planned Care versus Respite. We compared the 90-day total costs (combining inpatient hospital read- missions and, where applicable, Respite charges) for patients discharged to Respite versus Own Care, in both unadjusted ( t-test) and adjusted analyses, the latter incorporating propensity-weighted data in a multiple linear regres- sion adjusted for the same measured potential confounds. A comparison of costs for Respite versus Other Planned Care was not undertaken because Other Planned Care costs could not be obtained. Because over 85 %of patients had insurance, and Massachusetts pro- vided back-up funding options for persons without insurance, we did notinclude this variable in the statistical model. All analyses were carried out with SAS System for Windows (Version 8.2). RESULTS Of the 743 individuals discharged from the hospital, 136 (17 %) were dis- charged to Respite, 174 (22 %) to Other Planned Care, and 433 (55 %)t o Own Care. Compared to Own Care, Respite patients were older, more likely to be White, less likely to be female, and somewhat more likely to have record of Alcohol Abuse, but less likely to have record of Drug Abuse (Table 1). The index hospital stay was roughly 3 days longer among those discharged to Respite and to Other Planned Care settings, and extremely short hospital stays(0-2 days) were less common among Respite compared to other patients (see Table 1). At 90 days, 8 patients had died (2 discharged to Respite, 3 to Own Care and 3 to Other Care), leaving 735 for readmission analysis. Early Readmission Readmission by 90 days occurred among 156 patients (21.2 %of the sample). There was no difference in the proportion readmitted in comparisons not adjusted for patient characteristics (Table 1).Homeless Medical Respite 135Downloaded By: [Kertesz, Stefan] At: 22:45 13 April 2009As expected, some potentially adverse characteristics were associated with readmission. For example, readmission was more common among per- sons discharged following index hospital stays lasting six or more days (31%), compared to shorter stays (21 %for 3-5 days, and 15 %for 0-2 days) and among those with higher versus mid-range or lower illness burden asmeasured by DCG score. Both characteristics were more common amongTABLE 1 Characteristics of 743 Homeless Individuals Discharged from Boston Medical Center (July 1, 1998-June 30, 2001) by Discharge Dispositiona ALL Respite Other Planned Care Own Care pb n 743 136 174 433 Age in years <40 26 % 19% 46.9 (11.0) 48.5 (11.8) 48.6 (10.6) 45.7 (10.8) Sex Female 20 1% 41% 37% 14% Mean LOS (SD) 4.6 (5.3) 6.4 (5.9) 6.1 (7.2) 3.5 (2.7) <0.001 Illness burden (DCG)c0.002 Low 13 % 10% 5% 17% 21% 23% 18% Mean Illness Burden score (SD)c1.1 (1.0) 1.1 (0.9) 1.2 (1.0) 1.1 (1.0) Note: Italicized comparisons are significant p<.05. aPercentages do not consistently add to 100 %due to rounding. bp-values reflect a 3-group comparison (Respite versus Own Care versus Other Planned Care) by Chi- squared test or analysis of variance ( df\u00bc2), with a\u00bc0.05, 2-tailed. cIllness burden computed with the Diagnostic Cost Group (DCG) prospective relative risk score based on diagnoses recorded during 180 days previous to, and during, the index admission.

Propensity models were moderately robust in their capacity to predict each patient's likelihood to be discharged to Respite, compared to Own Care(c\u00bc.76, range 0-1, with 1 indicating perfect fit between the modeled pro- pensity and the actual treatment assigned). To illustrate, when individualswere divided by quintiles based on propensity to be discharged to Respite, patients in the highest quintile had about 8 times greater likelihood of discharge to Respite (56 of 109 persons, 51 %), compared to patients in the lowest quintile (7 of 109, 6.4 %). Table 2 shows that prior to balancing for propensity to be discharged to Respite, the Respite and Own Care groups differed substantially on severalcharacteristics.

Italicized comparisons are significant at the p<.05 level, 2-tailed, applying Chi-squared and t-tests, 2009characteristics that predicted readmission, were greater for Respite patients. The right side of Table 2 also shows that these characteristics were more clo- sely matched after reweighting the data with propensity scores. In the final adjusted model comparing Respite to Own Care (Table 3), Respite patients had significantly reduced odds of hospital readmission by90 days in comparison to Own Care patients. The estimate for Other Planned Care, compared to Own Care, also suggested reduced odds for readmission (OR\u00bc0.70; 95 %CI 0.46-1.06), but the association was not significant at the .05 level (full model not shown, but available from the authors). Total Charges The mean charges for a Respite stay were $7,929 ( SD\u00bc$8,649) with mean length of stay 31.3 days ( SD\u00bc32.6, median \u00bc20). The mean 90-day charges for individuals discharged to Respite, summing Respite and (where TABLE 3 Predictors of Hospital Readmission Within 90 Days of Discharge Among Homeless Persons in Boston Discharged to Medical Respite Versus Discharge to Their Own Care (1998-2001) Respite versus own care Odds ratio (95 %confidence interval) Discharge DispositionRespite 0.54 (0.34-0.85) Own Care (0.28-0.85) 3-5 days 1.0 (0.16-1.21)Medium 1.0 abuse 1.11 0.90 (0.47-1.72) Note: Results for a single multivariable logistic regression are shown, adjusted for all variables displayed, using propensity score-weighted data to minimize heterogeneity between the Respite versus Own Care disposition groups; italicized comparisons are significant at mean readmission charges of $2,819 ( SD\u00bc$8,064) among patients discharged to Own Care, t(187)\u00bc7.68, p<.001. This comparison does not take into account the adverse characteristics associated with being a Respite candidate, or savings from reduced hospital readmissions at 90 days. In adjusted analysis, a Respite disposition was associated with \u00fe$5994 (95 %CI, $4,210-$7,779) in excess charges, relative to Own Care. The potentially higher Costs of Other Planned Care were not available to this study, and are discussed later. DISCUSSION In this sample, patients discharged to Boston's medical respite program hadsome characteristics associated with elevated risk for hospital readmission within 90 days, but in unadjusted analyses they were not readmitted more often than patients discharged to the streets and shelters, or to care facilities. In analyses controlling for individual characteristics, discharge to a homeless respite program was associated with an approximately 50 %reduction in the odds of readmission at 90 days post-discharge, compared to discharge to streets and shelters (Own Care), similar to what was found in Chicago by Buchanan et al. (2006). Other Planned Care settings, such as nursing homes,did not achieve a similarly robust reduction in the likelihood of readmission when compared to those released to Own Care. The Respite-associated reduction in readmission may reflect the pro- gram's customization for the complex problems of medically ill homeless individuals. Services included 24-hour nursing, as well as onsite physicians (including psychiatrists), nurse practitioners, physician assistants, casewor- kers, and a dental team, all experienced in homeless health care. Recupera- tive care was accompanied by interventions for other illnesses, arrangements for (and transportation to) continuing outpatient care, establishment of a new primary care relationship, spiritual care, 12-step meetings, and identification of social and financial resources. Although some of these services may existin other settings, few combine all these services for homeless individuals. The present report should be compared to one prior study of respite, comparing post-discharge hospital utilization among 161 homeless patients discharged to a Chicago respite versus 64 patients referred to respite but not accepted due to lack of space (Buchanan et al., 2006). The authors reported a 49 %reduction in hospital admissions in adjusted analyses. Our findings are not discordant, but reflect a program designed for patients with higher medical acuity, suggesting that a homeless respite program may some- times take the place of skilled nursing facilities. The analysis of measured costs, including hospital and respite care, sug- gest that a policy of discharging homeless patients to a respite program isHomeless Medical By: [Kertesz, Stefan] At: 22:45 2009potentially more expensive than a policy of discharging them to the streets and shelters. This inference is tempered, however, by lack of data concerning the full range of costs associated with discharging people into homelessness.Where those costs have been measured, notably among chronically home- less persons in New York City, the combined judicial, medical, and mental system costs associated with homelessness exceeded $40,000 per year (Culhane, Metraux, & Hadley, 2002). For policy makers the most relevant cost comparison may be the one this study could not formally accomplish, namely, between the Respite and Other Planned Care. A speculative estimate combining typical rehabilitative skilled nursing facility, professional fees, and the mean duration of post- hospital nursing home stays suggests that discharge to a non-respite nur- sing facility with professional services is likely to involve costs in the range of $4,512-$7,520 (Gundlapalli et al., 2005; Medicare Payment AdvisoryCommission, 2006). The mean cost of a discharge to Boston's Respite (M\u00bc$7,929, falling to $5,994 after adjustment for hospital readmission sav- ings) may be justifiable because: (a) Respite was associated with reduced 90-day readmission, while Other Planned Care settings were not, and (b) Respite offered a homeless-customized service model, as reviewed earlier. The principal limitation to this study is reliance on observational data. Given the nearly universal prevalence of medical, mental, and substance abuse problems among the Respite patients, it is unlikely that selection of a particularly healthy subgroup of homeless individuals biased theresults. Additionally, the analyses adjusted for measured confounds, some of which suggested that patients discharged to Respite were at higher readmission risk. This study's strengths include the use of multiple data sources to identify a large cohort of hospitalized homeless patients, producing one of the largest comparative studies of a medical service for homeless persons to date. Com- prehensive casemix adjustment and propensity scoring are important meth- odologic tools not previously applied to comparing interventions for the homeless. Given high hospital utilization by a growing homeless population, this study offers a methodological advance, and may lay the groundwork for a much-needed randomized trial of respite care in comparison to other carearrangements. It should be emphasized that the design of this particular study was dri- ven by our interest in an easily measured outcome, hospital readmission. However, Boston's respite program, like others, receives patients directly from emergency rooms, shelters, detoxification facilities, and the streets and may play a hospital diversion role unmeasured in the present study. In March of 2004, a coalition of homeless persons in Birmingham, Ala- bama, pleaded ''we need a surgical and hospital discharge shelter for the large number of us who are discharged from the hospital with no place torecuperate'' (Letter of March 24, 2004 to City Council of Birmingham,140 S. G. Kertesz 13 suggests that offering a safe ''place to recuperate'' could meet patients' needs while reducing hospital readmissions. The findings should spur further research, and lend impetus to recognition of this service. REFERENCES Ash, A. S., Ellis, R. P., Pope, G. C., Ayanian, J. Z., Bates, D. W., & Burstin, H., et al.

Malabanan, MD, and Jeffrey H. Samet, MD, MA, MPH Aim: To examine the prevalence and risk factors of low vitamin D status (vitamin D deciency or insufciency) among patients in amethadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program.Design: Cross-sectional study of subjects recruited from an MMT program in a higher latitude (Boston, MA).Measurements: Standardized survey and medical record review were used to assess patient characteristics. Serum was tested todetermine vitamin D deciency (25-hydroxyvitamin D /H1102120 and insufciency (25-hydroxyvitamin D between 20 and 30 ng/mL).Multivariable analyses were used to assess risk factors associatedwith vitamin D deciency.Findings: Low vitamin D status was found in 52% of the subjects (48 of 93), deciency in 36%, and insufciency in an additional16%. Older age (OR /H110053.47; 95% CI 1.31-9.22) and black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (OR 3.34; 95% CI 1.30 - 8.58) were signif-icantly associated with higher risk of vitamin D deciency.Conclusion: Low vitamin D status was present in a majority of patients recruited from an MMT program. This raises the question asto whether this is a generalizable phenomenon and whether thesepatients are at higher risk of complications of low vitamin D statusincluding bone pain, periodontal disease, osteomalacia, and cardio-vascular disease. Key Words: methadone maintenance, vitamin D, drug dependence, medical complications (J Addict Med 2009;3: 134-138) The Institute of Medicine1recently stated that co-occurring medical conditions in drug-dependent populations are a reality that merit attention and action. Effective medical careis often underutilized among individuals with substance-usedisorders, due in part to unawareness of treatable medical conditions. Attending to physical health problems may be ofparticular importance to individuals enrolled in methadonemaintenance treatment (MMT); opioid-dependent individualsin the United Sates tend to be older than opioid-dependentindividuals in other forms of addiction treatment. 2 Low vitamin D status, which we use to refer to either vitamin D deciency or insufciency, has been recognized ina variety of populations with medical conditions; yet, it hasreceived little attention in drug-dependent populations. 3-5 Examining vitamin D in individuals receiving MMT may beparticularly important, because low vitamin D status canresult in nonspecic musculoskeletal pain 6,7as well as and tooth loss,8conditions common in MMT patients.9,10Low vitamin D status can also lead to a higher risk of fracture by exacerbating osteoporosis,11a painless bone disease of low bone mass. Low bone density has alsobeen noted in opioid-dependent populations. 12,13 Low vitamin D status is more common than previously thought, ranging from 21% in an elderly low-income African-American population in Boston 3to 71% in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease.14The most important source of vitamin D is sunlight, the skin synthesis the vitaminfrom sunlight. Factors that affect vitamin D synthesis are thelevel of sunlight exposure (eg, season, latitude, and time ofday), diet, skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, and age. Better understanding of the contribution of vitamin D status to the bone health of MMT patients could lead topragmatic interventions to identify patients in addiction treat-ment who are at risk for vitamin D deciency and amelioratethe associated medical comorbidities. Thus, we sought toexamine the prevalence and risk factors of low vitamin Dstatus in a population enrolled in MMT. METHODS Study Design and Sampling This was a cross-sectional study of participants re- cruited from the 350 patients of the Boston Public HealthCommission's MMT program. Flyers were posted at theMMT program's dosing and counseling sites inviting patientsto participate in a study about bone health. Research associ-ates were present at the program to schedule research ap-pointments at the Boston University School of MedicineGeneral Clinical Research Center.

The study was con- ducted between August and December of 2003. The BostonUniversity Institutional Review Board approved the studyprotocol. Data Collection After providing written informed consent, study partic- ipants met with trained research associates for a standardizedinterview assessing the following: demographics, vitamin Dsupplementation (\"Have you taken vitamin D in the pastweek?\"), medical conditions associated with low vitamin Dstatus including chronic liver disease, chronic pancreatitis,and renal disease. Height and weight were measured tocalculate body mass index (weight [kg]/height 2[m]), because obesity (body mass index /H1135030) is associated with low vita- min D status in some populations.4Data on alcohol use,15 opioid use,12,13 and HIV infection16were collected, because they have been associated with low bone density. Medicalrecord review was performed to ascertain the presence ofmedications that are associated with low vitamin D statusincluding corticosteroids and antiepileptics (eg, phenytoin,carbamazepine, and phenobarbital). We used accepted denition of vitamin D deciency or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of /H1102120 ng/mL. 17 We also report the prevalence of vitamin D insufciency or 25-hydroxyvitamin D between 20 and 30 ng/mL. This issupported by the observation that elevated parathyroid hor-mone levels do not plateau until 25-hydroxyvitamin D levelsare above 30 ng/mL. One source of confusion stems from thefact that older articles used different cutoffs for the termsvitamin D deciency and insufciency. Despite this source ofconfusion, we included the prevalence of insufciency, be-cause although there is no consensus on the optimal range of25-hydroxyvitamin D, there is more agreement that levelsbetween 20 and 30 ng/mL are still suboptimal. 18,19 Statistical Analysis Analysis included descriptive statistics for all variables, such as using ttests for continuous variables and /H92732analysis or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. We used logistic regression models to examine the relationship between inde-pendent variables and vitamin D deciency. We used vitaminD deciency as the outcomes in these analyses, because it ismore widely known than vitamin D insufciency. The limitednumber of vitamin D deciency cases precluded models thatadjusted for all independent variables simultaneously. There-fore, separate adjusted models were created for each inde-pendent variable; all adjusted analyses included age, gender,and race/ethnicity. All statistical analyses were performedusing SAS version 8.2 (SAS System for Windows 2001; SASInstitute, NC). RESULTS Sample Characteristics Of the 350 patients enrolled in the MMT program, 106 volunteered to be included in the study. Thirteen (12%) wereexcluded due to inadequate venous access, which precludedserum collection. Of the remaining 93 subjects (Table 1), themajority were women (63%), black or Hispanic (58%), and overweight or obese (62%). Most of the subjects enteredMMT after a median of 11 years of heroin use. About halfhad been heavy drinkers for at least a year, but only 14%reported recent (past month) heavy alcohol use. Many sub-jects reported past month medical conditions associated withlow vitamin D deciency status including liver disease(54%), kidney disease (7%), and chronic pancreatitis (1%). Inaddition, 12% of the sample was taking medications associ-ated with vitamin D deciency. Despite multiple risk factorsfor vitamin D deciency, only 2 participants were taking anyform of vitamin D supplementation. No differences werefound between the entire MMT program population and thestudy sample in terms of P/H110050.48), gender ( P/H110050.65), or race/ethnicity was 36% (95% CI 26%- 45%). The prevalence of vitamin D insufciencywas found in an additional 16% (95% CI 9%-23%). Only 2participants reported having been informed by a doctor ofhaving vitamin D deciency before this study. Participantswere encouraged to give a letter with their 25-hydroxyvita-min D levels to his/her doctor. Individuals older than 40 years were more than 3 times likely to have vitamin D deciency (OR 3.47; 95% CI1.31-9.22). In addition, those who were either black orHispanic were more likely to be vitamin D decient (ORTABLE 1.

Recent heavy alcohol consump- tion, recent heroin use, and longer years in MMT wereassociated with a nonstatistically signicantly higher OR ofvitamin D deciency (Table 2). DISCUSSION More than half of the opioids-dependent population recruited from an MMT program had vitamin D status that isconsidered insufcient for optimal bone health. Althoughmedical comorbidities of substance-use disorders have re-ceived greater recognition recently, 20previous studies have not addressed vitamin D deciency or insufciency as amedical comorbidity. The ndings in this study suggest thatlow vitamin D status is common among individuals withopioid dependence and deserves greater attention as a treat- able medical issue in this population. How does this estimate of low vitamin D status of patients on chronic methadone treatment compare with otherpopulations in the literature? Methodological differences canoften explain vitamin D differences between studies; thefollowing similarities made it possible to compare healthyvolunteers in a study by Tangpricha et al 5: (1) study location in the Northeast, specically, the city of Boston, (2) identicalassay used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, 21 and (3) primary outcome or 25-hydroxyvitamin D deciency/H1102120 mg/dL. Our study, which was conducted predominantly at the end of summer (after maximal sun exposure), foundmore vitamin D deciency (36%) compared with the study ofTangpricha et al (11%). Other studies of more debilitatedpopulations have reported higher prevalence of vitamin Ddeciency including adults with HIV infection (79%) 22el- derly African-Americans in Boston (73%),3and uninsured women in Michigan (67%).23In summary, our estimate of vitamin D deciency is higher than a similar study of healthyvolunteers but lower than potentially more debilitated popu-lations. Very few individuals knew of their vitamin D status despite a high proportion of patients with medical conditionsor medications associated with low vitamin D. Our resultsunderscore the pressing need to treat co-occurring medicalconditions as well as the addiction needs of patients insubstance use treatment so as to improve overall health.Primary care physicians should be aware that low vitamin Dstatus could contribute to the chronic pain of patients withopioid dependence. The nding that black and Hispanic individuals are at higher risk for vitamin D deciency is consistent with otherstudies. 3,11,23 One reason for this may be reduced skin syn- thesis of vitamin D in individuals with darker skin pigmen-tation. Among women of reproductive age in the third Na-tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, theprevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D /H1134915 ng/mL was 42% in African-American women versus 4% among white women. 4 This biologic phenomenon could give rise to ethnicity-relatedhealth disparities. We also found that older patients weremore likely to have vitamin D deciency in our sample,which may be due to the skin's decreased ability to synthesizevitamin D with aging. 24Older age may also be accompanied by lower physical functioning, which may result in less sunexposure. Low vitamin D status in individuals in an MMT pro- gram is worthy of concern in light of the relatively highprevalence of chronic pain in drug-dependent popula-tions. 25-27 Patients in MMT experiencing chronic limb or joint pain are likely to attribute this pain to the effects ofmethadone. 28Vitamin D deciency causes osteomalacia, a bone disease of ineffective bone matrix mineralization and asyndrome of diffuse skeletal pain and muscle aches. 29In a study of patients with chronic pain, 93% of them were ofvitamin D deciency. 6Long-term therapy with medi- corticosteroids, antiepileptic drugs, and someTABLE 2.

However, the highprevalence of low vitamin D status in this study raises thequestion of whether patients in MMT with chronic pain mayhave low vitamin D status. Low vitamin D status for any population is important because of its role in a number of other medical conditions.Low vitamin D status is associated with muscle weakness thatcan lead to lower pulmonary function 32and higher risk of falls.33Vitamin D is vital for bone health. Low vitamin D status is also associated with cardiovascular disease34,35 and metabolic syndrome.36Moreover, vitamin D receptors are found in a variety of tissues in the body including colon,breast, ovarian, and prostate; sufcient vitamin D may beprotective against cancers in these areas. 37-39 To treat vitamin D deciency, 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once a week for 8 weeks is often effective. Reoccurrence of vitamin D deciency can safely be prevented with 50,000 IUevery other week. Another approach to prevention is dailysupplementation of 1000 IU of vitamin D to maintain serumlevels above 30 ng/mL. 40 The results of this study should be interpreted with the following limitations. First, because the study was conductedin the summer and fall when 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels aregenerally highest, a greater proportion of the study sample islikely to have low vitamin D at the end of winter whensunlight exposure is at it lowest. Second, although we did notnd differences between the study sample and the clinicsample in terms of age, gender, and race/ethnicity, patientswith bone pain may have been more likely to participate in astudy on \"bone health\" leading to an overestimation of theincidence of low vitamin D. Third, the study did not includea comparison group of patients not receiving methadone, butrather notes a comparable historical control group. Thus, thisstudy does not provide denitive evidence but rather suggeststhat the vitamin D status of MMT patients is worse than thosenot in MMT. Finally, it is possible that these ndings may notgeneralize to other opioid-dependent populations, becausemost MMT patients are required to leave their house to attendclinic for methadone dosing on a daily basis where they arepotentially exposed to sunlight. Further study should examinelow vitamin D status in other opioid-dependent populationsincluding those in other forms of opioid treatment (ie, bu-prenorphine) and those not in addiction treatment. In conclusion, low vitamin D status was common in patients receiving MMT and unawareness of vitamin D statuswas almost universal. Low vitamin D status is another largelyunrecognized medical comorbidity of patients with addic-tions, a group with complex medical problems. These nd-ings merit further investigation into the need and benets ofvitamin D supplementation in MMT patients. REFERENCES 1. Institute of Medicine.

Knapp, M.D., M.S.,1Kara M. Showers, M.P.H.,1Jenna C. Phipps, M.P.H.,1 Jeanne L. Speckman, M.Sc.,2Elliot Sternthal, M.D.,1Karen M. Freund, Ph.D.,2and Caroline M. Apovian, M.D.1 Abstract Objective: This study compared glycemic control in nger tip versus forearm sampling methods of self- monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG).Research Design and Methods: One hundred seventy-four insulin-using patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to SMBG using either nger-tip testing (FT) or forearm alternative site testing (AST) and followedup for 7 months. Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) was measured at baseline, month 4, and month 7. The study was designed to test the noninferiority of the AST method for the primary end point of change in HbA1C from baseline to month 7. Adherence with the testing schedule and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes were alsomeasured.Results: The FT ( n\u00bc85) and AST ( n\u00bc89) groups each had signicant decreases in mean HbA1C from baseline to month 7 (FT, /C00.4/C61.4%, P\u00bc0.008; AST, /C00.3/C61.2%, P\u00bc0.045), and noninferiority between groups was demonstrated with a margin of equivalence of 0.5 ( P\u00bc0.043). There was no observable difference in HbA1C change between the groups ( P\u00bc0.442). Adherence was better in the FT (87%) than the AST (78%) group (P\u00bc0.003), which may have been because of the difculty some subjects had in obtaining blood samples for AST. The number of hypoglycemic episodes was too small to assess for a difference between groups. Conclusions: SMBG by the AST, rather than FT, method did not have a detrimental effect on long-term glycemic control in insulin-using patients with type 2 diabetes. Although adherence with testing was expected to be betterin the AST group, it was actually better in the FT group. Introduction Individuals with diabetes have traditionally obtained samples for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using lancets to prick their ngertips, but this process can be painful and may be a barrier to testing with adequate frequency.1In the last several years, a new generation of SMBG devices has been developed that allows the use of far smaller volumes of blood than previous devices ( <1mL). These newer meters al- low patients to perform SMBG using samples obtained from skin sites other than the ngertip, such as the forearm or thigh, which are less vascular than the ngertips and yield less bloodafter skin puncture. They are also less densely innervated withpain receptors than the ngertips, which allows for lesspainful sampling. 2,3Alternative site testing (AST) has been widely marketed by the manufacturers of SMBG meters as a less painful alternative to nger-tip testing (FT). It has alsobeen suggested that AST might improve patients' adherence to SMBG regimens, potentially improving their glycemic control. 2,4-7However, whether the option to use AST actually improves adherence has not been adequately answered. One small nonrandomized study suggested that it does,6while a larger crossover study showed no such difference.8 Thus far in the evaluation of AST it has also been noted that this method can yield results that are signicantly different from both FT and reference blood glucose measures at timesthat blood glucose is changing rapidly, such as after a glu-cose load, 5,9,10after meals,4,11,12after the administration of 1Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition and Weight Management, Section of Endocrinology, Evans Department of Medicine; 2Health Care Research Unit and Section of General Internal Medicine; and3Women's Health Unit and Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. This study is identied through http: ==clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00207207.DIABETES TECHNOLOGY & been at- tributed to a delayed equilibration of arm and thigh skin with arterial blood glucose resulting from lesser blood flow.10 Manufacturers of SMBG devices have recommended prepa- ratory rubbing or heating of AST sites to increase blood flow and mitigate the difference due to equilibration time, but this may not be effective.11No signicant difference has been found between AST and FT measurements in the fasting or steady state.4,5,11-14 The delay in equilibration in arm and thigh testing ap- pears to be greatest between 60 and 90 min after a mealor glucose load 4,5,9-12but may persist for as long as 240 min after a combination of glucose and insulin.10These ndings have led to serious concerns about the potential failure of ASTto identify hypoglycemia, 7,9,10,14,15and the phenomenon has led the Food and Drug Administration to recommend clear labeling and instructions for patients not to use AST whenhypoglycemia is suspected or at times when blood glucose may be changing rapidly. 16Another potential consequence of the lag in AST equilibration is that postprandial blood glucoselevels could be systematically underestimated. Postprandialmeasurements are being increasingly used in clinical practice because they contribute signicantly to long-term control 17-19 and can guide later mealtime insulin dosing. Underestimation in measuring postprandial blood glucose with AST could hamper efforts at glycemic control. When AST is used in clinical care, it is generally introduced as an option for patients to use for some but not all of their SMBG tests in order to reduce the cumulative discomfort from multiple nger sticks. Our goal was to explore the question ofwhether changing from exclusive nger testing, the standard of care in patients with diabetes using insulin, to introduce an option to use AST in addition to FT would lead to worsenedcontrol as a result of differences between AST and FT read-ings. The only previous study to have compared long-term control between these two methods found no difference be- tween them, but its study population was in such good initialcontrol that a meaningful difference would have been difcult to detect. 8We hypothesized that the option to use AST would not lead to poorer glycemic control as assessed by hemoglobinA1C (HbA1C) in a diverse population of insulin-using pa- tients with type 2 diabetes with varying levels of initial gly- cemic control. As a secondary consideration, we planned totrack adherence to testing to determine whether use ASTmight improve adherence to testing and thereby have the potential to positively affect long-term glycemic control. The results were previously presented in abstract form at the 2006Endocrine Society Annual Meeting. 20 Research Design and Methods Population The study was conducted between July 2003 and December 2005 at Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA, with subjects recruited from the Center for Endocrinology, Dia- betes and Nutrition and Weight Management and afliatedprimary care practices. Newspaper advertising was also em-ployed to recruit subjects from outside the medical center. Potential subjects were eligible for participation if they were 18-70 years of age with type 2 diabetes, using insulin, andperforming SMBG measurements. Exclusion criteria includedtype 1 diabetes, prior use of AST, pregnancy, and serious comorbid illness (unstable cardiovascular disease or meta- static cancer). Potential subjects were also excluded if, within the past year, they had a hypoglycemic episode requiringurgent medical attention, resulting in cognitive impairment, or a lack of symptoms during a hypoglycemic episode. The Institutional Review Board at Boston University and the Foodand Drug Administration's Research Involving Human Sub- jects Committee each approved the protocol. All subjects gave verbal and written informed consent prior to study entry. Study design This was a randomized, parallel group trial consisting of nine visits. At the screening visit, information was collected on baseline characteristics as listed in Table 1, and subjects were asked to return approximately 2 weeks later for therandomization =training visit. Those who arrived for this visit were randomized to either the FT or the arm AST group using a block randomization stratied by six strata of initial HbA1Cto ensure similar mean initial HbA1C in both groups. All was performed using the OneTouch /C210Ultra/C210device (Life- scan/C210, Milpitas, CA). Subjects not already using this device were provided with a new one. When subjects were not able to obtain an adequate number of test strips as part of theirusual health coverage, they were provided with free strips donated by the manufacturer. Once randomized, each subject received a 30-min train- ing session from a qualied diabetes nurse educator in the use of the SMBG device, including device calibration and settings adjustment. For subjects randomized to the ASTgroup, the training also included instruction on obtainingsamples from the forearm. Subjects in the AST group were asked to use AST as much as possible; however, because of the potential limitations of AST in detecting hypoglycemia, theywere instructed to use FT when experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia and to repeat any AST reading <5.55 mmol =L using FT. They were also told that if they had difcultiesobtaining a blood sample from arm puncture on any partic- ular occasion, it was acceptable to substitute a nger test. As intended, this resulted in a mixture of arm and nger testingin the AST group, which is consistent with actual clinical useof AST. Subjects were given standardized SMBG log sheets that prompted them to test a minimum of three times per day:before breakfast, before dinner, and 2 h after dinner. The log sheets were designed to allow some flexibility such that the subject or their diabetes provider could alter the timing oftests if the individual subject's meal or insulin dosing sched- ule so required. Space was also provided to record test results for episodes of suspected hypoglycemia. Adherence wasmeasured by counting the number of tests recorded, regard- less of timing or method, as well as the number of tests re- quested for each log sheet (21 for a full week). When a test wasrepeated at an individual time point because of suspicion ofhypoglycemia, only one test was counted. Subjects were asked to return for study visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 months after the randomization =training visit. At each follow-up visit the study coordinator collected completed220 KNAPP ET AL. SMBG log sheets and gave out new sheets for use until the next visit. At each visit the study coordinator also recordedthe 30-day glucose average from the SMBG device. At the 1-, 3-, and 5-month visits, subjects were also seen by one of nine diabetes care providers (physician or nurse practitioner).Subjects were asked to show their SMBG log sheets from the preceding month to the provider who used this information to modify the treatment regimen as part of their routine diabetescare. Because of the nature of the intervention, neither subjectsnor providers could be blinded to group assignment. At months 4 and 7 subjects had blood drawn for HbA1C mea- surement. These HbA1C values were therefore obtained 3 and6 months after the rst provider visit in which providers had the opportunity to make management decisions based on study SMBG values. HbA1C measurements were made bygas chromatography using the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Var- iant V-II instrument. Subjects were compensated with a total of $170 for participation. Predetermined withdrawal criteria included a serious hy- poglycemic episode during the course of the study (dened as hypoglycemia requiring urgent medical attention or causing seizure or loss of consciousness) or inability to comply withthe intended timeline. Sample size and statistical analysis The primary hypothesis was that glycemic control in the AST group would not be meaningfully worse than in the FTgroup. In planning for the noninferiority test we dened a clinically signicant difference in HbA1C, the margin ofequivalence, to be 0.5%. We powered our study to test the hypothesis that the change from baseline to month 7 HbA1C measurement in the AST group would be no more than 0.5units higher (worse) than in the FT group. Assuming an SD in HbA1C change of 1.3 (which was an estimate obtained from review of multiple studies using HbA1C as an end point) andusing a one-sided rejection rule with alpha \u00bc0.05, we calcu- lated that a sample of 66 subjects in each group completing the study would result in 71% power to detect noninferiority, with margin of equivalence \u00bc0.5. The goals for diabetes management depend on the level of control already achieved. For patients already in good control, the goal is to maintain the same level of control, andfor those in poor control, clinicians strive to improve the HbA1C. Therefore, post hoc analyses were performed to compare the difference in HbA1C change between the twogroups stratied by initial level of glycemic control. Statisticalanalyses were performed using SAS software (PC-SAS ver- sion 8, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Continuous variables were assessed for normality of distribution and compared usingtwo-tailed ttests or analysis of variance unless otherwise noted. The paired-sample ttest was used for within-group comparisons, and independent sample ttest was used to compare between groups. Categorical variables were com- pared using the w 2test unless otherwise noted. All signi- cance tests were performed at the alpha \u00bc0.05 level.Table 1.Baseline Characteristics in the FT and Forearm AST Groups FT group ( n\u00bc85) AST group (kg Waist Asian=Pacic 2 (2%) 0 (0%) Highest educational level achieved Completed high school =GED 30 (35%) 35 (39%) Some post-secondary 0.643 tests prior per day 8 (9%) 10 (11%) 1-2 per day 40 (47%) 51 (57%) 0.258/C213 or more per day 37 (44%) 28 (32%) Frequency of insulin injections 1 per day 12 (14%) 12 (14%)2 per day 37 (44%) 34 (38%) 0.633/C213 per day 33 (39%) 37 (42%) Using oral diabetes agent (plus insulin) 52 (63%) 47 (57%) 0.374 Continuous variables were expressed as mean /C6SD values, and categorical variables as n(%). No difference between groups was considered signicant. Baseline characteristics were also compared between the total number of completers ( n\u00bc135) versus non-completers than completers (50.0 vs. 54.1 years old, P\u00bc0.02) and had a trend towards fewer insulin injections per day (2.3 /C60.8 vs. 2.6 /C61.1,P\u00bc0.10). There were no other signicant differences noted in baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers, including initial mean HbA1C /C62.22%, aBy Fisher's Exact Test.FINGER TIP VERSUS ALTERNATIVE SITE SMBG 221 Results Population characteristics Two hundred thirty-three potential subjects were screened in person. Of these, 26 were ineligible (Fig. 1). Of the 233 patients screened, 207 expressed initial interest. One hundred seventy-four returned for the randomization visit and wereenrolled at that time; 85 were randomized to the FT group and 89 to the arm AST group. Of those randomized, 71 (83%) in the FT group and 64 (72%) in the AST group completed the study.The higher dropout =withdrawal rate in the AST group ap- proached statistical signicance ( P\u00bc0.07). Baseline charac- teristics were similar for the AST and FT groups (Table 1). Correlation between SMBG and HbA1C HbA1C reflects the average glucose concentration over a 3-month period with weighting toward the most recent blood glucose levels, such that levels within the 1-monthprior to the HbA1C analysis account for approximately 50% of the measured value. 21To assess the correlation between month 4 HbA1C and SMBG readings by each testing method,we calculated a weighted average from the monthly 30-dayaverages generated by the SMBG meters. Thirty-day aver- age SMBG were recorded from each subject's meter at each of the monthly visits for the 3 months prior to the month 4HbA1C measurement. The weighted average was then cal- culated as (0.5 /C2month 3 average) \u00fe(0.35/C2month 2 aver- 1 average). HbA1C was highly correlated with the SMBG weighted average in both groups. The Pearsoncorrelation coefcient ( r) for the FT group was 0.84 ( n\u00bc66, P<0.0001) and for ( n\u00bc64, P<0.0001). Long-term glycemic control The central that glycemic control, as as- sessed by HbA1C, would not be meaningfully worse in the AST than in the FT group. We tested this with an intention-to-treat, noninferiority analysis. Missing values for month 4 and month 7 HbA1C in subjects who did not complete the study were taken from actual measurements when available in themedical records. When later HbA1C values were not avail- able, the initial HbA1C value was carried forward. For the FT group HbA1C values were based on actual measurements in94% of subjects at month 4 and 91% at month 7. For the AST group HbA1C values were based on actual measurements in 90% at month 4 and 83% at month 7. The intention-to-treatanalysis demonstrated a statistically signicant improvementin glycemic control between baseline and month 7 in both groups (Table 2). The noninferiority test was conducted with pooled variance after assessing for equality of variances. We FIG. 1. Subject enrollment and follow-up. MI, myocardial infarction.222 KNAPP ET AL. rejected the hypothesis that the change from baseline to month 7 HbA1C for the AST group was at least 0.5 unitshigher than for the FT group ( P\u00bc0.043). There was no sig- nicant difference in the degree of improvement between FT and AST groups ( P\u00bc0.442) (Table 2). Findings were similar when the analysis was repeated excluding the imputed valuesfor month 7 HbA1C. Because the goals of care for patients depend on initial level of glycemic control, we provide an analysis of HbA1C changeby group stratied for starting HbA1C (Table 2). For subjects in good initial control (HbA1C <7.0%) there was a slight in- crease in HbA1C from baseline to month 7 in both the FT andAST groups, but the mean HbA1C remained below 7.0% in both groups. For subjects in intermediate glycemic control (7.0-8.5%) there was no change in HbA1C from baseline ineither group, and for subjects in poor control (HbA1C >8.5%) there was a signicant improvement in both groups. There was no detectable difference in mean HbA1C or change inHbA1C between the FT and AST groups in any of the strata ofinitial glycemic control (sign test). To conrm the lack of difference between FT and AST groups, we categorized subjects into improved, unchanged,or worsened glycemic control by change in HbA1C from baseline to month 7 of 0.25% or more. In the FT group 39 (46%) improved, 19 (22%) were unchanged, and 27 (32%) worsened.In the AST group 39 (44%) improved, 21 (24%) were un- changed, and 29 (33%) worsened. There was no difference in frequencies between groups ( P\u00bc0.929). Adherence to SMBG schedule In the AST group subjects were encouraged to use AST as much as possible but were asked to use FT for suspected or possible hypoglycemia or if they had difculty obtaining blood from the arm. Tests were counted as completed re-gardless of whether they were performed on the arm or nger. Adherence overall was better in the FT compared to the AST group (Fig. 2).Hypoglycemic episodes Information on hypoglycemic episodes was collected using a strict denition. Events were only considered to be hypo-glycemic episodes if they consisted of hypoglycemic symp-toms followed by an SMBG test that conrmed blood glucose <4.44 mmol =L. As of such events wasTable 2.Percentage HbA 1C over Time by FT Versus AST Groups Stratied by Level of Initial Glycemic Control HbA1C (%) (mean /C6SD) n Baseline (T0) (M4) Month 7 (M7) Difference (M7-T0) Pvalue (M7-T0) All /C61.7 /C00.4/C61.4 0.045 Good initial /C60.4 6.7 /C60.5 0.040 Intermediate initial /C60.4 7.6 /C61.0 0.493 Poor initial /C61.9 9.7 /C61.8 <0.001 There was signicant improvement in HbA1C from T0 to M7 in both the FT and the AST groups but no signicant difference between the groups in the magnitude of this change ( P\u00bc0.442). Stratication into three levels of initial glycemic control demonstrated that only the stratum in poor control at baseline actually showed improvement during the course of the study. There was no signicant difference between randomization groups in the good, intermediate, or poor initial control strata ( P\u00bc0.876, 0.839, and 0.413, respectively). FIG. 2. Adherence to testing regimen by randomization group. Mean individual adherence with SMBG regimen in the FT and forearm AST groups was expressed as percentageof requested tests completed. Finger tests are shown in black,arm tests in white. Percentages were obtained by dividing the total number of SMBG tests performed by the total number of tests requested (three tests per day for each daythe subject was in the study). The denominator reflected re- turned log sheets only. Mean percentage of arm tests within the AST group was 65%. Mean overall adherence was higherin the FT group than in the AST group: 87% for FT (95% 95% condence intervals.FINGER TIP VERSUS ALTERNATIVE SITE SMBG 223 very small and concentrated in a few individuals. The mean number of hypoglycemic episodes per month was 0.183 in the FT group and 0.176 in the AST group with no signicant difference between the two ( P\u00bc0.16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Only three subjects in each group reported an average of more than one hypoglycemic episode per month. Because of the small number of recorded hypoglycemic events we didnot have adequate power to detect a difference in the number between groups. Four subjects were withdrawn from the study because of a severe hypoglycemic episode requiring urgent medical at-tention: one in the FT group and three (two including sei- zures) in the AST group. While the occurrence of three out of four severe hypoglycemic events in the AST group is con-cerning, this is not sufcient to suggest a relationship between AST and such episodes. Discussion Glycemic control improved in both groups over the course of their participation in the study, primarily because of sub- stantial improvements in subjects who began the study inpoor control (HbA1C >8.5%). Presumably, this was caused by an increased attention to their diabetes and increased fre- quency of SMBG testing through their participation in the study. We did not observe a difference in the degree of im-provement between the FT and AST groups. Despite the frequently postulated but rarely tested idea that the option for AST might improve adherence with SMBG,AST actually reduced the degree of adherence in our study population (Fig. 1). The fairly regimented nature of our study procedure in which subjects were asked to return their SMBGlog sheets to the study coordinator on a monthly basis ap-peared to lead both groups to have relatively high adherence rates, but the rate in the AST group of 78% tests completed = tests requested was lower than the 87% rate in the FT group(P\u00bc0.003). While this difference is statistically signicant, it is small in real terms, and it conflicts with a prevailing opinion that AST can be expected to improve adherence with SMBG.One possible explanation is that subjects in the AST group frequently reported difculty in obtaining blood from the arm despite having had specic training in this method with aqualied nurse educator. Many AST subjects reported having to make multiple attempts to obtain an adequate sample, and several reported frustration in this regard. Limitations and other considerations Our sample size was designed to give our study sufcient power to detect a difference between the FT and AST groups as small as 0.5 units on the HbA1C percentage scale. A largerstudy would be required to conclusively rule out the possi- bility of a smaller change in mean HbA1C caused by the use of AST. The number of recorded hypoglycemic events in ourstudy was small enough that we can neither prove nor exclude an effect of AST. A larger study is also needed to better char- acterize the risk for hypoglycemia or the failure to detect it. In choosing a SMBG testing schedule we attempted to strike a balance between the unique requirements for the timing of tests for each individual with diabetes based on his or her insulin regimen and meal schedule, on one hand, andstandardization between groups, on the other. We chose a standard regimen including two premeal tests and one post-prandial test per day while allowing individual patients and providers to deviate from this schedule if they chose. It is possible that a study using an SMBG regimen more heavily weighted toward postprandial measurements would havedifferent results regarding the impact of AST. In designing the study, we also attempted to strike a bal- ance between instructing the AST group to exclusively per-form arm tests and giving them the flexibility to choose the method on a test-by-test basis. AST is generally suggested for use in clinical practice as an option for patients rather than anexclusive testing modality, but complete flexibility may haveled to few actual arm tests. We therefore chose to ask subjects in the AST group to utilize arm testing ''as much as possible,'' but to use FT under the particular circumstances described.This was intended to maximize our ability to detect a differ- ence between testing methods while maintaining the gener- alizability of our ndings to real clinical practice.

Kressin, PhD,*\u00a7 Martha E. Nunn, DDS, PhD,*\u00b6 Harpreet Singh, Palfrey, Paul L. Geltman, MD, MPH,* Cynthia Cadoret, RDH, MPH,*\u00b6 and DDS, MPH*\u00b6 Objective: Early childhood caries (ECC) is a serious and prevent- able disease which pediatric clinicians can help address by counsel-ing to reduce risk.Research Design: We implemented a multifaceted practice-based intervention in a pediatric outpatient clinic treating children vulner-able to ECC (N /H11005635), comparing results to those from a similar nearby clinic providing usual care (N /H11005452). Intervention: We provided communication skills training using the approach of patient centered counseling, edited the electronic med- ical record to prompt counseling, and provided parents/caregiverswith an educational brochure.Outcome Measures: We assessed changes in provider knowledge about ECC after the intervention, and examined providers' counsel-ing practices and incidence of ECC over time by site, controlling forbaseline ECC, patient sociodemographics and parents'/caregivers'practice of risk factors (diet, oral hygiene, tooth-monitoring), among 1045 children with complete data.Results: Provider knowledge about ECC increased after the intervention training (percentage correct answers improved from66% to 79%). Providers at the intervention site used morecounseling strategies, which persisted after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics. Children at the intervention site hada 77% reduction in risk for developing ECC at follow up, aftercontrolling for age and race/ethnicity, sociodemographics andECC risk factors; P/H113490.004. Conclusions: The multifaceted intervention was associated with increased provider knowledge and counseling, and signicantlyattenuated incidence of ECC. If validated by additional studies,similar interventions could have the potential to make a signicantpublic health impact on reducing ECC among young children. Key Words: early childhood caries, physician-patient relations, physicians,' practice patterns, intervention studies (Med Care 2009;47: 1121-1128) Early childhood caries (ECC) is a serious, but preventable, form of tooth decay that affects children's primary denti- tion. Untreated, it can lead to serious illness, including ab-scesses, necessitating costly therapeutic interventions such assurgery with general anesthesia. The infection and paincaused by ECC can impair growth and weight gain, 1cause speech, learning and eating problems, and increase school absenteeism,2negatively affecting children's quality of life.3 Thus, a national public health goal is to reduce the prevalenceof children with dental caries in primary teeth (HealthyPeople 2010 goal 21-1a). 4 ECC disproportionately affects poor, racial/ethnic minor- ity children.5-8Several risk factors including sugary diet, excessive bottle use, and poor oral hygiene have been iden- tied.9,10ECC risk can be reduced by minimizing children's exposure to caries-promoting food and drinks, weaning from the bottle as early as possible, and regularly cleaning chil-From the *Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities, Boston, MA; HealthCare Disparities Research Program,Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School ofMedicine, Boston, MA; VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA;\u00a7Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research, VAMC,Bedford, MA; \u00b6Boston University School of Dental Medicine, Boston,MA; /H14067Department of Medicine, Division of Preventive and Behavioral Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA;**Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, Boston, MA; Depart-ment of Pediatrics, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA; andDepartment of Pediatrics, Boston University School of Medicine,Boston, ofVeterans Affairs Health Services Research and Development ResearchCareer Scientist Award (N.R.K.).

It is vital that at-risk children and their caregiv- ers be educated, advised, and counseled about preventionstrategies. Thus, \"counseling, reinforcement of health pro-moting behaviors with care givers of children, and interven-tion by dental and other professionals to improve parentingpractices\" have been called the best available means toprevent or mitigate ECC. 11 To monitor children's teeth for ECC, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that all childrenbegin regular dental visits by 1 year. Unfortunately, childrenmost at risk for ECC face the greatest barriers to accessinghealth care in general, 12and dental care in particular.13 However, because most (88%) American children see apediatrician annually, 14pediatric clinicians could potentially counsel parents about decreasing children's ECC risk. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics has adopted a policysupporting the use of caries risk assessment and referral to adental home. 15However, pediatricians are not well trained to do so,16,17despite their belief that they have an important role in identifying dental problems and in counseling parents about caries prevention.18,19 Others have addressed the problem of ECC by teaching pediatricians to apply fluoride varnish,20or increasing their knowledge regarding the disease and ability to screen chil- dren for ECC risk.21-26Evidence is clear that increasing clinician knowledge does not necessarily lead to behavior change,27but notably absent from prior approaches are strat - egies to provide pediatric clinicians with the communicationtools needed to effectively convey such information, or theskills needed to enlist parents/caregivers in behaviors toreduce children's ECC risk. To capitalize on pediatricians' commitment to chil- dren's oral health, and to address the decit in pediatricians'preparation to help prevent ECC 19,28we developed and im - plemented a multifaceted pediatric practice-based interven-tion where children especially vulnerable to ECC receivecare, building on the proven educational methodology ofpatient centered counseling (which has been successfullyapplied in other clinical settings 29-32). Patient centered coun - seling has successfully changed provider behavior, effectedchanges in patients' risk-related behaviors, and, ultimately,improved clinical outcomes, 29-34although the evidence for the effectiveness of such programs applied specically to the oral health of young children is lacking.28Our goal was to assess the effects of this intervention on provider ECC coun- seling practices, and on children's subsequent developmentof ECC. METHODS Study Locations Parents and children were recruited from the pediatric outpatient practices of 2 academic medical centers in Boston.The intervention site was selected because it serves underservedpopulations (primarily African-American and Latino children).The comparison site was another nearby urban hospital-basedprimary care pediatric clinical practice, serving a similar patientpopulation but with more Asian Americans.Study Participants Patients We asked parents/caregivers of children aged 6 months to no older than 5 years attending well-child visits to partic-ipate in the study (during the same time period for both sites),to ensure the children likely had at least some erupted teethand thus were \"at risk,\" and to limit our sample to youngerchildren. Children were to be excluded from the study if theyself-reported or had congenital oral anomalies, ectodermaldysplasias, or other diseases (other than ECC) upon exami-nation affecting the dentition or oral mucosa, although nochildren were excluded for these criteria. At the interventionsite, a total of 635 children were recruited after their provid-ers had received the study training intervention, and 452children were recruited at the comparison site. Providers We invited all attending pediatricians (not residents or medical students) who care for regular panels of patients(N/H1100519), as well as clinic nurses (RNs and NPs; N /H1100514), to participate in the 1-hour study training intervention, as eachhas the opportunity to provide anticipatory guidance coun-seling in the clinic. After offering multiple early morning andlunchtime sessions, and a $100 gift certicate incentive, 68%of the eligible physicians (13/19), and 100% of the eligiblenurses (14/14) were trained. Although we did not conceal thepurpose of the study, we did not explicitly describe it duringthe training. Questionnaire Interview and Clinical Examination-Procedures and Measures After the educational program was given to providers at the intervention site, and with the simultaneous initiation ofrecruitment at the comparison site, parents/caregivers ofyoung children were approached in the clinic waiting roombefore a regular well-child visit, the study was described(respondents were not blinded to the study purpose but wereblinded as to which group they were in), and those expressinginterest were asked to provide informed consent. After thevisit, participants completed an interview assessing demo-graphic information including the child's date of birth, gen-der, race and ethnicity (Hispanic or not, following the USCensus conventions for assessing ethnicity), the educationand employment status of the parent, and language spoken athome. Study participants were again asked to participate in asimilar interview and clinical examination, approximately 1year later, at another well-child visit. In our analyses, we usedbaseline data on all variables except ECC, positing thatfollow up ECC would be a function of physician counselingregarding ECC at the baseline visit. One component of the questionnaire was a \"Patient Exit Interview\" (PEI), a series of questions inquiring about theparent's discussions with the child's doctor or nurse. Theseassessed the degree to which the clinician covered the topicson which they had been trained to counsel regarding ECC riskreduction. PEIs have been demonstrated to accurately mea-sure the actual content of clinical discussions through com-parisons of audiotapes of such interactions to patient reports 35Kressin et al Medical Care \u007f Volume 47, Number 11, November 2009 \u00a9 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1122 | www.lww-medicalcare.com(see Table 1 for all PEI questions); they do not assess knowledge gained. The PEI score was a sum of the questionsto which there was a positive response (range: 0-22). The interview also included questions about the 3 dimensions important to preventing ECC (eg, \"risk factors\").We assessed the child's diet and feeding behaviors (eg, \"Doesyour child usually drink from a bottle?\" and \"How often doesthe child get a bottle in bed with something besides water?,\"6 questions total; score range: 0-6), oral hygiene (eg, \"Doyou your child brush his or her teeth?,\" \"When brushing,do you use toothpaste with fluoride?\": and tooth monitoring (eg, you ever for spots or cavities?\": 3 questions total;score range: 0-3). We created summary scores from theitems assessing each dimension, by dichotomizing answersand summing the afrmative responses, provided that at least75% of the questions were answered. The research hygienist examined each child's dentition to identify ECC, recording both white and cavitated lesions,by tooth (because this was a research-focused interaction, nocounseling regarding hygiene or diet was provided by thestudy hygienist). In our analyses, we dene ECC as the moreserious, irreversible cavitated lesions in any tooth, which require restorative treatment (vs. the reversible white lesionswhich do not). Content of the Intervention The intervention had 3 components: communication skills training, edits to the electronic medical record's(EMR's) anticipatory guidance section, and provision of aneducational brochure. The communication skills training ed-ucational program was designed to enhance clinicians' abilityto advise and counsel patients' parents or caregivers aboutdecreasing risks for ECC. I n a 1 hour training session led by experts in dentistry and patient centered counseling, pediatricclinicians (nurses and physicians) were taught, using a 1-pagecounseling algorithm handout, to address 3 primary dimensionswith parents/caregivers: consuming foods and drinks thatstrengthen teeth and limit sugars (diet), toothbrushing/keepingteeth clean (hygiene), and monitoring teeth to detect the devel-opment of caries (tooth monitoring). Through didactic presen-tations and role play exercises, providers were asked to imple-ment the 4A's: Assess the parent/caregiver's status on each ofthe dimensions, identifying barriers to each, Assist with address-ing barriers to each behavior, Advise (or educate) about ECCand its etiology, and nally, Arrange for follow up (eg, makinga dentist appointment; see the Fig. 1 for additional detail). Immediately before and after the study intervention training sessions, we administere d a 5 item multiple choice pre- and post-test to the participants to assess the effects onECC knowledge. We also edited the anticipatory guidancesection (a listing of topics that parents should be counseledabout at each well child visit, which providers must documentthey followed) of the EMR to include age-appropriate infor-mation for each of the dimensions we trained the providers toaddress. Our edits were not the pop-up prompts typically usedin EMR reminders but rather additions to the topics on whichproviders are to counsel. We also prepared an educationalbrochure that summarized these same areas for the parent/caregiver to address in caring for the child. These brochureswere available in both clinics, but intervention providers wereasked to distribute them, as part of their counseling. Institutional Review Board The Institutional Review Boards at both study sites approved this study's protocol. Data Analysis We compared sociodemographics, and summary scores for the ECC risk factors of diet, oral hygiene, and toothmonitoring practices by site using /H92732tests of independence for the former and Mann-Whitney Utests for the latter 3 variables. We examined PEI items and overall scores by site,using the Mann-Whitney Utest. Then, we conducted 2 random effects least squares regressions to examine the independent effects of site onprovider counseling, adjusting for sociodemographic charac-teristics, with and without controlling for ECC risk factors,which we anticipated might affect rates of clinician counsel-ing. These analyses accounted for clustering of patients-within-provider.TABLE 1.

A multiple mixed model (frailty)proportional hazards regression model was t including onlychildren free of ECC at baseline with physician treated as arandom effect, adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, care-giver employment status and educational level, whetherEnglish was spoken at home, and the ECC risk factors. RESULTS Only parents/caregivers who could be interviewed in English were included (study staff made this determination;9% of the parents screened at the comparison site and 7% ofthose screened at the intervention site were excluded for thisreason). Refusal rates were 3% at the intervention site, and14% at the comparison site. Of the children recruited, thestudy hygienist was unable to conduct a clinical examinationwith 42 children, 28 (67%) of these patients were from theintervention clinic and 14 (33%) were from the control clinic.We excluded these 42 children from analyses using clinicaldata, leaving an analysis sample of 1045. The number ofpatients seen by intervention providers ranged from 1 to 134for each provider; mean: 32, median: 25. The average (mean)number of patients seen by all providers was 18 (out of 62).The median was 7.Provider ECC Knowledge Prior to the training, participants answered 66% of the questions correctly o n a 5 item ECC knowledge test. Subse- quent to the intervention, this rate increased to 79%. Improve-ments in knowledge were observed on 3 of the items-thosefocused on knowledge about dental caries being the mostcommon infectious disease of childhood, understanding ofrisk factors for dental caries in infants and toddlers, and therecommended age for a rst dental visit, but many cliniciansstill did not realize that ECC risk is related to the oral healthof the caregiver. Characteristics of the Patients Sociodemographic Characteristics The mean initial age of the sample was just under 2 years, with no differences by site (not shown; 1.93 years vs.1.87, P/H110050.20). There was no difference in age group or gender distribution across sites (Table 2). More parents fromthe comparison site were employed (69% vs. 56.7%, P/H11021 0.0001). The racial group distribution, but not the proportionof Hispanics, differed signicantly by site ( P/H110210.0001)- about half of the comparison site sample were white, whileover three-quarter of the intervention site were black.

Risk Factor Proles Patients at the comparison site had better baseline diets and more tooth-monitoring than those at the intervention site(P/H110210.0001 and P/H110050.001, respectively; Table 2); however, hygiene practices were better among patients at the interven-tion site ( P/H110210.0001). Patient Exit Interview Clinicians at the intervention site were more likely to ask the parents for ideas about how best to keep his/herchild's teeth clean, limit dietary sugars, and how to get thechild to the dentist (Table 1). They were also signicantlymore likely to explain what cavities are, their causes and theireffects on other aspects of the child's health. More cliniciansfrom the intervention site discussed limiting sugary foods anddrinks, the child's fluoride intake, and cleaning teeth nightly.Intervention providers more frequently discussed using tooth-paste with fluoride, helping the child brush his or her teeth upuntil age 6, and monitoring the child's teeth for spots, orwhether the child had a dentist. Also, a greater percentage ofintervention providers mentioned that they would discusscaries prevention at the next visit, gave parents writteninformation about cavities, and discussed caries preventionstrategies. Intervention providers asked or counseled an av-erage of 2 more issues than comparison site providers (means: 6.4 vs. 4.1; medians: 5 vs. 3; P/H110210.0001). Factors Associated With Provider Counseling Random effects least squares regression analyses were performed to examine the independent effects of site onprovider counseling (PEI), after adjusting for sociodemo-graphic factors and before and after controlling for ECC riskfactors (Table 3). In the rst model, the PEI score wassignicantly higher (better) at the intervention site, indicatingthat intervention providers counseled on approximately 2more issues than comparison site providers. After adjustingfor ECC risk factors, however, the PEI score was not signif-icantly different between the 2 sites. Factors Associated With ECC A person-level multiple proportional hazards frailty regression model with physician included as a random effectwas t for ECC incidence for all children free of ECC(cavitated lesions) at baseline, adjusting for demographicvariables that varied signicantly between sites without alarge number of missing observations (Table 4). At baseline,there was no difference in ECC prevalence at the 2 sites(5.8% at the intervention site vs. 6.4%; P/H110050.664).

Children at the intervention site were 77% less likely to develop ECC over time comparedwith children at the comparison site (HR /H110050.23, 95% CI: 0.09-0.62, P/H110050.004). DISCUSSION Recognition of the profound deleterious effects of ECC on children's health and well being has led to a growinginterest in and commitment to the role of primary careclinicians in children's oral health. 19To address the paucity of interventions oriented towards enhancing providers' knowledge and skills in counseling parents to reduce risk forECC, 28we developed, implemented, and evaluated the ef - fects of a multifaceted practice-based intervention for pedi-atric providers. Providers at the intervention site providedsignicantly more counseling regarding reducing ECC riskthan comparison site providers, with the differences in ratesspanning between 7 and 34 percentage points, depending onthe item. Further, more provider counseling for ECC at theintervention site was associated with 77% lower incidence ofECC over time. While the rates of ECC increased over timeat both sites, the progression was markedly attenuated at the intervention site, suggesting that such multifaceted interven-tions in the pediatric setting might have signicant publichealth impact. While intervention providers provided more counsel- ing, their rates of counseling were often only around 20% to40% (the maximum rate of counseling observed, on only 1item, was 60%, Table 1). Thus, although our intervention wasassociated with more counseling, there is still room forimprovement, so further training during medical school orresidency might help foster such adoption. However, com-peting demands for time during clinic visits presents a chal-lenge for increasing such rates. Providers of patients who are perceived to be at greater risk might exert greater effort at counseling to prevent ECC,as we have found in other work on hypertension care. 36 Intervention providers conducted signicantly more counsel-ing than at the comparison site after controlling for patients'sociodemographic factors, but not after adjusting for ECCrisk factors. However, such adjustment conservatively as-sumes that providers conducted an accurate risk assessment,which may not be the case. Interest by pediatricians regarding children's oral health has led to a variety of efforts, many focusing onincreasing pediatricians' knowledge base regarding the etiol-ogy of dental caries. 17,24,26Our study is one of the rst attempts to increase providers' skills in translating knowledge about the risk factors for ECC into useable information whichTABLE 3.

Relatively low cost interventions (brief provider train-ing, educational materials, and changing an existing EMR toinclude cues to counsel patients) were associated with signif-icantly greater amounts of provider counseling, which sug-gests that it may be valuable to implement such interventionson a more widespread basis. While the limited length of clinicvisits may be a barrier to counseling, our results suggest thatproviders were able to incorporate ECC counseling into theirvisits, although we were not able to assess the added timeneeded to do so. The tools we developed for our interventionare easily accessible and transportable for use by otherproviders (Available at http://www.creedd.org/afliate.html)including family physicians, midlevel providers, and for pe-diatric residency training and continuing medical education. These results are consistent with prior studies of patient centered counseling, which have consistently shown thatproviders are willing to incorporate such methods into theirpractices, and that they successfully do so after train-ing. 29,31-34Our ndings indicate that this method of changing provider behavior is useful in the pediatric setting as well. This study was limited by the absence of baseline data on providers' counseling habits, and by the fact that thesamples were different in several respects. However, thendings from the training pretest/post-test indicated an in-crease in provider knowledge (albeit with a short recall period, and without comparative data from clinicians at thecontrol site). Another potential limitation of the study wasthat we were unable to disentangle the specic effects of eachelement of the intervention, although we viewed them as apackage which should be implemented together in the futurebecause each piece addresses a different aspect of ECCprevention. Further, we still observed differential rates of counsel- ing after adjusting for the sociodemographic differences be-tween sites. Also, while our focus on very young childrenmay be viewed as a limitation in that our ndings are notgeneralizable to older children, the dearth of informationabout ECC and its risk factors among children in this agegroup warrants such a focus. Ideally, a cluster-randomized controlled design (ran- domized by site) would be used to test the effectiveness intraining pediatric clinicians to conduct oral health counselingwith parents/caregivers of very young children. To obtain atrue random sample, one would need to recruit cliniciansfrom the private sector to participate, which might introduceselection bias since such clinicians are less likely to see theeconomic and racial diversity of children whom we studied.Although our quasi-experimental design offered benets forinvestigating the effect of training pediatric clinicians todeliver such counseling, these ndings should be replicatedelsewhere before widespread use of this intervention. In summary, a relatively brief intervention was associ- ated with increased provider counseling and reduced subse-quent ECC. Such interventions are feasible to implement ona more widespread basis, and if validated by additionalstudies, may have a signicant public health impact, byreducing rates of ECC in young children.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the technical assistance of Kristal Raymond, MPH, in accomplishing this work who was sup-ported by a NIH/NIDCR Research Supplement to PromoteDiversity in Health-Related Research (U54 DE14264-S2), aswell as the support of Janis Johnson, MPH.

LASSER, MD, MPH Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts; and Department of Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA This article will review population-based nationally representative data on rates of smoking and tobacco cessation in adults with andwithout mental illness. We begin with a review of the methods andndings from the 1991-1992 National Comorbidity Survey. Thisstudy found that 41% of persons who had a mental illness in thepast month were current smokers, that persons with mental illnessare twice as likely to smoke as persons without mental illness, andthat heavy smoking is rare in persons without mental illness. Per-sons with a current mental illness smoked 44% of all cigarettes inthe United States. We then explore the reasons that persons withmental illness smoke at such high rates and examine the directionsof causality between smoking and mental illness. We review to-bacco companies' marketing activities that have targeted mentallyill smokers. The health consequences of smoking in this vulnerablegroup are dire. An estimated 200,000 smokers with mental illnessor addiction die each year from smoking. Despite their high ratesof smoking, a substantial proportion of persons with psychiatricdisorders are able to quit. KEYWORDS Smoking, mental disorders, primary care EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SMOKING AND MENTAL ILLNESS Many seasoned clinicians know that persons with mental illness smoke at higher rates than persons without mental illness. When I was a primary The author would like to acknowledge Maxim D. Shrayer, PhD, for his constructive comments on earlier drafts of this paper. Address correspondence to Karen E. Lasser, MD, MPH, General Internal Medicine, 801 Massachusetts Ave., 2nd Floor, Crosstown E. Lasser care resident, one of my supervising attendings advised me that one can \"practically diagnose schizophrenia from the nicotine stains on a patient'sngers.\" I remember wondering what this clinical observation meant on apublic health level. How heavily did people with mental illness smoke? And,furthermore, how representative were they of the average American smoker (if such a person exists)? Several years later, when I was a general internal medicine research fellow, I returned to these questions. I reviewed the literature, where Ifound that a number of studies documented high smoking rates amongselected populations with mental illness. These included psychiatric out-patients (Hughes, Hatsukami, Mitchell, & Dahlgren, 1986), patients in statemental hospitals (de Leon et al., 1995), and patients with individual di-agnoses, such as bipolar disorder (Gonzalez-Pinto et al., 1998), depres-sion (Glassman et al., 1990), schizophrenia (Kelly & McCreadie, 1999; Amico, 1992), and panic disorder (Breslau, 1995; Breslau &Klein, 1999). However, none of these studies seemed to reflect a broaderprimary care population, and few took an even broader public healthperspective. Only the analysis by Glassman et al. (1990) of data from the Epidemi- ologic Catchment Area Study was population-based. This analysis of datafrom the early 1980s showed that persons with major depression, dysthymia,agoraphobia, and alcoholism were 1.6 to 4.7 times more likely to have eversmoked than persons without mental illness. Yet, this study was not conclu-sive, for it did not administer a structured psychiatric interview to a nationallyrepresentative sample. It was not until the 1990-1991 National ComorbiditySurvey (NCS) that such data were collected (Lasser et al., 2000). The NCS was a congressionally mandated, nationally representative study of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the United States from1990 to 1992. Trained lay interviewers administered a structured psychiatricinterview to the non-institutionalized civilian population aged 15 to 54 years.While the survey excluded persons dwelling in psychiatric facilities andprisons, the study design accounted for such exclusions. The interviewersasked 4,411 respondents detailed questions about tobacco use, thus provid-ing the data to explore further the relationship between smoking and mentalillness. In analyses of these data, my coauthors and I found that persons with mental illness were about twice as likely to smoke as persons without mentalillness. Twenty-two percent of people without mental illness smoked ascompared to 41% of people with a current mental illness. Heavy smoking,dened as the consumption of 25 or more cigarettes per day, was rare inpersons without mental illness. Only 10% of people without mental illnesswere heavy smokers. Persons with a past-month mental illness represented40.6% of all current smokers in the United States and smoked 44% of allcigarettes in the United At: 19:10 8 May 2009Update in Smoking and Mental Illness 193 WHY DO THE MENTALLY ILL SMOKE MORE? Scholars have proposed numerous theories to explain the high smoking rates observed among persons with mental illness. First, there is the theoryof self-medication of psychiatric symptoms. Smoking reduces the negativesymptoms and cognitive decits in patients with schizophrenia. In patientswith depression, smoking affects noradrenergic proteins in the locus ceruleusmuch in the way that antidepressants do (Klimek et al., 2001). These the- ories implicitly assume that mental illness precedes the onset of smoking. However, a number of studies have shown that smoking preceded the onsetof certain mental disorders, such as adolescent depression (Wu & Anthony,1999), rst-time panic attacks (Breslau & Klein, 1999; Isensee, Wittchen,Stein, Hofler, & Lieb, 2003), anxiety disorders (Johnson et al., 2000), andschizophrenia (Kelly, 1999). It is also possible that smokers with mentalillness have a genetic predisposition to both conditions. Analyses of cross-sectional data cannot determine causality; thus, we are not likely to knowfor sure whether mental illness causes smoking or whether smoking causesmental illness. Internal documents from the tobacco companies suggest that the to- bacco industry may be partially responsible for high smoking rates amongpersons with mental illness (Lasser et al., 2000). In 1981, one companyconducted a study of different segments of the tobacco market. They iden-tied psychologically vulnerable persons as a key market segment and mayhave targeted their marketing and advertising accordingly. In their study,the company identied the 3 following positive aspects \"helps think out and \"cope with stress.\" SEQUELAE OF SMOKING IN THE MENTALLY ILL Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, with 440,000 deaths annually. Twenty times as many people suffer fromsmoking-related disability. Extrapolating from the smoking rates found inthe NCS, 200,000 smokers with mental illness or addiction die each yearfrom smoking (Williams & Ziedonis, 2004). Yet, there is a common concep-tion that people with mental illness often die of violent causes\u2014suicide orhomicide. Mortality follow-up data from the New Haven node of the Epi-demiologic Catchment Area Study refute this contention (Bruce, Leaf, Rozal, Florio, & Hoff, 1994). Among persons with mental illness, the investiga- tors found that the leading causes of death were circulatory diseases (55%),cancer-related (23%), other natural causes (21%), and 1% unnatural causes(accident, homicide, and suicide). Smoking could be implicated asDownloaded By: [Lasser, Karen E.] At: 19:10 8 May 2009194 K. E. Lasser a cause of many of the circulatory and cancer-related deaths. More recent data from Massachusetts also show a high prevalence of smoking-relatedmortality among persons with mental illness. A 2001 mortality report bySudders (Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Ofce of Health andHuman Services Department of Mental Health, unpublished data, May 2001) found that age-specic mortality from cardiovascular disease for individuals aged 25 to 44 was more than 6 times as high among Department of MentalHealth clients than among the general Massachusetts population. Smokingis only one of many other potential causes of high cardiovascular mortalityrates\u2014obesity, sedentary lifestyle, medications, social deprivation, and poorquality of medical care\u2014and further research is needed to elucidate the roleof smoking in these deaths. ARE SMOKERS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ABLE TO QUIT? Fortunately, smokers with mental illness are able to quit. In our analyses of the NCS, quit rates of persons with a lifetime history of mental illness(37.1%) or a mental illness in the past month (30.5%), while lower that thoseof people without a history of mental illness (42.5%), were substantial. El-Guebaly, Cathcart, Currie, Brown, and Gloster (2002), in their review of 24studies of smoking cessation in persons with mental illness or addictive disor-ders, found that quit rates of patients with psychiatric disorders were similarto those in the general population. Yet, other studies have demonstratedlow rates of cessation in smokers with schizophrenia, anxiety or depression(past or present), and current alcohol use. The latter studies focused on se-lected populations of mentally ill smokers, psychiatric outpatients, and moreseverely ill patients, which may explain their lower cessation rates. VARENICLINE (CHANTIX): THE LATEST WONDER DRUG? At our weekly research meeting at Cambridge Hospital, a psychiatrist col-league and I were exchanging stories about adverse reactions our mentallyill smoking patients had had from the newest smoking cessation medica-tion, varenicline. Pharmaceutical companies frequently test medications inhealthy populations who are often not representative of patients who ulti-mately take the drug once it is introduced onto the market. We wonderedwhether the same was true with varenicline. A quick literature search re-vealed that, indeed, persons with mental illness were systematically excludedfrom the premarketing trials of varenicline. The trials excluded patients with the following diagnoses: major depression within the prior year; history of or current panic disorder, psychosis, or bipolar disorder; and drug or alcoholabuse or dependence within the past year (Jorenby et al., 2006). Analyses ofpsychiatric epidemiologic studies suggest that persons represent Karen E.] At: 19:10 8 May 2009Update in Smoking and Mental Illness 195 of the general population (Kessler et al., 1994) and surely an even higher proportion of all smokers. Despite this major limitation in the premarketing trials of varenicline, the drug has been heavily marketed to and widely consumed by all smokers,with and without mental illness. Since its approval in May 2006, at least 5 million people have taken the drug, and its sales in 2007 totaled $681 million, which represents 90% of the smoking cessation market. Varenicline has alsoacquired a series of warnings regarding the risk of serious neuropsychiatricsymptoms, including agitation, depression, suicidal behavior, and suicidalideation (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2007). My coauthor and Iwrote in a recent correspondence to The Lancet , \"we question the wisdom of excluding these patients [the mentally ill], given the fact that those sufferingfrom mental illness smoke at very high levels and also might be especiallyvulnerable to post-approval pharmaceutical marketing efforts (just as theyhave been shown to be vulnerable to tobacco industry marketing)\" (Lasser& Boyd, 2008). CONCLUSIONS Those who continue to smoke most frequently and most heavily in theUnited States are the mentally ill. What are some interventions that mightimpact smoking rates among the mentally ill? First, we (both primary care andmental health providers) need to document smoking status in the patient'smedical record. If we cannot identify our smokers, how will we be able toassist them in quitting? Second, we need to support health policy initiativessuch as smoke-free psychiatric facilities, clean indoor air laws, and tobaccocessation. Finally, smokers with mental illness must be included in futuresmoking cessation drug trials. We cannot continue to ignore those in oursociety who are increasingly marginalized by both their smoking and theirmental illness. REFERENCES Breslau, N. (1995).

Patient navigation has been shown to increase brea st and cervical cancer screening rates, but few studies have looked at the potential of patient na vigation to increase colorectal cancer screening rates. Methods: The objective was to determine the feasibili ty and effectiveness of a patient navigator- based intervention to increase colorectal cancer screening ra tes in community health centers. Patients at the intervention health center who had not been screened fo r colorectal cancer and were designated as \"appropriate for outreach\" by their primary care providers received a letter from their provider about the need to be screened and a brochure about colorectal cancer screening. Patient navigators then called patients to discuss scre ening and to assist patients in obtaining screening. Patients at a demographically similar control he alth center received usual care. Results: Thirty-one percent of interven tion patients were screened at six months, versus nine percent of control patients (p < .001). Conclusion: A patient navigator-based intervention, in combination with a letter from the patient's primary care provider , was associated with an incr eased rate of colorectal cancer screening at one health center as compared to a demographically similar co ntrol health center. Our study adds to an emerging literature supporting th e use of patient navigators to increase colorectal cancer screening in diverse populations served by urban health centers.Published: 29 May 2009 BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 doi:10.1186/1471-2296-10-37Received: 13 November 2008 Accepted: 29 May 2009 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 \u00a9 2009 Lasser et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In 2008, an estimated148,810 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer,and it is estimated that 49,960 will die of the disease. [1]Current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services TaskForce [2] recommend screening individuals age 50 until age 75 with one of the following tests: flexible sigmoidos- copy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or fecaloccult blood test (FOBT) every year. Despite the availabil-ity of these effective screening tests [3-7] a large propor-tion of Americans are still not being screened. [8-10]Patients at greatest risk of not being screened include racial and ethnic minorities,[10,11] patients with Medic- aid or no health insurance,[8,12,13] those who are for-eign born,[12,14] and patients with low socioeconomicstatus [15] - groups that are commonly served by commu-nity health centers.[8,16] In a prior qualitative study of community health centers at Cambridge Health Alliance that included patients from Brazil, Portugal, the Azores, Cape Verde and Haiti, [17]large immigrant groups in Massachusetts and elsewhere inthe US, we found that the following factors preventedpatients from being screened for colorectal cancer: 1) lackof trust in doctors; 2) lack of symptoms; 3) lack of a doc- tor's recommendation for screening and 4) fatalistic views about cancer. Few physicians were aware that lack of trustand fatalistic beliefs about cancer were barriers to screen-ing for their patients. Physicians typically cited comorbidmedical conditions and numerous psychosocial stressorsas the main reasons why patients did not receive colorec- tal cancer screening. We used these findings to inform the development of a patient navigator-based intervention. Patient navigatorsare people selected from the community who are trainedto guide patients through the health care system to receive appropriate services.[18] A type of care management, patient navigation encompasses a wide range of advocacyand coordination activities.[19] Most published researchon patient navigators has focused on breast and cervicalcancer screening, showing that navigation increases therate of patient completion of screening and follow-upevaluation.[20,21] Several studies, all conducted in New York City, have shown that patient navigation can increase rates of color-ectal cancer screening among urban minoritypatients.[18,21-24] Our study adds to the existing litera-ture by including Haitian Creole and Portuguese-speaking patients, and patients in a geographic area other than New York. We report the results of a pilot study to assess thefeasibility of using patient navigators to increase rates ofcolorectal cancer screening among community health center patients in Massachusetts. Methods Study setting and sample Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) is a Primary Care Prac- tice-Based Research Network (PBRN)[25] including 15 community health centers. The health centers predomi- nantly serve a multi-cultural, low-income population inCambridge, Somerville, and Everett, MA. We selected onehealth center to pilot-test the intervention, and a demo-graphically similar health center to serve as the controlhealth center. The CHA institutional review board approved the study protocol. The institutional review board provided a waiver of informed consent, since thestudy was promoting an established screening standardand primary care providers (PCPs) were able to identifypatients who were not appropriate to contact. Using an electronic clinical data system (Meditech), we identified patients aged 52-80 who appeared to be unscreened for colorectal cancer. We included patients age75-80 because at the time of the study, age 80 was consid-ered to be the upper age limit of screening by the U.S. Pre-ventive Services Task Force. We chose to begin at age 52instead of age 50 (the age at which guidelines suggest that screening begin), because we sought consistency with the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set(HEDIS) measure on colorectal cancer screening. [26,27]The unscreened patient report used in our study alsoserved as the basis for our ambulatory quality improve-ment colorectal cancer screening measure. We based eligi- bility for colorectal cancer screening on a modified version of the most recent HEDIS measure. US healthplans utilize HEDIS measures to assess performance onimportant dimensions of care, including cancer screening.We modified the denominator of the measure to includeany patient aged 52-80 who had one visit to a primary care physician in a community health center in each of the two previous years. The numerator included any patientwho received colonoscopy in the past 10 years, sig-moidoscopy or barium enema in the past five years, orfecal occult blood testing (FOBT) during the prior year.Using this definition, 47% of eligible patients in our net-work of community health centers received colorectal can- cer screening in the year 2006. Since the data report did not capture tests performed outside of Cambridge HealthAlliance, or FOBT cards that were not billed, we suspectthat the true screening rate was higher than 47%. We limited our intervention group to patients who spoke English, Portuguese, Spanish or Haitian Creole and who received care at one center in Somerville, MA. Weexcluded patients of two primary care providers (PCPs) atthe intervention center: one PCP who was a study investi-BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 http://www.bi omedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 Page 3 of 7 (page number not for citation purposes)gator (KEL), and one PCP who was leaving the health center at the time of the study. The control group con- sisted of a random sample of similarly defined patients(speaking the same languages and unscreened for colorec-tal cancer based on the abovementioned definition) atanother health center in Somerville. Study Procedures Because the electronic data system did not capture diag-nostic tests performed outside of the health center net-work, one investigator (KEL) reviewed the medical recordsof all patients at both the intervention and control healthcenters who appeared unscreened in the data report to confirm that they were, in fact, unscreened. After review- ing 196 medical records at the intervention center and191 medical records at the intervention center, we identi-fied 93 intervention patients and 90 control patients whohad not received colorectal cancer screening according tothe criteria specified above. We asked each of the eight PCPs at the intervention center to review their list of unscreened patients and to identifyany patient who they deemed inappropriate for telephoneoutreach, based on the following criteria: 1) patient has amedical contraindication to screening or a short lifeexpectancy so that they do not warrant screening[25] 2) the patient will be out of the country continuously for at least three months during the period of navigation 3) thepatient had severe cognitive or mental impairment, andno one who can be identified as a caretaker or proxy and4) other reason as designated by the PCP. Of the 93 unscreened patients, PCPs deemed 38 (41%) to be inappropriate for outreach for the following reasons:patient has a long history of refusing screening (n = 16),patient with medical comorbidity (n = 7), gastrointestinalsymptoms or gastrointestinal workup in progress (n = 6),mental illness or substance abuse (n = 5), other reasons (n = 4; patient uninsured, out of the country, or moving). Fourteen of the 38 patients deemed ineligible for outreachwere uninsured. Intervention The remaining 55 patients were eligible to receive theintervention. We sent letters by first-class mail, signed by each PCP, notifying patients that they were overdue for colorectal cancer screening, and that a patient navigatorwould be calling them. The mailing also included a color-ectal cancer screening brochure designed by the HarvardCenter for Cancer Prevention and the MassachusettsColorectal Cancer Working Group (\"Take Control: Get Tested for Colorectal Cancer\"). The brochure, written at a sixth-grade reading level, offered patient-oriented infor-mation about the reasons for screening, the differentscreening modalities, and lifestyle changes to lower risk ofcolorectal cancer. We sent brochures to patients in Eng- lish, Portuguese, Spanish, or French (for Haitian Creole- speaking patients). The study patients were also eligible to receive navigation from navigators speaking English and Spanish, Portu-guese, and Haitian Creole, respectively. The navigators were based in the hospital's Department of Community Affairs; they did not have a presence at the interventionhealth center. The navigator who worked with English andSpanish-speaking patients was originally from Nicaragua,had completed college, and had extensive experiencedoing community health outreach. She was also a trained certified nurse's assistant (CNA). The Portuguese-speaking navigator had been a masters-level clinical psychologist inBrazil, and was an experienced community health worker.The Haitian navigator was also an experienced commu-nity health worker, and worked as a medical assistant in alocal community health center. All of the navigators werewomen, and were age 47, 42, and 37, respectively. The navigators attended a two day training program in October 2007. The training program included lecturesand interactive role plays about the following subjects: 1)the principles of motivational interviewing [28] 2) color-ectal cancer and how patients can be screened for it; 3) logistics (\"how-to,\" pros, and cons) of FOBT cards and colonoscopy 4) prevention of colorectal cancer (includingprevention by removal of adenomas) 5) use of open vs.closed questions, reflective listening, and summarizing; 6)assessment of patient's readiness for screening and 7)approaches for patients who refuse screening (pre-con- templation), are willing to think about it (contempla- tion), or are ready to act (action).[28] We chose to framethe intervention around a \"stages of change\" model asother cancer prevention studies have successfullyemployed this model.[29] During the study implementation, the project manager (who also attended the training sessions) audited betweenone and five patient calls by each navigator for adherenceto a calling script and for motivational interviewing tech-niques. The patient navigators and the project manageralso met on a weekly basis to discuss challenges arisingduring the outreach calls and to review the use of motiva- tional interviewing techniques. Over a three week period in October 2007, the patient navigators made between 8 and 11 attempts to call eachpatient on different days (weekdays and weekends) and atdifferent times (morning, afternoon, and evening) until they reached a patient. The navigators also left at least two messages for the patient, either on the answering machineor with a family member.BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 http://www.bi omedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 Page 4 of 7 (page number not for citation purposes)Once the navigator reached a patient, the navigator dis- cussed the need for colorectal cancer screening with the patient, the screening options of colonoscopy vs. FOBTcards, and the advantages and disadvantages of each test.The navigators did not discuss other screening testoptions, such as flexible sigmoidoscopy and bariumenema, since such options were not routinely offered to patients by their PCPs. If a patient was interested in completing FOBT cards, the navigator reviewed the FOBT instructions with the patientand mailed FOBT cards and illustrated instructions topatients by first-class mail. The navigator also offered to review the FOBT instructions with the patient over the phone as soon as the patient received the FOBT cards. If apatient did not return the FOBT cards within four weeks,the navigator called the patient to provide support and toaddress barriers to completion. For patients who were interested in pursuing colonos- copy, the navigators described the test in detail and the project manager contacted the patient's PCP to arrange acolonoscopy referral. Based on the patient's comorbidmedical conditions, the PCP either referred the patientdirectly for colonoscopy or for a routine appointmentwith a gastroenterologist to discuss colonoscopy. Patients with any of the following conditions were not eligible for direct referral: sleep apnea, obesity (BMI > 30), previoushistory of anesthesia problems, congestive heart failure,presence of an automatic implanted cardiac defibrillator,renal failure (as defined by the PCP), and warfarin use forany reason. For patients referred directly to colonoscopy, a registered nurse (LV) called the patient, educated him/ her about the procedure and the bowel preparation, andmailed instructions for the bowel preparation to thepatient. The patient did not require a medical visit prior tothe colonoscopy procedure. The gastroenterology officeplaced reminder calls to all patients one day prior to their procedure. Due to medico-legal concerns, the navigators did not escort patients home after the colonoscopy. In theevent that a patient did not have someone to escort themhome, the navigators advised them to complete FOBTcards instead. At the control health center, patients eligible for colorectal cancer screening received usual care. PCPs offered patients screening on an ad-hoc basis during primary care visits.Unlike the PCPs at the intervention center, the PCPs at thecontrol center did not review their lists of unscreenedpatients. At both health centers, PCPs had some decisionsupport to promote colorectal cancer screening in the Epic electronic medical record. The electronic record includes a health maintenance grid which flags age-appropriatepatients who have not received colorectal cancer screen-ing. The PCPs at the control health center could also referpatients directly for colonoscopy at the time of the study, but they did not have access to patient navigators to advise patients on screening options or to assist them in com-pleting the test. Measures The primary outcome of the study was completion of colorectal cancer screening at six months. While the inter- vention focused on the completion of colonoscopy or aset of three FOBT cards from home, patients who com-pleted any of the following during the study period wereconsidered to have been screened: colonoscopy, sig-moidoscopy or barium enema, or FOBT cards. One of the investigators (KEL) conducted a non-blinded chart review to determine completion of colorectal cancer screeningtests. Process Evaluation During the study, the navigators maintained paperrecords in which they documented details of their interac- tions with patients, including the patients' readiness to be screened, barriers to screening, and actions that weretaken to promote screening. The project manager enteredthese data into a Microsoft Access database. Statistical Methods We included all patients at the intervention center in anintention-to-treat analysis, regardless of whether theywere designated by their PCP to receive navigation, orwhether a navigator successfully reached the patient.Using the 2 test, we compared screening rates at six months among intervention patients and control patients. We chose to analyze the data at six months because the wait for a screening colonoscopy at the timeof the study was on the order of weeks, and we assumedthat patients would have had sufficient time to completetheir colonoscopy during the six-month period. Results Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of theintervention and control center patients. The patients atboth centers were of similar age, race (note that race datawere missing for 7 persons), and insurance status. Ofthose patients who had insurance, the majority at bothsites had Medicaid or free care (66% at the intervention center and 51% at the control center). At the time of the study, after being determined ineligible for other paymentoptions, Massachusetts residents were able to apply forhelp paying for health center bills from the Massachusettsuncompensated (free) care pool. The non-English speak-ing patients at both sites were mostly Portuguese speak- ing, with small numbers of Spanish and Haitian Creole speaking patients.BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 http://www.bi omedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 Page 5 of 7 (page number not for citation purposes)Screening Outcomes Table 2 shows the main study results. Patients in the inter- vention center were much more likely to be screenedwithin six months than patients in the control group(31% vs. 9%, 2 p < .001). Due to small numbers we did not present P values for comparisons between the differ-ent types of screening (FOBT and colonoscopy). Three of the 38 patients (8%) whom PCPs at the intervention sitedeemed ineligible for outreach were screened at six months (Figure 1). Of the 29 patients screened at the intervention site, 16 completed FOBT cards, and 13 completed colonoscopy.Among patients who completed FOBT cards, all tests werenegative. Of those patients who completed colonoscopy, three had high-risk lesions; one patient had a tubulovil- lous adenoma, one patient had four tubular adenomas,and another had a 35 mm. tubular adenoma. A fourthpatient had two small tubular adenomas. Among theeight patients screened at the control site, seven com-pleted FOBT cards and one completed colonoscopy. Three patients at the control site had positive FOBT results, but only one of these patients completed a follow-up colon-oscopy within six months. Process Outcomes Of the 55 patients who were offered navigation, the patient navigators were unable to contact 14 (25%) after between eight and eleven attempted telephone calls. Twoof these 14 patients (14%) were screened at six months,while 24 of the 41 patients (59%) whom the navigatorswere able to contact were screened at six months. Forpatients reached by the navigator, the median number ofcontacts was five (range 1-16). Patients received, on aver- age, about four hours of telephone outreach. Patients who received more contact (eight or more calls) were no morelikely to be screened than those who received less contact(fewer than eight calls). In their discussions with patients, the navigators learned that many patients had not been screened because their PCP had not taken enough time to educate them aboutcolorectal cancer screening. For example, one patientstated, \"my doctor asked me if I wanted to have it (colon-Table 1: Community Health Center Patient Characteristics Variable Intervention Control Chi-square p-value n = 93 N = 90 Female (%) 63.4 75.6 .08 Mean Age (SD) 60.6 (6.6) 60.9 (7.1) .54 Race (%) White 67.0 71.8 .50Non-White 33.0 28.2 Insurance coverage (%) No coverage 24.7 17.8 .25Coverage 75.3 82.2 Language used in visit (%) English 51.6 53.3 .82 Non-English 48.4 46.7 Flow diagram of intervention patientsFigure 1 Flow diagram of intervention patients . 93 intervention patients 38 ineligible for outreach 3 screened 55 eligible for outreach unable to contact 14 2 screened Contacted 41 24 screened BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 http://www.bi omedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 Page 6 of 7 (page number not for citation purposes)oscopy) done, and I said no and that was it.\" The patient noted that the PCP did not explore her reasons for declin-ing screening. In addition, patients related not being ableto take time off from work to undergo colonoscopy. Discussion We found that a patient navigator-based intervention wasassociated with an increased rate of colorectal cancerscreening at one health center as compared to a demo-graphically similar control health center. Almost one-third of intervention patients were screened at six monthsversus nine percent of control patients. Our study adds to an emerging literature supporting the use of patient navi- gators to increase colorectal cancer screening in diversepopulations served by urban health centers.[19,22-24] While our intervention was effective, it did not achieve the screening rates observed in other studies. For example, studies by Chen et al[18] and Christie et al[24] found that over 50% of navigated patients completed colonoscopy.These studies offered patient navigation only after apatient had been referred for screening colonoscopy bytheir PCP, which may explain their higher screening rates.In addition, these studies excluded patients who required a gastrointestinal clinic visit for pre-screening evaluation. Jandorf et al[22] also achieved higher screening rates, inboth the intervention and control groups. It is possiblethat the higher screening rates observed in all of these nav-igation studies could partially be attributed to seculartrends. In New York City, where all three of these studieswere conducted, 1.25 million people were screened in 2007, up from 826,000 in 2003, with the biggest rates of increase in minority communities.[30] Our study was limited by the fact that only 41 (44%) of 93 unscreened patients at the intervention health centerwere actually contacted by a patient navigator. The PCPs at the intervention site identified 38 patients (41%) as inappropriate for outreach. While some of the PCPs rea-sons for excluding patients were legitimate, such as medi-cal comorbidity, gastrointestinal symptoms orgastrointestinal workup in progress, and mental illness or substance abuse (our navigators were not trained to dealwith these special populations), some of the patients whowere excluded may have been good candidates for patientnavigation services. Such patients included those with along history of refusing screening and the uninsured. By excluding these patients, we may have underestimated the potential impact of patient navigation. Our study is alsolimited by small sample size, which precluded us fromexamining the individual effects of different componentsof the intervention (letter versus navigation) and fromperforming exploratory subgroup analyses. Unlike prior studies of patient navigation, which included mostly Hispanic and African American patients, our studyincluded immigrants from Brazil, Portugal, the Azores,and Haiti. Our inability to contact a substantial propor-tion (25%) of patients, which decreased the effectiveness of the intervention, may be due to the fact that many patients travel back and forth to their country of origin.The PCPs at the intervention site were often unaware oftheir patients' migratory patterns, and hence did notexclude such patients from being outreached. Thesepatients also experience housing instability. Unmeasured differences between the two health centers could account for the differential screening rates. In addi-tion, the PCPs at the control center did not have an oppor-tunity to identify patients whom they deemedinappropriate for screening. We attempted to account forthis difference by including all of the intervention center patients in an intent-to-treat analysis. A further potential source of bias is the fact that our qualitative study of bar-riers to colorectal cancer screening [17] included one PCPfrom the intervention site, and no PCPs from the controlsite. We doubt that a one-hour interview conducted witha PCP in 2005 would have significantly affected his color- ectal cancer screening practices.Table 2: Colorectal Ca ncer Screening Results Variable Intervention Control Chi-square p-value n = 93 n = 90 (%) (%) Screened for colorectal cancer at 6 months 31.2 8.9 .0002 Screened by FOBT 17.2 7.8 * Positive tests 0 3.3 * Screened by colonoscopy 14.0 1.1 * Adenomas 4.3 0 *BMC Family Practice 2009, 10:37 http://www.bi omedcentral.com/1471-2296/10/37 Page 7 of 7 (page number not for citation purposes)Conclusion This study supports the feasibility and effectiveness of a patient navigator intervention to increase colorectal can-cer screening rates in a community health center servingethnically and linguistically diverse patients. Future stud-ies will need to examine the cost-effectiveness of such anintervention, and a randomized trial would confirm the effectiveness of patient navigation for immigrant groups who have not been previously studied.

Lisabeth, PhD; Alexa S. Beiser, Murabito, MD, ScM; Margaret Kelly-Hayes, EdD, RN; Philip A. Wolf, MD Background and Purpose \u2014Women have increased lifetime stroke risk and more disabling strokes compared with men. Insights into the association between menopause and stroke could lead to new prevention strategies for women. The objective of this study was to examine the association of age at natural menopause with ischemic stroke risk in the Framingham Heart Study. Methods \u2014Participants included women who survived stroke-free until age 60, experienced natural menopause, did not use estrogen before menopause, and who had complete data (n /H110051430). Participants were followed until first ischemic stroke, death, or end of follow-up (2006). Age at natural menopause was self-reported. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between age at natural menopause ( /H1102142, 42 to 54, /H1135055) and ischemic stroke risk adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, current smoking, cardiovascular disease and estrogen use. Results \u2014There were 234 ischemic strokes identified. Average age at menopause was 49 years (SD /H110054). Women with menopause at ages 42 to 54 (hazard ratio /H110050.50; 95% CI: 0.29 to /H110050.31; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.76) had lower stroke risk compared with those with menopause /H1102142 years adjusted for covariates. Women with menopause before age 42 had twice the stroke risk compared to all other women (hazard ratio /H110052.03; 95% CI: 1.16 to 3.56). Conclusion \u2014In this prospective study, age at natural menopause before age 42 was associated with increased ischemic stroke risk. Future stroke studies with measures of endogenous hormones are needed to inform the underlying mechanisms so that novel prevention strategies for midlife women can be considered.

Key Words: stroke /H18546cerebrovascular disease /H18546women /H18546menopause /H18546bone mineral density Average life expectancy for women in the United States is 80 years, 5 years longer than that of men.1Although men have an increased stroke risk, more women than men will experience a stroke during their lifetime because of their in- creased life span.2Studies consistently show that women are more functionally impaired after stroke and are less likely to receive tissue plasminogen activator compared with men.3 Given the increased stroke burden and barriers to acute stroketherapy in women, it is critical to understand risk factors uniqueto women so that new strategies for stroke prevention can be considered. Results from a meta-analysis demonstrated that menopause before age 50 was associated with a 25% increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 4Three of the 12 studies in the meta-analysis included stroke,5-7with only 1 focused on incident stroke versus stroke mortality.7This investigation from the Nurse's Health Study failed to find an associationbetween age at natural menopause and stroke risk; however,a protective effect of older age at menopause and ischemicstroke risk was suggested. 8With the exception of this study, prospective data on the association of age at natural meno- pause and stroke risk among US women are lacking. Beyond age at natural menopause, duration of ovarian activity may be a marker of stroke risk. A recent case-control study found that a longer lifetime estrogen exposure, definedas the difference between age at menopause and age at menarche, was associated with decreased stroke risk. 8An alternative measure of cumulative endogenous estrogen expo- sure is bone mineral density (BMD). BMD is associated with age at menarche,9,10age at endogenous estrogen levels among peri- and postmenopausal women.13,14 Data from one prospective US study of elderly women demon- strated a strong association between low BMD and risk of incident stroke,15whereas data from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I-EpidemiologicalFollow-up Study (NHANES I) failed to find an association. 16 Further investigation of the relationship between BMD andstroke incidence is warranted.

A secondary objective was to examine the association of BMD and risk of ischemic stroke. Analyses were limited to ischemic strokegiven the purported role of estrogen deficiency in promotingatherosclerosis. Methods FHS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 5209 participants (2873 women, ages 28 to 62 at the time of enrollment) that began in 1948 inthe town of Framingham, Mass. Participants undergo biennial exami-nations including medical histories, physical examinations, laboratorytests for vascular risk factors, and, at some examinations, brain imagingstudies. Details of the study methods have been published. 17,18 This study investigated the association of age at natural meno- pause and incident ischemic stroke after age 60. Among the 2873women in the original cohort, there were 2461 who attended anexamination within 3 years of age 60; this examination was desig-nated the participant's baseline. Participants were excluded if they had no information on age at menopause (n /H110057), surgical menopause or menopause of unknown cause (n /H11005702), prevalent ischemic stroke at entry (n /H1100518), no follow-up after entry (n /H1100511), estrogen use before menopause (n /H1100526), or missing risk factor data (n /H11005267). The remain- ing 1430 participants comprised the study sample for the analysis ofthe association of age at natural menopause with risk of ischemicstroke (primary objective). Of the 2873 women in the original cohort, 866 were alive and attended examination 20 (1986-1990), when BMD was measured;this examination was designated the participant's baseline for the analysis of BMD and risk of ischemic stroke (secondary objective). Participants were excluded from this analysis if they had prevalentischemic stroke at entry (n /H1100543) or no follow-up after entry (n /H110057). Of the remaining 816, BMD was measured in 654 women. Thesewomen comprised the study sample for the secondary objective. Allparticipants provided written informed consent, and the study wasapproved by the Boston Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Baseline Covariates Baseline covariates were assessed at age 60 ( /H110063 years) for the primary objective and at the time of BMD measurement for the secondary objective. The following covariates were considered: systolic bloodpressure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular disease, status, body mass index, and estrogen use. Systolic bloodpressure was recorded as the average of 2 physician-recorded measure-ments. Diabetes was defined as a random blood glucose /H11022200 mg/dL, previous diagnosis or treatment with diabetes medication (insulin or oralhypoglycemia agent). Prior cardiovascular disease included coronaryheart disease, congestive heart failure and intermittent claudication.Atrial fibrillation was obtained from a standard 12-lead ECG completedat or before the baseline examination. Estrogen use was defined assomeone taking estrogen at their baseline assessment. Women takingestrogen before menopause were excluded from the analysis so thiscovariate measured estrogen started after menopause. Analyses were limited to those with complete covariate data. Stroke Ascertainment The primary outcome was incident ischemic stroke. Stroke was defined clinically as a focal neurological deficit of sudden or rapidonset that persisted for more than 24 hours. Continuous surveillance for cerebrovascular events included daily hospital monitoring, trackingof medical encounters, and examination of those with possible strokesymptoms identified at routine biennial examinations. Events wereadjudicated by at least 2 neurologists, and with verification of stroke byimaging when available. Stroke occurrence and characteristics, includ-ing subtypes, were determined at the end of the acute stroke phaseaccording to uniform criteria and a standardized protocol. 18,19Age at Natural Menopause At each biennial examination, women were queried as to whether periods had stopped for 1 year or more, the age at which periodsceased, the cause of stopped periods (natural, surgical, other), whether a hysterectomy was performed, and number of ovaries removed. Natural menopause occurred if a woman had ceasedmenstruating naturally for at least 1 year. Age at natural menopausewas retrospectively assigned as the self-reported age at last menstrualperiod. Bone Mineral Density BMDs of the femur (neck and trochanter) and distal third of the radius were measured in members of the cohort who came for their20th biennial examination in 1986 to 1990. Measurements were done using dual-photon absorptiometry for the hip (DP3; Lunar Corp, Madison, Wisc) and single-photon absorptiometry for the distal thirdof the radius (LUNAR SP2; Lunar Corp). Statistical Analysis Baseline characteristics were calculated using frequencies and per- cents or means and standard deviations (SD). Cox proportionalhazards models were used to examine the association between age at natural menopause and risk of ischemic stroke. Individuals were censored at death, hemorrhagic stroke, last examination or contactdate, or end of follow-up (December 2006). Survival age was used asthe outcome in all models, with entry age used as the left truncationlimit. Given an observed nonlinear relationship, age at natural menopause was modeled categorically ( /H1102142 [referent]), 42 to 54, /H1135055). Models were run age-adjusted and adjusted for age plus baseline covariates (systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabe- tes, current smoking, cardiovascular disease, estrogen use). Allcovariates were modeled dichotomously with the exception ofsystolic blood pressure and age which were modeled continuously. AWald /H92732test was used to test the overall association between age at natural menopause and risk of stroke in the adjusted model. Models were also run limited to never smokers and never estrogen usersgiven the potential confounding effects of these covariates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between BMD and risk of ischemic stroke, with individ-uals censored as described above. Survival age was again used as theoutcome in all models, with age at the 20th examination used as the left truncation limit. Models were run separately for each BMD site.BMD was modeled categorically based on quintiles of the distribu-tion of BMD at each site with the middle quintile as the referent.BMD quintiles were determined within age groups (67 to 69, 70 to74, 75 to 79, /H1135080). Models were run age-adjusted and adjusted for the covariates described above with additional adjustment for bodymass index. Using the adjusted models, Wald /H92732tests were used to test the overall associations of BMD at each site and risk of stroke. Models were also run limited to those not taking antihypertensivesgiven the potential confounding effects of this covariate. Results For the primary objective, there were 1430 women with complete data. Baseline covariate data for these women isincluded in Table 1. Average age at menopause was 49 years(SD/H110054). Women were followed for an average of 22 years (SD/H110059). There were 234 incident ischemic strokes occurring at an average age of 80 years (SD /H110059). The Figure displays cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke by age and age at natural menopause, and Table 2 displays the model results. Inthe age-adjusted model, women with menopause at ages 42 to54 (hazard ratio [HR] /H110050.57; CI: 0.14 to 0.79) had lower stroke risk compared with those with menopause /H1102142 years. These associations were relatively unchanged with adjustment forbaseline covariates. In the adjusted model, there was aLisabeth et al Age at Natural Menopause and Risk of Stroke 1045 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on May 28, 2009 stroke.ahajournals.org Downloaded from significant overall association between age at natural meno- pause and ischemic stroke risk ( P/H110050.02). Women with menopause before age 42 had twice the risk of ischemicstroke compared to all other women (HR /H110052.03; 95% CI: 1.16 to 3.56). Limiting to never smokers or to never estrogen users, results were similar (Table 2). Six hundred fifty-four women had at least one BMD measurement with an average age at measurement of 76 years (SD/H110055). Women were followed an average of 12 years (SD/H110055). In this subset, there were 92 ischemic strokes. Table 3 displays the model results. Cut-points for defining quintilesof BMD are provided in supplemental Table I, availableonline at http://stroke.ahajournals.org. In adjusted models,there were borderline significant associations with BMD at the trochanter ( P/H110050.07) and radius ( P/H110050.07) ischemic For BMD measured at the trochanter, a U-shapedpattern in risk was observed with women in the lowest(HR/H110052.36, 95% CI: 1.15 to 4.83) and highest 0.94 to 3.95) quintiles of BMD having elevatedstroke risk compared with women in the middle quintile. A similar pattern was observed at the radius 5.30). Limiting the analysis to those not using antihypertensives, results were similar (data not shown). Discussion In this prospective study, we observed a significant association between age at natural menopause and ischemic stroke risk in acohort of women followed from age 60. This association was nonlinear and reflected an increased risk of ischemic stroke in those with natural menopause before 42. Menopause at /H1134940 years is termed premature ovarian failure (POF). The etiology ofPOF is unknown, although POF is thought to arise from differentprocesses than those leading to natural menopause around age 50. Prevalence of POF is 1% to 2% among women, with anadditional 3% to 10% of women experiencing \"early\" meno-pause defined as natural menopause before age 45. 20,21Although women with menopause before 42 years represent a small subgroup of the total population, data from this study suggest that 4% to 5% of strokes in all women can be attributed to this risk factor. Reasons for increased ischemic stroke risk amongwomen with POF or early menopause are not clear but early lossof ovarian function coupled with a prolonged low estrogen stateis a plausible hypothesis. The menopausal transition represents a change in endoge- nous hormones including decreasing estradiol levels several years before menopause and relative estrogen deficiencywithin 2 to 3 years of the final menstrual period. 22Estrogen deficiency is thought to promote cardiovascular disease,23 perhaps through functional or structural changes in the arteries,24and as such early onset of estrogen loss in women with POF may contribute to increased stroke risk. However,the role of estrogen deficiency has become controversial inTable 1.

Interestingly, thispattern does not hold for stroke, further complicating an understanding of the hormone-stroke association. 28,29No published study has assessed the association between endogenous estrogens and stroke risk. Studies of other nonstroke cardiovascular disease end points in postmenopausal women have found no association between endogenous estrogen and peripheral artery disease,30intima media contrast, proxy measures of endogenous estrogen exposure, including measures of lifetime ovarian activ- ity and BMD, have been associated with stroke risk in some15,34 but not all studies.16Unlike previous studies, which suggested aTable 2.

Women in the lowest quintilesof BMD (trochanter and radius) had elevated risk. This finding supports the estrogen deficiency-stroke hypothesis, although other explanations are possible. Bone metabolism and athero-sclerosis share factors including osteopontin and osteocalcin, aswell as other potential pathogenic contributors such as oxidizedlipids and hypertension. 35,36This link is supported by an asso- ciation between low BMD and carotid plaques.37The finding of elevated stroke risk with the highest quintile of BMD is unexpected and could be real but could also be the result of misspecification of our model, residual confounding, or selec- tion bias given the age at which BMD was measured in thisstudy. More research is needed to understand the impact of endogenous estrogen on stroke risk. However, given the harmful association of HRT with stroke in recent trials andnegative findings of studies of endogenous estrogen andnonstroke cardiovascular disease end points, alternate hor-monal pathways, including changes in androgens and sex-hormone binding globulin with menopause, should be ex-plored. Lower levels of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and higher levels of free androgen index (FAI) have been associated with cardiovascular disease, 32but again, data on stroke are lacking. Low SHBG and high FAI were also related to an adverse cardiovascular risk factor profile, including higher insulin, glucose, lipids, and hemostatic and inflammatory markers, in a study of perimenopausal wom-en. 38Estradiol was also associated with an adverse risk factor profile but to a lesser degree. These findings suggest that the association of age at menopause and stroke risk may be mediated through changes in risk factors which occur with menopause, although associations remained after adjustmentfor risk factors in this study. Alternatively, an adversecardiovascular risk factor profile in premenopausal womenmay be associated with earlier menopause. 39 Some limitations warrant discussion. The population was limited to white women who were recruited in 1948; there- fore, results may not be generalizable to different populations or to more recent birth cohorts. Although age at natural menopause in the Framingham population is similar toestimates in more recent cohorts, 40,41there have been tempo- ral trends in increasing age at menopause.42Oral contracep- tive use and use of hormone replacement therapy were uncommon in this cohort because of the study time period limiting generalizability to more recent birth cohorts with a greater prevalence of these medications. Similarly, secular trends in stroke risk factors or their treatment may limitgeneralizability. Women with stroke before age 60 were excluded. Although ischemic stroke was rare before 60, if early menopause is associated with stroke at younger ages,the association of age at menopause and stroke may differfrom that presented. Similarly, the secondary analysis fol-lowed women prospectively from BMD measurement, whichoccurred on average at 76 years. Women who experiencedstroke or who died before BMD measurement were not included. This may have introduced bias and suggests that ourresults should be confirmed in different populations andacross a broader range of ages. Although we adjusted forconfounders, with a focus on factors known to influence stroke in this population, there may be other unaccounted forconfounders. For example, we did not include metabolicsyndrome, measures of central adiposity or parity, which maybe confounders, because they were not available for thispopulation for the time frame under study. Sample sizes andnumbers of events were small in some analyses, which may have limited power. This study relied on self-reported meno-pausal status which may be subject to recall bias, although theprospective biennial exams minimize this possibility. Summary Given the increased stroke burden in women, it is critical to understand risk factors unique to women so that new strategiesfor prevention can be considered. Results from the current study demonstrated an elevated risk of ischemic stroke in women with early menopause and possible POF and in women with lowBMD. These findings raise the hypothesis that estrogen defi-ciency may play a role in ischemic stroke but current evidence regarding this hypothesis is inconsistent. Alternate hypotheses, including the role of androgens and/or a common cause of BMDand stroke, are also possible. Future studies, with measures ofendogenous hormones, are needed to unravel the relationshipbetween hormonal changes that occur with menopause, eitherpremature or at the usual onset, and ischemic stroke.

Keywords Thrombosis /C1Anticoagulation /C1 Internal medicine The importance of thrombosis and anticoagulation in clinical practice is rooted rmly in several fundamental constructs that can be applied both broadly and globally. First, hemostasis, representing the physiological or pro-tective phenotype of thrombosis is life-sustaining. Second, thrombotic disorders are common and occur in patients of all ages, races, ethnicities and medical/surgical condi-tions. Third, in many instances, thrombosis as venous myocardial infarction is preventable and treat-able. Awareness and the appropriate use of anticoagulant therapy remain the keys to prevention and treatment. However, to assure maximal efcacy and safety, the cli-nician must, according to the available evidence, choose the right drug, at the right dose, for the right patient, under the right indication, and for the right duration of time. The opportunity to share ideas, and advance the care of patients with thrombotic disorders, is the fundamental tenet of practicing clinicians worldwide. This can only be accomplished through knowledge gained from carefully designed, meticulously conducted and honestly interpretedtranslational and clinical research.R. D. Lopes /C1R. C.

The symposium waspromoted by the Federal University of Sao Paulo together with the Brazilian Society of Internal Medicine and the Duke Clinical Research Institute of Duke UniversitySchool of Medicine. It was also supported by the Brazilian and Paulista Societies of Cardiology. The chairmen of the meeting were Dr. Renato D. Lopes and Dr. Richard C.Becker, both from Duke University School of Medicine and the Duke Clinical Research Institute. The symposium took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil from the 23-25 of October,2008. The primary objective for the 3 days of academic pre- sentations and open discussions was to educate, motivateand inspire internists, cardiologists and hematologists by convening national and international visionaries, thought- leaders and dedicated clinician-scientists in Sao Paulo,Brazil. The following is a focused summary of the sym- posium proceedings. Thrombosis\u2014what is the role of the endothelium? It is widely recognized that the endothelium is not a static barrier between the vessel lumen and the vessel wall, but rather a dynamic organ that synthesizes, secretes and reg- ulates a wide variety of substances, including nitric oxide (NO), cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules andmediators that affect the function of different cells. The endothelium is the major regulator of vascular homeostasis. Under the transmigration. inhibits smooth muscle cell prolifer-ation and migration, platelet adhesion and aggregation, and displays both anticoagulant and probrinolytic Several traditional risk factors thelial cell ofobstructive atherosclerotic plaques. The resultant ''endo- thelial dysfunction'' is characterized a propensity toward vasoconstriction, release of inflammatory mediatorsand predisposition to thrombosis (Fig. 1). Endothelial dysfunction is considered a marker of early atherosclerosis, and is considered the pathophysiological foundation foratherosclerotic plaque progression, which include impaired vascular repair leading to erosion and disruption. Oxidative stress and the free-radical-mediated neutral- ization of nitric oxide (NO) are closely linked to atherothrombosis. Apart from NO, endothelial cells and plasmino- gen activator Under normal conditions,inhibitors of platelet and coagulalation pre- dominate, allowing thrombin generation and brin formation to be tightly regulated. In contrast, when theendothelium is dysfunctional, a shift toward a prothrom- botic state takes place. An increase in the expression of selectins promotes platelet adhesion to the endothelium.Adherent, activated platelets interact with and stimulate endothelial cells and monocytes, further amplifying the inflammatory environment that inherently typiesatherosclerosis. There is ample evidence linking endothelial dysfunction and changes in NO metabolism to atherothrombosis, pro-viding mechanistic support for an observed independent association between endothelial dysfunction and future cardiovascular events. Accordingly, treatment strategiestargeting endothelium/NO pathways may promote vascular health and reduce thrombotic events. For example, risk factor control, statins, angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors, physical exercise, antioxidants and red wine improve endothelial performance. Cell-based therapeutics that target signaling pathways implicated in endothelial dysfunction may confer additional benet and warrant further investigation.Endothelial dysfunction Reduced NO bioavailability Vasoconstriction, vascular inflammation, cell proliferation, thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis Atherosclerotic plaque growth Stable anginaAtherosclerotic plaque vulnerability Acute coronary syndromesArterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipid disorders, obesity, smoking, aging, genetic factors Oxidative stress Fig. 1 Cardiovascular risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction, closely associated with oxidative stress and characterized by reducednitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. The dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells establishes an environment characterized by a propensity toward vasoconstriction; the release of inflammatorymediators; and. a marked predisposition to thrombosis. Endothelialdysfunction is a fundamental pathophysiological alteration that governs initiation, growth and erosion/rupture of atherosclerotic plaque-the proximate cause of orunstable angina and acute myocardial infarctionHighlights from the I international symposium 107 123Thrombosis and hemostasis Fibrin clot formation, the basis for both protective hemostasis and pathological thrombosis, is a complex, cell-based process represented by several integrated biochemi- cal steps designed to maintain blood fluidity and vascular integrity. Following vascular injury, platelets tether and ultimately adhere to collagen bers within the subendothelium-a physical event mediated by platelet membrane glyco-proteins GPIaIIa, GP VI, GP 1b, GPIIbIIIa, and von Willebrand factor, which represent the predominant ligand for both transient and stable adhesion and brinogen thatbuilds a ''bridge'' between adjacent platelets, establishing a stable aggregate. Activated platelets expose phospholipids that, in turn, provide a surface for coagulation protein assembly. Tissue factor, in the presence of calcium ions and the exposed phospholipids on the activated platelet membrane, initiatesactivation of factor VII at the site of endothelial injury. Activated factor VII (VIIa) activates factor IX which, in the presence of factor VIII, forms the X-ase complex thatactivates factor X. Factor Xa, in the presence of factor Va forms the prothrombinase complex that cleaves the pro- thrombin molecule, forming a small amount of thrombin.Thrombin is capable of activating both factors V and VIII, thus creating a positive feedback loop that leads to addi- tional thrombin formation. Thrombin, by generates monomers that polymerize toform the Finally, thrombin activates factor XIII, which promotes covalent binding within gamma chains of brin to stabilize the brin clot. Several intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, such as bin- olysis by plasmin or the inactivation of coagulation proteins by endogenous anticoagulants like antithrombinIII and activated protein C provide a counterbalance that, in most instances, prevents pathologic (or unwanted) thrombosis. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the only oral anticoagulants available for clinical use until now, and have been used for more than 60 years. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated for primary and secondary VTEprophylaxis, prevention of systemic embolism in patients with atrial brillation, prosthetic cardiac valves, or large myocardial infarctions, particularly with mural thrombosis. VKAs exert their effect by inhibiting vitamin K oxide reductase, thus limiting the amount of reduced vitamin Kavailable for the c-carboxylation of the glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of coagulation proteins II, VII, IX and X. This specic carboxylation step is an absolute prerequisite for calcium- dependent binding to cofactors onphospholipid surfaces- its absence reduces the coagulant potential of the blood. VKAs also interfere with carbox- ylation of the anticoagulant proteins C, S and Z and severalproteins synthesized in bone. There are two VKAs available in Brazil: warfarin, the most commonly used, with a half-life of about 35 h and phenprocoumon, a much longer-acting agent, with a half- life of 5.5 days. Both preparations are metabolized by thecytochrome P450 system in the liver. Individual response to VKAs varies greatly depending on genetic factors, concomitant diseases and both medi-cation and food interactions. For these reasons, close monitoring of treatment with VKAs is necessary; to include INR determinations at least every 4 weeks, clinicalinterview, and ascertainment of new (or changes in) med- ications or foods. The INR provides a reliable and evidence-based parameter for effectiveness and risk ofbleeding, and must be maintained in the range between 2 and 3 for most patients. The effect of VKAs may be attenuated or fully reversed by vitamin K administration. Antithrombotics in acute coronary syndrome with st-segment elevation Advances in the management of patients with STEMI have been achieved with antithrombotic pharmacotherapies. Further contributions are likely with new compounds such as oral, direct factor Xa inhibitors (otamixaban, Among theapproved drugs, important data has been presented in the last few years. A brief summary is presented below: (A) Antiplatelet drugs : Clopidogrel was tested against placebo in two STEMI studies that included a total of nearly 49,000 patients. The primary endpoint inCLARITY was the composite of an occluded culprit coronary artery, death or reinfarction at the time of the coronary angiography or at hospital discharge.A 36% risk reduction ( P\\0.001) in the main endpoint, in favor of clopidogrel was demonstrated. In COMMIT, the primary endpoint was a compositeof death, reinfarction or stroke up to 28 days, and the results showed a 9% relative risk reduction (P=0.002), also in favor of clopidogrel. In both studies, the bleeding rates were similar between clopidogrel and placebo. The ACC/AHA STEMI108 R. D. Lopes et al. 123guidelines recommend clopidogrel whether or not reperfusion therapy has been provided. More recentlythe TRITON Trial was published, and its sub- analysis for patients with STEMI was presented during the European Society of Cardiology Congress.The results were as follows: incidence of the primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) at 30 days of for P=0.02). There was no signicant difference in bleeding between groups. (B) Antithrombin drugs : In 2001 the HERO-2 study was published, showing that bivalirudin, in addition to streptokinase, had a similar 30-day mortality rate(primary endpoint) compared to UFH, but an increase in the incidence of bleeding. The CREATE study was published in 2005, and reported a lower incidence ofdeath, reinfarction or stroke at 7 and 30 days (main endpoint\u2014HR of 0.87, P=0.014) for reviparin compared to placebo, but at the cost of increasedmajor bleeds (HR =2.49, P=0.001). The OASIS-6 Trial, published in 2006 included 12,000 patients treated initially with either brinolytics or primaryPCI, and then randomized to fondaparinux, placebo or UFH. The primary efcacy endpoint was the composite of death or MI at 30 days. The observedhazard-ratios were as follows: for the comparison of fondaparinux and placebo or UFH, 0.86 ( P=0.008); for the comparison of fondaparinux and placebo, 0.79(P\\0.05); and, for the comparison of fondaparinux and UFH, 0.95 ( P=NS). Moreover, interaction ( P=0.03) between fonda- parinux and primary PCI, with a hazard-ratio of 1.20 for patients undergoing PCI, and 0.88 for those without primary PCI. There were no signicantdifferences in bleeding, between fondaparinux and UFH. A meta-analysis including 27,000 patients treated with LMWH or UFH, revealed a signicant16% net clinical benet in favor of enoxaparin in relation to UFH.Based on the available information, the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend UFH, enoxap-arin or fondaparinux for patients with STEMI, but caution that ''because of the risk of catheter throm- bosis, fondaparinux should not be used as the soleanticoagulant to support PCI''. Anticoagulation in acute coronary syndromse without ST-segment elevation Platelets play a pivotal role in the transformation of a stable to an unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Disruption of anatherosclerotic plaque exposes the subendothelial matrix (e.g. collagen and tissue factor) to circulating blood. Antiplatelet therapy, a cornerstone of therapy in NSTE- ACS, is directed at decreasing the formation of throm-boxane A 2(aspirin), inhibiting the P2Y12-mediated platelet activation (thienopyridines) and inhibiting platelet aggregation (GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors). In four ran-domized trials, the use of aspirin versus placebo was associated with a 50% reduction in death or MI. Therefore, after an initial dose of 162-325 mg, a dose of 75-100 mg daily is recommended in patients with ACS. Clopidogrel when added to aspirin, confers a 20% reduction in car-diovascular death, MI, or stroke, compared with aspirin alone, in both low- and high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS. The dose of clopidogrel for medical treatment is 300 mg,followed by 75 mg daily. The benet of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is most evident when used in high-risk patients (e.g. elevated troponin, diabetes mellitus). Abciximab iscurrently approved only in patients undergoing PCI within 12 h of treatment initiation. Eptibatide and tiroban can be used in either a conservative or intervention-basedstrategy. Anticoagulation, traditionally with unfractionated hep- arin (UFH) therapy for patientswith NSTE-ACS. A meta-analysis showed a 33% reduction in death or MI comparing UFH plus aspirin versus aspirin alone. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) combinefactor IIa and Xa inhibition and both the action and generation of thrombin. LMWH has several potential advantages over UFH. In ESSENCE and TIMI 11B trials,enoxaparin was superior to UFH, with a statistically sig- nicant 20% reduction in events among moderate-risk patients. In the SYNERGY trial, including high-riskpatients managed with an invasive strategy enoxaparin was found to be noninferior to UFH. The standard dose of en- oxaparin is 1 mg/kg given subcutaneously (SC) every 12 h. Fondaparinux is a synthetic, indirect, specic factor Xa inhibitor that requires antithrombin III for its pharmaco- dynamic activity. In the OASIS-5 trial, fondaparinux at adose of 2.5 mg SC once daily produced similar rates of death, MI or refractory ischemia to enoxaparin, but with substantially less major bleeding. Direct thrombin inhibitors have a theoretical advantage over heparin compounds; they do not require antithrombin III and can inhibit clot-bound thrombin; they do notinteract with plasma proteins, they provide a very stable level of anticoagulation and do not cause thrombocytope- nia. In the ACUITY trial, patients were managed with anearly invasive strategy, and randomized to receive either bivalirudin alone, enoxaparin or UFH plus a GP bivalirudin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Nodifferences were observed between the three treatment arms for the composite of death, MI or unplannedHighlights from the I international symposium 109 123revascularization at 30 days, but bivalirudin caused less bleeding compared with the other two arms (3% vs. 5% vs. a common complication of myocardial infarction (MI) with a reported incidence ranging from 5% to 23%. It is associated with worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes. Although antithrombotic therapy is important in the treatment of patients with both AF and MI, the combined administration of aspirin, thienopyridines, and a vitamin K antagonist (triple therapy) increases the risk of bleeding.The current AF guidelines recommend VKA anticoagulant therapy for patients with a CHADS 2score C2 as a class IA recommendation. Guidelines also recommend low doseaspirin (81 mg/day), clopidogrel, and warfarin (with target INR 2.0-2.5) after stenting for patients with acute coronary syndromes and a concomitant indication for oral antico-agulation. The available literature on the subject of ''triple therapy'' shows that patients with AF and ACS are not discharged from the hospital on a VKA. Paradoxically,patients deemed to be at highest risk of stroke (CHADS 2 score C2) are least likely to be treated due to physician concerns over the potential risk of bleeding. New onset AF that develops in the setting of ACS continues to be a marker of poor short and long-term prognosis. There appears to be a ''treatment-risk paradox''concerning VKA use, highlighting the need for additional investigation to better understand risk-benet relationships and optimal management strategies. Atrial brillation The prevalence of atrial brillation (AF) is increasing worldwide. Older age, hypertension, heart failure, andobesity all increase the risk of developing AF. Atrial brillation is a potent risk factor for stroke raising the risk on average 5-fold. The seminal trials in nonvalvular AFdemonstrated the remarkable efcacy of warfarin in stroke prevention with a risk reduction of 68%. Current guidelines recommend warfarin for patients with stroke, transientischemic attack, or systemic embolism and for patients with two or more of the following risk factors: age 75 years and greater, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus.Aspirin or warfarin is recommended if only one of these risk factors is present, depending on patient preference. Despite the efcacy of warfarin, numerous studies haveshown that only about one-half of patients are treated. Older age and perceived bleeding risk are the most often-cited negative predictive factors. Difculty with warfarin monitoring is also a major obstacle to its use. Recent randomized trials have focused on maintenance of sinus rhythm and the potential role of antiplatelet ther-apy in stroke prevention in AF. These studies have illustrated that prolonged maintenance of sinus rhythm remains elusive and antiplatelet agents, either as mono-therapy or in combination (aspirin plus clopidogrel), is less efcacious than anticoagulant treatment in AF. Because the 30-day mortality of AF-related stroke is 24%, use of less efcacious agents mandates careful consideration. Current trials in AF will explore the efcacy of novel anticoagulantdrugs as potential replacements for warfarin. Hemorrhage is a serious adverse effect of antithrombotic therapy. The clinical dilemma in atrial brillation is thatboth risk of stroke and risk of hemorrhage increase with age. Older age is also associated with lower warfarin dose requirements and a slower return to therapeutic levelsfollowing an episode of excessive anticoagulation. Con- comitant antiplatelet therapy also increases the risk of extracranial and intracranial hemorrhage. Strategies tominimize these risks include vigilant monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) with a target INR of 2.5, maintaining blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg,and minimizing concomitant aspirin use. It is important to emphasize that the frequency and severity of stroke in AF outweigh the risk of warfarin-related hemorrhage for mostpatients. New studies on atrial brillation There are several ongoing phase II and phase III trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial brillation. They are summarized in Figs. 2,3and4. The trials of warfarin (versus placebo) for stroke prevention inatrial brillation included approximately 3,800 patients. Recently completed and ongoing trials will include a total of 71,600 patients. The results of these trials are eagerlyawaited and will be important to better understand this common disease and to improve patient care. VTE prophylaxis in Brazil\u2014a global perspective VTE, as a public health problem, frequently affects hos- pitalized patients at risk for thromboembolic events and represents a major eld for prophylaxis interventions.Guideline-recommended thromboprophylaxis reduces the burden of VTE, both in at-risk surgical and medical patients. However, multinational, prospective registriessuch as the IMPROVE show that risk factors are very common in medical patients (93% have at least one risk110 R. D. Lopes et al. 123factor), but that VTE prophylaxis is underutilized in the participating countries. In Brazil, the utilization of pro- phylaxis was signicantly less than ''rest of world'' (36% vs. 51%), particularly among the public hospitals. TheENDORSE study, a large, global observational study of VTE prophylaxis in medical and surgical patients, included 32 countries, 358 hospitals and 68,183 patients. Using across-sectional design, the study showed that more than half of the hospitalized patients were at-risk of VTE and that prophylaxis was underutilized in both surgical and medical patients (59% and 40%, respectively). Therefore, there is a clear gap between guidelines and clinical prac-tice, observed across many countries. VTE prophylaxis in special patient populations Given the coexisting risk of thrombosis and bleeding asso- ciated with acute CVA, the PREVAIL study evaluated the efcacy and safety of enoxaparin (40 mg SC daily) versus heparin 12-12 h) the pre-vention of VTE. The study showed that enoxaparin was superior to UFH for the prevention of VTE and proximal deep vein thrombosis, reducing the overall incidence by43% without increasing the risk of major bleeding. The EXCLAIM study investigated the potential benet of pro- longed VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients withrecent reduced mobility. Hospitalized medical patients were randomized to enoxaparin (40 mg daily) or placebo for an additional 28 days after initial 10 day-prophylaxis withenoxaparin. The study showed a signicant reduction in VTE (4.9% vs. 2.8%). Major bleeding was signicantly more frequent in the enoxaparin group (0.6% vs. 0.1%). Onecould conclude that highly selected, acutely ill medical patients, including those with reduced mobility, age [75 years, malignancy or previous history of VTE, might benet from extended prophylaxis beyond the recom- mended 10 \u00b14 days, but at a cost of increased bleeding. Brazilian guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in medical patients VTE refers to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), frequent complications responsible for 10%of deaths in the hospital. Although classically related to sur- gical procedures, fatal PE can occur in high-risk medical patients as well. VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized patientsremains low, partially due to the lack of readily available risk assessment tools and widely implemented ''triggers'' for ordering prophylactic measures upon hospital admission. In 2006, 12 Brazilian Medical Societies published the ''Brazilian Guideline for VTE Prophylaxis in Medical Ongoing Trials of Ongoing Trials of AntithromboticAntithrombotic Therapy Therapy for Stroke Prevention in for Stroke 2 Ongoing Placebo-control phase III trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial brillation Ongoing Trials of Ongoing Trials of AntithromboticAntithrombotic Therapy Therapy for Stroke Prevention in for Stroke 4 Ongoing Warfarin-control phase III trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial brillation Ongoing Trials of Ongoing Trials of AntithromboticAntithrombotic Therapy Therapy for Stroke Prevention in for Stroke Ongoing Warfarin-control phase II trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial brillationHighlights from the I international symposium 111 123Patients'' as part of the Guidelines Project of the Brazilian Medical Association ( http://www.projetodiretrizes.org.br/ volume_4.php ). A systematic review was performed, with the objective to identify diseases and conditions associatedwith VTE and the optimal strategy for its prevention. An algorithm was subsequently developed to assist physicians in day-to-day clinical practice. Risk assessmentEvery medical patient admitted must have his/her VTE risk evaluated. Patients 40 years of age or older, with reducedmobility and at least one additional risk factor for VTE must be considered at risk. In the absence of contraindi- cations, prophylaxis should be provided. Patients youngerthan 40 years, but having one or more risk factors for VTE may also benet from prophylaxis. Prophylaxis For prophylaxis, once a day (enoxaparin 40 mg, dalteparin 5.000 IU, or nadroparin 3,800 and 5,700 IU, respectively for patients weighing 70 kg or more), or SC unfractionated heparin,5.000 IU three times a day, may be used. Prophylaxis should continue for 6-14 days, even if the patient resumes ambulation. Improving VTE prophylaxis in medical patients There are several barriers for implementation of an effec- tive VTE prophylaxis program, beginning with lack ofawareness of the recommendations, resistance to change, fear of inducing bleeding, absence of institutional policies, economical barriers, and lack of an adequate risk assess-ment tool. It is widely recognized that continuing medical education (CME) initiatives, including lectures and dis- semination of guidelines are not effective. Multifacetedinterventions, targeting specic barriers are more effective than single-strategy interventions. A combined approach must include formal presentations of the guidelines tohospital physicians; distribution of the printed guidelines; creation of a working group to identify local barriers to change; use of printed or electronic reminders, and constantevaluation of physician and institution performance. VTE prophylaxis programsIdentication of interested personnel is an important rst step in the development of a VTE prophylaxis program.The hospital administration must also be engaged and committed to the process and support the establishment ofa Commission for VTE Prophylaxis (CVTEP) that should be multidisciplinary, with participation of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and hospital quality control personnel. The CVTEP should be proactive, per-forming a daily evaluation of prophylaxis utilization to include patient selection and dosing in every area of the hospital. The CVTEP should also be responsible for pro-viding physician feedback and establishing mechanisms for continued quality improvement. Additional strategies for success include staff presentations emphasizing VTE pro- phylaxis in medical, surgical, and subspecialties areas, distribution of educational material, decision-support sys-tems, risk assessment tools, and electronic alerts. An active, integrated, and multifaceted approach may be the key to achieving and maintaining long term compliancewith VTE risk evaluation and prophylaxis. Orthopedics surgery\u2014How to prevent thromboembolic events? Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery are at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events; proven prophylactic measures are available but are generally underused. Theincidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery is reported to range from 40% to 60% in patients who did not receivethromboprophylaxis. Several studies provide evidence of a signicant A new class of oral anticoagulants, direct factor Xa inhibitors, appears particularly promising. The RECORD program included several phase III trials that compared the efcacy and safety of rivaroxaban to enoxaparin in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.The RECORD 1 investigated VTE thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. It was random- ized, double-blind study that assigned 4,541 patients toreceive either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban once daily, begin- ning after surgery, or 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily, beginning the evening before surgery, plus aplacebo tablet or injection. A total of 3,153 patients were included in the superiority analysis and 4,433 were included in the safety analysis. There was a highly statistically sig-nicant reduction in total VTE favoring rivaroxaban group and 2.0% in the group (absolute risk reduction, 1.7%; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5; P\\0.001). The RECORD 2 study compared the use of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis with short-term throm- Lopes et al. 123undergo elective total hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned, stratied according to centre to receive oral riv- aroxaban 10 mg once daily for a total of 31-39 days or enoxaparin 40 mg given subcutaneously once daily for 10-14 days (with a placebo tablet given for 31-39 days). Analyses were done using a modied intention-to-treat population. The primary outcome occurred in 2.0%patients in the rivaroxaban group, compared with 9.3% in the enoxaparin group (absolute risk reduction 7.3%; 95% CI 5.2-9.4; P\\0.0001). The incidence of any on-treat- ment bleeding was similar in both groups (6.6% events in the rivaroxaban safety population vs. 5.5% in the enoxap-arin safety population; P=0.25). Finally, in RECORD 3 the efcacy and safety of riva- roxaban in preventing venous thrombosis after total kneearthroplasty was studied. In this randomized, double-blind trial, 2,531 patients who were to undergo total knee arthroplasty received either oral rivaroxaban, 10 mg oncedaily, beginning 6-8 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily, beginning 12 h before sur- gery. The primary efcacy outcome occurred in 9.6% ofrivaroxaban-treated patients and 18.9% of enoxaparin- treated patients in 1.0% 2.6% respectively (absolute risk reduction, 1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4-2.8; P=0.01). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and 0.5% of patients in the enox- ( P=NS). (perioperative) anticoagulation: risks and benets Patients taking VKA anticoagulant therapy may require interruption of treatment to undergo either surgery or aninvasive procedure. During temporary discontinuations, the physician (and patient) must weigh the risks and benets of administering ''bridging'' (short-acting) anticoagulantssuch as unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Although there is a lack of evidence from ran- domized controlled trials that denes an optimal peri-operative anticoagulation strategy, several prospective cohort studies suggest that, even for patients at high risk of thromboembolism (e.g. a recent pulmonary embolism or aprosthetic mechanical heart valve), peri-procedural LMWH is associated with a low rate of thromboembolic events. The major challenge for clinicians is an even greaterpaucity of information on the risk of thromboembolism without bridging therapy. Indeed two recently published studies suggest that, for many patients with atrial brilla-tion, the risk of simple warfarin interruption may be quite low. The results of these observational studies especiallywhen considered cumulatively with cost, inconvenience and bleeding risk conferred by peri-operative anticoagu- lants, highlight the need for a randomized, controlled trial of bridging therapy. Such a trial-the Bridge study, fundedby the United States National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\u2014is ongoing. Oral anticoagulation in valvular heart disease Valvular heart disease is associated with a risk of throm- boembolism and resulting morbidity and mortality.Warfarin and Phenprocoumon are available in Brazil, decreasing blood levels of vitamin K dependent coagula- tion factors by 50-75% and biological activity of newfactors being synthesized by 20-30%. Patient education is a critical component of treatment, with emphasis on what to do if bleeding occurs, when to perform blood tests, targetINR, drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions and the impact of exercise on warfarin response. Our approach to patients requiring warfarin is as fol- lows: we begin with a dose of 5 mg and perform an INR measurement on the third and seventh day, adjusting the dose accordingly to achieve the chosen INR. In the settingof acute thrombotic disorders, heparin is maintained until the target INR is achieved. We prefer that our patients continue their regular diet, rather than changing to a dietrestricted in vitamin K-containing foods. The optimal INR varies by indication, but typically ranges from 2.0 to 4.0, with values less than 2.0 being associated with thrombosisrisk, and those [4.0 posing a risk for serious bleeding. Increased bleeding episodes occur most often within the rst 90 days of treatment initiation among patients withuncontrolled hypertension, INR [4.0, previous bleeding episodes, occult malignancies and in those with medication noncompliance and poor follow-up for coagulation moni-toring. Anticoagulants should be avoided in patients unable to understand all aspects of treatment; have inadequate resources;or in whom the potential risk of bleeding out-weighs the benet of treatment. New anticoagulants A brief overview of anticoagulants and platelet-directed therapies under development, and their respective targets of inhibition is summarized in Figs. 5and6. Anticoagulation in patients with malignancy The association between thrombosis and cancer was established by the French physician Armand Trousseau inHighlights from the I international symposium 113 1231865, when he described thrombophlebitis or phlegmasia as a presenting sign of visceral malignancy. It is wellestablished that tumor cells can secrete factors that initiate coagulation, including tissue factor and cancer procoagu- lant protein, which directly activates factor X. It has alsobeen shown that ''cryptic proteins'' in the coagulation system, in the brinolytic system and secreted by platelets can affect angiogenesis, an essential process for tumorgrowth and metastasis. VTE is a major complication of cancer and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated thatVTE occurs in 4-20% of patients with cancer, and 14.3% of hospitalized cancer patients die as a direct result of pulmonary embolism (EP). Chemotherapy and hormonaltreatment, particularly tamoxifen, increase the risk of VTE as does surgery. Anticoagulant therapy is used in two classic conditions in cancer patients: for treatment of VTE episodes and as aprophylactic measure for hospitalized patients, particularly those who undergo surgery lasting more than 30 min. Although the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend VTE prophylaxis for ambulatory cancerpatients, several recent reports suggest that high-risk patients may in fact benet from this approach. Cancer patients frequently have long-term indwelling central venous catheters for administration of blood prod- ucts, chemotherapy and parenteral nutrition. Catheter- related venous thrombosis is one of the most common complications, but routine antithrombotic prophylaxis is not recommended. How to diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a limb-and life-threatening immune-based disorder characterized by the formation of IgG antibodies against an antigenic complex consisting of as a platelet count either 50% or more below baseline or less than 150 910 9/l develops in 30-50% of patients who develop heparin-PF4 antibodies, In turn, thrombosis involving the arterial, venous and less often microcirculatory system occurs in30-50% of patients with thrombocytopenia. In most instances, antibody production requires 3-5 days of daily heparin exposure; however, antibodies can develop withinhours of exposure, particularly in patients with recent heparin treatment or weeks later\u2014a condition known as delayed HIT. Clinical suspicion is the key to diagnosis, with conr- mation subsequently provided by documentation of heparin-PF4 antibodies using either a functional, ELISA-based or platelet serotonin release-determined assay. The management of HIT must begin with complete cessation of all heparin products, followed by infusion of adirect thrombin inhibitor\u2014lepirudin, argatroban or biva- lirudin (for patients A vitamin K antagonist should notbe insti- tuted until a direct thrombin inhibitor is started and the platelet count has increased to baseline or to a level above 150910 9/l. The recommended duration of vitamin K antagonist treatment is, at a minimum, 6 weeks and longer if a thrombotic condition dictates. Future directions: pharmacogenomics The majority of common diseases arise from interactions between innate and acquired genetic alterations, sTM (ART-123) Bates, J Thromb Haemost 2007TTP889Novel anticoagulants ATI-5923Aptamer/antidote Fig. 5 Novel anticoagulants and targets of inhibition Antithrombotic Environmental Scan Available (or in phase IIb/III clinical trials)Antithrombotic Environmental Scan Available (or in reversal Fig. 6 Antithrombotic therapy for acute coronary syndrome and atrial brillation114 R. D. Lopes et al. 123to varying environmental factors and life style. Accord- ingly, they are referred to as complex diseases. Common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and dia- betes are examples of complex diseases. Variations inDNA sequence and gene expression, influenced by envi- ronmental factors, determine individual differences in susceptibility or protection to common diseases, as well asin the response to therapy. The development of drugs tai- lored specically to the patient's genetic prole or ''signature'', minimizing adverse effects and maximizing treatment response, constitutes the overarching theme of pharmacogenomics. The hereditary basis of individual variability for disease susceptibility and drug response were, for a long time, studied within the classic genetic paradigm, i.e. investi-gating polymorphisms or mutations in a particular gene and the co-segregation of these genes and the phenotype of interest along several generations. The sequencing andmapping of the human genome expanded the possibilities for studying genetic variability: 3 million genomic sites where individuals can differ by only one DNA nucleotidewere identied and these variations, called single nucleo- tide polymorphisms or SNPs, have subsequently been associated to risk for or protection from several diseases.Through SNP analysis it was shown that polymorphisms in the genes CYP2C9 e VKORC1, which have an essential role in warfarin's metabolism and pharmacological prole,determine a patients' response to this oral anticoagulant. Whether knowledge of a patient's genotype will allow clinicians to reduce the rate of adverse events such asbleeding remains to be established through carefully designed clinical trials.

Benjamin Initially submitted June 30, 2008; accepted for publication December 5, 2008. Cumulative exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage across the life course may be inversely associated with coronary heart disease (CHD); the mechanisms are not fully clear. An objective of this study was to determine whether cumulative life-course socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with CHD incidence in a well- characterized US cohort that had directly assessed childhood and adulthood measures of SEP and prospectivelymeasured CHD incidence. Furthermore, analyses aimed to evaluate whether adjustment for CHD risk factors reduces the association between cumulative life-course SEP and CHD. The authors examined 1,835 subjects who participated in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort from 1971 through 2003 (mean age, 35.0 years;52.4% women). Childhood SEP was measured as father's education; adulthood SEP was assessed as own education and occupation. CHD incidence included myocardial infarction, coronary insufciency, and coronary death. Cox proportional hazards analyses indicated that cumulative SEP was associated with incident CHD afteradjustment for age and sex (hazard ratio \u00bc1.82, 95% condence interval: 1.17, 2.85 for low vs. high cumulative SEP score). Adjustment for CHD risk factors reduced that magnitude of association (hazard ratio \u00bc1.29, 95% condence interval: 0.78, 2.13). These ndings underscore the potential importance of CHD prevention and treatment efforts for those whose backgrounds include low SEP throughout life. cohort studies; coronary disease; myocardial ischemia; social class; disease; CI, condence interval; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HR, hazard ratio; SEP, socioeconomic position. Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major cause of mortality in the United States and worldwide, responsible for 10% of the disability-adjusted life years lost in develop- ing countries and 18% in developed countries (1, 2). Stronginverse socioeconomic gradients in CHD exist in many de- veloped countries, where adulthood socioeconomic position (SEP) is typically measured as participants' own education,occupation, and income (3, 4). Evidence is fairly consistent that childhood SEP (often measured as parents' occupation or education) is also inversely associated with CHD in de-veloped countries (5, 6). There also tend to be socioeco-nomic gradients in the expected directions for CHD risk factors including smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, choles- terol, and, for women, obesity (3, 7-10).To better understand how SEP may influence CHD, it is informative to conceptualize SEP across the life course (11-13). People experience a certain set of socioeconomic circumstances at every phase of their lives; each period maytheoretically influence the course of chronic disease. The ''accumulation-of-risk'' SEP framework focuses on the total amount of (i.e., cumulative) exposure to socioeconomic dis-advantage (11, 12). Initial evidence suggests that, in a num- ber of studies in Europe using case-control designs (14) or nationally available death records (13, 15-18), cumulativeSEP is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease.Less is known about the association of cumulative SEP with incident CHD in the United States. Furthermore, little is known about whether specic CHD risk factors may be Correspondence to Dr. Eric B. Loucks, Douglas Mental Health Institute, McGill University, 6875 socioeco- nomic gradients in CHD. An objective of this study was to determine whether cu- mulative life-course SEP is associated with CHD incidence in a well-characterized US cohort (The Framingham Off- spring Study) that had directly assessed childhood andadulthood measures of SEP and prospectively measured CHD incidence. Furthermore, analyses aimed to evaluate whether adjustment for CHD risk factors reduces the asso-ciation between cumulative life-course SEP and CHD.Exploratory analyses further evaluated whether any specic CHD risk factors (e.g., smoking, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glucose, body mass index) may beparticularly important explanatory mechanisms for the as- sociation of life-course SEP with CHD incidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study sample The Framingham Heart Study is a community-based, lon- gitudinal, observational cohort study initiated in 1948 toprospectively investigate risk factors for CHD. The Framingham Offspring Study began in 1971 with recruit- ment of 5,124 men and women who were offspring (or off-spring's spouses) of the Original Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study. The design and selection criteria of the Framingham Offspring Study have been described else-where (19). At each examination visit, participants under- went medical history, physical examination, anthropometry, and laboratory assessment of CHD risk factors, as previ-ously described (19). Framingham participants signedinformed consent, and the Framingham Study is reviewed annually by the Boston University Medical Center Institu- tional Review Board. There were 5,124 participants who completed Offspring Study examination 1 (during 1971-1975), and 4,989 agreed for their data to be in the open-access data set. Ofthese, 2,136 had no father in the Original Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study and hence were excluded from analyses, leaving 2,853 particip ants. Of these participants, 119 had fathers whose education variable was missing. A further 818 were missing their own education or occupa- tion variables (150 died between examinations 1 and 2, 509did not attend examination 2 or 3, and 159 did not answer theeducation/occupation question), leaving 1,916 participants. We further restricted participants to those aged /C2128 years at the time their own educational attainment and occupationwere measured, and we excluded 21 participants with base- line CHD events, resulting in a nal sample of 1,835 partic- ipants. Analyses on excluded ( n\u00bc3,154) versus included participants found that excluded participants were more likely to be older (age 36.9 vs. 35.0 years, respectively; P<0.0001), to have slightly higher fasting glucose levels (103 mg/dL vs. 101 mg/dL, P<0.0001), and to be taking antihypertensive medications (3.7% vs. 2.5% of participants, P\u00bc0.03). Included and excluded participants were similar regarding other variables including sex, cigarette smoking,body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total:high densitylipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, cholesterol-lowering medication use, and incident CHD events. Childhood SEP: father's education Childhood SEP was measured by father's educational attainment, obtaine dd i r e c t l yf r o mO f f s p r i n gS t u d yc o h o r t participants' fathers who wer e enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study Original Cohort. Father's educational levelwas measured at enrollment between 1948 and 1950 when their mean age was 44 years (range: 28-62) (Figure 1). Father's education was ascertained directly from the fatheras a 6-category variable: /C20eighth grade, some high school (i.e., did not graduate from high school), high school grad- uate, some college (i.e., did not graduate from college), col-lege graduate, and a nal category including postgraduateschool, business college, nursing school, music school, and art school. For analyses, father's education was categorized into 3 groups: <high school, high school, and >high school. We explored the use of mother's education as a measure of childhood SEP. Mother's educational attainment was not associated with incident CHD in this cohort (hazard ratio(HR)\u00bc1.25, 95% condence interval (CI): 0.84, 1.90 for mother's education <high school vs. >high school, after adjusting for age and sex). The vast majority of mothers(84%) in this cohort had the same occupation (homemaker),likely because of the historical time period when Offspring Study participants were children (approximately during the 1930s-1950s), when it was less common for mothers towork outside the home. Consequently, father's education was used as a measure of childhood SEP. Adulthood SEP: own education and occupation Own education was measured directly from Framingham Offspring Study participants at examination 3 (1984-1987);1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 YearCoronary Heart Disease Incidence Assessed Own Education Assessed Own Occupation Assessed Father's Education Assessed Figure 1. Time line of assessments for exposures (father's edu- cation, own occupation, own education) and outcome (coronaryheart disease incidence). Covariates were assessed at examination1 of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (1971-1975),Framingham, Massachusetts. Enrollment and initiation of exam-ination 1 for the Original Cohort of the Framingham Heart Studytook place during 1948-1950. Enrollment and initiation of exam- ination 1 for the Offspring Cohort took place during 1971-1975. Initiation of Offspring Cohort examination 2 took place during1979-1982. Initiation of Offspring Cohort examination 3 occurredduring 1984-1987.830 Loucks et al. Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:829-836if examination 3 education was missing, the examination 2 assessment (1979-1982) was used (Figure 1). Education was available in 6 categories of years of education: 0-4,5-8, 9-11, 12, 13-16, /C2117. For analyses, own collapsed into 3 groups: /C2012, 13-16, and /C2117 years of education. Own occupation was measured at examination2 (1979-1982) by asking what kind of work the partici- pants do (or did), categorized as professional, executive, supervisory, technical, laborer, clerical, sales, and house-wife. To obtain higher levels of education or occupation,participants were restricted to those aged /C2128 years when educational attainment and occupation were measured to allow 10 years from likely completion of high school (atage 18 years on average). Sensitivity analyses using data on participants aged /C2140 years were performed, as described below. Accumulation-of-risk SEP framework Analyses utilizing an accumulation-of-risk framework used a cumulative SEP score (range: 0-6) including ( <high executive/professional/supervisory/ technical \u00bc2). Higher cutpoints were used for educational categories of Offspring Study compared with Original Cohortfathers to account for secular trends of increased normative levels of education across generations. Coronary heart disease At all examinations, participants underwent standard- ized physician-administered medical history assessments. All participants suspected of experiencing stroke were in-vited back for a detailed neurologic examination. Hospital and nursing home records as well as outside medical of- ce records were routinely sought for all cardiovascularevents and all deaths. In addition, Framingham Study per- sonnel surveyed the only hospital in town daily for par- ticipant emergency room visits and hospitalizations.Suspected cardiovascular disease events and deaths werereviewed by a panel of 3 investigators, who examine all relevant available data (Framingham Study clinic data; outside medical, nursing home, and hospitalization rec-ords) and make event determinations by using previously published criteria (20). CHD incidence was identied as occurring in participants diagnosed since onset of the Framingham Offspring Study (1971-1975) until 2003 (Figure 1). Clinically validated CHD events included myocardial infarction, coronary in-sufciency, and coronary death (sudden and nonsudden). Secondary analyses investigated the outcome cardiovascular disease, which included clinically validated measures ofmyocardial infarction, coronary cerebro- vascular accident), failure requiring hospitalization,and death due to the aforementioned outcomes.Covariates Risk factors were measured at baseline, Offspring Study examination 1 (1971-1975) (Figure 1). Cigarette smokingwas determined by self-report and was dened as smokingregularly in the year prior to the examination. Systolic blood pressure was calculated as the average of the clinic physi- cian's 2 seated systolic blood pressure measurements. Bodymass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m 2). Body weight was measured to the nearest 1 pound with a standing beam bal-ance and with subjects wearing examination robes and undergarments. This measurement was then converted to kilograms (1 pound \u00bc0.454 kg). Height was measured with the use of a stadiometer (to the nearest 0.25 inch and was then converted to meters (1 inch \u00bc0.025 m). Fasting glu- cose was measured with a hexokinase reagent kit (A-gentglucose test; Abbott, South Pasadena, California). Glucoseassays were run in duplicate, and the intraassay coefcient of variation ranged from 2% to 3% depending on the assayed glucose concentration. HDL and total cholesterolconcentrations were measured by automated enzymatic techniques (21). Medication use was self-reported. Statistical analyses Sex- and age-adjusted descriptive statistics (predicted means and percent prevalences) were generated for CHD and CHD risk factors (systolic blood pressure, total:HDL cholesterol ratio, fasting glucose, body mass index, cigarettesmoking, and antihypertensive medication use) according to father's education, own education, and own occupation. Cox proportional hazards analyses evaluated the associa- tion of SEP with incidence of CHD. Secondary analysesused cardiovascular disease instead of CHD as the outcome. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders including age and sex, as well as for CHD risk factors (describedabove). Cholesterol medication use was not included in analyses because only 5 participants used these medications at baseline. Pearson correlation coefcients and varianceinflation were used to evaluate collinearity, which found that systolic and diastolic blood pressure variables were highly collinear ( r\u00bc0.81). The 3 SEP variables (father's educa- tion, own education, and own occupation) were found to have minimal variance inflation and were not correlated highly enough to be of concern to simultaneously adjustfor all 3 in a single multivariable model (correlation co-efcients ranged from 0.27 to 0.51). Consequently, all 3 measures of SEP were simultaneously adjusted for in anal- yses to evaluate whether any specic SEP measures contrib-uted more strongly to CHD risk. Marginal hazards models were run by using the procedure PHREG in SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc.,Cary, North Carolina) with option COVSANDWICH to ac- count for clustering of outcomes by family. Sex-specic analyses were underpowered and could not be conductedbecause only 44 CHD events in females and 100 events inmales occurred. Formal interaction tests did not show evi- dence of effect modication by sex. Consequently, data for males and females were pooled in analyses. Power analysesLife-Course SEP and CHD 831 Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:829-836were performed by using the computer program PS: Power and Sample Size Calculations, version 2.1.31 (Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee) according to criteriareported by Dupont and Plummer (22). Sensitivity analyses were performed on a sample further restricted to participants /C2140 years of age (rather than /C2128 years of age) at baseline to assess associations between occupation and CHD incidence among participants who had more time to attain higher occupational levels. Furthersensitivity analyses investigated associations between cu-mulative life-course SEP and CHD incidence during the time frame after which all SEP measures were obtained (1988-2003 rather than 1971-2003) (Figure 1). RESULTS The Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants in- cluded in the present study were a mean age of 35.0 years atbaseline, and 52.4% were women. The age range at exami-nation 1 (1971-1975) was 19-62 years. Father's education was inversely associated with several CHD risk factors, in- cluding smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure,total:HDL cholesterol ratio, and fasting glucose. Own edu- cation was inversely associated with smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total:HDL cholesterol ratio. Own occupationwas inversely related to smoking and body mass index. Fur- thermore, unequal proportions of females were represented in the own education and occupation categories (Table 1). Age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models showed that cumulative SEP across the life course was in- versely associated with CHD incidence (HR \u00bc1.82, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.85 for low vs. high cumulative SEP score) (Table 2).Further adjustment for CHD risk factors reduced the associ- adjusting for individual CHD risk factors, smoking wasassociated with the greatest reduction in the point estimate (age-, sex-, and smoking-adjusted HR \u00bc1.43, 95% CI: body mass index, systolic blood pressure,and HDL:total cholesterol ratio also somewhat reduced the effect size; adjusting for fasting glucose and antihypertensive medication use had little effect on the strength of associationbetween cumulative SEP and CHD incidence (Table 2). In an effort to provide information regarding whether any of the 3 subcomponents of the cumulative SEP score may becontributing particularly strongly to the gradient between cu-mulative SEP and CHD incidence, we analyzed the individual association of father's education, own education, and own occupation with CHD incidence. Father's education andown education were inversely associated with CHD inci- dence after adjusting for age and sex (HR \u00bc1.65, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.66 for father's education school, and educa- tion/C2012 years vs. /C2117 years; Table 3). Further adjustment for other SEP measures reduced the estimated effect sizes onlya small amount for both father's education and own education(HR\u00bc1.53, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.55 whose father's school, and HR \u00bc1.62, 95% CI: 0.85, 3.09 for participants whose own /C2012 years vs. /C2117 years). However, the95% condence intervals encompassed both a null effect (i.e., HR\u00bc1.0) and a large effect (e.g., HR \u00bc2.5), indicating that the statistical power was low (1 /C0b\u00bc0.43 for a cumulative 30-year incidence of CHD of Occupation was not asso- ciated with CHD incidence (Table 3). We conducted a series of secondary analyses. Analyses were repeated by using cardiovascular disease instead ofCHD as an outcome (Web Tables 1 and 2; this informationis described in the rst 2 of 3 supplementary tables, all of which are posted on the Journal 's website (http://aje. oupjournals.org/)). Findings were generally similar wheneither outcome was used. Sensitivity analyses were per- formed to assess the association of occupation with CHD and cardiovascular disease incidence among participantsaged/C2140 years rather than aged /C2128 years, as used in the analyses described above. Effect sizes were similar in both sets of analyses (Web Table 3). Because own education(1979-1987) and occupation (1979-1982) were assessedafter commencement of CHD incidence measurements (1971-2003), we performed sensitivity analyses restricted to the years after completion of all SEP measures(1988-2003) to evaluate whether the timing of SEP and CHD measures had an impact on the ndings. Analyses showed similar socioeconomic gradients in CHD (HR forhigh vs. low cumulative SEP score \u00bc1.94, 95% CI: 1.19, 3.17 after adjusting for age and sex). DISCUSSION Evidence from our study supported an inverse association of cumulative life-course SEP with CHD incidence. Further adjustment for CHD risk factors substantially attenuated the strength of association. Prior literature With regard to adulthood socioeconomic disparities in CHD, a systematic review showed consistent inverse asso- ciations between adulthood SEP and CHD in developednations since the 1970s (4). A separate systematic reviewreported inverse associations of childhood SEP with risk of cardiovascular disease in 31 of 40 studies (23). The accumulation-of-risk SEP framework suggests that as theduration and severity of socioeconomic disadvantage in- crease, resulting cumulative damage could place individuals at higher risk of CHD (12). Our study provides evidence tosupport this hypothesis, in that higher life-time exposure to socioeconomic deprivation was associated with increased risk of CHD. Adjusting for CHD risk factors reduced thestrength of association and rendered it nonsignicant, which was not unexpected because CHD risk factors are candidate pathways by which SEP may influence CHD. For life-course SEP, a systematic review found consistently inverseassociations between the accumulation-of-risk SEP frame- work and risk of cardiovascular disease (13), which is in agreement with our ndings. In the latter review, the asso-ciations of early-life SEP (independent of adulthood SEP)832 Loucks et al. Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:829-836and social mobility were less consistently associated with measures of cardiovascular disease (13). Potential mechanisms Cumulative life-course SEP may influence CHD through a number of mechanisms. Low adulthood SEP is typically inversely associated with many risk factors for CHD, suchas smoking (7), blood pressure (8), diabetes (9), and, for women, obesity (10). Childhood SEP has been shown to be inversely associated with several CHD risk factors inadulthood, including smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol,and adiposity (24-26). Other potential mechanisms notmeasured in this study, including depression and stress, were not able to be evaluated. Few if any studies on the association of cumulative SEP with CHD adjusted for CHD risk factors separately (13-18); consequently, little is known about which risk factorsmay be particularly important in explaining socioeconomic gradient in CHD. Note that methodological biases can be induced by adjusting for mediators; therefore, these mech-anistic ndings should be interpreted with caution (27). In our study, adjusting for smoking reduced the strength of association between life-course SEP and CHD. Pointestimates for the association of cumulative SEP with CHDincidence were lower after adjusting for smoking than forTable 1.

However, given the wide 95% con- dence intervals for these point estimates, it was not possi- ble to ascertain whether smoking was more important thanother CHD risk factors in reducing the association. We found strong inverse socioeconomic gradients in smoking in our study. Some studies on socioeconomic gradients inCHD, using other measures of SEP (only adulthood SEP or only childhood SEP), adjusted individually for smoking. For example, in a study on male physicians (who consequentlyhad similar adulthood SEP), low childhood SEP was asso-ciated with a 2.40 (95% CI: 1.21, 4.74) higher relative risk of developing CHD before the age of 50 years. Adjustment for smoking only slightly and nonsignicantly reduced theassociation (relative risk \u00bc2.24, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.51) (28). In the Whitehall II study, the magnitude of association of occupational class with CHD was nonsignicantly reducedby 18% after adjusting for smoking. Adjusting individually for hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes reduced the effect sizes by 14%, 3%, and 6%, respectively (29). In a recent study on adulthood (that did not include child- hood) socioeconomic gradients in mortality in 22 European countries, smoking-related conditions accounted for 22% and 6% of the socioeconomic gradient in the all-cause deathrate among men and women, respectively (30). In another study in the United States and 11 European countries, adult- hood (the study did not include childhood) socioeconomicgradients in cardiovascular disease mortality were highly associated with socioeconomic gradients in cigarette smok- ing and excessive alcohol consumption, unlike overweight,moderate alcohol consumption, and lack of fresh vegetables, which were not strongly associated with socioeconomic gra- dients in cardiovascular disease mortality (31). Overall,studies using SEP measures other than cumulative SEP pro-vide limited evidence to suggest that smoking is a particu- larly important risk factor in explaining the socioeconomic gradients in CHD. Replication of ndings using cumulativeSEP is needed in other study samples to better ascertain the role of smoking in explaining cumulative socioeconomic gradients in CHD. Strengths and limitations Strengths of our study include that childhood SEP was directly assessed from parents. A review found that those studies that measured SEP in childhood showed strongerassociations between childhood SEP and disease outcomescompared with studies that measured adult recall of child- hood SEP, probably because of reductions in measurement error (32). Furthermore, the measures of CHD used onlyclinically validated outcomes. CHD risk factors were rou- tinely and directly assessed by using measures with good validity and reliability. Weaknesses of this study include the relatively small sam- ple size ( n\u00bc1,835) compared with larger studies; conse- quently, we had lower statistical power. Furthermore, thisstudy included a community-based population of individualsof European descent (representing the demographics of the city of Framingham, Massachusetts, at study onset) residing in the northeastern United States; thus, generalizability ofresults to other communities, races, and ethnicities isTable 2.

Scores were calculated for each SEP measure se parately and then summed (range, 0-6): father's education: models were adjusted for age and sex. cCHD risk factors include smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total:HDL cholesterol ratio, fasting glucose, and antihypertensive me dication use.834 Loucks et al. Am J Epidemiol 2009;169:829-836uncertain. A limitation of the accumulation-of-risk SEP framework, as described by Pollitt et al. (13), is that cumu- lative life-course SEP measurements conflate SEP measures at specic times in the life course (e.g., SEP in early, middle,and late life); therefore, it is unknown which time period may be particularly important in influencing health. Furthermore, cumulative SEP measures typically give equal weighting toeach subcomponent of SEP, which may not reflect true con- tributions of SEP to health. To provide information on rela- tive contributions of each subcomponent of the cumulativeSEP index to CHD incidence, we provided point estimates for each subcomponent. These analyses suggested that meas- ures of father's education and own education were moreimportant risk factors for CHD incidence than own occupa-tion, at least as measured in this cohort. In summary, this study found that directly assessed cumu- lative SEP across the life course was inversely associated withincident CHD in Framingham Offspring Study participants. Adjustment for CHD risk factors reduced the magnitude of association. These ndings underscore the potential impor-tance of CHD prevention and treatment efforts for those whose backgrounds include low SEP throughout their life course.

Health and human rights: no miracle in postconfl ict Chechnya Nearly 15 years after the wars began between Chechen separatist and Russian troops, Chechnya and its capital Grozny have seen reconstruction e orts and economic recovery over the past several years that some there even praise as \"the Chechen miracle\". Meanwhile, violent incidents in Chechnya have become dramatically more prevalent since the war over South Ossetia between Georgia and Russia last August. Violent deaths, compared with those last summer, have almost doubled in number since, from 84 to 152. 1 Last April federal Russian military forces o cially terminated what they termed a counter-terrorism operation and what human rights organisations considered \"a regional system of torture, forced confessions, and fabricated trials\". 2 Documented by human rights organisations as well as the national and international press, Russian forces continue their practices of enforced disappearance, torture, and other ill-treatment of alleged terrorists, while Russian authorities have faced a wave of killings of their representatives by increasingly organised insurgents. 3 The European Court of Human Rights, as of October, 2009, has ruled in over 100 cases of Chechen citizens that the Russian Government failed to properly investigate and prosecute human rights abuses by its forces, or found Russia directly responsible for human rights violations ranging from inhuman treatment to secret detention and deaths. Thousands more cases are pending. The ongoing human rights violations from both sides of the confl ict have direct health implications for the majority of Chechens still su ering from physical and mental war sequelae. Since the wars o cially ended almost 10 years ago, reports from non-governmental organisations and data from UN organisations have portrayed desperate living and public health conditions in the Northern Caucasus, even compared with other disadvantaged regions within the Russian Federation. 4 Dahl\u00f6f B, Devereux RB, Kjeldsen SE, et al, for the LIFE Study Group.

International organisations and the Chechen health ministry o cially announced and launched a series of programmes for health and education. 4,5 The o cial portrayal of successful health-system reconstruction, whose standards still lack behind even Russian standards, particularly for subspecialty care, leaves out the many quali ed health professionals who have left for Moscow or abroad in search of better work and life conditions. Patients requiring services beyond primary care need to rely on a quota system that provides a limited number of grants to refer cases for specialised treatment that cannot be provided in Chechnya. 6 International organisations o ering assistance with human rights investigations7 are confronted with the refusal of the federal government to cooperate, 8 and the few non-governmental organisations operative in postconfl ict Chechnya are hindered in their work by an excessive burden of administrative hurdles created by recently imposed legal requirements. 9 Similarly, those health professionals who stay in Chechnya are reluctant to speak out for improved health-services delivery, fearing to be regarded \"unpatriotic\", a label which can soon become dangerous in the context of counter-terrorist activities. In a societal climate that analysts call one of the most repressive in the world, 10 health-care delivery and programming that meets the needs of the ill and vulnerable (eg, targeting women and infants, tuberculosis patients, or the 30 000 internally displaced persons still in Chechnya) are clearly challenging. When Natalia Estemirova from the local human rights organisation Memorial was abducted and killed in Chechnya in July, 2009,7 after a series of abductions and murders of prominent and less high-pro le human rights activists, Memorial suspended its work there. The absence of independent monitoring mechanisms to hold policy makers and law-enforcement services accountable, and the lack of international attention and response, could create a dangerous nurturing ground for extremism. Spreading violence could become a threat beyond the region\u2014and from there endanger global security. Violence has resurged in Chechnya, 1,3 menacing the health and health systems of its war-burdened population. The legitimate goal of controlling armed violence and stabilising a disadvantaged region will have to respect human rights to reverse this trend and bring sustainable improvements in health for this postconfl ict society. There is no miracle in Chechnya, but a situation that calls for international pressure from academia, parliamentary, governmental, and non-governmental organisations, and journalists.

Methods and resultsParticipants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort underwent abdominal and chest multidetector com- puted tomography to quantify volumes of pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and VAT. Relations between each fat depot and CVD were assessed using logistic regression. The analysis of 1267 participants (mean age 60 years, 53.8% women, 9.7% with prevalent CVD) demonstrated that pericardial ratio (OR) 1.32, 95% condence interval and (OR 1.35, 95% 1.11-1.57; P\u00bc0.003), not intrathoracic fat (OR 1.14, CI P\u00bc0.22), were signicantly associated with prevalent CVD in age-sex-adjusted models and after adjustment for body mass index and waist circumference. After multivariable adjustment, associations were attenu-ated ( P.0.14). Only pericardial fat was associated with prevalent infarction after adjusting for conven- tional measures 1.37, 95% CI 1.03-1.82; P\u00bc0.03). Conclusion Pericardial fat and VAT, but not intrathoracic fat, are associated with CVD independent of traditional measures of obesity but not after further adjustment for traditional risk factor. Taken together with our prior work, these ndings may support the hypothesis that pericardial fat contributes to coronary atherosclerosis. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- Keywords Pericardial fat Visceral abdominal fat Cardiovascular disease Framingham Heart Study Epidemiology Introduction Obesity currently affects nearly one-third of the population in the industrialized world.1,2Traditionally, anthropometric measures such as body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) have been used to quantify overall adiposity. However, regional fat depots may be of greater importance than overall adiposity.3-8 Several studies have highlighted pericardial fat and abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as unique, pathogenic fat depots.9-17Abdominal VAT is the largest visceral fat depot in the humanbody with more than 10 times the volume of pericardial fat. 18It is signicantly correlated with cardiovascular disease the metabolic syndrome, 19,20and systemic markers of inflammation.21Therefore, VAT is hypothesized to have a systemic effect on atherosclerosis. In contrast, pericardial fat is a smaller fat depot, but surrounds the coronary arteries and the myocardium and therefore mayhave a local (paracrine) effect on the development of coronary *Corresponding author.

Recently, we showed that pericardial fat is associ- ated with metabolic risk factors.18Furthermore, we demonstrated that pericardial fat is correlated with the presence of coronary artery calcication.18Additional studies have identied an associ- ation between pericardial fat and the severity of coronary arterydisease. 22,23Taken together, these ndings support the hypothesis that the magnitude of perivascular fat tissue may be a determinant of the extent of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In contrast, the impact of intrathoracic fat on total CVD, because of its small volume and lack of close proximity to the cor- onary arteries, may be limited, despite its correlation with CVDrisk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association of pericardial, intrathoracic, and visceral abdominal fat with the prevalence of CVD in the Offspring population of the Fra-mingham Heart Multi-detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) Study. We hypothesized that pericardial fat, because it may have a local effect on the coronary arteries and abdominal VAT and asystemic effect on atherosclerosis as the largest visceral fat depot, are associated with total CVD. Further, we hypothesized that intrathoracic fat, which is a small fat depot not in local ana-tomic contact with the coronary arteries, would be less likely to be associated with CVD. Methods Study sample Participants of this study were drawn from the Framingham Heart MDCT Study sample. Offspring participants underwent MDCTimaging between June 2002 and April 2005. Exclusion criteria werepregnancy, age ,40 years for women and age ,35 years for men, and weight .320 pounds. Study design has been described previously. 24,25 Overall, 1422 subjects underwent CT scanning of the chest and abdomen between June 2002 and April 2005. Of these, 1342 had non-missing or interpretable pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and VATmeasures, and 1320 of those attended the seventh examinationcycle. Of the remaining 1320, 47 subjects were excluded due to ahistory of prior open heart surgery, and an additional six subjectswere excluded due to a missing covariate prole, resulting in a totalsample size of 1267 participants. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Boston University Medical Center and the Massachusetts GeneralHospital. All subjects provided written informed consent. Multi-detector computed tomography imaging protocol Participants underwent radiographic assessment of their chest and abdomen in the supine position within one procedure using an eight-slice MDCT scanner (LightSpeed Ultra, General Electric, Milwaukee,WI, USA). The thoracic scan was performed during inspiratorybreath hold, with an average scan length of 18 s (tube voltage120 kVp, tube current 320 mA ,220 lbs and 400 mA .220 lbs, gantry rotation time 500 ms, temporal resolution 330 ms). Imageacquisition was prospectively triggered with the centre of the acqui-sition at 70% of the R-R-interval. Images were reconstructed with aslice thickness of 2.5 mm without overlap and a eld of view of25 cm. On average, 48 contiguous slices were taken for volume cover-age from the carina to the diaphragm. For the abdominal scan, 25 con-tiguous slices were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 5 mmwithout overlap, starting 150 mm above the upper edge of S1, and a eld of view of 35 cm (tube voltage: 120 kVp, tube current 320 mA,220 lbs and 400 mA .220 lbs, gantry rotation time 500 ms, pitch 1.33). Fat tissue measurements Pericardial fat, total thoracic fat, and VAT volumes were assessed usinga dedicated workstation (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, SanMatteo, CA, USA). Fat volumes were measured by a semi-automaticsegmentation technique. The reader was required to manually tracea region of interest. Within the region of interest, fat was dened aspixels within a window of 2195 to 245 Houndseld units (HU) and a window centre of 2120 HU. Pericardial fat volume was dened as any adipose tissue located within the pericardial sac. Totalthoracic fat volume was dened as any adipose tissue located withinthe thorax from the level of the right pulmonary artery to the dia-phragm and from the chest wall to the descending aorta in additionto fat inside the pericardial sac ( Figure 1 ). For VAT, the muscular abdominal wall was manually traced to separate VAT from the subcu-taneous fat. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were excellentfor VAT (ICC /C210.99), 19pericardial fat (ICC and total thoracic fat (ICC 0.98).18Intrathoracic fat was dened as the difference between total thoracic fat and pericardial fat in order to create aunique fat depot that was non-overlapping with the pericardial fatcompartment. This is in contrast to our prior work in which intrathor-acic fat referred to total thoracic fat. Risk factor and covariate assessment Risk factors and covariates were measured at the seventh examinationcycle (1998-2001). BMI was dened as weight (in kilograms) dividedby the square of height (in metres). WC was measured at the levelof the umbilicus. Fasting plasma glucose, total and high-density choles-terol, and triglycerides were measured on fasting morning samples.Diabetes was dened as fasting plasma glucose level of /C21126 mg/dL or treatment with either insulin or a hypoglycaemic agent. Hyperten-sion was dened as systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg, diastolicblood pressure above 90 mmHg, or treatment. Participants were con-sidered current smokers if they had smoked at least one cigarette perday within the previous year. Alcohol use was dened as a consump-tion of more than seven drinks per week for women and more than 14dinks per week for men. Women were considered menopausal if theirperiods had stopped for /C211 year. CVD included coronary heart disease (CHD, dened as recognized or unrecognized myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina pec-toris, and coronary claudica-tion as the presence of exertional calf discomfort that wasrelieved with rest), and congestive heart failure (CHF, dened as thepresence of two major criteria or one major and two minor criteriaaccording to the Framingham Heart Study criteria for the diagnosisof CHF 26). All suspected CVD events were previously adjudicated by a panel of three Framingham investigators after review of all avail-able Framingham Heart Study examination records, hospitalizationrecords, and physician notes, as described previously in detail. 27 Statistical analysis Pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and visceral abdominal fat were nor-mally distributed. Associations between the fat tissues were assessedusing the Pearson's correlation coefcient. Associations between theamount of each fat depot and the prevalence of CVD were assessedPericardial, intrathoracic, and VAT with CVD 851using regression. First, all fat depots were standar- dized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to facilitate directcomparisons of effect sizes across different fat depots. For modelsexamining CVD as an outcome, we made the following covariateadjustments: (i) age and sex adjustment; (ii) age, sex, BMI, and WCadjustment; (iii) age, sex, BMI, WC, and pressure, hypertension treatment, total choles- terol/HDL cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy.Separate logistic regression analyses were preformed for each fattissue. To assess for a potential clustering of the data due to subjectsfrom the same family, we determined the P-values for the association of pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and VAT with overall CVD usinggeneral estimate equations (GEEs). For the GEE, we assumed theexchangeable compound symmetry correlation structure betweenmembers of the same nuclear family, and robust standard errorswere used. In GEE, we observed similar P-values and statistical signi- cance for the same models as using generalized linear models. For thethree fat variables of interest (pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, andVAT), we assess if there was a signicant quadratic trend. For allthree variables, the quadratic trend was not signicant ( P.0.14). In secondary analyses, we tested the association of pericardial fat and VAT with CHD, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Because ofthe relatively small number of events (myocardial infarction, n\u00bc39 and stroke, n\u00bc19), these models were limited to the following covariate adjustments: (i) age and sex; (ii) age, sex, BMI, and WC. Sex interaction was tested in all models. SAS version 9.13 was used for all computations. A two-tailed P-value of ,0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Results Overall, 1267 participants (mean age: 60 +9 years, 53.8% women) were included in this evaluation. Mean pericardial fat volume was 124 +50 cm3, mean intrathoracic fat volume was 115+63 cm3, and mean visceral abdominal fat volume was 2091+1099 cm3. Detailed sample characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The three fat depots were highly correlated (Pearson'scorrelation coefcient: for pericardial fat vs. intrathoracic fat, vs. VAT, and 0.74 for intrathoracic fatvs. VAT; P,0.001 for all). Fat depots and the association with cardiovascular disease In an age- and sex-adjusted model, both pericardial fat and VAT but not intrathoracic fat were signicantly associated with CVD(Table 2 ). The association of pericardial fat and visceral abdomi- nal fat remained statistically signicant after further adjustment for BMI and WC, but was attenuated after multivariable adjust-ment. There was no statistica lly signicant difference in the magnitude of the associations between pericardial fat and VAT with CVD ( P\u00bc0.99 for the model adjusted for age and sex). Visceral fat tissues and the association with coronary heart disease, myocardialinfarction, and stroke After observing a signicant association of pericardial fat and VAT with overall CVD, we performed secondary analysis to further investigate the association of both fat tissues with CHD and myo-cardial infarction as an outcome variable that may be influenced by a potential local effect of pericardial fat and stroke as an outcome variable that is influenced by a systemic effect of VAT but is not aslikely to be influenced by pericardial fat. Both pericardial fat and VAT were signicantly associated with the prevalence of CHD in an age- and sex-adjusted model andafter further adjustment for BMI and WC. However, associations were stronger for pericardial fat than for VAT. In an age- and sex-adjusted model, both pericardial fat and VAT were signicantly associated with the prevalence of myocardial infarc- tion. This association remained signicant for pericardial fat after further adjustment for BMI and WC, but was not signicant for VAT. Figure 1 Pericardial fat and intrathoracic fat in an axial image, showing that the pericardial sac was dened as the border between pericardial and intrathoracic fat ( A) and three-dimensional reconstructions of pericardial fat ( B) and total thoracic fat ( C). Intrathoracic fat was calculated by subtracting pericardial fat from total thoracic fat. For this subject, pericardial fat volume was 153 cm3, intrathoracic fat volume was 287 cm3, and VAT volume was 1865 cm3.A.A. Mahabadi et al. 852Only VAT but not pericardial fat was associated with stroke in an age- and sex-adjusted model. The association of VAT withstroke remained statistically signicant after further adjustment for BMI and WC ( Table 3 ). There was no signicant sex interaction for any fat depot (P.0.07 for all age- and sex-adjusted models). Discussion In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations of pericar- dial fat, intrathoracic fat, and VAT with CVD in a community-based sample and found that pericardial fat and VAT were both associ-ated with CVD in age- and sex-adjusted models. These for BMI and WC. The nding that pericardial fat, a very small fat depot, is associ- ated with CVD supports the hypothesis that pericardial fat may have a paracrine role in the pathogenesis of CVD. In contrast, the strong association of VAT with CVD is likely due to powerfulassociations between VAT and CVD risk factors, including hyper- tension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes, that we and others have reported previously, suggesting that VAT has systemic effects asa pathogenic fat depot. These hypotheses are supported by our nding that pericardial fat is predominantly associated with CHD and myocardial infarction, whereas only VAT is associated withstroke. However, the lacking association of pericardial fat with stroke may be caused by a smaller number of strokes compared with myocardial infarction (MI). The nding that pericardial fatand VAT were similarly associated with overall CVD may indicate that the potential paracrine effect of pericardial fat and the sys- temic effect of VAT might be of comparable effect size. However, associations were attenuated upon adjustment for CVD risk factors, suggesting that ultimately relations between fat depots and CVD are due to shared risk factors. Also, we cannot rule out thatseveral ndings may be influenced by diminished statistical power to detect modest effect sizes. Further, the association between pericar- dial fat, VAT, and CVD events may be mediated via shared risk factorsin the pathogenesis between fat depots and actual events. Notably, we observed different associations to CVD of pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and VAT, despite their ...................................... ...................................... ............................................................................................................................... ................................................Table 2 Association of pericardial fat, intrathoracic fat, and visceral abdominal fat with cardiovascular disease per standard deviation of fat tissuea Models for all three exposures Pericardial fat VAT Intrathoracic fat Odds ratio (95% CI) P-value Odds ratio (95% CI) P-value Odds ratio (95% CI) Age 1.32 (1.11-1.57) 0.002 1.35 0.003 CI, condence interval. aAll fat depots have been standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 to facilitate comparisons across depots. bIncludes systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, total cholesterol/HDL, lipid-lowering therapy, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, meno pausal status, and hormone replacement therapy................................................................................. ................................................................................ ................................................................................ ................................................................................Table 1 Study sample characteristics Characteristic n51267 Age (years) 60 +9 Women (%) 53.8 (682) Body Lipid-lowering treatment (%) 18.4 (233) Diabetesa(%) 9.8 (124) Smoking (%) Current 10.2 (129) Former 51.9 (657)Never 38.0 (481) Alcohol use b(%) 16.3 (207) Post-menopausal (%) 82.7 (564) Hormone replacement therapy (%) 36.7 (250) All CVD (%) 9.7 (123) CHD (%) 6.3 (80) Myocardial infarction (%) 3.1 (39) Stroke (%) 1.5 (19)CHF (%) 0.2 (3) Intermittent claudication (%) 1.9 (24) Data presented as mean +standard deviation for continuous traits or per cent ( n) for dichotomous traits.

In a study of 203 participants from Korea, a close association between epicardial fat thickness and the severity of coronaryartery disease was found. 23Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that perivascular fat may be associated with local vascular injury. In this context, our observation that VATand stroke are strongly associated warrants further exploration. Potential mechanisms The specic composition and metabolic activity of visceral fat tissuessuch as pericardial fat and VAT are widely recognized as differingfrom subcutaneous fat. Visceral fat tissues have smaller adipocyte The of adiponectin, a stabilizer of the inhibitor of NF- kB released from pericardial fat,11decreases with an increased amount of fat.32The decrease in adiponectin enhances the activity of NF- kB, which leads to an increase in TNF- aand hence to a local increase of inflammation.11A mismatch of pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators and cytokines secreted by pericardial fat is suspected to have a local influence on the underlying coronaryarteries. Increased CD45 mRNA expression in the pericardial fat of subjects with coronary artery disease, representing elevated macrophage inltration, 13and an increase in mast cells in the adventitia of coronary lesions14have been observed. The hypoth- esis of an impact on local inflammation of pericardial fat and its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries aresupported by our ndings. Despite the relative size, VAT differentiates from pericardial fat in blood supply and drainage. Intra-abdominal mesenteric fat (VAT)has a circulatory communication path to the liver via the portal circulation and thus may be highly associated with insulin resistanceof the liver and hepatic production of inflammatory factors such as high sensitivity-C-reactive protein. VAT is associated with metabolic risk factors, 5,15,16,31,33-36traditional CVD risk factors,19and systemic inflammatory markers.21These associations further emphasize the importance of VAT as a mediator of systemic CVD risk factors. In contrast, intrathoracic and pericardial fat depots are substan- tially smaller than VAT and are unlikely to release substances that can be detected systemically. Therefore, their hypothesized role is more likely to be paracrine via their local effect on inflammation inthe underlying tissue. 10,13,14,21 Implications Together with our previous ndings of visceral fat tissues beingassociated with risk factors calcication, 18,19these ndings suggest that visceral fat depots are associated with CVD. Further research is warranted to establish the incremental value of fat measurements to traditional CV risk factors and the causalrelationship between pericardial fat and VAT and the development of CVD. Strength and limitations The strengths of our study include a community-based sample not selected for adiposity-related traits. Fat volumes were quantiedusing a highly reproducible volumetric CT-based measure. Limit- ations of our study include the predominantly white Framingham Offspring Study, hence generalization to other ethnic groups isuncertain. Also, we were only able to assess prevalent CVD and by denition could not assess the relation between fat depots and fatal CVD. Given the cross-sectional study design, we cannotestablish causality. Although our data are plausible with the biologi- cal hypothesis, a cause-and-effect relationship between pericardial fat and myocardial infarction cannot be established in this cross-sectional study. However, our results are consistent with our pre- vious data, describing a cross-sectional association of pericardial fat and coronary artery calcium in subjects without known CVD. Weincluded individuals with CHF as outcomes and recognize that these patients may have an underlying pathology different from CAD.

Mahabadi et al. 854patient had angina pectoris about 2 years after the CHF occurred; one patient had an MI about 10 years before the CHF occurred,and the third patient only had CHF. Thus, it is unlikely to have affected our results. Further, we excluded all participants who had previously undergone cardiac bypass surgery, due to theunreliability of pericardial fat in this setting. Therefore, we have excluded participants with the most informative physiology and biased our results towards the null. A further limitation of ourstudy is the diminished statistical power to detect modest effect sizes. Thus, our ndings that need to be conrmed in studies with larger numbers of CVD events, including prospectivestudies, are warranted to determine whether metabolic fat depots are independently associated with CVD after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. Conclusion Pericardial fat and VAT, but not intrathoracic fat, are associatedwith CVD independent of traditional measures of obesity. However, none of these fat depots are independently associated with CVD after further adjustment for traditional risk factors.Taken together with our prior work, these ndings may support the hypothesis that pericardial fat contributes to coronary athero- sclerosis but needs to be conrmed in larger studies.

Srivastava Cardiology Department, Austin Health, 145 Studley Road, for further investi-gation with an incidental nding of a mass over the left heart border on an immigration chest X-ray(Panel A). Physical examination and laboratory results were normal. Transthoracic echocardio-gram showed a cystic structure along the cular (LV) border with no pericar-dial effusion (Panel B). A CT scan showed a lobulated mass in the anterior and middle mediastinum.Cardiac inltration could not be excluded (Panel C), resulting in an MRI being performed. On cardiac MRI, flattening of the anterolateral LV wall with free move- ment of the LV myocardium againstthe lesion was noted (Panel G). Although heterogenous in signal, the T1 sequences (Panel D)showed that the mass was isointense to myocardium but had increased signal intensity with STIR sequences(Panel E). Myocardial tagging with breaking of tag lines at end systole suggested that there was no inltra-tion of the myocardium (Panel F). This information assisted the surgical team in pre-operative planning; at resection, the mass was found to be well circumscribed without myocardial involvement. Pathological ndings were of a cystic-encapsulated structure attached to the thymus gland, measuring 7 /C26.5/C23 cm.

Delay to medical care after sexual assault can be associated with adverse consequences for the assault survivor. Few studies examine factors associated with timely presentation to care after sexual assault.Using data from the Massachusetts Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program, we examine sexual assault and survivor characteristics and their association with time to presentation after sexual assault. Method. Cross-sectional data were collected during forensic exam for all patients presenting to 24 SANE- afliated hospitals in Massachusetts between July 2003 and June 2005. Data included patient demographics, assailant information, and assault characteristics. A Cox proportional hazards model described factors associated with delayed presentation for post-assault care. Results. 478 females presented to SANE hospitals over two years. 66% were white, non-Hispanic; 14% Hispanic and 13% black; 39% were between 18 and 24 years old. The median time from onset of assault to presentation was 16 h. In multivariable analysis, assault by a known assailant was associated with delayed presentation (hazard ratio=0.71, 95% con dence interval=0.57, 0.88). Conclusion. Most women who present for exam following sexual assault do so expeditiously. If an assailant is a family member or date, a woman is more likely to delay post-assault care. These ndings can inform public health interventions. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Introduction Lifetime prevalence of rape is 18% among US adult women, with annual prevalence between 0.3 ( Tjaden and Thoennes, November 1998 ) and 1.1% ( Moracco et al., 2007 ). Few rape survivors seek immediate medical attention, even with serious injury ( Tjaden and Thoennes, November 1998 ). Delayed presentation may result in loss of forensic evidence and postpones treatment for sexually trans- mitted infections, postexposure prophylaxis for HIV, and emergency contraception, which are maximally effective if given early after assault ( Resnick et al., 2000 ). Rape sequelae include illness and increased healthcare utilization ( Suris et al., 2004 ). Medical care early after sexual assault may reduce these sequelae ( Resnick et al., 2000 ). Little prior data describes factors associated with delay to presentation for post-assault care. Prior study has retrospectively compared those who engage in post-assault medical care to non-presenters ( Resnick et al., 2000 ). In a single institution study ( Millar et al., 2002 ), severe assault and an unknown perpetrator were associated with earlier presentation. Under Massachusetts law, medical providers treating sexual assault survivors must complete an anonymous forensic encounter form ( Fallon et al., 2006 ). In Massachusetts, Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) complete at least 24% of these encounter forms, ( Fallon et al., 2006 ) covering 24 hospital emergency rooms. SANEs are more likely than non-SANE providers to provide post- assault STD prophylaxis and emergency contraception ( Campbell et al., 2005 ). SANEs collect higher quality forensic evidence. When cases are prosecuted, SANE exams are associated with more convictions ( Campbell et al., 2005 ). SANE care may be psycholo- gically bene cial to sexual assault survivors ( Campbell et al., 2005 ). Using data from the Massachusetts SANE program, we describe characteristics of the assault, assailant and survivor, and examine the association of these characteristics with time to presentation after sexual assault. Methods Our sample included all subjects for whom a forensic encounter form was submitted by a SANE for the two-year period from July 2003 through June 2005. Welimited analyses to female assault survivors age 12 and older.Preventive Medicine 48 (2009) 593 -595 Preliminary results from this work were presented at the Society of General Internal Medicine 31st Annual Meeting, Pittsburgh, PA on April 10, 2008.

Independent variables: Age was categorized based Massachusetts Rape Crisis Center groupings as 12 -17, 18 -24, 25 -59 and 60 years or greater. Assault survivors reported number of assailants and relationship of the assailant to the survivors (stranger, family member, or date or acquaintance). We created dichotomous variables based on theoretical (common characteristics) and statistical (cells with small numbers) factors: race/ethnicity (white, non-Hispanicversus nonwhite); age (teenage [ages 12 -17] versus adult [18 or older]), relationship of the assailant to the survivor (known [family, date or acquaintance] versus unknown),severe violence (beating, physical restraints, burns, bites or use of a weapon versusnone), verbal threats (versus none), intoxicant exposure (voluntary or involuntary useof intoxicants including alcohol versus none), assault surroundings (home or dorm versus another location), and multiple assailants (greater than one versus one). Statistical analyses We computed frequencies for categorical data. For continuous variables, we computed means with standard deviations for parametric and medians withinterquartile ranges for nonparametric distributions. We used the Cochrane -Mantel -Hantzel chi-square test to perform bivariate tests of whether pertinent assault characteristics (severe violence, verbal threats, intoxicant exposure, assault surroundings, and multiple assailants) differed by age or race/ethnicity of the assault survivor, or by the relationship of the assailant to the survivor. To determine the factors associated with time to presentation after sexual assault, we performed bivariate comparisons of median time to presentation using theWilcoxon Rank Sum. A Cox proportional hazards model described independent factors associated with time to presentation. A decreased hazard ratio for presenting to theemergency department is indicative of a relative delay in presentation among thosewho are positive relative to those who are negative on a given factor. Our nal model included prespeci ed demographic criteria (age and race/ ethnicity) and all variables with pb0.10 in bivariate analyses. To con rm the robustness of our variable selection, we used multiple selection procedures including stepwise(entry criterion pb0.05, retention criterion pb0.10), backwards (retention criterion pb0.10), and best subsets selection. Although assault in a house or dorm was signi cant in bivariate analysis, we excluded this from the multivariable model due to highassociation with the known assailant variable ( 2=54, pb0.001). All analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results During the two-year interval, 478 SANE forensic encounter forms were led on women. Assault characteristics are shown in Table 1 . In bivariate associations, 55% of those who reported a known assailant reported severe violence, compared to 44% of those who did not know their assailant ( pb0.01). Teenagers (age 12 -17) were more likely to be assaulted by more than one assailant compared to adults, (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.28, 3.62). Subjects assaulted in a house or dorm were more likely to know their assailant (OR=4.07, 95% CI=2.73, 6.07). None of the remaining bivariate associations was signi cant. Time to presentation data were available for 392 subjects. There were no signi cant differences in assault characteristics or demo- graphics between these 392 subjects and those for whom time to presentation data were not available. The median time to presentation was 16 h; 95% presented within 72 h. Analysis of bivariate comparisons of median time to presentation by potential explanatory variables yielded the following: severe violence was associated with earlier presentation (median time 13 h versus 17 h among those not reporting severe violence, pb0.01), verbal threats were associated with earlier presentation (10 h versus 17 h, pb0.01). Intoxicant exposure (18 h versus 14 h, pb0.05) and assault at home (16 h versus 12 h, pb0.05) were associated with later presentation. A known assailant was suggestive of an association with later presentation (17 h versus 15 h, p=0.056). White, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, teenage status, penetration, ejaculation, condom use, and multiple assailants were not signi cantly associated with time to presentation. Table 2 shows multivariable analysis for time to presentation. A known assailant was associated with delayed presentation to the emergency department, and verbal threats were associated with earlier presentation. The remaining covariates were not indepen- dently associated with time to presentation.Table 1 Females presenting to Massachusetts emergency rooms, SANE forensic encounter form,7/03 -6/05.

McCall-Hosenfeld et al. / Preventive Medicine 48 (2009) 593 -595Discussion Among women who present for SANE evaluation following sexual assault in Massachusetts, most do so expeditiously. Most of our sample would be eligible for collection of forensic evidence, emergency contraception ( Resnick et al., 2000 ), and HIV chemopro- phylaxis ( Smith et al., 2005 ), all recommended within 72 h of sexual assault. This is important given the high rates of body cavity penetration and ejaculation and low rate of condom use among perpetrators in this cohort. The high rate of severe violence (55%) reported by subjects who knew their assailants contests the conventional view that severe violence is associated with stranger assault ( Stermac et al., 1995 ). However, need for medical care due to severe violence may differentially increase presentation for care among subjects who know their assailants. Concordant with prior report, ( McDermott et al., 2008, Resnick et al., 2000 ) our data indicate that a majority of assault survivors knew their assailant. Study limitations and strengths Our data have several limitations. Providers may underreport treatment of sexual assault survivors. These data re flect a portion of those sexual assault survivors who present for post-assault care, and may not be generalizable to survivors who present to non-SANE hospitals or who do not present for immediate care. Older persons are underrepresented in our data (2% over age 60) compared to census data for Massachusetts in 2005 (12%). However, the frequency of sexual assault among older persons in our study is similar to previous data ( Zink and Fisher, 2006 ), and consistent with prior report that younger individuals are disproportionately likely to be sexually assaulted ( McDermott et al., 2008 ). Frequency of Black (13%) or Hispanic (14%) race/ethnicity is identical to census data. Our data indicate a lower rate of intoxicant exposure (16%) compared to an Irish sample (32%, McDermott et al., 2008 ). The strongest independent predictor of delay to presentation was a known assailant. These data are a logical extension of prior report that women assaulted by intimates are less likely to ever seek medical care (Resnick et al., 2000 ). Conclusions Because most sexual assailants are known to survivors, delaying care among those who know their assailant re flects a substantial public health risk. Preventive efforts must include public health campaigns to better inform survivors that assault by a known assailant is a crime, and early access to medical care may mitigate adverse outcomes.Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no con flicts of interest.

Seaver, M.D., M.P.H.4 Abstract Aims: Sexual assault in the military (SAIM) is associated with decreased sexual satisfaction. However, mediators of this association have not been fully described.Methods: Using a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data collected for the national Veterans Affairs (VA) Women's Health Survey, we propose a mediator model to explain the association between SAIM and decreasedsexual satisfaction among women veterans. Four mediators of the association between SAIM and decreasedsexual satisfaction are tested: (1) emotional health-related quality of life, (2) physical health-related quality of life,(3) lack of a close partner, and (4) gynecological illness. These mediators were chosen to encompass independent domains potentially relevant to sexual satisfaction, including emotional, physical, and relational. Results: Of 3161 women (87%) who answered the sexual satisfaction question, the mean age was 45 (SD 15) years; 85% were white. Twenty-four percent reported a history of SAIM, and 39% reported sexual dissatisfaction.In age-adjusted logistic regression analyses, both SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction were strongly associated witheach of the proposed mediators. However, of the four mediators, emotional health-related quality of life moststrongly attenuated the association between SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction. After including all mediators, theassociation between SAIM and decreased sexual satisfaction was markedly attenuated.Conclusions: SAIM's negative impact on sexual satisfaction in women veterans operates both directly and through its physical and mental health sequelae. Of the proposed mediators in this association, the most prominent is mental health-related quality of life; the other proposed mediators were minimally related. Introduction Sexual satisfaction is a complex construct that incor- porates multiple domains, including physical and emo- tional satisfaction with sexual activity and satisfaction withsexual interpersonal relationships. 1-5Sexual satisfaction is dened as ''an affective response arising from one's subjec- tive evaluation of the positive and negative dimensionsassociated with one's sexual relationship'' 6but may incorpo- rate both partnered sexual activity and self-stimulation.2Al- though sexual satisfaction is increasingly acknowledged as animportant domain of health-related quality of life 7and emo- tional and relational health,8the correlates of sexual satisfac- tion are not well described.2Women veterans report high rates of decreased sexual sat- isfaction.9,10This may be due to the disproportionate burden of risk factors for sexual dissatisfaction found among women veterans. A history of sexual assault in the military (SAIM) is unique to women veterans and highly associated with de-creased sexual satisfaction. 10SAIM may be more traumatizing than other forms of sexual violence because of assault by a close or trusted colleague, use of a weapon, or perception ofinadequate response by the judicial system. 11More than half of the women who report a history of SAIM were not satised with their sex life, compared with 34% of women who did notreport a history of SAIM. 10Sexual trauma may predispose to decreased sexual satisfaction through interference with sev- eral domains of sexual satisfaction, including emotional 1Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania. 2Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. 3VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts. 4Lahey Clinic, Burlington, Massachusetts.JOURNAL OF WOMEN'S HEALTH Volume 18, Number 6, 2009\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc.

SAIM is highly associated with adverse mental health consequences.12,13Sexual assault is associated with post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at higher rates than are found in victims of other types of physical violence,14,15and military sexual trauma more strongly predicts the develop-ment of PTSD than other types of trauma. 16-18Mental health disorders are highly associated with decreased sexual func- tioning,11,12,19-22which may reciprocally lower satisfaction with emotional elements of sexual life. Medical sequelae of sexual trauma include physical in- juries, a greater burden of chronic somatic complaints,11,23and decreased overall health-related quality of life.23Increased physical illness24,25and decreased health-related quality of life26are likewise associated with sexual dysfunction. Sa- tisfaction with physical aspects of sexuality may be compro-mised by physical illness and overall decreased health-related quality of life, which can result from sexual trauma. An extensive literature describes the adverse impact of sexual assault on gynecological and reproductive functioning.Chronic gynecological complaints are common among rape survivors, 27,28many of whom suffer vaginal and perineal tears and the late sequelae of sexually transmitted diseases(STDs). 23Sequelae of rape that may directly affect sexual satisfaction include lack of pleasure with a sexual encounter and dyspareunia.27-29Other medically unexplained gyneco- logical complaints that are strongly associated with sexual assault history include unexplained menstrual irregularity,27 dysmenorrhea,27and increased hysterectomy.30The role of medically unexplained gynecological symptoms as a potential mediator for sexual dissatisfaction has not been established. Traumatic experiences adversely affect interpersonal rela- tions among trauma survivors,31,32including disruption in the ability to form close partnerships. Relational factors, such as intimacy,4marital stability and quality,33marital satisfac- tion,1and satisfaction with nonsexual aspects of a relation- ship,1are associated with sexual satisfaction. Thus, trauma may mediate decreased sexual satisfaction through its effect on the relational domain of sexual satisfaction. Prior work has linked decreased emotional health, de- creased physical health, including gynecological function, and disrupted interpersonal relations to both sexual traumaand sexual dissatisfaction. However, these factors have neverpreviously been assessed for their potential mediation of the association between sexual trauma and sexual dissatisfaction. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual model to de-scribe the association of SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction through four proposed mediators: (1) lower emotional health- related quality of life, (2) lower physical health-related qualityof life, (3) gynecological problems, and (4) disruption in in- terpersonal relationships as measured by lack of a close partner. We use the data of Skinner et al. 9-12to examine the hypothesis that these physical and psychosocial correlates of sexual trauma mediate the association between SAIM and decreased sexual satisfaction among women veterans. Materials and Methods Subjects We used data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Womens' Health Project, a cross-sectional, national survey of 3632women veterans11that was designed to characterize the health-related quality of life of women who use VA ambula- tory services. The design of this study has been described in detail elsewhere.9Briefly, a randomly selected subset of all women veterans who had at least one outpatient VA visit between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1995, was identied. Eli- gible subjects were mailed a self-administered questionnaireand returned it in a postage-paid envelope. Dependent variable Sexual satisfaction was measured using a single, face-valid, item asking: Overall how satised are you with your sex life? 1, very dissatised; 2, dissatised; 3, satised; 4, very satised. Responses were dichotomized into satised (answer 3 or 4)vs. dissatised (1 or 2), as described in other studies. 2,7,34The sexual satisfaction construct is deliberately broad to measure the emotional, physical, gynecological, and relational do- mains relevant to sexual satisfaction. Use of a single, face-valid item to measure overall sexual satisfaction has been correlated in other studies to domains of functional sexuality, including sexual interest and number of daily sexualthoughts, 34and relational and emotional factors, including family affection and partner initiation and communication.2 Independent variable Self-reported SAIM was measured by an afrmative re- sponse to the question: Did you ever have an experience where someone used force or the threat of force to have sexual relations with you against your will while you were in themilitary? 11,12This denition conforms to the U.S. Merit Sys- tem Protection Board guidelines.12 Mediator variables We dened four potential mediators of the association be- tween SAIM and sexual satisfaction: emotional health-relatedquality of life, physical health-related quality of life, gyneco- logical illness, and absence of a close partner. Emotional health-related quality of life was measured with the mental health composite score (MCS), and physical health-related quality of life was measured with the physical health composite score (PCS) of the Short Form (SF)-36. TheSF-36 is composed of eight subscales that aggregate to twohigher-order clusters. Vitality, social functioning, role limita- tions due to emotional health, and mental health aggregate to the MCS. Physical functioning, role limitations due to physi-cal functioning, bodily pain, and general health aggregate to the PCS. Reliability statistics for these measures exceed 80%, and validity has been established by comparison of thesemeasures to other accepted clinical indicators for multiple disease states. 35-37In these measures, scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a more favorable healthstate. Gynecological illness was a composite variable created by endorsing at least one of the following gynecological condi-tions: current endometriosis; vaginitis or yeast infections;abnormal, heavy, or irregular periods; chronic pelvic pain or painful periods; or a history of problems getting pregnant, hysterectomy, or abnormal Pap smears. In the construction ofthe composite gynecological variable, we rst indepen- dently associated each age-adjusted element of the composite902 McCALL-HOSENFELD ET AL. gynecological variable with sexual trauma and then did the same for sexual satisfaction. Each element of this composite variable was signicantly ( p<0.05) and independently as- sociated with both sexual satisfaction and sexual trauma. Allthe associations were in the expected direction (greater gy- necological complaints among subjects endorsing sexual sat- isfaction and sexual trauma, respectively), suggesting eachcould logically be placed in the mediator pathway. Close partner was created from two survey line items. Subjects endorsed that they had a spouse or partner andsubsequently that this spouse or partner was someone they''feel very close and intimate with.'' This denition was chosen because these two face-valid questions incorporate necessary elements of a published denition of a close interpersonalrelationship, dened as ''repeated interactions over time characterized by enduring bonds, emotional attachment, personal need fulllment and irreplaceability.'' 38 Covariates Covariates included self-reported age, educational status, household income, and smoking. Alcohol abuse was denedby a score of three or more on a validated ve-item screeningtest. 12 Statistical methods We compared demographic variables between sexually satised and dissatised women. We used ttests to compare continuous variables and chi-square to compare frequencies between categorical variables. An alpha /C200.05 determined signicance for all statistics. To assess the clinical signicance of statistical differences, we calculated an effect size measure. The effect size is a pro-portion of a standard deviation (SD), dened as the absolutevalue of the difference between the mean scores of the satis- ed vs. dissatised women, divided by the SD of the reference group (satised). 39Using previously published guidelines, an effect size of 0.20-0.40 is considered small, 0.50-0.79 is mod- erate, and /C210.80 is large.40 We used logistic regression to separately model the asso- ciation between each of the four proposed mediators and the exposure (SAIM), adjusting for age. We similarly modeled the association between each proposed mediator and the out-come (sexual satisfaction), adjusting for age. Lack of an in-dependent association of any proposed mediator with either the exposure or outcome would suggest that the proposed mediator is incorrectly identied as a mediator. After determining that each of the mediators was inde- pendently associated with both SAIM and sexual satisfaction, we used a nested approach to test the proposed mediationmodel, tting a sequence of logistic regression models. In nested modeling, each successive model includes signicant or prespecied predictors from the previous model and addspotential predictors from the next domain. We rst tested an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for decreased sexual satisfaction, given SAIM (model 1). Next (model 2), we tested and retainedall demographic and health-related variables that changedthis unadjusted effect estimate by /C2110%. Next we tested four models, one for each proposed mediator. If a potential me- diator reduced or eliminated the effect of SAIM on sexualsatisfaction, this was consistent with our hypothesis and re- tained in our mediator model. If a potential mediator waseither not statistically signicantly associated or did not alter the effect estimate of SAIM on sexual satisfaction by at least 10% or more, it was inconsistent with our model. In our third model (model 3), we created a fully adjusted model, retainingall proposed mediators and demographic and health-related variables that were statistically signicant or changed the unadjusted effect estimate by /C2110%. All statistical analyses were run using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results As has been reported previously, 3632 women completed questionnaires, a 58.4% response rate. 11Of these, 3181 women met inclusion criteria for our analyses, of whom 24% endorseda history of SAIM. 11 In unadjusted analyses (Table 1), respondents who re- ported dissatisfaction were more likely than those who re-ported satisfaction to be older, unmarried, more educated, and of lower household income. Respondents who reported dissatisfaction were more likely to endorse more smoking andalcohol abuse. All proposed mediators were associated with sexual dis- satisfaction. The mean mental health composite score among the sexually satised was 44, compared with 35 among thesexually dissatised. The effect size for emotional health- related quality of life on sexual satisfaction was 0.73, re- presenting a moderate clinical difference. The mean physicalhealth composite score among the sexually satised was 39, compared with 37 among the sexually dissatised. This effect size was 0.16, a clinically inconsequential effect. A high proportion of our sample endorsed any gyneco- logical problem. However, this was more frequent among the sexually dissatised (86%) than the satised (76%). The pro-portion of respondents endorsing no close partner was greateramong the sexually dissatised (46%) versus the satised (25%). In Table 2, each of the proposed mediators was signicantly associated with both the exposure to SAIM and the outcome of sexual dissatisfaction (all p<0.001), and each of the asso- ciations was in the expected direction. Thus, each of the pro-posed mediators independently met criteria for inclusion in our adjusted nal model describing the association between SAIM and sexual satisfaction. Table 3 shows the results of our nested logistic regression analyses to determine the association of our proposed medi- ators between SAIM and decreased sexual satisfaction. In model 1 (unadjusted), we found that SAIM was associatedwith 2.3 greater odds of decreased sexual satisfaction. After adjusting for demographics, including age, marital status, race, education, income, and the health behaviors of smokingand alcohol abuse (shown in model 2), we found modest at- tenuation of the association of SAIM and sexual dissatisfac- tion, with SAIM conferring 1.8 greater odds of decreasedsexual satisfaction. We then created four models, adding each proposed me- diator independently. Addition of the mental health com-posite score produced the most marked reduction in theassociation between SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction, reduc- ing the OR from 1.78 to 1.42. This is a 20% change in the overall effect estimate, suggesting that emotional health-related quality of life is a substantial mediator of this associ- ation.MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION 903 A substantially smaller effect was found with the other proposed mediators. The addition of physical compo-nent scale to model 2 resulted in a small (1%) reduction in the increased odds of sexual dissatisfaction relative to the increased odds of sexual dissatisfaction associated withmodel 2 (1.78 to 1.76). Endorsing any gynecological prob-lem decreased the OR of sexual dissatisfaction from 1.78 to 1.72, a minimal change of 3% in the effect estimate. Addition of the close partner variable also attenuated the associationbetween SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction, reducing the OR from 1.78 to 1.70, a 4% change in the overall adjusted effect estimate.Table 4 shows the nal adjusted model, with independent factors associated with sexual dissatisfaction. After control-ling for demographics, health behaviors, and the proposed mediators, SAIM remained modestly associated with sexual dissatisfaction (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02, 1.72). The increasedodds of sexual dissatisfaction associated with SAIM in thefully adjusted model dropped from 1.78 to 1.32, reflecting a clinically important 26% reduction in the effect estimate. Of note, age, marital status, race, and family income were notsignicantly associated with sexual satisfaction. Participants who reported lower educational attainment were less likely to report sexual dissatisfaction.

Each of the proposed mediators was independently asso- ciated with sexual dissatisfaction in the nal model. A 1-SDdecrement in mental health composite score was associated with 1.91 greater odds of sexual dissatisfaction and a 1-SD decrement in the physical health composite score was asso-ciated with 1.27 greater odds of sexual dissatisfaction. En- dorsing a gynecological problem was associated with 1.39 greater odds, and lack of a close partner was associated with2.51 greater odds of sexual dissatisfaction. Differences in the magnitudes of the effect estimates should be interpreted with caution in this model, which includes both measurement andcategorical variables. Discussion In a sample of over 3000 female veterans, increased mental health-related quality of life, increased physical health-relatedquality of life, lack of gynecological morbidity, and having a close partner largely mediate the adverse effect of SAIM on sexual satisfaction. Decreased mental health-related quality oflife was the most prominent mediator in the association be- tween SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction. The dominant mediator role of mental health-related quality of life has been suggested in studies of specic mentalhealth conditions relevant for survivors of SAIM, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. An as- sociation between PTSD and decreased sexual satisfaction hasbeen directly described in male populations, 19,41-43even among those with nonsexual trauma. Among women, the link between sexual dissatisfaction and PTSD is not as well de-scribed. However, sexual dysfunction is described among female populations with PTSD, 20and sexual dissatisfaction as a manifestation of sexual dysfunction may be more prominentin survivors of sexual assault, with resultant PTSD. Avoidantbehavior with respect to sexual activity and intrusive negative thoughts when attempting consensual sexual activity 44may lead to sexual dissatisfaction. Sexual assault is more stronglyassociated than other types of physical assault with the de- velopment of PTSD in women. 13,15 Depression likely contributes to lower mental health- related quality of life after SAIM.21Hypoactive sexual desireand anhedonia, which may manifest as decreased sexual satisfaction, are common features in depression.45Women with a history of violence victimization are more likely thantheir male counterparts to manifest depression. 46The inde- pendent contributions of PTSD and depression as potential mental health-related mediators may be difcult to establishbecause of the high rate of cooccurrence of these psychiatric conditions among women veterans. 47Thus, emotional health- related quality of life may be an ideal measure to capture thefunctional impact of these disorders. Although we determined that decrements in physical health-related quality of life were statistically signicant inour nal adjusted model, this association showed a minimalclinical effect. Thus, our ndings were concordant with the expected direction of association but not with the expected magnitude. This was unexpected because self-perceivedhealth status has been associated with sexual satisfaction among women. 48Moreover, sexuality can be adversely af- fected by a variety of chronic nongynecological medical con-ditions, 25,49,50including respiratory disease,51renal disease requiring chronic dialysis,52neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis,53,54and endocrinopathies such mellitus55and the metabolic beenTable 3.Odds Ratios of Sexual Dissatisfaction Given SAIM in Women Veteran Outpatients Nested Logistic Regression Models OR* 95% CI Model 1: Unadjusted 2.26 1.91, 2.68 Model 2: Demographics and health behaviors1.78 1.42, 2.23 Model 2 plus SF-36 mental health composite score1.42 1.11, 1.83 Model 2 plus SF-36 physical health composite score1.76 1.39, 2.24 Model 2 plus any gynecological problem1.72 1.37, 2.16 Model 2 plus no close partner 1.70 1.35, 2.14 Model 3: Model 2 plus all 4 proposed mediators1.32 1.02, 1.72 *All p<0.05.Table 4.Odds Ratios for Sexual Dissatisfaction among Women Veteran Outpatients Variable aOR 95% CI SAIM** 1.32 1.02 1.72 Age (per 1 year increase) 1.00 0.99 1.01Marital status Divorced 1.07 0.79 1.45 Never married 1.22 0.88 1.68Widowed 0.97 0.54 1.73Married Ref. \u2014 \u2014 Race Black 0.75 1.34Other 0.88 0.55 1.40White Ref. \u2014 \u2014 Education** Less than high school 0.24 0.06 0.95 High school only 0.59 0.38 0.92 Some college 0.84 0.57 1.24 Completed college Ref. \u2014 \u2014 Income <$20,000 1.05 0.70 1.57 $20,000 - Know 0.79 0.42 1.48$50,000 \u00fe Ref. \u2014 \u2014 Smoking Current 0.91 0.70 1.20 Former 0.94 0.96 1.26Never Ref. \u2014 \u2014 Alcohol abuse 1.42 0.95 2.12 Proposed Mediators SF-36 mental health composite score (per 1 SD adecrease)**1.91 2.17 1.68 SF-36 physical health composite score (per 1 SDadecrease)**1.27 1.42 1.13 Any gynecological problem** 1 SD \u00bc13.0; PCS, 1 SD \u00bc12.3.MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION 905 associated with poorer self-reported health among women with heart disease.57Thus, we anticipated that women with greater decrements in physical health-related quality of life, associated with the experience of SAIM, would report de-creased sexual satisfaction. One explanation for the limited role of physical health- related quality of life as a mediator is that our sample wasrelatively homogeneous with respect to health status. Further, because physical health-related quality of life is less important for sexual functioning in women than in men, 58women may be less likely to report decreased sexual satisfaction due todecreased health-related quality of life. Endorsement of a gynecological problem was likewise as- sociated with a modest increase in odds of sexual dissatis-faction. Although this nding is concordant with our expected direction of association, we anticipated a greater overall impact on our effect estimate, given the extensive lit-erature describing the adverse and long-standing impact of sexual assault on gynecological and sexual functioning. 27-29 Much of the literature on sexual functioning in survivors of sexual assault does not directly address the construct of sexualsatisfaction. Thus, whereas gynecological problems may manifest as sexual dysfunction in assault survivors, this sex- ual dysfunction may not be reported as decreased sexualsatisfaction but may be more appropriately measured as an- other form of sexual dysfunction, such as sexual pain disor- ders. Alternatively, the limited impact of gynecologicalproblems on the association between SAIM and decreased sexual satisfaction may be explained by the relative homo- geneity of our sample with respect to gynecological com-plaints. A substantial majority of both sexually satised and dissatised subjects endorsed any gynecological problem, suggesting that all women veterans may be at high risk forgynecological complaints. This nding deserves furtherstudy. Not only having a close partner but having a long-standing stable partner is protective of sexual functioning. 24Given the adverse impact of trauma on interpersonal relationships,31we anticipated that our close partner variable would be an im- portant mediator of the association between SAIM and de-creased sexual satisfaction. The minimal independent contribution of this variable to the association suggests that although it functions as an intermediary, the adverse mentalhealth-related quality of life is the predominant mediator. Of note, we found no independent effect of marital status after controlling for having a close partner. Lack of a close partner was more strongly associated with sexual dissatis-faction in our model than was marital status. This suggests that the stability of interpersonal relationships, rather than partner availability, more strongly affects sexual satisfactionin this population, a nding reported in other work. 59 Our ndings with respect to educational status were sur- prising. Lower education in our cohort was correlated withincreased sexual satisfaction. Prior work has described in- creased interest in sex and decreased painful sex with higher educational attainment. 58In international samples,5,60higher educational attainment was correlated with greater sexualsatisfaction, possibly due to more permissive sexual attitudes. Conversely, among Finnish women, 5higher educational at- tainment was associated with female orgasmic dysfunction.The study of orgasmic dysfunction as a possible mediator ofdecreased sexual satisfaction was beyond the scope of this work but presents a target for future research. The remaining sociodemographic variables were not sig- nicant in our nal model, suggesting limited independentcontribution of these to sexual satisfaction in a model that includes mental health-related quality of life. Our work has several important strengths. Sexual satis- faction, an important dimension of health-related quality of life, has been minimally studied in women veterans, and further research on this topic may improve care for a growingpopulation of women veterans. Although prior studies havedescribed an association between sexual trauma and sexual dissatisfaction, our study extends this line of inquiry by pro- posing and testing mediators of this association. An important limitation of our study is that our data are cross-sectional. Thus, causality cannot be established, and the directionality of association can only be inferred. Somedirections of associations proposed in our mediator model may logically be reversed. For example, sexual dissatisfaction may lead to a lower emotional health-related quality of lifeor may impact the ability to form close partnerships instead ofthe converse. This cannot be tested in cross-sectional data, which preclude the establishment of temporal associations. Additionally, the data were collected by self-report; thus, themedical conditions and other histories collected cannot be veried. Further, we did not collect data on satisfaction with sexual frequency. Relational and physical aspects of sexualsatisfaction may logically be compromised by partner un- availability. Further, women voluntarily abstaining from ei- ther partnered or unpartnered sexual activity may report highsexual satisfaction. The VA Women's Health Project did not collect data on premilitary sexual violence, including childhood sexualabuse, or ongoing interpersonal violence, including intimatepartner violence (IPV). Thus, a potentially unmeasured con- founder in these associations is nonmilitary violence. Sexual revictimization is common, affecting approximately twothirds of rape victims, and there is evidence that the adverse health effects of multiple victimizations are cumulative. 61 Thus, among subjects with a history of multiple victimiza- tions, premilitary or ongoing interpersonal violence may ac- count for these ndings. We cannot adequately assess the relative contribution of antidepressant medication on sexual satisfaction in these data.Antidepressant medications, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, contribute to sexual dysfunction in women. 62Given the burden of psychiatric ill- ness in this population, it is possible that a large proportion of these women were prescribed antidepressant medications. Some women may have experienced adverse sexual side ef-fects of SSRI medication and were dissatised because of this. Regardless, among women who are appropriately treated for psychiatric illnesses that have resulted from trauma, the as-sociation between SAIM, and decreased sexual satisfaction may be attenuated due to improved emotional health-related quality of life. Finally, the sexual satisfaction construct is based on a sin- gle, face-valid question designed to capture all domains of sexual satisfaction. A single, face-valid question to measure overall sexual satisfaction has been related previously tofunctional, relational, and emotional aspects of sexuality. 2,34A906 McCALL-HOSENFELD ET AL. multiple-question, psychometrically validated instrument designed to capture operationally different domains of sexual satisfaction was not available in these data. Indeed, the study of sexuality is often problematic because studies that enrollsubjects willing to answer detailed multiquestion surveys addressing sexual issues may not represent the population under study. 63Conversely, surveys designed to measure a broad range of topics, such as the one reported here, may be more representative of the study population but provide limited ability to elaborate details of the domains of sexualconstructs. Future research should establish if the proposedmediators impact more strongly on operationally distinct domains of sexual satisfaction. After controlling for mediators, a modest but signicant association between SAIM and decreased sexual satisfaction remained. This suggests that the four proposed mediators do not fully describe the association between SAIM and sexualdissatisfaction. Elaboration of additional mediators presents an important target for further research. Conclusions Women veterans are exposed at high rates to sexual trauma, which adversely impacts sexual satisfaction, an im-portant aspect of health-related quality of life. Much of the adverse impact of SAIM on sexual satisfaction in women veterans is explained by decrements in emotional health-related quality of life. The Department of Defense reported that 1620 service members were victims of SAIM during scal year 2007. 64As the population of women veterans increases in both the VA and the community, the burden of SAIM may become more evident. Healthcare providers treating survi- vors of SAIM should focus on treatable sequelae of this ad-verse life event, including mental health consequences.Providers who recognize adverse mental health disorders in SAIM survivors should screen patients for adverse sexual effects in all domains of sexual satisfaction: emotional, phys-ical including gynecological, and relational. In addition to primary prevention of SAIM, efforts to both screen for and then appropriately treat the sequelae of SAIM may improvepatient satisfaction and overall well-being of women veterans.

Many of the diseases that cause chest pain are reviewed in detail elsewhere. This topic will discuss the differential diagnosis of chest pain in an approximate order of prevalence seen in primary care practice. Within each subsection, diseases that may pose an immediate life-threat are discussed first, followed by the more common etiologies, and then by other causes of chest pain. Details about the office evaluation of the patient with chest pain are found separately. (See \"Qiagnosti<;: QQ.PIoach to chest pain in adults\".) CHEST WALL PAIN -Chest wall causes of pain are among the most common etiologies of chest pain seen by primary care clinicians, accounting for 36 percent of episodes in one report (table lA:::6) [ll Chest wall tenderness may present concomitantly with myocardial ischemia; the latter should be considered first in any patient at risk by age, history, or associated symptoms [1]. Causes of true chest wall pain may be musculoskeletal or related to the skin and sensory nerves. Musculoskeletal pain -Demographic features, characteristics of the chest pain, and associated symptoms may favor the diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain or suggest other causes of chest discomfort (table 2). As an example, the patient may describe a history of repetitive or unaccustomed activity involvlnq the upper trunk or arms. Certain characteristics of the chest pain or associated symptoms may suggest a nonmusculoskeletal origin. (See \"Clini<;:aJevaJYatiooof musculoskeletal chest pain\".) Musculoskeletal chest pain is often insidious and persistent, lasting for hours to weeks. It is frequently sharp and localized to a specific area (such as the xiphoid, lower rib tips, or midsternum), but may be diffuse and poorly localized. The pain may be positional or exacerbated by deep breathing, turning, or arm movement; the first two, however, are also noted in a variety of visceral processes, particularly those involving the pleura and pericardium. The proportion of patients with chest pain having a musculoskeletal source varies with the clinical setting. It is more common in ambulatory patients presenting to their primary care clinician than presenting to an emergency department (tab1U). It also occurs more frequently among women than men. One study examined the incidence of musculoskeletal chest pain in 122 consecutive patients presenting to an emergency department with chest pain [2]. Of 36 patients diagnosed with costochondritis, 69 percent were women. By comparison, women represented only 31 percent of the presenting patients who did not have a subsequent diagnosis of costochondritis. http://uptodateonline.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=pri_card/4594&view=print 11/27/2009 Differential diagnosis ofchest pain in adults Page 2 of28 The differential diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain has been divided into three categories (see \"M.i;lJQI~i;lUSesQfmus~uJoskeleti;lL~hestpi;ljn\" : Isolated musculoskeletal chest pain syndromes (costosternal, posterior syndromes) musculoskeletal chest pain syndromes -There are a number of chest wall syndromes with chest pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation (tqRJe4). \"Costochondritis\" is one of the more common presentations of musculoskeletal chest pain. It is a diffuse pain syndrome, in which multiple areas of tenderness are found that reproduce the described pain. The upper costal cartilages at the costochondral or costosternal junctions are most frequently involved. The areas of tenderness are not accompanied by heat, erythema, or localized swelling. Chest wall pain occurring after coronary artery bypass surgery may be a result of incisional discomfort, of internal mammary artery grafting, or related to sternal wires [J]. Costovertebral joint dysfunction syndrome is an uncommon condition that causes posterior chest wall pain and may mimic a pulmonary embolism. Thoracic disk herniation is another unusual cause of posterior chest pain; the pain is sometimes dermatomal and \"band-like,\" and retrosternal or retrogastric pain has also been described DtA]. Rheumatic diseases -Involvement of thoracic joints in rheumatic diseases can be associated with musculoskeletal chest wall pain (tqRJe~). Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic ~hestpq in\". ) Nonrheumatic systemic diseases -A variety of systemic disorders can be characterized by bony involvement that can lead to chest wall pain (ti;lbJe~). Examples include stress fractures L~J, neoplasms including pathologic fractures [6J, sickle cell anemia, and infections such as septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Skin and sensory nerves -Chest pain may be the presenting symptom of herpes zoster (shingles); it may precede the characteristic rash and, rarely, zoster may occur without a rash [Z]. Dysesthesia is usually present in the affected dermatome. Postherpetic and postradiation neuralgia are other unusual causes of chest pain. (See \"PQstherpeti~neUIqlgiq\".) CARDIAC CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN -Cardiac causes of chest pain may be related to myocardial ischemia resulting from coronary heart disease, aortic dissection, valvular heart disease, inflammation of the myocardium or pericardium, or reversible left ventricular dysfunction due to emotional stress. In cardiac syndrome X ischemic type chest pain may occur in the absence of documented epicardial coronary artery disease. (See 'Cq[dji;lc:: SyndIO/Ile X' below.) Coronary heart disease -Ischemic chest pain due to coronary artery disease (CAD) encompasses a spectrum of presentations including stable angina pectoris, unstable angina, non\u00ad unstable angina and non-ST elevation~ocardial infarction\".) Patients classically complain of chest heaviness, pressure, tightness or burning, but may vigorously deny \"pain.\" (see \"PC3thQPhY$JQIQgYC3n<:J<::liniC::<:'llpr~$~ntC3JiQnQfj$c::h~mi<::<::h~stPC3 in\". Other descriptlons such as provocation with physical or emotional stress or cold, relief with rest, and radiation to the neck, jaw, and shoulder are common. Ischemic pain usually lasts more than 2 but less than 20 minutes, unless a myocardial infarction is occurring. Associated symptoms may include dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, presyncope, or palpitations. This classical description of pain due to CAD is most frequently seen in middle-aged men with risk factors for atherosclerosis; women, patients with diabetes, and the elderly often do not present with classical symptoms. As an example, one study of 94 patients found that 32 percent, especially women over age 65, presented with \"atypical\" symptoms; abdominal pain was most common, occurring in one-third of these patients, while paroxysmal dyspnea was the presenting symptom in 17 percent [8J. Such presentations do not necessarily suggest a better prognosis [~]. Even elderly women diagnosed with \"nonspecific chest pain\" may be at increased risk of cardiac morbidity [lQ]' The term \"atypical\" chest pain should be avoided; it increases the risk of misdiagnosing women, the elderly, patients with long standing diabetes, and those with a myocardial infarction who present with symptoms such with chest pain who use cocaine are at increased risk of acute coronary syndrome [11J. In one series, approximately one-fifth of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain experienced an acute coronary syndrome [12]. The differential diagnosis of chest pain in patients who have used cocaine is similar to that in the general population except that the likelihood of the patient having a serious event is increased [l:n (See \"<:::oC::C3Ln~:8<::uJ~iotQxjC::<:'ltjQn\".) One interesting group of patients is those with variant angina, in which coronary vasospasm may result in classical anginal pain. It may be precipitated by hyperventilation and, occasionally, by exercise. Vasospastic angina may be associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. Patients are typically less than 60 years old and, other than cigarette or cocaine use, do not necessarily have traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The rest ECG may reveal transient ST segment elevation. (See:'VC3r iC3Dt<:'lDg iO<:'l\".) Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare but often deadly cause of myocardial infarction that mainly affects otherwise healthy, young females [14]. Aortic dissection -Sudden, severe, and often migratory chest pain occurs in most but not all patients with dissection of the ascending or descending aorta, but its diagnosis often requires a high index of suspicion [15]. It is most common in men older than age 60. The pain typically is cataclysmic in onset, and is often described as a \"ripping\" or \"tearing\" sensation. Pain is commonly felt in the anterior or posterior chest, or in the neck, throat, or jaw. Hypertension is the most important risk factor; less common associations include Marfan's syndrome, congenital bicuspid aortic valves, may precipitate aortic dissection [18]. Aortic dissection should be considered in any patient who presents with a catastrophic illness associated with hypertension, an aortic murmur, and unexplained physical findings _cardl4594&view=print 11/27/2009 adults Page 4 of28 ortqln. The presentation may be subtle, however; in one series, one-third of cases were initially misdiagnosed [In. Symptoms associated with aortic dissection may be related to impaired blood flow to an organ or limb induced by the original dissection or by propagation of the dissection proximally or distally. Even in the absence of chest pain, findings that should prompt consideration of aortic dissection include, in approximately decreasing order of incidence: Abnormal aortic contour or widened mediastinum on chest radiograph, seen in most patients (pi..GlyreJ) Congestive heart failure, which may be due to acute aortic insufficiency (movie 1) Neurologic deficits, including paraplegia, stroke, or decreased consciousness (due to spinal cord ischemia, dissection into the carotid arteries, or diminished carotid blood flow, respectively) Syncope, cardiac tamponade, and sudden death due to rupture of the aorta into the pericardial space Shock, hemothorax, and exsanguination, which may result if the dissection extends through the adventitia, with hemorrhage into the pleural space Acute lower extremity ischemia due to dissection into the iliac vessels Infrequently reported sequelae such as myocardial ischemia due coronary occlusion, signs of mesenteric or renal ischemia, Horner syndrome due to compression of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, vocal cord paralysis due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and other rare physical findings The initial evaluation to rule out dissection should involve confirming that chest pain is not typical for this disorder, that there are no new neurologic symptoms, checking that pulses and upper extremity blood pressures are symmetric and normal and that the murmur of aortic regurgitation is not present, excluding heart failure on exam, and determining that the aortic contour is not widened on chest radiograph. A normal electrocardiogram may raise concern that chest pain is not due to an acute myocardial infarction. Definitive diagnosis is made with aortography or noninvasive techniques including CT scanning, magnetic on\".) particularly of the aortic or mitral valves, may present with chest pain. Aortic stenosis should be considered whenever a patient presents with progressive angina, dyspnea, and/or syncope. A detailed physical examination of the heart should be performed to exclude \"weak and delayed\" arterial pulses, a sustained (See \"AYscultgtiooof Ci:3IdJgcffilJrmUIS\" \"AvscuIJi:ltioIJoflJei:lIt sounds\".) The ECG may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy. It is important to obtain an echocardiogram in patients with suspected aortic stenosis early in the evaluation since exercise stress testing be contraindicated. (See chest pain. The pain often resembles angina and, although it is most commonly the result of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, may be due to underlying coronary artery disease or a coronary artery http://uptodateonline.com/ online/content/topic. do?topicKey=pri _card!4594&view=print 11/27/2009 Differential diagnosis of chest Page 5 of28 'embolism [19]. An atrial tachyarrhythmia with left atrial and pulmonary vascular distension is another cause of intermittent (See \"Qverviewo{PlJJmOIJaJY relatively common congenital defect, but a rare cause of chest pain in primary care practice. Pulmonic stenosis occurring later in life is associated with the carcinoid syndrome. (See \"Qlnical features of pericarditis are chest pain (usually pleuritic), a pericardial friction rub, and Widespread ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram [2.Q]. (See \"AlJsClJltationothegrtsQlJnds\".) At least two of these features, with or without an accompanying pericardial effusion, are usually present. The chest pain of acute pericarditis is typically of fairly sudden onset and occurs over the anterior chest. It is usually sharp and exacerbated by inspiration. However, dull, oppressive pain, difficult to distinguish from that of myocardial infarction, can also occur. The pain may decrease in intensity when the patient sits up and can radiate, especially to the trapezius ridge. (See \".l:;vgllJgtioOand ...mgnagemeot ..Qf...gClJle ...pe(Jci,\"l.[dj.tis'~.) Myocarditis -Myocarditis may present with both cardiac and systemic symptoms. When chest pain occurs, it is usually associated with concomitant pericarditis although evidence of infarction may be seen. Systemic symptoms include fever, myalgias, and muscle tenderness. (See \"CLlnicaJ manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults\".) Stress-induced cardiomyopathy -Emotional stress can precipitate severe, reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients without coronary heart disease, probably related to exaggerated sympathetic stimulation. Patients most commonly present with acute substernal chest pain. (See \"Stress-::indlJced{takotsuJ::>o}cgrdjomyoPgthYII') Cardiac syndrome X -Cardiac syndrome X is a syndrome of angina-like, non-gastrointestinal chest pain associated with normal coronary arteries; it is most commonly seen in premenopausal women [2.1]. The pain is typical of angina in approximately one-half of patients and may be precipitated by exertion, although it also occurs at rest. The pain also often has characteristics atypical for epicardial CAD; it is more severe, prolonged, and is variably relieved with nitrates [22,2.~]' An association with an underlying panic disorder has been described [23]. ST segment depression may be seen on treadmill exercise testing. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, generally made if coronary angiography does not demonstrate evidence of CAD. In referral populations of women with chest pain (eg, hospitalization, undergoing coronary angiography), myocardial ischemia and/or coronary microvascular dysfunction are present in 20 to 50 percent of patients with normal coronary arteries. (See IICgJoji,\"lC that rarely presents with chest pain [2.4]. It should particularly be considered in patients who lack other coronary risk factors; have other symptoms suggestive content/topic.do ?topicKey=pri _card!4594&view=print 11/2712009 Differential of chest pain in adults Page 6 of28 paroxvsmal hypertension, headache, or generalized sweating or palpitations); whose symptoms are paroxysmal or worsen after the administration of beta adrenergic blockage; or who appear to be experiencing and esophagus share similar neurologic innervation. Thus, it may be difficult to distinguish between chest pain due to myocardial ischemia and that originating from the esophagus based upon the history alone. Esophageal disease may cause symptoms thought \"classical\" for myocardial ischemia, including a sensation of chest pressure, provocation with exercise or emotion, palliation by rest or nitrates, or a crescendo pattern [:2\u00a7]. In one study of 28 patients referred to a cardiology clinic for chest pain, 36 percent ultimately had a diagnosis of reflux esophagitis [:27]. After a history was taken independently by a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist, an accurate diagnosis was made in only 40 and 30 percent of patients with myocardial disease and reflux esophagitis, respectively. Any patient at risk for CAD who presents with anginal-quality chest pain should have myocardial ischemia ruled out before being given a gastroenterologic diagnosis. Neither the clinical history nor the response of new chest pain to a \"GI cocktail\" (eg, vlscous lldocajne and antacid) reliably differentiates the diagnoses, which often coexist [2a]. There are, however, several clues that suggest an esophageal etiology (table 6) [26]. Gastroesophageal reflux disease -Chest pain due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can mimic angina pectoris and may be described as squeezing or burning, located substernally and radiating to the back, neck, jaw or arms, lasting anywhere from minutes to hours, and resolving either spontaneously or with antacids. It may occur after meals, awaken patients from sleep, and be exacerbated by emotional stress. The preponderance of patients with reflux-induced chest pain also give a history of typical reflux symptoms (ie, dyspepsia, regurgitation, acid taste). (See\"<:::Jioica1maoJfeslaJionsaoddJagOOsiso{gastrOE:!soplJageaJrefll,J)(jnadl,Jlls\".) After cardiac disease has been ruled out, a trial of acid suppression may assist in the diagnosis of GERD [29\u00ad ~1]. (See \"<:::hestpaiOQtesoPha9E:!.alorigJo\".) Esophageal hyperalgesia -There are considerable experimental data to indicate that some patients with noncardiac chest pain have a lower threshold for esophageal pain than normal subjects. Studies utilizing intraesophageal balloon distension have shown that many patients with unexplained chest pain experience their pain at a lower volume of balloon inflation than that found in appropriate control subjects [32,33]. (See \"Chest pain of esophageal origin\", section on '!;sQPhageaJhYPE:!JsensitivJty'. ) Some patients with cardiac syndrome X may have a similar problem in which there is altered sensory awareness to cardiac events, the uncommon diagnosis of a motility disorder or esophageal spasm should be entertained if chest pain is associated with dysphagia, and a parJl,JfD swallow study does not reveal an ':sophageal rupture, mediastinitis, and foreign bodies -Spontaneous perforation of the esophagus most commonly results from a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure combined with negative intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or vomiting (effort rupture of the esophagus or Boerhaave's syndrome) [J6]. Other causes of perforation include caustic ingestion, pill esophagitis, Barrett's ulcer [J7], infectious ulcers in patients with AIDS, and iatrogenic injury (typically from passing an instrument or tube through the esophagus or following dilation of esophageal strictures). (See 'ICQmpljcgtion$Qt~$QPh9g~gl?triGt!Jr.~dilgtiQn'~.) The classical history in a patient with Boerhaave's syndrome is one of severe retching and vomiting followed by excruciating retrosternal chest and upper abdominal pain. Odynophagia, tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, fever, and shock develop rapidly thereafter [9,36]. (See \"6Q~Lhggv~'$$yngrQm~:Effor.tIl,JptYI~Qfth~~$QPbggU$\". ) A patient with a foreign body impacted in the esophagus may present with chest pain. Esophageal foreign bodies are most commonly seen in children. Adult patients are often prisoners, edentulous, or are mentally retarded, psychiatrically ill, or dependent on LJm. (See':EQr.~jgnbQdil;$jD the esophagus in adults\".) Medication-induced esophagitis -Medications can induce esophageal abnormalities via both systemic and local actions. The types of medication causing direct esophageal injury can be roughly divided into antibiotics (most commonly doxycycline), antiinflammatory agents (especially asntrlm. and others including bisphosphonates, PQtg$?il,lr:D<:;bJocide, qYJnic:liD~ preparations, and iron compounds in the United States; emepronium, alprenolol, and pi!.Jgv~riUm are common etiologies in other countries. The typical patient with medication-induced esophagitis does not have a history of prior esophageal disease. Patients will often present with the sudden onset of odynophagia and retrosternal pain; the pain may be so severe that swallowing saliva is difficult. Patients often relate (after careful questioning) the onset of symptoms to the swallowing of a pill without water, commonly at bedtime. (See'IM~c:liGgtJQn:::inc:lVG~9l;$QPhggilis\".) Other gastrointestinal causes of chest pain -The possibility of radiating or referred visceral pain due to peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis or [J9], pancreatitis, kidney stones or even appendicitis [40J should be considered in any patient with unexplained chest pain. PULMONARY CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN -The pulmonary causes of chest pain may be related to the pulmonary vessels, lung parenchyma, or pleural tissue. Pulmonary vasculature -Chest pain caused by abnormalities of the pulmonary vessels may be due to an acute problem such as a pulmonary embolism or a chronic condition such as pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary thromboembolism -The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism often requires a high index of suspicion, especially since it is an uncommon cause of chest pain in the primary care setting [1,41,42]. It should be considered in any patient who presents with chest pain that is usually but not necessarily pleuritic in nature or dyspnea which is not fully explained by the clinical evaluation, chest radiograph, or electrocardiogram [43:::45J. Individual symptoms and signs are not helpful diagnostically because their frequency is similar among patients with and without PE [46J. The Prospective Investigation of online/content/topic. do?topicKey=pri_ card!4594&view=print ofchest pain in adults Page 8 of28 found that the most common symptoms of pulmonary embolism were dyspnea (73 percent), pleuritic chest pain (66 percent), cough (37 percent), and hemoptysis (13 percent) [45]. Ninety\u00ad seven percent of patients had pleuritic pain, dyspnea or tachypnea; 90 percent had dyspnea, tachypnea or signs of deep venous thrombosis; 84 percent had a chest x-ray abnormality; and 50 percent had nonspecific electrocardiographic abnormalities. Subsequent studies have corroborated these findings [4Z,4~]. The PIOPED II study further elucidated that, if present, dyspnea may occur only on exertion. The onset of dyspnea is usually rapid. Orthopnea may occur. Occasionally, common symptoms may be absent or mild if present, even with severe pulmonary embolism. A low-probability objective clinical assessment does not exclude the diagnosis [46]. Most patients with pulmonary embolism have identifiable risk factors including immobilization, surgery within the last three months, stroke, history of venous thromboembolism, or malignancy (tgbJ~]) [49]. (See \"QY~rYJ~wottlJ~~gLJ$~$QtY~nQLJ$tbJQmbQ$Js'.'.) Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale -Patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that reflect the underlying etiology (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolic disease, collagen vascular disease). There are, however, symptoms directly attributable to secondary pulmonary hypertension including dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, lethargy, chest pain, and syncope with exertion. Typical exertional angina has been reported in patients with mitral stenosis or congenital heart disease and cor pulmonale even in the presence of normal coronary arteries [19]. The mechanism by which angina occurs is unclear; both pulmonary artery stretching and right ventricular ischemia have been proposed. (SeeIlQY~Iyi~WQlpl,JJmoogJybYP~Jt~nsion~'. ) Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disease. Most patients present with exertional dyspnea, which is indicative of an inability to increase cardiac output with exercise. Exertional chest pain, syncope, and edema are indications of more severe pulmonary hypertension and impaired right heart function. (See \"Overview of pulmonary hypertension\".) Lung parenchyma -Causes of chest pain related to the lung parenchyma include infection, cancer, or chronic diseases such as sarcoidosis. Pneumonia -The patient with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by pyogenic organisms classically presents with the sudden onset of rigors followed by fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough productive of purulent sputum. Chest pain occurs in 30 percent of cases, chills in 40 to 50 percent, and rigors in 15 percent. Because of the rapid onset of symptoms, most individuals seek medical care within six days [50]. (See \"Oiagoostic::gpprogc::oJoc::ommlJoity ... acqUired pneumonia in adults\".)

Cancer -Isolated chest pain is a relatively rare presentation of lung cancer [lA1,42]. The chest pain experienced by 25 to 50 percent of lung cancer patients is usually in association with htlp://uptodateonline.comionline/content/topic.do?topicKey=pri_card/4594&view=print 11/27/2009 Differential diagnosis ofchest pain in adults Page 90f28 cough, dyspnea, weight loss or hemoptysis. Some patients have a dull, intermittent pain on the side of the tumor; severe or persistent pain often indicates chest wall a common manifestation of pulmonary sarcoidosis, although it rarely occurs in isolation; most commonly it is accompanied by cough and dyspnea. (See \"Cljnic.aJ manifestations and diagnosis of sarcoidosis\".) Granulomatous involvement of the ventricular septum and conduction system of the heart can lead to a variety of arrhythmias (including heart block) and sudden death; such involvement may be heralded by chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. (See \"Cardiac sarcoidosis\".) Pleura and pleural space -Pleuritic chest pain is caused by irritation of nerve endings of pain fibers in the costal pleura. It often has a stabbing quality that worsens with inspiration. Pain referred from the pleura may be felt in the thoracic wall in the areas of skin innervated by the intercostal nerves [5.1]. Pneumothorax -A spontaneous pneumothorax (as well as an acute pulmonary embolus) should be considered in any patient who complains of the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and respiratory distress (pictlJr~2). A primary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs without a precipitating event in a person (most commonly young, tall, adult male smoker) with no clinical lung disease; recurrence is common [52J. A secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs as a complication of underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumocystis pneumonia. (See \"Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is rare, but potentially life-threatening unless treated emergently. It occurs when a tissue flap from the injured lung creates a one-way valve, progressively trapping air in the intrapleural space during inspiration. Respiratory failure occurs as the healthy lung is compressed. Physical findings include a unilateral loss of breath sounds with hypertympany, shift of the trachea away from the injured side, and jugular venous distension. The diagnosis is based upon a characteristic history and examination; it should be emergently treated prior to a confirmatory chest radiograph. Decompression is accomplished by inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side [53J. Pleuritis/serositis -Pleuritis is an inflammation of the parietal and serous pleura of the lung. Viral pleurisy is a common cause of pleuritic chest pain in young adults (table 8). Other causes include autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, and drugs that can cause a lupus-like syndrome including procaJnamide, bYdIalazin~, isoniazid, and others. (See \"Drug-induced pleural effusion is more likely to present with dyspnea or vague chest discomfort than with typical \"pleuritic\" chest pain, except in the setting of pleuritis. (See\"QiagnQstic~valqatiQnQtapJ~IJJal~ffIJSiQnjnadqltsl'.) Mediastinal disease -Disease originating in the mediastinum is a rare cause of chest pain in http://uptodateonline.com/ online/content/topic. do?topicKey=pri _card!4594&view=print 11/27/2009 Differential diagnosis of chest pain in adults Page 10 of28 primary care practice. Such pain may be associated with signs and symptoms of involvement of different mediastinal or surrounding structures [54]. (See \"I:Vi:llqi:ltJQJ1QfmeoJqstini:llmqssesl'.) PSYCHOGENIC/PSYCHOSOMATIC CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN -Chest pain may be a presenting symptom of panic disorder, depression, and hypochondriasis, as well as cardiac, cancer, or other phobias Cti:lbJe9) [,55:-57]. (See I'Qverv iewQ[pi:ln icdisQroer\".) A report of patients evaluated in an emergency department for chest pain found that 20 percent had panic disorder as the etiology [5Jn. Reviews of the literature have estimated that approximately one-third of patients presenting to the emergency department for chest pain have a psychiatric disorder, while approximately one-half of patients with noncardiac chest pain have various psychiatric diagnoses [59,60], Among patients with chest pain due to CAD, 20 to 30 percent also have a coexlstlnq psychiatric disorder. Hyperventilation, which is associated with panic attacks, can also result in nonanginal chest pain and occasionally electrocardiographic changes, particularly nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities [6L64]. Given its prevalence and long-term negative impact on function [63], panic disorder and other psychosocial pathology should be actively considered in evaluating the patient who complains of chest pain of uncertain etiology [64]. Vigilance is necessary since patients with psychiatric disorders may develop organic disease [2$,60]. In addition, ischemia may occur during a panic attack in a patient with CAD [65]. Thus organic disease must be reasonably excluded before ascribing chest pain to a nonorganic origin. Another psychological basis for chest pain is the Munchausen syndrome. This entity denotes a psychological disorder in which patients deliberately feign serious medical illness, inventing false symptoms and signs. In one literature review, 58 patients with cardiac Munchausen syndrome were identified [66]. Of these, 54 (95 percent) were male; the mean age was 44 years (range, 23 to 71). The most common presenting symptom was retrosternal chest pain (50 patients); other presenting complaints were syncope, dyspnea, and back pain. Patients typically gave a history of prior cardiac disease and often reported havlnq \"white collar\" jobs; on investigation, these historical data proved to be untrue. (See \"EactitiQl.IsoJsQrderqodMl.Iochi:lYsensynorornel'.) Acute myocardial infarction was the most common admitting diagnosis. All subjects had had numerous admissions and extensive cardiac testing, which were negative for cardiac disease but which the patients reported were positive. When confronted, most patients changed their history, became uncooperative, and refused psychiatric examination. The majority left hospitals against medical advice, and none reported for outpatient follow-up. PAIN REFERRED TO THE CHEST -Referred pain may occur when the same spinal cord segments supplying dermatomal areas of the chest wall also innervate the very sensitive parietal pleura or peritoneum. As an example, irritation of the mediastinal pleura or of the central diaphragm due to gallbladder or liver disease may result in neck and shoulder pain, while more peripheral diaphragmatic irritation may result in inferior chest pain [51]. A herniated thoracic disc may cause \"band-like\" anterior chest pain [4]. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS -Educational materials on this topic are available for patients.

SUMMARY -In the primary care setting, the etiology of nonemergent chest pain can be musculoskeletal (36 percent), cardiac (16 percent), gastrointestinal (19 percent), pulmonary (5 percent), or psychiatric (8 percent). (tableZ). An approach to the diagnostic evaluation of the adult with chest pain is presented separately. (See \"Diagnostic approach to chest pain in adults\".) Chest wall pain can be categorized as musculoskeletal pain or disorders of the skin and sensory nerves. Musculoskeletal pain can be caused by costochondritis, pain related to surgery, costovertebral joint dysfunction, rheumatologic disorders, and non-rheumatologic disorders (see '<:::tlestwaJJpi'lin' above. Cardiac causes of chest pain may be related to myocardial ischemia resulting from coronary heart disease, aortic dissection, valvular heart disease, inflammation of the myocardium or pericardium, reversible left ventricular dysfunction due to emotional stress, or cardiac syndrome X. Cardiac syndrome X is ischemic type chest pain that occurs in the absence of documented epicardial coronary artery disease. (See'<:::i'lg:li gc::c::i:lW5e59fcoestPi'lin' above.) Gastrointestinal causes of chest pain may include gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal hyperalgesia, abnormal motility, esophageal disease, and medication use. It may be difficult to distinguish between chest pain due to myocardial ischemia and gastrointestinal causes based upon the history alone. Any patient at risk for CAD who presents with anginal-quality chest pain should have myocardial ischemia ruled out before being given a gastroenterologic diagnosis. (See 'Gastrointestinal causes of chest pain' above.) The pulmonary causes of chest pain may be related to the pulmonary vessels, lung parenchyma, pleural tissue, or mediastinal disease (see'pwJmO[lgJyc::aJ,l5esoLcOestpgiJl' above. Chest pain may be a presenting symptom of panic disorder, depression, and hypochondriasis, as well as cardiac, cancer, or other phobias. (See 'Psychogenic/psychosomatic causes of chest pain' above.) Referred pain may occur when the same spinal cord segments supplying dermatomal areas of the chest wall also innervate other areas that are inflamed, including liver disease or a herniated thoracic disc (see 'Pain referred to the chest' above.

Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation Daniel E. Singer, Yuchiao Chang, Fang, Leila H. Borowsky, Niela K. Pomernacki, Natalia Udaltsova, and Alan S. Go Ann Intern Med September 1, 2009 151:297-305; CHADS2 (8SX2) o lames L. Meisel, M.D., FACP Boston University School of Medicine Singer et al have further validated the benefit of anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin for populations at high risk for thromboembolic stroke due to nonvalular atrial fibrillation (1,2). Increased net clinical benefit may accrue to older patients, those with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA and those with CHADS2 scores of 2 or more (3). The mnemonic \"CHADS2 (85x2)\" may help clinicians recall the thrust of the latest research (3,4,5). In this adaptation, age>=85, like a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, would be given a double point value. Thus age>=85 alone would raise a patient's CHADS2 score to 2, i.e., into the high risk lone. Age 75-84, like a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, would remain less potent but validated risk factors. Weighing the probable benefit of stroke prevention against bleeding risk, especially in the elderly, remains an important part of individualized decision-making. This is especially true since \"CHADS2 (85x2)\", while at the moment a logical tool to help physicians decide who should receive chronic anticoagulation, has not been independently validated and is partially dependent upon a large, well done but non randomized observational assessment (3).

Introduction Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately ve to eight million Americans [1]and is a powerful predictor of incident coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality [2-4] . The ankle- brachial index (ABI), a subclinical measure of PAD, is considereda marker of generalized atherosclerosis. It is now well estab-lished that inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesisof atherosclerosis and, further, that various inflammatory markerspredict incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events [5,6] .H o w - ever, risk for CVD associated with inflammatory markers is oftenattenuated with adjustment for traditional risk factors. The relation between inflammatory markers and PAD is not fully characterized. C-reactive protein predicts risk of symptomatic PAD[7,8] , and also is associated with atherosclerosis in the aorta [9] and femoral artery [10] , but the associations are attenuated after accounting for established risk factors. Adjusted inverse relationsbetween the ABI and C-reactive protein have been reported in men[11] ,i ne v e rs m o k e r s [12] , and in persons with prevalent CVD [13] . Higher C-reactive protein concentrations are iliac, and lower extremity atherosclerosis [14] , and in one small study both a low ABI and a high C-reactive pro-tein identied persons at greatest risk for clinical events and death[15] . Reports of the relations between other inflammatory mark- ers and PAD are limited, often focus on a single marker, or onsmall hospital-based or referral-based samples, and demonstrateconflicting results [10,16-18] . Emerging evidence suggests that different inflammatory markers operate through distinct biologicmechanisms, and thus the relative importance to the atheroscle-rotic process and PAD may differ for individual markers. We examined the cross-sectional relations of a panel of 12 inflammatory biomarkers and PAD in a large community-basedsample. We selected the inflammatory and oxidative stress mark-ers to represent various stages and pathways in inflammatoryprocess, that differentinflammatory markers represent distinct biologic pathways, andthus not all markers would be related to PAD. Moreover, we pos-tulated that the strength of the relation would vary for differentbiomarkers operating through unique pathways. To our knowl-edge, no other study has evaluated the relation between multiplebiomarkers from potentially diverse biologic pathways and PADconjointly. 2. Methods2.1. Study sample The Framingham Offspring Study was initiated in 1971 when 5124 adult children (and offspring spouses) of the Original cohortwere enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study. Offspring partici-pants have been examined approximately every 4-8 years sincethe study's inception. Written informed consent was obtained ateach examination and the Institutional Review Board of BostonUniversity Medical Center approved the examination content. Offspring participants who attended the seventh examination cycle (1998-2001) were eligible for this study. The examinationincluded a standardized medical history and physical examination,electrocardiogram, noninvasive cardiovascular testing, and mea-surement of fasting lipids, glucose, and a panel of inflammatorybiomarkers. Of the 3539 participants attending the examination,205 were examined off-site and did not have ABI testing, 92 partic- ipants had incomplete ABI data, and 12 participants were excludedbecause of an ABI > 1.4. We further excluded participants missing allbiomarker data ( n= 289) and participants with incomplete risk fac- tor data ( n= 141). Thus, our study sample included 2800 Offspring participants with data available for all 12 biomarkers and completerisk factor data. 2.2. Measurement of ankle-brachial index Ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure measurements were obtained using a standard protocol by trained technicians and thedetails previously published [19] . An 8 MHz Doppler pen probe and an ultrasonic Doppler flow detector (Parks Medical Electronics, Inc.)were used to measure the systolic blood pressure in each limb. Alllimb blood pressures were repeated, and if the initial and repeatblood pressures differed by more than 10 mmHg at any one site,a third measurement was obtained. Measurements were obtainedfrom the dorsalis pedis artery only if the posterior tibial pulse couldnot be located by palpation or with Doppler probe. For this study,the ABI was dened as the ratio of the average systolic blood pres-sure in the ankle divided by the average systolic blood pressure inthe higher arm. The lower ABI was used for analysis. Based on priorepidemiologic studies, we analyzed ABI < 0.9 as indicative of PAD. 2.3. Intermittent claudication and lower extremity revascularization Intermittent claudication was assessed using a standardized physician-administered questionnaire that inquired about thepresence of exertional calf discomfort related to walking uphillor walking rapidly and was relieved with rest. Two physiciansindependently interviewed all participants suspected to have inter-mittent claudication. An endpoint panel, comprised of three seniorinvestigators, examined all medical evidence and made the naldiagnosis of the presence of intermittent claudication. Participantswere also queried about revascularization procedures includinglower extremity bypass surgery and percutaneous transluminalangioplasty. The endpoint panel reviewed hospital records for allcardiovascular procedures. 2.4. Inflammatory biomarker measurement At examination cycle seven, 12 biomarkers were measured including plasma CD40 mass from fasting participants and plasma and serumaliquots were stored at 80 C until analysis. Biomarkers, except C-reactive protein, were measured in duplicate with commer-cially available ELISA kits from R&D A2 activity was measured and masswas measured by DiaDexus. Details for pre-viously published [20] . The intra-assay (based on 24% dupli-J.M.

Additionally, plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (R&D Sys-tems, CV 7.6% low, 5.6% 9.1 urinary creatinine were measured on a subset of participants. 2.5. Clinical covariate assessment Covariates were dened at the time of examination cycle seven. Medication use and current smoking within the year preced-ing the exam were self-reported. Resting blood pressure wasmeasured twice by the examining physician. Hypertension wasdened as an average blood pressure of systolic 140 or dias- tolic90 mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive medication. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the heightin meters squared. Diabetes was dened by fasting blood glucoseof126 mg/dL, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. CVD was dened as coronary heart disease, stroke or transient ischemicattack, and heart failure. An endpoint adjudication panel made thenal diagnostic determination using previously reported criteria[21] . 2.6. Statistical analysis Sex-specic standardization of biomarkers was performed (i.e., within each sex, biomarkers were standardized to have a meanof 0 and a standard deviation of 1). Due to skewed distri-butions, biomarker concentrations were natural logarithmicallytransformed for analysis. Our primary analysis was the simultane-ous consideration of multiple biomarkers (independent variables)in relation to PAD dened as (1) ABI cat-egory (ABI: >1.0) and (2) presence of dened as intermittent claudication or lower extremity revas-cularization. Separate logistic regression models were run for ABIcategory and presence of clinically overt PAD. First, we performeda global test of signicance to determine whether at least one of12 biomarkers was related to the PAD dependent variables usingthe TEST statement in the LOGISTIC procedure in SAS. The analysiswas adjusted for age, sex, and the following 13 clinical covari-ates previously reported to be correlated with biomarkers and orPAD [19,22,23] : current cigarette smoking, number of pack-years of cigarette smoking, diabetes, fasting glucose, body mass index,waist circumference, total to HDL cholesterol ratio, fasting triglyc-eride, lipid lowering treatment, hypertension, aspirin use, prevalent CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary insufciency, angina pec-toris, stroke, or transient ischemic attack), and use of hormonereplacement therapy. Second, we conducted a stepwise multivari-able ordinal logistic regression with PAD as the dependent variable,with forward selection of biomarkers using a p< 0.05 adjusting for age, sex, and forcing the 13 clinical covariates into the model. Forbiomarkers identied to be related to PAD in the second step of theanalysis we calculated point estimates of the odds ratio (or i.e., therelative change in odds of PAD), with 95% condence intervals, perstandard deviation increase of the biomarker examined. We conducted several secondary analyses. We examined effect modication by age (<60, 60 years) and sex for signicant biomarker\u2014PAD relations. We repeated the analysis in personsfree of CVD. Finally because multiple reports have used differentmarkers or sets of markers, we analyzed the multivariable-adjustedlinear relations of each log-transformed marker (dependent vari-able), one marker at a time, to the independent PAD measures usingPROC GLM in SAS. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured on asubset of participants attending examination cycle seven ( n= 2129) and was included in the secondary analysis. SAS version 8.1 wasused to perform all analyses [24] . 3. Results 3.1. Participant characteristics and biomarker concentrations Clinical characteristics of the study sample by presence of clinically overt PAD, and by ABI category are shown in Table 1 . Participants with PAD, dened by symptoms or an ABI < 0.9, wereolder than participants without PAD. The untransformed medianfor the 12 biomarkers and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (availableon a subset) by ABI level are shown in Table 2 . A graded increase in marker concentrations across decreasing ABI levels was present forall markers except lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 massand activity whereas an inverse relation was seen for CD40 ligand. 3.2. Global relations of multiple biomarkers and measures of PAD The inflammatory markers as a group were signicantly related to both ABI and clinically detected PAD ( p= 0.01 and p= 0.02 respec- tively for the multi-marker adjusted global test of signicance)as shown in Table 3 . The forward elimination regression retained interleukin-6 and TNFR2 in the nal models as signicantly associ-ated with ABI and with intermittent claudication or lower extremityrevascularization.

The analysis of clinical PAD was not run in participants free of prevalent CVD due to small numbers ( n= 43). No signicant interactions were noted for sex and age with regardto the association between biomarkers and ABI.

Simi- lar markers associated with clinical PAD (C-reactive protein,interleukin-6, and TNFR2; p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.01) with the following exceptions: brinogen and tumor necrosis factoralpha were not signicantly associated (data not shown).4. Discussion 4.1. Principal ndings In our cross-sectional community-based study, we examined the relations of a panel of 12 inflammatory biomarkers to PADassessed by ABI, and by clinically lower extremity revascularization. Interleukin-6 and TNFR2were signicantly related to both measures of PAD. In secondaryanalyses, examining the relation of each marker separately to ABI,we observed additional signicant inverse relations for C-reactiveprotein, brinogen, and tumor necrosis factor alpha after adjustingfor known risk factors. 4.2. Interleukin-6 and PAD Interleukin-6 is known to play a critical role in the inflamma- tory process with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatoryeffects that include the stimulation of C-reactive protein, brino-gen and other acute phase reactants and increased endothelial celladhesiveness. In accordance with our results, in a small study ofpatients with intermittent claudication, interleukin-6 concentra-tions were higher in patients compared to healthy controls bothat rest and after treadmill exercise ( p< 0.001) suggesting that this marker is associated with peripheral atherosclerosis [25] .I na hospital-based investigation of the interleukin-6 G (-174) C geno-J.M.

Covariates in multivariable model include covariates listed in Table 3 legend. types, in patients with type II diabetes with and without PAD, the GG genotype and higher plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and other inflammatory markers were more common in PADpatients [26] . The investigators of that report hypothesize that the GG genotype promotes PAD in patients with diabetes by induc-ing release of interleukin-6 which in turn results in increasedconcentrations of other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein. Inthe Edinburgh Artery Study, inflammatory marker concentrations,including interleukin-6, were signicantly elevated at baseline inparticipants who developed symptomatic PAD during follow-up[27] . In that study, interleukin-6 was a predictor of incident PAD but the association was attenuated with adjustment for CVD riskfactors. Elevated concentrations of interleukin-6 have been noted in a community-based sample of older participants with a low ABI [28] , a nding similar to our study. Furthermore, interleukin-6 was pre-dictive of PAD progression dened by declining ABI over 12 yearsof follow-up even after adjusting for traditional risk factors Moreover, interleukin-6 was the only inflammatory marker independently associated with ABI declinein persons free of baseline PAD. The independent predictive valueof interleukin-6 in relation to PAD progression may reflect itsrole in both inflammatory and hemostatic processes. Additionally,interleukin-6 predicts the development of type II diabetes [29] and hypertension [30] , both signicant predictors of PAD. Finally, interleukin-6 predicts risk for incident CVD events [5]and persons with coronary disease have nearly a threefold risk of intermit-tent claudication. Hence, the association between interleukin-6and PAD is likely mediated through a variety of complex inter-related biologic pathways and appears to extend to early peripheralatherosclerosis, atherosclerosis progression, and incident symp-tomatic disease. 4.3. TNFR2 and PAD Tumor necrosis factor alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that affects vascular tissues including endothelial cells. Tumornecrosis factor alpha exerts its biologic effects through two cellsurface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. However, the role of TNFR2in the regulation of inflammatory responses in endothelial cellsis unclear. In mice, the proatherogenic effect of tumor necrosisfactor alpha was mediated primarily [31] . Fur- in mice tumor necrosisfactor alpha induced leukocyte-endothelial-cell interaction whichmediates several important steps of the inflammatory responseincluding leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and transmigration [32] of enzyme in extracellu-lar matrix maturation. TNFR2 has been shown to be involved in lysyl oxidase down-regulation, which in turn is associated with endothe-lial dysfunction [33] . To our knowledge there is only one small study of patients with intermittent claudication and critical limbischemia demonstrating elevated tumor necrosis factor receptorconcentrations compared with controls [34] . 4.4. Other markers and PAD In the Physician's Health Study, C-reactive protein was the strongest nonlipid predictor of the development of symptomaticPAD [8]. In that report both C-reactive protein and brinogen improved risk prediction for PAD. However, the two markers werecorrelated and C-reactive protein was the stronger predictor ofrisk. The associations between C-reactive protein and brinogenand incident PAD were conrmed by the Edinburgh Artery Studyand persisted after accounting for risk factors and prevalent CVD[27] . Additional associations between C-reactive protein and ABI, PAD progression, and risk for adverse CVD events among indi-viduals with PAD have been reported [11,13,28] . However, these prior reports were limited as only a few other biomarkers wereexamined. If we considered each marker separately, both C-reactiveprotein and brinogen were associated with PAD. But in our globalmodel that considered all 12 biomarkers conjointly neither C-reactive protein nor brinogen was signicantly associated withPAD. One possible explanation may be that the effect of C-reactiveprotein and brinogen may be mediated through interleukin-6 andTNFR2. It is known that interleukin-6 up-regulates both C-reactiveprotein and brinogen and that all three biomarkers are correlated. 4.5. Strengths and limitations The strengths of the present study include the community- based sample, the simultaneous measurement of a panel ofbiomarkers, and the direct measurement of clinical factors previ-ously reported to be correlated with PAD and or the inflammatorymarkers. Several limitations merit comment. The study is cross-sectional and thus we cannot infer that the associations betweenPAD and the inflammatory markers are causal. We suspect, butcannot establish with the current study design that the relationsare bidirectional, with inflammation contributing to PAD and PADexacerbating systemic inflammation. Conversely, we note that wemay have failed to detect small to modest associations. Medi-cation usage (aspirin and lipid lowering treatments) may havealtered some inflammatory marker concentrations. Since medica-tion usage was higher in those with PAD, our results may havebeen biased toward a null result. In addition, the estimated effectsizes of the observed associations were modest; we acknowledgethat statistical signicance is not synonymous with clinical signif-icance. We acknowledge that walk test data would have enhanced514 J.M. Murabito et al. / Atherosclerosis 203 (2009) 509-514 the accuracy of a PAD diagnosis. Lastly, our sample is primarily white, limiting the ability to generalize our results to other racialand ethnic groups. 5. Conclusions In a community-based sample interleukin-6 and TNFR2 were signicantly associated with PAD accounting for established riskfactors. Their effects appear to be independent of each other sug-gesting that each marker represents a distinct biologic pathwaymediating the complex process of vascular inflammation in periph-eral atherosclerosis. Further research is needed to establish the roleof these markers in predicting incident clinical PAD events anddisease progression and to determine whether therapies targetingthese markers alter prognosis in patients with PAD.

Nader, M.D.,1Joel Tsevat, M.D., M.P.H.,2Amy C. Justice, M.D., Ph.D.,3,4 Braithwaite, M.D., M.Sc.3,4 Abstract Common symptoms associated with HIV disease and its management are often underrecognized and under- treated. A clinical decision support tool for symptom management was developed within the Veterans HealthAdministration electronic medical record (EMR), aiming at increasing provider awareness of and response tocommon HIV symptoms. Its feasibility was studied in March to May 2007 by implementing it within a weeklyHIV clinic, comparing a 4-week intervention period with a 4-week control period. Fifty-six patients and theirproviders participated in the study. Patients' perceptions of providers' awareness of their symptoms, proportionof progress notes mentioning any symptom(s) and proportion of care plans mentioning any symptom(s) weremeasured. The clinical decision support tool used portable electronic ''tablets'' to elicit symptom information at the time of check-in, ltered, and organized that information into a concise and clinically relevant EMR note available at the point of care, and facilitated clinical responses to that information. It appeared to be wellaccepted by patients and providers and did not substantially impact workflow. Although this pilot study wasnot powered to detect effectiveness, 25 (93%) patients in the intervention group reported that their providerswere very aware of their symptoms versuas 27 (75%) control patients ( p\u00bc0.07). The proportion of providers' notes listing symptoms was similar in both periods; however, there was a trend toward including a greaternumber of symptoms in intervention period progress notes. The symptom support tool seemed to be useful inclinical HIV care. The Veterans Health Administration EMR may be an effective ''laboratory'' for developing and testing decision supports. Introduction Many of the symptoms related to HIV disease, its complications, and =or its management (e.g., fatigue, pain, diarrhea, sleep disturbances) are underrecognized and therefore undertreated in many care settings.1-5Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased life ex-pectancy, it may precipitate side effects that substantiallydecrease quality of life 1and may create a barrier to the high adherence levels necessary for maximum benet.2Survey instruments that detect symptoms common in HIV carehave been developed to facilitate effective symptom man- agement6-8but those instruments have not been regularly incorporated into clinical practice. We postulated that providers underrecognize and under- treat common symptoms because of the substantial time burden required to ask about the many individual symptoms, and because of providers' lack of comfort regarding appro-priate management strategies. At the same time, we observedthat the growing sophistication of clinical decision support tools may alleviate such barriers, 9-12and that the advanced electronic medical record (EMR) system of the Veterans 1Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. 2Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio. 3General Internal Medicine,6Section of Infectious Diseases,8Section of Medical Informatics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. 4Connecticut VA Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut. 5Tibotec Therapeutics, Bridgewater, New Jersey. 7Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.AIDS PATIENT CARE and STDs Volume 23, Administration (VHA) may serve as a ''laboratory'' to test the feasibility of new types of clinical decision supports. With this in mind, we constructed an EMR-based clinical decision support tool to increase providers' awareness of andresponses to common symptoms, and tested the feasibility of incorporating our tool into routine care. Methods We sought to construct a clinical decision support tool that would elicit information about symptoms at the time of check- in for a routine clinic visit, organize that information to em- phasize what is most useful for clinical care, present thatinformation in an easy-to-use form at the point-of-care, and recommend clinical responses based on that information. We chose these design factors because they encompass a broadrange of information management necessary for clinical care. In addition, many of those design factors have been shown to help integrate computerized systems into clinical workflow. 9 Because our ultimate objective was to improve symptommanagement in HIV care, we refer to our decision support tool as the Tool to Enhance Management of Symptoms (TEMS). Because clinical guidelines suggest assessing andreinforcing adherence at each visit 13and because adherence rates may be related to the prevalence of side effects, we augmented the symptom information with a briefer queryregarding medication adherence. Clinical setting We aimed to implement our TEMS within a weekly half- day HIV clinic at our urban Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Approximately 30 patients are seen in a typical clinicsession, which is staffed by two to four attending physicians(from General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases), one physician assistant, one clinic coordinator, and several rotat- ing trainees (fellows and residents). Design of clinical decision support tool We sought to base recommended response strategies for symptoms on evidence-based guidelines when available, and to supplement those with expert opinion from our senior clinic personnel. The site principal investigator (R.B.), along with theclinic director and infectious diseases trainee, constructed re-sponse strategies based on their expert opinion, in conjunction with HIV textbooks, 14,15recent Department of Health and Human Services guidelines,13well-regarded HIV care web- sites,16-18and other sources. The informatics infrastructure underlying the TEMS was developed by a senior programmer having 14 years of experience with VHA data systems (F.L.),working in conjunction with the Chief Information Ofcer of the Connecticut VA Healthcare System ( J.E.) and the director of the Informatics Fellowship program at our institution(C.B.). The senior programmer required approximately 200 hours of programming time to implement the intervention. We describe our design aims by discussing each of the four main design factors that we sought to incorporate into TEMS:elicitation, organization, presentation, and recommendation (Fig. 1 and Appendix). Elicitation. We strove to elicit information in a manner that would minimize respondent burden, would not interruptthe clinical workflow, and would direct information transfer into the EMR without manual transcription. For those reasons, we sought to identify surveys of HIV symptoms that were validated yet comparatively brief, and could be administeredby using portable devices that could interface with the EMR. Among several HIV symptom indices that we considered as candidates for inclusion in TEMS, only 2 have been vali-dated in the ART era. 6-8We chose the 20-item HIV Symptom Index6because it has been widely used in clinical studies of HIV=AIDS, including Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) studies and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study(VACS). 19An example of an item in the index is, ''How much have you been bothered by fatigue or loss of energy?'' with possible responses, ''I do not have this symptom.'' ''I have itand it doesn't bother me.'' ''I have it and it bothers me a little.'' ''I have it and it bothers me.'' and ''I have it and it bothers me a lot.'' With the intent of minimizing additional respondent bur- den, we chose to gather information on medication adherence by using a single question, which we based on a patient ad-herence instrument developed by the Outcomes Committee of the AACTG. 20The question asks, ''When was the last time you missed one or more doses of your HIV medications?''with possible responses of ''today,'' than 1 month ago.''Elicit information on symptoms, adherence Recommend clinical responsesOrganize information, omit nonessential Present information in progress noteCheck-in Patient starts clinician visit Patient finishes clinician visit, check-outLinks to relevant clinical guidelinesFiltering logic Patient completes check-in, waits to see clinicianPatient visit pathway Information pathway FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of design factors for Tool to Enhance Management of Symptoms (TEMS). These factorsencompass a wide spectrum of information management necessary for clinical care, and are synchronized with the workflow of a typical clinic visit. Information is elicited at thesame time that vital signs are measured, and the computer-generated progress note can be viewed at the same time that other patient information is used for decision making.522 NADER ET AL. Organization. We strove to organize the information to deemphasize any that was not clinically important or ac- tionable, as evidence suggests that providers often ignore clinical decision support information that is insufcientlyspecic. 12We sought to use two distinct ''lters'' on the survey information, the rst excluding information pertaining to symptoms that were not sufciently bothersome to prioritize,and the second limiting the detail of information when a pa- tient appeared to endorse a great number of unrelated symptoms simultaneously (such patients would be unlikelyto respond to any 1 or 2 interventions to alleviate symptoms,and may have a more global problem such as depression). Presentation. We strove to ensure that symptom infor- mation was presented through an interface that was simple and clear and had the capacity to be linked to response strategies. For that reason, we collected the symptom infor-mation on a ''tablet'' thin-client computer and aimed to present the information within an EMR progress note that could be accessed during the patient encounter. We aimed toconstruct flexible templates for notes (i.e., notes that couldhave alternative structures depending upon the level of in- formation detail), so that notes could generally remain as brief as possible yet ''telescope'' into longer notes when it was es-sential to communicate additional information. Recommendation. We sought to provide clinical recom- mendations by developing an interface that would anticipate clinicians' information needs and address them rapidly, in real time. 12Our goals were (1) to t into the user's workflow12 (e.g., allowing the clinician to place an order to address the symptom while viewing the note that alerted her to that symptom); (2) to minimize medical knowledge barriers (e.g.,permitting the clinician to retrieve the preferred approach foraddressing a symptom in case she does not already know it); and (3) to minimize institution-specic knowledge barriers (e.g., allowing the clinician to learn how a particular drug orlaboratory test is listed in the EMR order menu in case she does not already know it). Consequently, we sought to embed hyperlinks in the note to clinical and diagnostic algorithms,experts' recommendations, and relevant orders (including medications, tests, and consultations). Study design Four clinic sessions comprised the control phase, and were followed by four clinic sessions comprising the interventionphase. During the control phase (March 2007), TEMS was not activated and therefore participants did not complete the HIV symptom survey. During the intervention phase (mid-Aprilthrough mid-May 2007), TEMS was activated, and all par- ticipants were asked to complete the HIV symptom survey. Therefore, only in the intervention phase did providers re-ceive the computer-generated progress notes and have access to the other functionalities of TEMS. In both the control phase and the intervention phase, all participants received a one-item postvisit survey in which they were queried about theirperception of their providers' level of awareness about their symptoms. The item asked, ''How aware of your symptoms do you think your health care provider was?'' with possibleresponses, ''not 21,22To maximize the generalizability of the study, we did not impose any inclusion criteria other than having a clinic ap- pointment during the period of the study (March 2007-May 2007), having HIV infection, and providing informed consent.Patients were excluded only if they were making their rst visit to the clinic because a thorough symptom review would likely be performed as part of routine care at initial visits. Eachindividual could participate in each phase of the study no more than once (i.e., a patient could participate once in both phases of the study, but could not participate in either phasetwice); however, we did not require that patients who par-ticipated in one phase also participate in the other phase. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Connecticut VA Healthcare System and the Human In-vestigations Committee at Yale University. The sponsor did not have any role in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; in the decision to submit study results for publication;or in the drafting or revision of the manuscript. Outcomes In a subset of participants, we assessed the acceptability of the system and the information provided to physicians byhaving a cognitive engineer (M.R.) review the entire process. By using a human factors approach, the cognitive engineer analyzed barriers to: (1) entering symptoms into the tabletpersonal computer; (2) transferring the symptoms electroni- cally into the VHA EMR; and (3) having providers act on the symptom information. In addition, the study coordinator(K.M.) independently noted which barriers seemed to be most prevalent for participants. Because this was a pilot study and its primary outcome was to assess the feasibility of TEMS, the study was not poweredto detect clinically signicant changes in the effectiveness of symptom recognition and =or management. However, this study did incorporate two prospectively dened effective-ness measures as secondary outcomes. First, we evaluated responses on the postvisit survey, comparing the proportion of intervention versus control participants who thought thattheir providers were ''very aware'' of their symptoms by using thew 2test for proportions. Second, we performed chart re- views to assess the proportion of progress notes that includedat least one symptom addressed by TEMS. The reviews were completed in a blinded fashion and in duplicate (C.N. and S.F.); the agreement between the blinded reviewers was high(kscore\u00bc0.862 for having at least one symptom mentioned in progress note; kscore\u00bc1.00 for having at least 1 symptom mentioned in the treatment plan). Because only a minority (N\u00bc8) of patients participated in both the control and inter- vention phases and therefore could serve as their own control, each progress note during the intervention period was com- pared with the most recent progress note that preceded theintervention period, even if it pertained to a visit prior to the control phase. Results Of 60 clinic patients invited to participate, 56 (93%) agreed to participate, and 55 (98%) completed all parts of the study (1 patient left before completing the postvisit survey). Eight patients (14%) participated in both the intervention and con-trol phases, 28 patients (50%) participated in the control phase only, and 20 patients (36%) participated in the interventionDECISION SUPPORT TO IMPROVE HIV SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT 523 phase only (Table 1). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the patients was 54.4 (9.5); 40 (73%) were minorities and 33(59%) had hepatitis C coinfection. Approximately two thirds had plasma HIV RNA levels below 400 copies per milliliter, and the median CD4 count was approximately 400 cells permilliliter. Most (79%) reported last missing a dose of anti- retroviral medications more than 1 month ago, but a sub- stantial minority (21%) reported more recent nonadherence(4% within the last week to month, 14% within the last day to week, and 4% on the day of the survey). Feasibility The vast majority of patients required fewer than 5 minutes to complete the survey, and none required more than 10 minutes.

Based on observations made by the cog- nitive engineer, the most common reasons for needing assis-tance were inability to read the text because of small font;difculty handling the stylus because of arthritis or other dexterity impairments; or difculty understanding particular words (for example, asking what a ''provider'' was). Thosefactors were also independently endorsed as particularly important by our study coordinator. Although all patients completed the symptom survey, some patients were con-cerned about the condentiality of their information, and others were concerned about its usefulness (''doctors never check the computer anyway''). Additionally, one patient witha supercial skin infection was concerned that the tablet and stylus may serve as a vector for communicable disease. While this pilot study did not include quantitative end points for provider feasibility, the cognitive engineer qualita-tively assessed provider feasibility by reviewing the electronic medical records and meeting with the providers individually at the end of the study period. She noted that most of thephysicians acted upon the new information in the computer- generated progress note (e.g., some physicians copied and pasted the information from the symptom index-generatednote into their own progress note) and that the workflow was only slightly affected. Patients seemed to be very comfortable using TEMS to endorse symptoms. Twelve of the 20 symptoms queried wereendorsed by most participants (Table 2). However, because TEMS used ''bothersome'' as the minimum severity thresholdfor inclusion in the computer-generated progress note, most endorsed symptoms were not included in the notes. Indeed, participants were able to use the tool to discriminate among varying severities of symptoms; only 1 symptom ( ''pain, numbness, or tingling in hands or feet'') was rated as ''both- ersome'' by most participants. Effectiveness In the intervention phase, 25 (93%) participants thought that their clinicians were ''very aware'' of their symptoms, whereas during the control phase, only 27 (75%) participants thought their clinicians were very aware ( p\u00bc0.07; Table 3). Additionally, although the proportion of providers' notes listing symptoms was identical in the control and intervention phases (Table 4), there was a trend toward including a greaternumber of symptoms in intervention phase progress notes (mean [SD] number of symptoms mentioned in the progress note but not in the problem list: 3.6 [3.2] in the interventionphase versus 2.7 [2.3] in control phase, p\u00bc0.07; mean [SD] number of symptoms mentioned in the problem list: 1.9 [1.5] in the intervention phase versus 1.6 [1.3] in control phase,p\u00bc0.22). Discussion We have developed a clinical decision support tool (TEMS) that focuses on symptom management in HIV care. TEMSencompasses a wide breadth of information management in clinical care, from eliciting information through recomm- ending clinical approaches to that information. Its design isparticularly noteworthy because it processes and lters eli- cited information in order to emphasize that which is most clinically relevant, and therefore minimizes additional timeburden on clinicians. In that respect, TEMS is innovative be-cause informatics interventions generally do not place a great emphasis on minimizing demands on clinicians' time and attention, and therefore are at risk of inducing ''alert fatigue''and subsequent reductions in effectiveness. Our pilot study suggests that TEMS was accepted by cli- nicians and did not substantially impede workflow, andtherefore it was successful in this initial feasibility test. We have learned that TEMS acceptance by patients could be im- proved by increasing font size, increasing stylus size, simpli-fying language, reassuring patients about condentiality, andcleaning the keyboard =stylus with disinfectant in between uses. Nevertheless, available resources did not allow us to assess many important aspects of its feasibility.

Additionally, the favorable trends that were observed regarding effectiveness (i.e., perception of providers' symptom awareness) need to be conrmed in fu-ture studies having greater statistical power.There are many possible ways to use clinical decision support systems to individualize care in the VHA, as EMR information may be combined with self-reported patient in- formation in a wide range of domains (i.e., preferences,symptoms, behaviors, clinical data), and the resulting infor- mation may be used to tailor clinical strategies for individual patients (Fig. 2A). For example, an expanded version of TEMScould be developed with the aim of improving adherence to ART (Fig. 2B) by combining pharmacy rell data with symptom survey data to identify patients with probable ad-herence difculties, and to individualize approaches to im-prove adherence based on relevant behavioral risk factors, for example, depression, 2,23,24alcohol abuse,25-28or other sub- stance abuse.29-32 TEMS has important limitations, some of which were not anticipated during its design. Even though it uses portable electronic tablets that have the capacity to transmit informa-tion wirelessly, evolving VA security standards have forced us to use hardwired network connections, thereby removing some of the tablet's flexibility. We envisioned a wide networkof hyperlinks to help clinicians respond to symptom infor-mation, but constructing those links was not possible within the time and budgetary constraints of this pilot project. More generally, clinical decision support tools require regular up-dates of clinical knowledge and technical support in order to impact care in a sustainable manner. 10-12Nonetheless, we have accomplished our main objectives and have designed aclinical decision support tool having a structure that can be generalized to other diseases and clinical management ques- tions. Because informatics expertise and EMRs are becomingincreasingly sophisticated, we may be entering a promising era for clinical decision support tools that aim to individualize care.

Detailed Description of Incorporating Design Factors into TEMS This appendix discusses in more detail how we incorporated each of the four main design factors into TEMS: elicitation, organization,presentation, and recommendation. Elicitation TEMS collects portable electronic ''tablet'' (Pa- nasonic model CF-08) that enables respondents to answer questions by using a hand-held stylus similar to a pen, or alternatively bytouching the screen with a nger. After a patient has his or her vitalsigns measured, the medical assistant registers the patient in the tablet-based survey application and remains with the patient in order to help with any technical difculties that may arise as the patient usesthe tablet. The tablet queries patients about their symptoms by using the 20-question HIV Symptom Index. Because the HIV Symptom Index does not t onto 1 screen, patients must proceed through5 screens in order to answer all questions. The implementation wasprogrammed so that respondents are not able to ''skip'' a question. We developed TEMS in conjunction with the clinicians who would implement it, and strove to incorporate their suggestions. Cliniciansthought that the usefulness of symptom information would be greatlyenhanced if the duration of each symptom could be reported, along with patients' judgment about whether that symptom was due to a medication side effect. For that reason, we augmented the HIVSymptom Index by asking additional questions regarding duration ofsymptoms (''How long has this symptom bothered you?'' with pos- sible responses of ''less than 1 week,'' ''between 1 week and 1 month,'' ''between 1 month and 1 year,'' and ''longer than 1 year'') and attri-butability of symptoms to medications using the 1-question item adapted from the AACTG questionnaire (''Do you think that this symptom is caused by drugs that you take to treat your HIV infec-tion?'' with possible responses of ''yes,'' ''unsure,'' and ''no''). Also, inresponse to ideas from providers, we ensured that each patient's vital signs would be included with the symptom information. To avoid errors that might result from manual entry, TEMS extracts vital signinformation automatically from the electronic medical record (EMR). We had hoped to use the wireless capacities of the tablet to transmit symptom information into the EMR in order to minimize staff burden (i.e., they would have the flexibility to elicit symptom information at avariety of places and times). However, shortly before beta-testing TEMS, the VHA issued an embargo of wireless data-encoding algo- rithms. Therefore, we beta-tested TEMS by using a wired connectionto transmit the data, and will try wireless transmission pending theapproval of a VHA-compliant data-coding algorithm. Organization We maximized the specicity of information to be presented to the provider by using two distinct information lters, each of which re-duces the level of information detail when that information is unlikely to lead to an effective clinical response. The rst lter excludes symptom information when a symptom is sufciently minor so that itis unlikely to warrant a clinical response (i.e., if the symptom is notbothersome or very bothersome). The second lter reduces the detail of symptom information when a patient endorses multiple unrelated symptoms, because clinical approaches directed at the varioussymptoms themselves may be less effective than clinical approachesgeared to a latent underlying condition (e.g., depression). Thus, we dened a speciable ''threshold'' for the number of symptoms: if a patient endorsed more than the threshold number of symptoms, thenthe note informed the provider about which symptoms were en-dorsed but did not include duration and attributability; if a patient endorsed the threshold number of symptoms or fewer, then the note included the full detail of symptom duration and attributability. Wehave currently set the threshold at three symptoms, but we have not yet determined the optimal threshold value. Presentation TEMS generates progress notes by using one of two templates (Fig. 1). If a patient endorses a number of symptoms that falls below the numerical threshold, then the note gives full detail about each symptom. Appendix Figure 1A shows the note that was generated fora patient who endorsed two symptoms (headache, which has lasted less than 1 week, with the patient being unsure of its relationship to medications; and loss of appetite, which has lasted for 1 week to 1month, attributed by the patient to his HIV medications). However, ifa patient endorses a number of symptoms that exceeds the specied threshold, then the note limits the level of detail. Appendix Figure 1B shows the note that was generated when a patient endorsed 13 sep-arate symptoms. Although the patient reported severity and symp-tom attribution, that information is not represented in the note. Both note formats contain the result of the one-item adherence query and the vital signs. In our original concept of the tool, we had planned for physicians to see a ''pop-up'' alert on their computer screen when the computer- generated progress note was created (we thought that this would be desirable because many physicians review the patient record beforepatients enter the examination room). However, the pop-up pre- sented an unforeseen programming burden because of technical fea- tures of the VHA's EMR architecture, and therefore we had tosubstitute a low-tech approach in which patients carried a brightyellow ''alert'' card into their examination room, serving as a prompt for the physician to look at the results of the symptom index. Recommendation Each symptom in each progress note is linked to a le that rec- ommends a corresponding clinical response strategy (Fig. 2), eitherdiagnostic considerations or symptom treatments. Because diagnosticconsiderations are often distinct for individuals with HIV, TEMS emphasizes those considerations that are particularly applicable to individuals with HIV infection. Additionally, because HIV-infectedindividuals who are severely immunosuppressed have particular diagnostic considerations (i.e., opportunistic infections, etc.), TEMS straties strategies by CD4 count when indicated ( <200 cells per milliliter versus /C21200 cells per milliliter). When diagnoses would be facilitated by using another screening instrument (e.g., the Alcohol Use Disorders Identication Test to screen for hazardous alcohol consumption), that instrument along with its scoring algorithm isincluded in the response strategy. To mitigate barriers to provider adherence, each recommendation is expressed by using the terminology and care options particular to our institution (e.g., rather than recommending ''refer for alcoholtreatment,'' TEMS will recommend ''Substance Abuse Clinic con- sult''), and we designed our therapeutic strategies to include only generic drugs that were on formulary. The full text of all responsestrategies is available at www.vacohort.org. We had intended to link each symptom in the computer-generated progress note to its response strategy by means of a hyper-link, but technical barriers discouraged such an approach. As an alternative, weplaced a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) next to each symptom sothat the URL could be copied and pasted into a Microsoft Word doc- ument and ''pointed'' to a document that contains the corresponding response strategy. Similarly, we intended to embed in each responsestrategy hyper-links to relevant orders, but that also proved to beprohibitively burdensome. As an alternative, we carefully edited each response strategy to ensure concordance between an order's speci- cation in our response strategy and its representation in the EMR.528 NADER ET AL. Author's personal copy Driving After Binge Drinking Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH, David E. Nelson, MD, MPH, Robert D. Brewer, MD, MSPH Background: Although binge drinking is strongly associated with alcohol-impaired driving, little is known about the prevalence of or risk factors for driving after binge drinking. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and risk factors for, driving during or shortly after a specic binge drinking episode. Methods: The data were analyzed in 2007 and 2008 from 14,085 adults from 13 states in 2003 and 14 states in 2004 who reported binge drinking and answered an additional series of questions about binge drinking behaviors as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Binge drinking was dened as the consumption of ve or more drinks during a drinking occasion. Results: Overall, 11.9% of binge drinkers drove during or within 2 hours of their most recent binge drinking episode. Those drinking in licensed establishments (bars, clubs, and restaurants) accounted for 54.3% of these driving episodes. Signicant independent risk factors for driving after binge drinking included male gender (AOR /H110051.75); being aged 35-54 or /H1135055 years compared to 18-34 years (AOR/H110051.58 and 2.37, respectively); and drinking in bars or clubs compared to drinking in the respondent's home (AOR/H110057.81). Drivers who drank most of their alcohol in licensed establishments consumed an average of 8.1 drinks, and 25.7% of them consumed /H1135010 drinks. Conclusions: Because binge drinking and subsequent driving were common in establishments licensed to sell alcohol, and because licensing is conditional on responsible beverage service practices (i.e., not selling to intoxicated people), efforts to prevent impaired driving should focus on enforcing responsible beverage service in licensed establishments. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(4):314-320) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Excessive drinking is the third leading actual cause of death in the U.S.,1is responsible for approximately 79,000 deaths annually, and shortens the lives of those who die by approximately 30 years.2,3Binge drinking, dened as the consumption of ve or more drinks on an occasion, is responsible for more than half of these deaths3and contributed to the 13,000 deaths from alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes in 2006.4In the U.S., approximately 15% of all adults report one or more episodes of binge drinking in the past month, resulting in 1.5 billion binge drinking episodes annually (or approximately seven episodes per adult per year).5Survey research has shown that binge drinking is strongly associated with alcohol-impaired driving. For example, a recently published study found that 88% of self-reported episodes of alcohol-impaireddriving involved adults who reported past-month binge drinking.6Another study found that 12% of binge drinkers report that they drove after having \"perhaps too much to drink\" in the past month, although the amount of alcohol consumed was not quantied.7In addition, the increase in binge drinking episodes ob- served among U.S. adults from 1993 to 20015paralleled a similar increase in alcohol-impaired driving episodes during this time period.7 However, little is known about the likelihood of, or risk factors for, driving after a specic binge drinking episode. Although most impaired-driving countermeasures focus on reducing driving among individuals who are already impaired, little attention has been focused on the role played by demographic or environmental factors that may be risk factors for this impairment and/or propensity to drive. It was hypothesized that establishments licensed to sell alcohol were the site of a large proportion of binge drinking and subsequent driving episodes, but it was not clear whether that association was mostly accounted for by the characteristics of those consuming alcohol in licensed establishments. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and risk factors for, driving during or shortly after a specic binge drinking episode.From the Alcohol Team, Emerging Investigations and Analytic Meth- ods Branch, Division of Adult and Community Health, National Centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Timothy S.

The survey includes questions on a variety of health risk behaviors, including alcohol consump- tion. Details about the BRFSS are available at http://www. cdc.gov/brfss/technical_infodata/index.htm . A binge drinker was dened as someone who consumed alcohol in the past 30 days and who gave a nonzero response to the following question: Considering all types of alcoholic beverages, how many times during the past 30 days did you have 5 or more drinks on an occasion? In 2003 and 2004, the BRFSS survey offered states a new, optional module of six additional questions to be asked of those who reported binge drinking; all questions were about a respondent's most recent binge drinking episode. Driving after binge drinking was assessed by the question: Did you drive a motor vehicle, such as a car, truck, or motorcycle during or within a couple of hours after this occasion? A yes answer to this question was the numerator for determin- ing the prevalence of driving after binge drinking. Because each respondent was providing information about a single binge drinking event, prevalence information was combined with the number of binge drinkers in particular strata to determine the number of episodes of driving after binge drinking. Other questions in the module elicited information about the number and type of alcohol-containing beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) consumed during their most recent binge drinking episode and the physical location where most binge drinks were consumed. Analyses were limited to the 18 states that used this set of binge drinking questions in both 2003 and 2004 (nine states); 2003 only (four states); or 2004 only (ve states). States using the module in both years were California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming; states using it in 2003 only were Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota; and states using the module in 2004 only were Delaware, Idaho, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Virginia. The median response rate to the BRFSS survey among these states across both years was 55.0% and included 121,172 respondents, including 16,496 people who reported one or more episodes of binge drinking in the past month. The weighted prevalence of binge drinking among respondents in the states and years included in the study was 16.3%, which is approximately 1% higher than that for the U.S. during 2003-2004. The weighted prevalence of driving after binge drinking was very similar in 2003 (11.9%) and 2004 (11.6%). The study was restricted to those who reported one or more episodes of binge drinking in the past 30 days. Data were weighted by age, gender, and race or ethnicity to be repre- sentative of the adult population for each state and year analyzed; weights were divided by 2 for states with 2 years of data. After excluding binge drinkers with missing or incom- plete information from the binge drinking module, data from 14,085 respondents were analyzed, including 1848 respon- dents who reported driving during or within 2 hours of binge drinking. All data analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.0, and SUDAAN, version 9.0. Analyses were conducted for threetypes of variables: demographics, alcohol-specic measures, and binge drinking location. Demographic characteristics included age group (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, /H1135055 years), which was collapsed into three groups (18-34, 35-54, and /H1135055 years) for regression analysis based on strata size and similarity with respect to driving characteristics; gender; race or ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; other, non-Hispanic; and Hispanic), which was collapsed to white non-Hispanic versus other for regression analysis; education level (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, and college graduate), which was collapsed to some college or more versus high school graduate or less for regression analysis; income level (/H11021 $25,000, $25,000-$49,999, and /H11350$50,000), which was collapsed to /H11350$50,000 versus /H11349$49,000 for regression analysis; marital status (married, never married, unmarried couple, divorced, or separated), which was collapsed to married versus nonmarried for regression analysis; and employment status (employed, unemployed, student, homemaker, or re- tired), which was collapsed to employed versus nonemployed for regression analysis. Alcohol stratication variables included the number of binge episodes during the past 30 days (one to two, three to four, and ve or more), which was collapsed to one to two versus three or more for regression analysis; and the total number of drinks consumed during the last binge episode (ve to six, seven to nine, and ten or more), which was collapsed to ve to six versus seven or more for regression analysis. The physical location where most of the drinks were consumed (own home, another person's home, bar or club, restaurant, other public place, or other) was also analyzed. Results Overall, 75.1% of binge drinkers were men, 75.1% were aged/H1134944 years, 49.7% consumed seven or more drinks during their most recent binge drinking episode, and 58.3% drank in a private residence (their home or someone else's home; Table 1). After weighting, 11.9% of binge drinkers reported driving during or within 2 hours of their most recent binge drinking episode (Table 1). Men were more likely than women to drive after binge drinking (13.2% vs 8.1%), and men accounted for 82.9% of all recent binge drinking and driving episodes. The prevalence of driving after binge drinking increased slightly with age; 50.6% of binge drinking and driving episodes involved those aged /H1135035 years. Among underage adults aged 18-20 years, 10.3% drove after binge drinking and they accounted for 6.3% of driving episodes (data not shown inTable 1). More than 90% of most recent binge drinking and driving episodes were accounted for by high school graduates or those with at least some college education, and 78.6% of driving episodes were reported by binge drinkers who were employed. Al- though those who reported ve or more binge drinking episodes in the past 30 days were more likely to drive after their most recent binge episode than those who reported binge drinking once or twice, approximately half (48.7%) of driving episodes involved those who reported binge drinking only once or twice in the past October 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(4) 315Author's personal copy Table 1.

Similarly, although those who consumed more drinks per binge (seven or more drinks) were nonsig- nicantly more likely to report driving after their most recent binge episode, almost half of driving episodes involved those who consumed ve to six drinks. The prevalence of driving after binge drinking varied con- siderably based on drinking location, ranging from 4.0% for those who reported binge drinking at home to 20.8% of those who drank in bars or clubs. Those who reported binge drinking in bars or clubs accounted for 44.2% of driving episodes; licensed establishments (bars, clubs, and restaurants) accounted for more than half (54.3%) of all driving episodes. Binge drinkers who drank most of their alcohol in licensed establishments (bars, clubs, and restau- rants) and who subsequently drove consumed an aver- age of 8.1 (95% CI/H110057.45, 8.65) drinks; 53.5% con- sumed seven or more drinks; and 25.7% consumed ten or more drinks. Among binge drinkers who drove, agreater proportion of those drinking in bars or clubs consumed ten or more drinks compared with those drinking in restaurants (28.7% vs 13.6%, data not shown). In stratied analysis, differences observed in the prevalence of driving based on the location of binge drinking were generally consistent across various demo- graphic characteristics, the frequency of binge drink- ing, and the number of drinks consumed during the binge drinking episode (Table 2). Specically, driving after binge drinking at home was reported by /H113496% of all subgroups. In contrast, driving after binge drinking in bars or clubs was reported by more than 20% of those in most subgroups. The prevalence of driving after binge drinking in bars increased signicantly with age, ranging from 17.0% among those aged 18-34 years to 36.7% among those aged /H1135055 years. However, the prevalence of driving after binge drinking in bars or clubs did not differ substantially when evaluated by Table 2.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, signi- cantly increased odds of driving after binge drinking were observed for men compared with women, those aged/H1135035 years compared to younger adults, unmar- ried people compared to married people, those report- ing three or more compared to one or two binge drinking episodes in the past 30 days, and those drink- ing outside of their own home (Table 3). Compared to those binge drinking in their own home, the AOR for driving after binge drinking in bars or clubs was 7.81 and 5.90 for drinking in restaurants. The AOR of driving for people binge drinking in any licensed establishment (bars or clubs and restaurants) was also signicantly increased (AOR 3.4, 95% CI/H11005 2.7, 4.4) compared with driving after drinking in any private residence (a respon- dents' home or someone else's home). Race/ethnicity, education, income, and the number of binge drinks consumed were not signicantly associated with subse- quent driving. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the rst U.S. study to examine the likelihood of driving following a specic binge drinking event, and the rst to assess personal and contextual risk factors (e.g., location of alcohol con- sumption) affecting these associations. Overall, almost one in eight binge drinkers drove during or within 2 hours of their most recent binge drinking episode. Of these people, more than half consumed most of their alcohol in establishments licensed to sell alcohol. Bars and clubs accounted for 43% of binge drinking and driving episodes; 25% of those who drove after binge drinking in any establishment licensed to sell alcohol (bars, clubs, and restaurants) consumed ten or more drinks. These ndings emphasize the need to imple- ment effective measures to reduce binge drinking, including the implementation of policies to prevent overservice in licensed establishments where selling alcohol to intoxicated people is generally illegal.8 Although a strength of this study was that it estab- lished a temporal relationship between binge drinking and subsequent driving, the current ndings are con- sistent with the strong cross-sectional relationship be- tween binge drinking and impaired driving that has been described in previous studies.6,7A population- based study of California drinkers observed that driving while intoxicated was influenced by age, gender, indi- vidual drinking patterns, increased alcohol outlet den- sity, and drinking in bars and restaurants.9The impor- tance of drinking location and subsequent impaired driving was further illustrated by a New Mexico study of 5000 people convicted of driving-while-intoxicated (DWI), in which 45% of those convicted were drink- ing in bars or lounges prior to their arrest.10Anotherstudy of 16,000 DWI arrestees in Ventura County CA found that 44% had consumed their last drink in a bar, club, or restaurant and that those drinking in these establishments had signicantly higher bloodTable 3.

While those in relatively younger age groups accounted for most binge drinking and driving episodes, the AOR of driving after a single binge drinking episode was progressively higher among those in older age groups. This nding may represent a cohort effect, as younger people have grown up in an era of enhanced awareness of, and social stigma associ- ated with, impaired driving. It is also possible that a higher proportion of older binge drinkers were alcohol dependent, but alcohol dependence could not be assessed using this data source. Finally, drinking more drinks was not associated with a higher likelihood of driving. It is possible that a progressive loss of judgment after consuming more drinks was counteracted by a greater awareness of impairment, because the sensation of impairment is generally attained at or above the number of drinks used to dene binge drinking.21It is also possible that those drinking more drinks were less likely to report subsequent driving. This study is subject to several limitations. First, data were from self-report, and survey respondents may under-report how much they drink and whether they engage in impaired driving. Therefore, the number of drinks reported by respondents was likely conservative, as was the proportion of those who reported driving after binge drinking. Similarly, the median response rate among states included in this study was 55%, and nonrespondents may be more likely to binge drink and engage in impaired driving, although it is unclear how the proportion of binge drinkers who drive would vary be- tween respondents and nonrespondents. Second, this study assessed the location where most drinks were con- sumed, and some binge drinkers may have consumed alcohol at more than one location. Third, the study did not include information about all U.S. states, and therefore may not be representative of the U.S. as a whole. And fourth, the BRFSS used a ve-drink thresh- old to dene binge drinking among women; the Na- tional Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism rec- ommends using a four-drink threshold, and BRFSS survey adopted this threshold in 2006. It is unknown what proportion of women drinking exactly four drinks subsequently drove a motor vehicle, but it is likely thatthe women would have accounted for a somewhat larger proportion of binge drinking and driving epi- sodes had the four-drink threshold been used. It was not possible to determine whether all people who reported driving during or within 2 hours of a binge drinking episode were legally intoxicated. How- ever, consuming ve drinks for men or four drinks for women at a typical rate (i.e., within 2 hours) results in blood alcohol concentrations of 0.08 mg/dL, the legal limit for dening alcohol-impaired driving in all states in the U.S.22Further, half of drivers in this study consumed seven or more drinks during their most recent binge episode, suggesting that many of these people may have had blood alcohol concentrations well in excess of 0.08 mg/dL. And nally, it should be noted that the risk of a motor vehicle crash increases at blood alcohol concentrations in excess of 0.03 mg/dL.23 Given the frequency with which binge drinkers sub- sequently drive a motor vehicle, population-based strat- egies to reduce both binge drinking and impaired driving are required to reduce alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. Such strategies are the cornerstone of prevention, because there are few targeted interven- tions available to address the likelihood of excessive drinking or subsequent driving among high-risk demo- graphic groups (e.g., men). Effective population-based strategies to reduce binge drinking include increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting alcohol outlet density and hours of sale, enhanced enforcement of the age-21 min- imum legal drinking age, and limiting days of alcohol sales.24-26Effective strategies to prevent alcohol-impaired driving include implementation of the age-21 minimum legal drinking age, 0.08 laws, sobriety checkpoints, lower blood alcohol concentration laws for young and inexpe- rienced drivers, immediate driver's license revocation for those arrested for driving while intoxicated, sobriety checkpoints, server training programs, mass media cam- paigns intended to reduce impaired driving, ignition interlocks, multi-component interven- tions with community mobilization, and school-based instructional programs.27 Because driving after binge drinking in licensed establishments accounted for more than half of such episodes, implementing and strengthening existing in- terventions to prevent on-premise binge drinking in retail alcohol outlets are warranted.28Effective inter- ventions to improve responsible beverage service in- clude limits on drink discounting, \"dram shop\" liability laws, mandatory server training programs, and en- hanced enforcement of laws prohibiting sales to intox- icated patrons.27,29,30However, a number of states lack liability laws or mandatory server training laws for establishments serving alcohol; most states lack ade- quate numbers of alcoholic beverage control ofcers; and laws preventing sales to minors or intoxicated people are enforced only sporadically.31Further, some states have laws that prevent cities or counties from adopting October 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;37(4) 319Author's personal copy more stringent alcohol-control policies than those that exist at the state level. Strengthening these laws and ensuring their enforcement could help reduce alcohol overservice and create an environment that supports responsible beverage service by not placing law-abiding retailers at an economic disadvantage.

Nelson, MD, MPH, Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH, Robert D. Brewer, MD, MSPH, Hayley A. Nelson Background: Underage drinking, particularly binge drinking, is an important public health problem that results in substantial premature mortality and morbidity. Little is known about thepotential influence of the alcohol-use behaviors of adults on youth alcohol use at apopulation level. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of alcohol-usebehaviors among youth with those of adults at a population level. Methods: Data were analyzed in 2007 and 2008, using biennial 1993-2005 data from state school-based Youth Risk Behavior Surveys of students in grades 9-12, and from the BehavioralRisk Factor Surveillance System for adults aged /H1135018 years. Pearson correlation coefcients (r) were used to compare state prevalence estimates for youth with those of adults forseveral alcohol-use measures. Results: Overall and subgroup-specic state youth estimates of current drinking and binge drinkingwere generally moderately to strongly correlated with adult alcohol use (range of r-values for pooled estimates across all years: 0.35-0.68 for current drinking [ p/H110210.01 for all correlations]; 0.24-0.60 for binge drinking [ p/H110210.01 for all correlations ]) and with youth and adult drinking-and-driving behaviors (range of r-values for pooled estimates: 0.12- 0.52, p/H110210.01 for all but one correlation). Correlation coefcients were generally higher for girls with women and for youth with younger adults aged 18-34 years. The use of alcoholby youth before they were aged 13 years was not correlated with adult alcohol-use measures,and most youth alcohol-use measures were not correlated with adult heavy-alcohol use. Conclusions: Most state youth alcohol-use estimates were correlated with state adult estimates. Thesendings have implications for underage-drinking control strategies and suggest that effortsto address this problem need to be targeted on a broader societal level. (Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3):218-224) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Excessive alcohol use is the third leading prevent- able cause of death in the U.S.1It accounts for an average of approximately 79,000 deaths an- nually as well as substantial health morbidity and broader societal adverse consequences, such as vio-lence, unintended pregnancy, and lost productivity. 2-5 Binge drinking, which is generally dened as the consumption of /H113505 drinks in a row on a single occa- sion,6is a hazardous drinking pattern and is especially common among adolescents.5,7-13As with many health risk behaviors, alcohol use usually begins in adoles-cence. 4,5,9,14In addition to the health risks posed by alcohol use during adolescence itself (e.g., motor-vehicle crashes), the early onset of alcohol use is associated with a substantially greater risk of alcoholmisuse during adulthood. 9,14 A substantial research literature exists on the factors associated with youth alcohol use, including genetics,demographics, psychological characteristics, and familyand peer influences. Previous studies 4,5,15have demon- strated a strong connection between youth and adultdrinking at the household and the community levels.Somewhat surprisingly, little population-based researchhas been conducted on the relationship between youthand adult drinking at the state level. 8,16 Assessing this relationship is important because young people may model their drinking patterns after adults beyond those living within their own households;in addition, youth alcohol use occurs within a broadersocietal context shaped by adults. 8,14,17-19A need for a better understanding of the potential relationship be-tween youth and adult drinking behavior on a popula-tion basis has practical implications, such as whetherefforts to reduce underage drinking should be targetedto youth alone or to youth and adults more broadly. 14From the Alcohol Team, Emerging Investigations and Analytic Meth- ods Branch, Division of Adult and Community Health, NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC(Nelson DE, Naimi, Brewer), Atlanta; and the University of Georgia(Nelson HA), Athens, Georgia Address correspondence and reprint requests to: David E.

Becausealcohol use among youth may be influenced more byyounger-aged adults, 20estimates for youth were com- pared to estimates for adults aged 18-34 years (youngeradults) and adults aged /H1135035 years (middle-aged and older adults). Estimates for boys were compared tothose of men, and estimates for girls to those of women. Methods Youth Data Youth alcohol-use prevalence estimates for the years 1993- 2005 came from data tables published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Surveillance Summaries from biennially conducted state YRBSs7,21-26; details are available elsewhere.27Briefly, states use the YRBS to anony- mously collect data on health risk factors from students ingrades 9-12. Students complete a self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire during a regular class period. Partici- pation is anonymous and voluntary. Local parental-permissionprocedures are followed before survey administration. Most states employ a two-stage cluster-sample design to produce representative samples of students in public schools.The total number of states with published data in the MMWRSurveillance Summaries ranged from 29 to 40. Median statesample sizes ranged from 1619 to 2760, and median stateresponse rates ranged from 61% to 67.5%. Data from stateswith a representative sample of students, appropriate docu-mentation, and an overall response rate of /H1135060% were weighted to be representative of all students attending publicschools in grades 9-12. Of all the states included in this study,only about two thirds had weighted data; unweighted data arerepresentative of students who participated in the survey, notnecessarily of all students statewide. (Because preliminaryndings found virtually no differences in correlations whenonly weighted state YRBS data were used [data available fromauthors], this report includes YRBS data from every statepublished in each MMWR Surveillance Summary regardlessof whether data were weighted or unweighted.) Questions about alcohol use in general are contained on the YRBS. These include lifetime (ever) use of alcohol(respondent had at least 1 drink of alcohol on at least 1 dayduring his or her life); alcohol use for the rst time beforeage 13 years (i.e., early age of initiation); current alcohol use(had at least 1 drink of alcohol on at least 1 day during the 30days before the survey); and binge drinking (had /H113505 drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey). The YRBS also containquestions about alcohol use and motor vehicles, includingdriving after drinking alcohol (i.e., alcohol-impaired driving)and riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol /H113501 time during the 30 days before the survey. The same wording for all the alcohol questions was used over the entire studyperiod; YRBS questions are available at www.cdc.gov/ healthyyouth/yrbs/data/index.htm . Overall and gender-specic state data were available for all alcohol-use measures annually except for 1993; publisheddata on alcohol-impaired driving and early age of initiationwere available starting with the 1995 survey administration. 22 Because states have nal decision-making authority aboutquestions, not all alcohol questions were included each year.Each year the MMWR Surveillance Summaries contained nodata on lifetime alcohol use from approximately two to sevenstates; in 1995 and 1997, no data on binge drinking from onestate; and in 1995 and 2001, no data on early age of initiationfrom one state. Adult Data Biennial adult data (corresponding to the years for whichYRBS data were available) were obtained from publicly avail-able CDC BRFSS data sets for 1993-2005. (Although BRFSSdata are collected annually, only biennial BRFSS data fromodd-numbered years were used for this study in order to beconsistent with the years that YRBS data on youth wereavailable.) Details about the BRFSS are available elsewhere. 28 In brief, state-based random-digit-dial telephone surveys ofnon-institutionalized people aged /H1135018 years are conducted monthly in all states; survey instruments contain questions ona variety of health risk measures. Overall, median state samplesizes for the years studied ranged from 2045 to 5812, andmedian state response rates ranged from 51.1% to 68.5%.Data for all states were weighted to be representative of eachstate's adult population. Questions in the BRFSS covered current alcohol use; the frequency and quantity of alcohol use (consumption); andalcohol-impaired driving (the actual wording for BRFSS ques-tions is available at www.cdc.gov/brfss). Current alcohol use was dened as having at least 1 drink of an alcohol-containingbeverage (beer, wine, wine cooler, or liquor) in the pastmonth from 1993 to 1999, and as having /H113501 drink in the past 30 days in 2005. In 2001 to 2003, respondents were askedabout the number of days they drank an alcohol-containingbeverage within the past 30 days; those reporting /H113501 day were considered current alcohol users. Binge drinking was dened as drinking /H113505 alcohol- containing beverages on one or more occasions within the past month (1993-1999) or within the past 30 days (2001-2005). Heavy drinking was dened as having /H110222 drinks per day on average for men, and /H110221 drink per day on average for women, within the past month (1993-1999) or within the past30 days (2001-2005). Alcohol-impaired driving was dened ashaving driven after perhaps having had too much to drinkwithin the past month from 1993-1999; questions on alcohol-impaired driving on the BRFSS were not included on the coresurvey in 2001, 2003, or 2005, preventing correlations withthis measure with YRBS data for these years. Data Analyses Data analyses occurred in 2007 and 2008 and were limited tothe same states and years for which YRBS data were available.Pearson correlation coefcients ( r) were used in all analyses, March 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3) 219Author's personal copy and signicance, based on p-values /H110210.05, was used to assess if coefcients were different from 0. Correlations of 0.10- 0.29 were considered weak, 0.30-0.49 moderate, and /H113500.50 strong.29Five broad types of prevalence correlations were estimated: overall youth with overall adults; overall youth withadults aged 18-34 years; overall youth with adults aged /H1135035 years; boys with men; and girls with women. Because of the differences in alcohol-use measures in the YRBS and BRFSS surveys, correlations were further catego-rized as direct or indirect. Direct comparisons consisted ofcorrelations of the prevalence measures for current alcoholuse, binge drinking, and alcohol-impaired driving for youthand adults (e.g., youth and adult binge-drinking estimates).Indirect comparisons consisted of correlating the remainingalcohol-use measures (e.g., youth binge drinking with adultheavy drinking). Correlations were obtained separately by year, pooled for the time periods 1993-1999 and 2001-2005, and pooledacross all years. Correlations using youth early age of initia-tion and youth alcohol-impaired driving were available onlyfor 1995 to 2005, and comparisons with adults were per-formed for these years. Correlations of youth data with adultalcohol-impaired driving were conducted only for period1993-1999. Direct comparisons (e.g., binge drinking amongyouth with binge drinking among adults) were performedboth overall and for each subgroup for each year and forpooled years; indirect comparisons were limited to overallestimates and pooled years. Results The youth median overall state prevalence and the range for medians across the survey years for thealcohol-use measures and34.1% (27.2%-36.6%) for riding with a driver who hadbeen drinking alcohol. The median overall adult stateprevalence and the range for medians across the surveyyears for the alcohol-use measures were for Correlations of state youth and adult alcohol preva- lence for direct-comparison measures are included inTable 1. Overall, the pooled estimates of current youthalcohol use were moderately correlated with currentadult alcohol use (r /H110050.43, p/H110210.01). Demographic- specic estimates of current youth alcohol use wereconsistently correlated in a positive manner with cur-rent adult alcohol use (range of r-values for pooled estimates: 0.35-0.68; range of r-values for annual mates: with nearly all coefcients signicant at p/H110210.01. Coefcients for all comparisons were typically higher from 2001 to 2005 than in earlieryears. Pooled and annual correlation coefcients for current alcohol use were generally higher among fe-male youth and adults than among male youth andadults, and for youth estimates correlated with youngeradults compared to older adults. There were positive correlations for youth and adult binge-drinking prevalence, although correlation coef-cients were slightly lower (the majority were moderatelycorrelated) and annual ndings somewhat less consis-tent than those for current drinking (Table 1 andTable 1.

As with current drinking, youth and adult binge- drinking correlations were generally stronger from2001 to 2005, and were higher among girls and womenand younger adults (Table 1). Youth alcohol-impaireddriving estimates from 1995 to 1999 were moderately tostrongly correlated with those of adult alcohol-impaireddriving for all years and among all subgroups ( Ta- ble 1; range of r-values for pooled estimates: 0.45-0.53; range 0.36-0.66), with coefcients signicant at p/H110210.01. Table 2 contains correlation coefcients of state overall youth and adult alcohol prevalence for indirect-comparison measures. State youth estimates of lifetime,current, and binge drinking were moderately tostrongly correlated with state adult estimates of currentalcohol use, binge drinking, and drinking-and-drivingpooled across all years (range of r-values: 0.30-0.52, p/H110210.01 for all correlation coefcients) but not estimates. The correlation foryouth riding-with-a-drinking-driver estimates with adultalcohol-impaired driving estimates from 1993 to 1999was moderate (0.42, p/H110210.01). Early age of initiation was not correlated with any adult alcohol-use measures. Youth estimates for alcohol-impaired driving and for riding with a drinking driverconsistently correlated\u2014albeit at a weak-to-moderate level\u2014 with adult binge-drinking estimates of r-values for pooled estimates:0.18-0.44) but were in-consistently correlatedwith estimates of adultcurrent alcohol use andheavy drinking. Discussion This may be the rstpopulation-based studyof the relationship be-tween youth and adultalcohol-use measures atthe level. Thisstudy empirically dem-onstrated that state-leveladult and youth alcoholuse are generally corre-lated to a moderate orstrong degree. Thesecorrelations were gene- rally found for moststate-level alcohol-usemeasures between youthand adults and wereconsistent over the 13-year time period, withsome evidence that cor-relations were strongerin recent years. Correla-tions were higher forgirls with women thanfor boys with men, andTable 2.

Correlation of binge drinking among youths and adults, 1993-2005 March 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3) 221Author's personal copy for youth with younger adults than for youth with older adults. Youth estimates for early age of initiation didnot correlate with adult alcohol-use measures, andyouth alcohol-use measures did correlate with adultheavy drinking. These ndings provide further evi-dence of the need to address underage drinkingthrough broader societal approaches that also influ-ence excessive adult alcohol use. Comparing these ndings with prior work is difcult because there are few similar studies. However, thisresearch is consistent with ndings from a study byNelson et al., 8which demonstrated that adult binge- drinking estimates for 40 states were strongly correlatedwith binge drinking among college students and withyoung adults aged 18-24 years and not attendingcollege who resided in the same state (r /H110050.43 and 0.45, p/H110210.01, respectively). A study comparing YRBS ndingsfor high school students with a telephone-administeredYRBS survey of college students in Texas found thatcollege students had a slightly higher prevalence ofbinge drinking and a slighter older age of rst alcoholuse than did high school students. 30 The only study31involving a comparison of YRBS with BRFSS data was based on a survey of AmericanIndians living on or near reservations in Montana.Although no comparisons were available on alcohol-usemeasures, that study found that the prevalence of youthtobacco use, physical inactivity, weight loss, and lowlevels of fruit and vegetable consumption was generallysimilar to, or higher than, that of adults. That study alsofound that risk-factor estimates about girls were gener-ally more similar to those for women as opposed toestimates about boys compared to men. A variety of factors at multiple levels influence youth alcohol use (e.g., religion, family members,peers). 4,5,14,15,17One reason for the correlations be- tween youth and adult alcohol-use measures is thatyouth drinking patterns may persist into adulthood. 32 Additionally, research has consistently shown that ado-lescents who begin drinking heavily at younger ages areat much greater risk of maintaining heavy use intoadulthood and developing alcohol-use disorders. 5,15 However, these ndings of moderate-to-strong correlations population-level estimatesof youth and adult alcohol-use behaviors suggest thatenvironmental influences, such as social, cultural, andlegal factors, may have an important effect on youthalcohol use. 14,17This study also provides further evi- dence of the need for more scientically rigorousresearch, such as intervention trials, on the effects ofpolicies to reduce underage drinking. Policies that result in higher alcohol excise taxes, in the enforcement of minimum legal drinking age laws,and in the restricted availability of alcohol reducealcohol use among youth. 3,8,33-39In the 2005 Nelson et al. study8of college students, alcohol-control policies\u2014 including those geared toward the general populationrather than just underaged people\u2014were indepen-dently associated with reduced binge drinking by col-lege students, even after adjusting for the impact ofsame-state adult drinking patterns, emphasizing theimpact that the policy environment may have on youthand adult drinking. Possible reasons are unknown for the lack of state- level correlations between an early age of initiation ofalcohol use among youth and adult alcohol use. Deci-sions by youth to begin drinking at a young age arecomplex and likely to be affected by other factors (e.g.,genetics, parental alcohol use, peer pressure) besidesadult alcohol-use patterns among nonhousehold ad-ults. 4,5,15Similarly, other factors may account for the general lack of positive correlations for youth alcohol-use measures with adult heavy-drinking estimates. This study had limitations. This was an ecologic analysis, and correlation does not equal causation; thestrong youth-adult correlations for most alcohol-usebehaviors could be the result of other factors. Data werebased on self-reports, which underestimate alcoholconsumption, at least among adults. 40There were wording differences in the questions used in the YRBSand BRFSS, which may have influenced correlations.There was the potential for a slight overlap betweenYRBS and BRFSS respondents, given that some highschool students are aged /H1135018 years, although the effect of this overlap on BRFSS estimates would be small.Response rates for the BRFSS, as with other telephone-based surveys, declined over time, 41and the impact on correlations is not known. Both weighted and un-weighted estimates were used from the YRBS; however,preliminary ndings based on direct comparisons weresimilar only when weighted YRBS data were used. Inaddition, YRBS data are representative only of youthwho attend school and not of all students in this agegroup. Finally, the generally stronger correlation be-tween youth and adult alcohol-impaired driving shouldbe interpreted cautiously, given that correlations couldbe calculated only through 1999. This study's ndings have implications for public health efforts to reduce excessive alcohol use. Regard-less of the reasons for the youth-adult alcohol associa-tions, the two are correlated. This is important becausemany citizens, policymakers, and even public healthofcials frame youth drinking as an age-related prob-lem that should be addressed through youth-centeredapproaches. Certainly some youth-centered approachesare effective, such as the presence and enforcement ofminimum legal drinking-age laws; laws that establish alower legal blood alcohol concentration for young orinexperienced drivers (i.e., zero-tolerance laws); andschool-based instructional programs to reduce ridingwith alcohol-impaired drivers. 36,38A youth-centered approach, however, can result in a lack of focus onreducing excessive drinking among the entire popula-tion through the use of policy interventions. 42,43 222 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 36, Number 3 www.ajpm-online.netAuthor's personal copy Higher alcohol taxes, for example, particularly those on beer, are inversely related to youth drinking, the frequency of youth drinking, heavy drinking by youth,youth motor-vehicle crashes, homicide, suicide, andyouth violence. 33,44-48More-comprehensive sets of state policies, including those geared toward the general pop-ulation, are associated with less alcohol-impaired drivingamong college students, 18including those who are under - age19\u2014e.g., one study found that states that lowered their legal limit for blood alcohol concentration to the 0.08 level experienced reductions in beer sales.49Similar ndings have been shown for tobacco control.50,51 Reducing underage drinking, as noted by the 2004National Research Council/IOM Underage DrinkingReport, will require a broader focus on reducing exces-sive drinking in the entire population. 14 The ndings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the ofcial positionof the USDHHS or the CDC.

Oates, MD, MSc; Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, MD, MA, MPH Case presentation: A 67-year-old retired school bus driver presents to your office for an initial visit after having had an acute myocardial infarc-tion, which is complicated by new-onset congestive heart failure. Shecomes to your office alone, with a bagof 5 pill bottles, and asks, \"Do I reallyneed all these pills?\" To care for themselves and partici- pate in their health care, patients mustbe able to understand and act on infor-mation and instructions given to themby their healthcare providers. Thisconcept is known as health literacy, which is defined as \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity toobtain, process, and understand basichealth information and health servicesneeded to make appropriate health de-cisions.\" 1Basic literacy skills, such as proficiency in reading, writing, listen- ing, interpreting images, and interact-ing with documents, as well as facilitywith numeric concepts and basic com-putation, are central to the concept ofhealth literacy and greatly affect a patient's level of health literacy. The Institute of Medicine, American Medical Association, American Collegeof Physicians, and the Joint Commission have targeted health literacy as a cross-cutting priority area for quality improve-ment to transform US health care. 2-5 Patients with the largest disease burdens are often those with the least ability tounderstand and use health information. This is due in part to a lack of focus on patient education and poor communica-tion skills by clinicians. In this article,we discuss the prevalence of limited health literacy, its impact on health out- comes and healthcare utilization, andstrategies that providers may use to en-hance their communication skills. The Problem According to the 2003 National As- sessment of Adult Literacy, a 30 000-household US Department of Educa- tion survey, 36% of US adults possess basic or below-basic health literacyskills. 6For people with basic health literacy, most documents such as pa- tient education brochures, informed consent forms, notices of privacy pro- tection, patient bills of rights, and even pill bottles are far too complex. Theprevalence of limited health literacy is higher for those with low educationalattainment, the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with chronic dis-ease. 7Indeed, more than 50% of those 80 to 84 years old and more than 70% of patients 85 years old and older have marginal or limited health literacy.8 The Impact Patients with limited health literacy have worse diabetic control9; often present with more advanced diseases,such as prostate cancer 10; use fewer preventative services11; and are up to twice as likely to be hospitalized.12 Additionally, older adults with limitedhealth literacy have a hazard ratio formortality over a 5-year period of 1.52 compared with those with normal health literacy. 13Many factors account for this worse health status, including an increasingly complex healthcare system, difficulties accessing health- care, limitations in patient-providercommunication, and the failure of pro-viders to promote self-management and recognize patient barriers to com- munication and comprehension. 14 Numerous barriers to healthcare ac- cess exist for those with limited health literacy.

Providers often assume that their patients are function-ally literate and communicate with themassuming they are able to read and com- prehend information, although this often is not the case. 16Clinicians can often be rushed and therefore make patients feel rushed and embarrassed to ask ques-tions. The office visit can be a daunting interaction, especially for those with lim-ited health literacy. Patients often preferto be quiet than to admit that they do notunderstand their doctor's instructions. They fear that their limited literacy skillswill be revealed. 15 Strategies for Clear Communication Numerous strategies are available that clinicians can implement thatwill help their patients overcomelimited health literacy (Table). 17 Some of these communication tech-niques appear easy to implement;however, these strategies often re-quire practice and the participation and training of an interdisciplinaryteam, as well as feedback frompatients. The goal is to help patients become informed and activated. 18This cannot be achieved without a welcoming en- vironment in which patients are com- fortable asking questions. Shame is aprominent emotion that patients with limited literacy associate with medicalencounters. Everything from registra-tion to referrals should be made clearand simple. If you are not hearingquestions, patients do not feel wel-come to ask. Who are the people inyour healthcare setting with the re-sponsibility to elicit and answer patients'questions? Do they help patients feelcomfortable asking questions? There aremany ways to distribute this responsibil-ity of eliciting and answering questions,but if the tasks are not clearly defined,achievement of the objective is unlikely. Avoiding the use of medical jargon during the encounter is another impor-tant way to improve patient comprehen-sion. Medical providers often use terms that are straightforward to them, yet maynot be so to patients. Commonly heardjargon such as the words \"echo,\" \"stressTable. Clear Communication Strategies Guiding Principles Specific Steps Clinical skills 1. Avoid jargon. 2. Use simple sentence structure and plain language. 3. Speak slowly.4. Use analogies, if appropriate (eg, \"Getting a pacemaker is like replacing the electrical wiring in your house\"). 5. Limit the amount of information discussed: Focus on 2 or 3 key points per visit and repeat them.Use others (office staff, VNA, home physical therapist, etc) to help reinforce key points. Be specific 1. Use clear, action-oriented directives. 2. Stress action steps the patient should take.3. Stress concrete, specific steps that the patient can take.4. Minimize information about anatomy and physiology.5. Focus instead on answering the patient's question, \"What do I need to do?\" Use multiple forms of communication 1. Use more than 1 communication modality to give the most important information. 2. Pictures can help convey complex information or explain procedures.3. Videos or interactive computer programs may also be useful.4. Get feedback from patients to make certain such patient education materials work with your patients. Help patients ask questions 1. Create an environment conducive to patients asking questions. Instead of asking, \"Do you have any questions?\" you can ask, \"What questions do you have for me?\" 2. Empower your patients to always leave medical encounters knowing the answer to the question, \"What do I need to do?\" Confirm comprehension 1. Conduct \"teach back.\" Part A: \"Tell me what you'll tell your family about what we talked about.\"Part B: Focus feedback on aspects not understood.Part C: Reevaluate comprehension (\"close the loop\") and provide additional feedback until mastery has been exhibited. VNA indicates Visiting Nurse Association.1050 Circulation February 24, 2009 at Boston University on November 18, 2009 circ.ahajournals.org Downloaded from test,\" and \"EKG\" may confuse patients and make them fearful unless thesewords are explained. Use of jargon canbe a subconscious technique providersuse to assert their role as a health pro- fessional and exhibit the mastery theyhave of their topic area. Unfortunately, itdoes not promote patient understanding.To make matters worse, even simplewords can function as jargon. For exam-ple, medical providers tend to use theterm \"diet\" to refer to all the food aperson consumes. Patients, however,tend to use the word \"diet\" to refer to an effort to lose weight. It can be hard toidentify and drop the jargon; feedbackfrom non-health professionals can beuseful. Taking time to explain in plainterms the action steps you want patientsto take will help improve patient under-standing, and it can be an effective wayfor providers to show that it is importantto them that their patients understand. Universal Precautions The ultimate way to ensure that commu- nication with your patient has been suc-cessful is to check. In doing this, physicians often ask, \"So, do you under-stand?\" (while getting up and walking for the door, training the patient to re-spond \"yes\"). This is not a helpful checkfor comprehension. A more effectivetechnique is to conduct a \"teach back,\"in which you ask the patient to explain toyou or teach back the critical actionitems from the encounter. You may ask,\"We talked about several things today. Iwant to be sure that it is clear what you are going to do, so please tell me, what is the plan?\" or \"When you go home, whatwill you tell your partner about what youneed to do every day?\" Such questionsare helpful in determining the extent ofunderstanding and also what parts of theaction plan the patient may not haveunderstood fully. Clinicians can thenprovide immediate feedback and educa-tional efforts to correct items the patientdid not comprehend. This may need totake a different form than simply repeat-ing the idea. The success of this teachingthen needs to be evaluated with another round of teach back to determinewhether the information has been im-parted successfully. 19 Conclusions Integration of the clear communication techniques outlined here may take practiceand training for a wide range of clinicalstaff; however, the high prevalence andsignificant clinical impact of limited healthliteracy warrant the expenditure of timeand resources. Implementation of the com- munication techniques presented will help create a prepared and proactive clinicalteam that will be able to empower patientswith limited health literacy to becomeinformed. 20 Sources of Funding Dr Oates is supported in part by a Geriatric Academic Career Award from the HealthResources and Services Administration (HRSA), No. 1 K01 HP00020-01.

BACKGROUND: Despite vigorous national debate be- tween 1999 -2001 the federal patients 'bill of rights (PBOR) was not enacted. However, states have enacted legislation and the Joint Commission defined an ac- creditation standard to present patients with theirrights. Because such initiatives can be undermined by overly complex language, we surveyed the readability of hospital PBOR documents as well as texts mandated bystate law. METHODS: State Web sites and codes were searched to identify PBOR statutes for general patient populations. T h er i g h t sa d d r e s s e dw e r ec o m p a r e dw i t ht h e1 2themes presented in the American Hospital Associa- tion's (AHA) PBOR text of 2002. In addition, we obtained PBOR texts from a sample of hospitals in each state.Readability was evaluated using Prose, a software program which reports an average of eight readability formulas. RESULTS: Of 23 states with a PBOR statute for the general public, all establish a grievance policy, four protect a private right of action, and one stipulates fines for violations. These laws address an average of 7.4 ofthe 12 AHA themes. Nine states 'statutes specify PBOR text for distribution to patients. These documents have an average readability of 15th grade (range, 11.6, NewYork, to 17.0, Minnesota). PBOR documents from 240 US hospitals have an average readability of 14th grade (range, 8.2 to 17.0). CONCLUSIONS: While the average U.S. adult reads at an 8th grade reading level, an advanced college reading level is routinely required to read PBOR documents. Patients are not likely to learn about their rights fromdocuments they cannot read. KEY WORDS: patient rights; readability; J Gen Intern Med -94 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-0914-z\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009BACKGROUND In 2001, both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate passed bills to create a Federal Patients 'Bill of Rights (PBOR). While the Senate version of the bill reversed certainelements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), by allowing patients to sue in state and federal courts for denials of care by managed care organizations, the Houseversion of the bill did not provide such a right and President Bush was reported to have threatened to veto the bill if it included such a provision. 1The bill was moved to a House - Senate conference to work out differences between House- passed and Senate-passed bills, but these negotiations failed. Despite this, many states enacted Patients 'Bill of Rights laws.2,3 The concept of patients 'rights represents a cultural shift that began to emerge 40 years ago when notions of informed consent and autonomy were first endorsed by court opinionand institutional policy. 4,5In 1973, the American Hospital Association (AHA) presented the first patients 'bill of rights.6The 12 themes addressed in this initial document (e.g., right to respectful care, right to refuse treatment, right to confidentiality, right to refuse participation in research) have remained insubsequent versions (Table 1), and in the 1990s the Joint Commission phased in a requirement to inform every patient about their rights as a national standard for hospitalaccreditation (RI.2.20). Unfortunately, efforts to advance patients 'rights can be thwarted by inadequate attention to the complexity and language of the materials pres ented to patients. For exam- ple, while the average U.S. adult reads at an 8th grade reading level, informed conse nt documents and notices of privacy practices typically require the reading capacity of ahigh school graduate. 7,8We hypothesized that PBOR texts are also written at a level of complexity that far exceeds patients 'average capacity. We therefore undertook a survey to determine the readability of PBOR texts in the UnitedStates. We included PBOR texts from a sample of U.S. hospitals and all PBOR texts designated by state law to be given to all patients. We performed the following threeadditional analyses of state PBOR statutes: 1) comparison of the rights delineated in state law to the themes advanced in the 2002 version of the Amer ican Hospital Association PBOR; 2) abstraction of any enforcement powers that are delineated within the statute; and 3) evaluation of the presence of PBOR texts in languages other than Englishfor those states with mandatory language defined within the statute. Received May 27, 2008 Revised December 3, 2008Accepted January 12, 2009Published online February 3, 2009 489METHODS Data Sources We obtained state PBOR statutes by searching all 50 state government Web sites and legal codes in the Lexis-Nexus Data base. If this information was unclear, we contacted the legal counsel for the state Department of Public Health and Welfareand/or the legal counsel for the State Legislature. The focus of this analysis was PBOR material for general patient popula- tions. As such, PBOR legislation intended for specific patientpopulations (e.g., psychiatric patients) or special circum-stances (e.g., long-term care) were not included. To obtain a sample of hospital PBOR documents, we used the U.S. News and World Report 2006 alphabeticalstate listing of the nation 's\"best hospitals \"; in each state we searched the publicly available Web sites for every fourth general hospital on the list with the goal of obtaining5 different PBOR documents from each state. We designated a document as different from other documents in the state sample if the language, excluding institutional names, wasnot exactly the same. In addition, documents had to be atleast 300 words long to be included. This served to exclude documents that are merely advertisements or outlines of actual PBOR texts and ensured an adequate word count forreadability analysis. In circumstances where multiple hos- pitals on the list had identical PBOR documents, we retained one copy of the PBOR and continued to searchfor additional documents. We continued to search the list until we found five unique documents of sufficient length per state or the list was exhausted by cycling through thelist four times. All Web sites were accessed between July and August 2006. Readability and Language Availability Readability analyses were conducted on each hospital PBOR using three software programs; Prose: The ReadabilityAnalyst, Grammatik 6.0, and Wstyle: Writing Style Analyzer (1992).9For any state that designated the specific PBOR text to be presented to patients, the readability of such text wasevaluated in the same fashion. In addition, for each state that designated the specific PBOR text to be presented to patients, we searched relevant Web sites for approved text inother languages. Prose provides grade level estimates for eight readability formulas. The upper limit for most readability formulas isgrade 17, which represents a 1st year graduate school readinglevel. Grammatik 6.0 software (1994) analyzes a text 's sen- tence and vocabulary complexity. Wstyle categorizes writing style as Very Poor, Poor, Weak, Satisfactory, Good, Very Good,and Excellent. Analysis of Themes T h es p e c i f i cr i g h t st h a ta r ep r o t e c t e di ne a c hs t a t es t a t u t ewere abstracted and compared with the 12 themes in the2002 version of the American Hospital Association PBOR. This process was conducted independently by two coders (MPO and DJ), who designated each AHA theme as present,present but altered, or not pre sent. In addition, state PBOR themes not included in the AHA PBOR document were documented. Each instanc eo fd i s a g r e e m e n ta m o n g reviewers was reevaluated in a joint conference for finalclassification until agreement was reached. Protected Remedies Any recourse delineated within the statute was abstracted. Wealso noted instances where the statute specifically limits aperson 's options to pursue legal remedies for breach of the rights delineated in the statue.

All significance tests were two-tailed. Analyses were conducted with Stata version 8 (CollegeStation, TX). RESULTS In two states, no relevant legislation was identified. In 25states, PBOR laws existed exclusively for the protection ofspecific patient populations. Of the 23 states with PBOR legislation for general patie nt populations, nine states 'laws presented a specific PBOR document for distribution topatients. We analyzed a total of 240 hospital PBOR docu-ments from all 50 states; we did not find five unique hospital PBOR documents in Delaware (4), Hawaii (3), North Dakota (2), South Dakota (2) and Utah (4).Table 1.

The average reading grade level for eachstate 's hospital sample of PBOR texts was 14.1 (95% confidence interval 13.8 to 14.4; range, 12.0, Maine, to 16.6, Minnesota). Nine states stipulated within their statutethe actual PBOR text to be distributed to patients. The average reading grade level for these nine documents was 15.2 (95% confidence interval 13.8 to 16.7; range 11.6,New York, to 17, Minnesota) as seen in Table 3.H o s p i t a l s i nt h e s en i n es t a t e sr a r e l yp r e s e n t e dt h et e x te x a c t l ya s prescribed by state law (1 of 45). The reading grade level of hospital PBOR texts in these nine states was lower thanthe language specified by state law (14.7 vs. 15.2, p=0.14) and higher than the average reading grade level of hospital PBOR documents in other states (14.7 versus 14.0, p=0.05). Table 4presents examples of excerpts from hospital PBOR texts for four common themes.Text Presented in Other Languages in State Statutes In six of the nine states that present statutory PBOR texts, thestate presented the mandatory text exclusively in English; three of these states presented a PBOR document in Spanish and twoof these states also presented documents in additional lan- guages (New York: Italian, Russian, Greek, Chinese, Yiddish, and Creole; Minnesota: Hmong, Somali, Russian, and Laotian). Specific Themes Of the 12 AHA themes, state statutes included an average of 7.4themes and hospital documents included an average of 9.8 themes. As seen in Table 1, the AHA theme that is least commonly presented is the right to be informed of business relationshipsthat influence care. In the 23 state statutes and the 240 hospital documents there were 95 themes not addressed in the AHA document (e.g., pain management including opiates, receiving anitemized bill, and freedom from restraints). The most common non-AHA themes are presented in Table 2.Table 2.

In most of these states, complaints may bedirected to the State Department of Health and in several states complaints are directed to the board of registration. For example, in Vermont complaints are directed to the board ofmedicine and failure to comply with any provision of thePatients 'Bill of Rights law may constitute a basis for disciplin- ary action against a physician. In one state, Illinois, the law stipulated fines for violations and in four states (Arizona,Massachusetts, Maine, and Texas), the statute protects a private civil right of action. For example, under Texas law \"A plaintiff who prevails in a suit under this section may recoveractual damages, including damages for mental anguish even if an injury other than mental anguish is not shown. \" 10In contrast, the Florida statute included language to explicitlyrestrict patients 'legal options: \"This section shall not be used for any purpose in any civil or administrative action and neither expands nor limits any rights or remedies providedunder any other law. \" 11 DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that PBOR documents presented in U.S. hospitals far exceed the reading capacity of the majority ofadults. In addition, these documents commonly fail to include themes designated by state law and by the American HospitalAssociation. While close to half of the states in the U.S. havePatients 'Bill of Rights legislation for the general public, the specific rights named in these laws vary and few of these laws incorporate remedies other than a mechanism to file com-plaints. Furthermore, in nine states statutory language to be presented to patients is very complex and is usually exclusively presented in English. These observations may not be surprising for people who know that other documents such as informed consent forms and notices of privacy protection have also been shown to beoverly complex. Efforts to empower patients are underminedby legal jargon in many instances. Similarly, efforts to cultivate communication skills and inculcate the importance of patient education in trainees are hampered by the mixed messagepresented by patients 'rights documents that patients cannot read. Students may be taught that they should care about health literacy and low English proficiency while simulta-neously observing what may appear as institutional indiffer- ence in the domain of patients 'rights documents. There are several reasons why clinicians and other patient advocates should particularly care about the readability and language accessibility of PBOR documents. Patients 'Bill of Rights documents are publicly presented. They are among theinitial points of patient engagement. Complex public documentsmay serve to train patients to be more passive in their care andTable 4.

The readability level represents the overall reading level of the document from which the excerpt was taken. Text that is not in quotations and presented in italics was written by the authors492 Paasche-Orlow et al: Survey of Patients 'Bill of Rights Statutes JGIMmay instill fear in patients with limited literacy or English proficiency. Many clinicians probably view the PBOR as a health system issue that does not directly impact clinical practice ortheir relationships with patients. However, a well-presented PBOR document has the capacity to encourage patient activa- tion and trust in those providing services. The current research,which demonstrates that PBOR documents are frequently not understandable to patients, reveals a missed opportunity to present the patient care mission in a clear manner. In the 1970s, the patients 'rights movement was advanced because physicians were perceived as too powerful. 12At that time, patients had to advocate for the right to be given information about their diagnosis and prognosis.13By the 1990s, when the concept of a patients 'bill of rights was introduced in Congress, the topic was advanced by a consumer rights movement due to a sense that managed care companiesand insurers were too powerful. 14Instead of protecting a right to refuse treatment from paternalist physicians, consumers wanted to secure a right to choose their providers and haveaccess to treatments being denied by payors. The American Hospital Association, which has long been an advocate for a patients 'bill of rights, changed their format in 2006 to a brochure called \"The Patient Care Partnership, \" which contains the same themes and \"informs patients about what they should expect during their hospital stay with regard to their rights. \" 15While the brochure is a clear departure from the legal jargon of prior PBOR documents advanced by the American Hospital Association (and is presented on their Web site in Arabic, Chinese, English, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog,and Vietnamese), the English text is still written at an 11th grade reading level. As seen in Table 4, where we present examples written at a 5th grade level, the themes of the PBOR can be written in plainEnglish. In most states, hospitals are free to revise their PBOR documents; however, in nine states (CA, FL, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NY, PA and TX) statutes should be amended either to allowhospitals to write their own language or to present the official state PBOR in plain English. A note of caution is warranted. According to Robert Gunning, developer of the Fog readabilityformula: \"Like all good inventions, readability yardsticks can cause harm in misuse. They are handy statistical tools to measure complexity in prose ...But they are not formulas for writing. \" 16Authors who replace long words with short words that are similarly arcane have not improved the actual readability, even if they do reduce their readability score.17,18 Different formulas report grade levels that vary by two to four grades, partly because they are based on different levels of reader comprehension. Because the SMOG formula is based on 100% reader comprehension, it tends to score higher thanother formulas which are based on 35% \u201470% reader compre- hension. Rather than using a single formula that might bias the results by scoring \"high\"or\"low,\"we used Prose software because it provides the average grade level estimates of eight readability formulas. In addition, we provide further analyses to exhibit the level of complexity of the PBOR documents. There are limitations to readability software programs. First, the same formula in different programs may give different grade levels due to variations in algorithms used to count sentences and syllables. 17Second, formulas do not take into account a PBOR 's organization, font size, font family, etc. Third, these formulas cannot account for the background knowledge of the readers, their motivation, cultural experi-ences, etc. Despite these limitations, the formulas do provide a reasonable and cost-effective way of assessing how clearly PBORs are written. Interested hospitals and legislatures may benefit from con- sulting specialists in adult basic education, readability, and improving patient care systems in this process. Patients andtheir advocates can also play an important role. In addition, plain language versions in other languages should be commis- sioned. Similarly, hospitals can improve patients 'comprehen- sion of their rights by supplementing their print material withother educational methods such as video or interactive multi- media that can be developed. A promising proposal for a National Health Literacy Act, to establish a national center forhealth literacy at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as well as provide funding for State Health Literacy offices, is currently being vetted. 19Resources of this kind could help avoid future instances of legislatures compelling hospitals to present unreadable legal jargon to patients. The strengths of this study that lend weight to our conclu- sions are the amount of text analyzed, the blind sampling within every state, and the complete evaluation of state statutes. Nonetheless, several limitations should be kept inmind. First, we surveyed only hospital PBOR texts that wereavailable through institutional Web sites. Although it is likely that the materials presented on institutional Web sites accu- rately reflect local practices, additional materials were notexamined. Second, we did not attempt to evaluate the concep- tual complexity of the content. It is possible that variations in conceptual complexity influence readability as well. Third, weevaluated readability using the average of eight readability formulas and three measures of syntax and semantics: sentence complexity, vocabulary complexity, and writing style.While this represents a significant advance over the vastmajority of published analyses which are based simply on the Flesch -Kincaid scale, or other single metrics of readability, additional factors that affect legibility and understandability,such as the type font, layout, and length, were not evaluated in this project. Similarly, we were not able to evaluate the readability of PBOR documents in languages other than Englishto determine, for example, if the Minnesota State PBOR, which is at a graduate school level in English, is also at a 17th grade level in Hmong, Somali, Russian and Laotian. Fourth, we reportthe remedies offered within statutes; however, this does not reflect the volume or types of complaints that these statutes have actually generated. We made multiple attempts to deter-mine details of these programs, but were not able to obtainrecords on complaints or otherwise assess the consequences of PBOR statutes. It would be valuable to know how patients and states use these programs. 20 When a hospital PBOR document is missing a theme that is recommended by the AHA or required by state statute, it is unclear if this represents an accidental lapse or a purposefuldeparture. The absence of themes from PBOR documents, however, does not change clinical standards. For example, the least common AHA PBOR theme presented in hospital docu-ments and state statutes relates to the disclosure of businessrelationships that may influence care. Nonetheless, profes- sional standards dictate disclosure of such relationships. 21 Promoting patients 'rights has had many years of regulatory support from the AHA and the Joint Commission. Similarly, almost half the states in our country have shown legislative support for a bill of rights to protect all patients. These laws do493 Paasche-Orlow et al: Survey of Patients 'Bill of Rights Statutes JGIMnot establish a right to health care. Yet, patients 'rights statutes are designed to promote the ethical and humane treatment of patients. These goals will not be realized by presenting patientswith documents they are not able to read and understand.

This is quite tting, as the research has included a multidisciplinary assortment of investigators con- cerned with the journal's core aspirations: improving the communication between patients and their providers and devel- oping methods for patients to be more educated and activated about their health. This agenda grows out of an intuition that views health care as unnecessarily complicated and insufciently dedicated to the mission of patient education and patient empowerment. Thus, it is truly an honor to present this special issue addressing international perspectives on health literacy research as part of the 75th volume anniversary of the journal. The collection of papers we present in this special issue reveal both the strides being taken to remediate the problem of limited health literacy as well as the great growth potential that remainsfor this eld of inquiry. We specically have highlighted through the article assortment how health literacy has become an international phenomenon. Though the research is still dominated by work being done in the Unites States, the issue includes articles from Australia, Great Britain, Japan, and Korea. The expansion of health literacy research to Asia is particularly notable as the groundwork is now clearly being laid to extend the eld into populations that communicate with character-based languages. We have also included material from a broad range of content and methods. There are three papers that focus on measurement: Shapira et al. evaluate and rene prior tests of health numeracy; Lee et al. present data for a new Korean Health Literacy Scale; and Yost et al., describe a new English and Spanish computer-based instrument. There are also four papers that evaluate innovative intervention strategies to address literacy barriers in health communication. Bickmore et al. present ndings on the efcacy of an animated computer avatar system, while Kandula et al. review the development and testing of a multimedia diabetes education program for use in community health centers. Wallace et al, evaluate another diabetes self-management intervention that combined a clinical practice protocol with literacy-appropriate patient education materials and a brief counseling strategy. Lastly, Rudd et al. describe results of using literacy-appropriate patient education materials with brief counseling for patients with arthritis. The work by Clement et al. appropriately complements these papers through a systematic review of complex health literacy interventions. The extent, association, and implications of limited literacy on health outcomes are also further explored by many of the authors in this issue as well. There are two papers that investigate the role of literacy in colorectal cancer screening programs (Von Wagner et al. and Smith et al.), while the impact parental literacy may haveon children's health is examined by two research teams (Shone et al. and Hironka et al.) in the context of asthma and medication adherence. Pandit et al. determine the nature of the relationship between literacy, education, and hypertension outcomes; Apter et al. present data on the role of health literacy on quality of life in the context of patients with asthma. The complexity of oral communication in the context of genetic counseling is explored in an innovative fashion by Roter et al. Two articles recognize the additional barrier of language in the context of health literacy. Sudore et al. compare the impact of literacy and limited English prociency in healthcare, and Fang and colleagues reveal alarming health literacy and language barriers for basic concepts relating to stroke among patients in an anticoagulation clinic. Finally, Tokuda et al. present the rst evaluation of the prevalence of health literacy barriers in Japan and show that health literacy is linked to health-related qualityof life. Close scrutiny of the articles reveals that much work remains to further ground and unite the eld across international borders. To begin, there appears to be signicant variation in denitions. Some authors avoid the term 'health literacy' when discussing basic literacy skills in a health care context while others are clearly comfortable with this label. The most commonly used tools to measure health literacy among the papers in this special issue are versions of the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and the Test of Functional Health Literacy Assessment (TOFHLA). In fact, neither of these instruments are tests of health literacy as it is typically dened. The REALM is a word recognition test and depending on which version of the TOFHLA was used, there are aspects of both reading fluency and numeracy present. Both of these tests were designed from general literacy measures and more accurately should be regarded as assessing basic literacy skills framed within a healthcare context. Basic literacy skills such as these are core components of any denition of health literacy, but authors disagree about how to discuss results of studies using these instruments. Two of the papers in this issue address the topic of denitions in the context of developing new measurement tools. Both Lee et al. who presents data for the Korean Health Literacy Scale, and Yost et al. who presents data on an English and Spanish computer-based instrument, developed a broad array of test stimuli to move beyond measuring basic literacy skills. These authors clearly aspire to capture a more expansive health literacy concept. What remains to be seen is whether such measurement is worthwhile. The literature in health literacy, after all, has been substantiated on data derived from studies that have used crude instruments like the REALM and TOFHLA, so the relationship between other domains of health literacy (that might be dened on the basis of new instruments) and health outcomes remains to bePatient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 293-294 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Patient Education and Counseling journal homepage: www.els evier.com/locate/pateducou 0738-3991/$ - see front matter /C2232009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2009.05.001Author's personal copy seen. Regardless, existing tools have been highly predictive for clearly identifying an at-risk population. Even further, the term health literacy is increasingly referred to as a broader public health concept in both the United States and internationally. Clearly, the large amount of interest in helping patients and families access, understand, and use health informa- tion allows for such diffusion. Those in the health literacy eld must be open to a growing duality that research in this line of inquiry can refer to the study of (1) the knowledge and skills a person needs (e.g., to gather, understand, and comply with medical instructions), and (2) the preparation and outreach that must be undertaken by health systems and other relevant institutions to convey roles, responsibilities, and information within healthcare and support their ability to perform relevant tasks. The former addresses an individual cognitive and psychosocial skill set, while the latter targets attributes of the health system. Both are appropriate foci for health literacy research and despite the broad array of measures and intervention targets that fall within this construct, this should not be viewed as problematic. Health literacy embodies the goals of clear health communication and patient engagement in healthcare, requiring a diverse worldview and multidisciplinary perspective. We hope this issue generates further global interest in health literacy and recognition of its importance in the context not onlyfor advancing clear health communication, but also, for promoting healthcare equity, quality, and safety. An identiable marker of the journal's success will be to see future publications from even more countries seeking to address the problem. As Patient Education and Counseling has an international audience, it is quite betting for it to continue to serve as a preeminent venue for advancing the eld among diverse populations and health systems.

Vasan, MD; Daniel Levy, MD Background \u2014Whereas the prevalence of coronary heart disease risk factors has declined over the past decades in the United States, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rates have been steady. We hypothesized that this paradox is due partly to the advent of increasingly sensitive biomarkers for AMI diagnosis. Methods and Results \u2014In Framingham Heart Study participants over 4 decades, we compared the incidence and survival rates of initial AMI diagnosis by ECG (AMI-ECG) regardless of biomarkers with those based exclusively on infarction biomarkers (AMI-marker). We used Poisson regression to calculate annual incidence rates of firstAMI over 4 decades (1960 to 1969, 1970 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, and 1990 to 1999) and compared rates ofAMI-ECG with rates of AMI-marker. Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to compare AMI case fatality over 4 decades. In 9824 persons (54% women; follow-up, 212 539 person-years; age, 40 to 89 years), 941 AMIsoccurred, including 639 AMI-ECG and 302 AMI-marker events. From 1960 to 1999, rates of AMI-ECG declinedby/H1101550% and rates of AMI-marker increased /H110152-fold. Crude 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year case fatality rates in 1960 to 1969 and 1990 to 1999 were 0.20 and 0.14, 0.24 and 0.21, and 0.45 and 0.41, respectively. Age- and sex-adjusted30-day, 1-year, and 5-year AMI case fatality declined by 60% in 1960 to 1999 ( Pfor trend /H110210.001), with parallel declines noted after AMI-ECG and AMI-marker. Conclusions \u2014Over the past 40 years, rates of AMI-ECG have declined by 50%, whereas rates of AMI-marker have doubled. Our findings offer an explanation for the apparently steady national AMI rates in the face of improvements inprimary prevention. infarction During the past 4 decades, death rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) have declined by /H1102260%.1-4 Between nearly one half to upwards of three quarters of the decline in CHD mortality has been attributed to improve-ments in primary prevention and risk factor modifica-tion. 5-10Awareness, treatment, and control of 3 key risk factors\u2014hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smok-ing\u2014have improved in recent decades. 1,11Despite these improvements, hospitalization rates for acute myocardialinfarction (AMI) have remained relatively stable over thepast 5 decades. 1,4,12 The reasons for the paradoxical stabil- ity of AMI rates in the face of declining CHD risk factorprevalence are not clear.Editorial p 1189 Clinical Perspective p 1210 Whereas ECG criteria for AMI have not changed appre- ciably over the past 50 years, several different biomarkers ofvarying sensitivity and specificity have been introduced forthe detection of AMI.

We hypothesized a priori that rates of AMI-ECG have declined in the long term (consistent with improvements inCHD risk factors) while the rates of AMI-marker haveincreased (owing to greater biomarker sensitivity), resultingin a relatively steady rate of total AMI incidence over a40-year time interval. Accordingly, we analyzed 40-yeartrends in the incidence of first AMI and for the 2 mutuallyexclusive AMI subgroups of AMI-ECG and AMI-marker.Such an approach may shed light on the paradoxical stabilityof national AMI rates in the setting of improvements in CHDrisk factors and declining rates of CHD mortality. Secondarily, we assessed time-period trends in mortality after AMI and its subcomponents, AMI-ECG and AMI-marker. This analysis will help promote understanding of therelative effectiveness of secondary prevention efforts overtime when considered in conjunction with analyses of time- period changes in the incidence of initial AMI, which reflect advances in primary prevention. Methods The Framingham Heart Study is a community-based prospective observational study that began in 1948, enrolling 5209 men andwomen in the original study cohort. 18Original cohort members attended clinic examinations approximately every 2 years. In 1971,5124 men and women enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort, which included the children and spouses of the children of the original cohort. Participant examinations for the offspring cohort occurred approximately every 4 to 8 years; the designand methodology have been described elsewhere. 19This investigation included original and offspring cohort members. We considered all original and offspring cohort members 40 to 89 years of age who were free of AMI (recognized and unrecognized)at their first Framingham clinic examination in each decade of study(1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s). Our final sample size consisted of9824 individuals. Each individual could enter the sample multipletimes on the basis of eligibility for time period and age group. For example, a participant 35 years of age in 1960 would not contribute follow-up time to the first time period until he or she turned 40 in1965, thereafter contributing 5 years. That participant would con-tribute 5 years to second time period and so on until the patient diedor developed AMI. Similarly, a patient 75 years old in 1960contributed at most 5 years to the last period. Participants providedwritten informed consent, and the study protocol was approved bythe Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.Risk Factor Assessment At each routine clinic visit, participants underwent physical exami- nation, 12-lead ECG, anthropometry, and laboratory assessment ofvascular risk factors. Details on the ascertainment of risk factors have been previously described. 19Participants with systolic blood pressure /H11350140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure /H1135090 mm Hg (mean reading of 2 readings taken by an examining physician) orreceiving medication for the treatment of hypertension were defined as having hypertension. Plasma glucose and total cholesterol weremeasured. Diabetes mellitus was defined (throughout the studyperiod) as fasting plasma glucose /H11350126 mg/dL, a nonfasting glucose of/H11350200 mg/dL, or treatment with either insulin or hypoglycemic agents. Participants were considered to be current smokers if theysmoked on average at least 1 cigarette per day during the year beforeexamination. Serum Biomarkers of MI Several serum biomarkers were used for AMI diagnosis during the study time period. Specific diagnostic biomarkers and the decadesduring which they were used for AMI diagnosis in the Framingham Heart Study included the following: serum glutamic oxalacetic in the 1970s, CPK-MB and lactic dehydrogenaseisoenzyme in the 1980s, and troponin in the late 1990s. We did notuse prespecified cut points to determine biomarker elevation because variability was present in assays used in the various hospitals fromwhich medical records were collected. Thus, we considered abiomarker elevated if it exceeded the reference limit provided by thehospital laboratory report at the time of AMI hospitalization,according to the available medical record/chart. Ascertainment of AMI and AMI Case Fatality Framingham Heart Study participants are under continuous surveil- lance for cardiovascular disease events and death. The surveillanceprocess included physician-administered questions about cardiovas- cular events during each routine follow-up Framingham Heart Study clinic visit and a mailed health history update questionnaire (which,before the late 1990s, consisted of a brief questionnaire for thosewho had not attended examinations and, after the late 1990s,included detailed sections about interim cardiac events and hospital- izations). If a participant reported a possible interim event, allpertinent medical records were collected and reviewed by an eventsadjudication committee consisting of 3 physicians who reviewed allavailable hospitalization records, physician office visit notes, andpathology reports. 20AMIs were diagnosed on the basis of ischemicTable 1.

ECGcriteria for AMI included development of pathological Q waves of/H113500.04 seconds, often accompanied by ST elevation and followed by serial changes indicating a reversion of these ECG changes towardnormal. We chose to exclude persons with unrecognized/silent AMIbecause it is impossible to determine the exact date of occurrence,which is assigned a midpoint between the last ECG without anabnormality and the first one manifesting Q-wave changes. Case fatality was assessed within 30 days and at 1 and 5 years. For 1- and 5-year mortality, deaths occurring within the first 30days were excluded from analysis. We did this to obtain a truersense of how many \"later\" case fatalities occurred after AMI (because a large proportion of post-AMI deaths occur within 30days of the index event as opposed to later). Furthermore,pathophysiologically \"early\" death resulting from AMI is likelydifferent from \"later\" deaths. Statistical Methods Prevalence rates and means ( /H11006SD) of cardiovascular disease risk factors were calculated for the study sample at the first examination cycle in each decade of study. We used Poisson regression to calculate annual incidence rates of first AMI over 4 time periods (1960 to 1969, 1970 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, and 1990 to 1999) andcompared rates of AMI-ECG with rates of AMI-marker. We testedfor sex/H11003age group, sex /H11003time period, age group /H11003time period, age group/H11003AMI type, and time period /H11003AMI type interactions forincidence rate trends; given multiple statistically significant proba- bility values for these interactions, we present age- and sex-specificAMI incidence rates for each time period. Additionally, with smallnumbers of events for the oldest and youngest age groups, weprovide trends in (log-transformed) event rates across the 4 timeperiods for the age groups of 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 yearsfor men and women separately. We calculated tests of trend foroverall AMI, AMI-ECG, and AMI-marker across time periods, with the 1960s serving as the referent decade (using a model accountingfor the interactions listed above). We used Cox proportional-hazardsmodels to calculate age- and sex-adjusted case fatality curves and30-day, 1-year and 5-year case fatality rates after all AMI, AMI-ECG, and AMI-marker for each of the 4 time periods (with 1960 to1969 serving as the referent period). The follow-up period for casefatality was until the end of 2006. The assumption of proportionalityof hazards was satisfied over the 5-year follow-up period after AMI(Pfor time to death /H11003period interaction /H110220.32 for overall AMI, AMI-ECG, and AMI-marker). A 2-sided value of P/H110210.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

The mean age of participants at the start of each time period ranged from 53years in the 1960s to 60 years in 1990s. Smoking rates, total cholesterol concentrations, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased from 1960 to 1999. Trends in Overall AMI, AMI-ECG, and AMI-Marker Rates Overall, 941 first AMIs occurred, including 639 AMI-ECG events (68%) and 302 AMI-marker events (32%). Age- andsex-specific incidence rate trends from the 1960s to the 1990s are presented in Tables 2 and 3 for men and women, respectively. Rates of AMI-ECG declined by /H1101550% and rates of AMI-marker doubled over the study period (Tables 2 and 3, Figures 1 and 2). Among men, statistically significant de- clines in AMI-ECG were noted in the age groups of 50 to 59 years ( Pfor trend /H110210.001) and 70 to 79 years ( Pfor trend /H110210.05) (Figure 1A). In women, statistically significant de- clines in AMI-ECG were noted among those 70 to 79 years ofage ( Pfor trend /H110210.01) (Figure 1B). Among men, significant increases in AMI-marker were noted in those50 to 59 and 70 to 79 years of age ( Pfor trend /H110210.01 for both) (Figure 2A); in women, statistically significant in-creases in AMI-marker were noted among those 70 to 79years of age ( Pfor trend /H110210.01) (Figure 1B). Trends and AMI-marker were largely flat for the 60-to 69-year-old group. Trends in 30-Day, 1-Year, and 5-Year AMI Case Fatality Five-year case fatality rates after overall AMI decreased steadily from 1960 to 1999 ( Pfor trend /H110210.001) (Table 4, Figure 3A). Trends in 5-year case fatality rates after AMI- ECG and after AMI-marker mirrored overall 5-year AMIcase fatality trends (Figure 3B and 3C). Similarly, decreaseswere seen in 30-day and 1-year case fatality rates after overallAMI, AMI-ECG, and AMI-marker (Table 4). A particularly large shift was found toward decreased case fatality between the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 3A through 3C). Discussion Principal Findings In a community-based cohort of 9824 men and women followed up for a 4-decade interval, we found that AMI-ECGrates declined /H1101550% with a concomitant 2-fold increase in rates of AMI-marker. The 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year case fatality rates after overall AMI declined by 50% to 75% from1960 to 1999, with parallel declines in case fatality after bothAMI-ECG and AMI-marker over this period. We conclude that national MI trend data may be biased by a diagnostic driftresulting from the advent of diagnostic biomarker tests for Figure 1. Temporal trends for age-range-specic incidence rates in AMI-ECG from 1960 to 1999 among men (A) and women (B). Figure 2. Temporal trends for age-range-specic incidence rates in AMI-marker from 1960 to 1999 among men (A) andwomen (B).1206 Circulation March 10, 2009 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on November 16, 2009 circ.ahajournals.org Downloaded from AMI; we were able to identify and quantify the possible magnitude of this effect within our study setting. Thesefindings may explain the paradoxical stability of AMI rates in the United States despite concomitant improvements in CHD risk factors. Temporal Trends in AMI Several epidemiological studies conducted in United States have demonstrated steady rates of AMI from the 1970s to the1990s, 4,12,17,21 whereas data from the World Health Organi- zation Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascu-lar Disease (WHO-MONICA) project demonstrated modestdeclines in rates of AMI from 1985 to 1991. 22Data from the Worcester Heart Attack Study similarly demonstrated modestdeclines in the incidence of first AMI. 23Differences in study design and event ascertainment may have accounted for thediffering results between these prior studies. In our study,particularly in men, overall AMI trends appear to be decreas-ing in a parallel fashion compared with AMI-ECG. Inwomen, overall AMI rates were steady to decreased.Defining AMI in population studies and clinical research is essential for accurate disease surveillance, clinical trial design and conduct, and healthcare resource allocation. 13,24,25 Sev- eral prior studies demonstrating trends in AMI rates have used international diagnostic codes ( International Classifica- tion of Diseases [ICD]) for hospital discharges to identify AMI cases21,26-28 and may be subject to \"diagnostic drift\".29 Specifically, diagnostic coding of AMI during hospitaliza-tions may have increased as a result of changes in reimburse-ment practices and by the use of more sensitive biomarkers ofinfarction. 24,29 Temporal-trend estimates of AMI based on ICD codes have shown steady rates4,21over the past several decades. In contrast, AMI-ECG rates in our study sample declined by /H1101550% from 1960 to 1999. AMI-ECG represents a relatively \"unbiased\" estimate of AMI that has not been influenced by the advent of increasingly sensitive biomarkersof infarction in recent decades. 17Not surprisingly, AMI- marker rates in our study increased over this same time period in a manner consistent with prior data in the WHO-MONICATable 4.

The proportion of overall AMI diagnosed by ECG (68%) was similar to figures reported in a prior report from the Minnesota Heart Survey.17That investigation concluded that incident AMI-ECG rates were steady from 1975 to 1985 and declined from 1985 to 1995.17We extend these findings by providing data from 2 additional decades of observation. Ourresults demonstrate a 50% to 60% decline in AMI-ECG ratesfrom 1960 to 1999. AMI-ECG likely represents a more advanced form of MI; declines demonstrated in out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death 2,12,32-34 (attributable to im- proved primary prevention efforts)32have likely contributed to some degree to the declines in the incidence of AMI-ECG. Another possible explanation for the decline in AMI-ECG and the relative rise in AMI-marker may have to do with decreases in time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalpresentation and treatment (data from the National Registryof Myocardial Infarction), 35which are thought to be due to public health education efforts and guideline implementation,which have collectively stressed the need to decrease door- to-intervention time for AMI. 35On the other hand, other studies of community-based individuals and clinical trial participants have shown no temporal declines in prehospital delay during AMI.36-38 Case Fatality Rates Our finding that AMI case fatality declined from 1960 to 1999 is consistent with studies conducted in the United Figure 3. Up to 5-year case fatality after overall AMI (A), after AMI-ECG by decade (B), and after AMI-marker by decade (C), with the major biomarker used during each decade.1208 Circulation March 10, 2009 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on November 16, 2009 circ.ahajournals.org Downloaded from States1,3,4,23 and Europe22that demonstrated declines in over- all AMI case fatality over the past 20 to 40 years. Several studies have demonstrated that out-of-hospital sudden cardiacdeath has declined substantially over the past several de-cades. 2,12,32-34 We extend these findings by demonstrating that case fatality rates after AMI-ECG and after AMI-markerhave declined to a similar degree. Prior studies have suggested that improvements in primary prevention account for 40% to 50% of the reduction in CHDmortality in the Unites States from 1968 to 2000. 6,10Our finding of a 50% decline in incidence of first AMI using anAMI definition for which bias is inherently low (ie, AMI-ECG) implies that primary prevention efforts also haveinfluenced the incidence of AMI. Strengths and Limitations The availability of 4 decades of physician-validated AMI andcase fatality data and the ability to separate AMI-ECG andAMI-marker are unique strengths of our investigation. In-deed, AMI diagnosis relying on ICD coding may have asensitivity of only 60% compared with physician-validatedAMI diagnosis. 39Our adjudication committee had access to simultaneous ECG and biomarker information; therefore, theECG adjudication could have been biased by knowledge ofbiomarker information. However, we believe that if such abias were introduced, it would have biased results toward agreater proportion of AMI-ECG over time. We could notseparate the contribution of specific biomarkers to AMIdiagnosis among AMI-marker cases. Our study sample islargely white of European descent; therefore, our findingsmay not be applicable to other ethnic groups or othergeographic regions. We had a relatively small number ofevents when sex, specific age groups, and 4 time periods areconsidered, possibly limiting our statistical power to detect differences. We had a limited number of subjects in each sex,age group, and time period. We did not provide confidenceintervals for the trend analyses for the incidence rates ofAMI-ECG and AMI-marker; in addition, because of limitedstatistical power, we did not test the interaction term of MItype with time period. Implications of our Findings The diagnosis of AMI is evolving; therefore, it is a challenge to accurately characterize the \"true\" epidemiology of AMI.However, our data demonstrate that although AMI-ECG rateshave declined, this decline was offset by rising AMI-markerrates. Because the most sensitive biomarkers (ie, troponin) were not available in the earlier study decades (1960s to1980s), AMI-marker earlier on may have been underdiag- nosed. Regardless, the advent of increasingly sensitive bi-omarkers for AMI diagnosis has substantially influencedAMI detection rates in the United States over the past severaldecades. Conclusions Over the past 40 years, AMI-ECG rates have declined by 50% and AMI-marker rates have doubled, offering a possibleexplanation for apparently steady national rates of overall AMI in the face of improvements in primary prevention.Source of Funding This work was supported by National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute contract N01-HC-25195.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE Whereas the prevalence of coronary heart disease risk factors has declined over past decades in the United States, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rates have been steady. Because the diagnosis of AMI is evolving, it is a challenge tocharacterize the \"true\" epidemiology of AMI accurately. Among Framingham Heart Study participants, we found that over the past 40 years, rates of AMI diagnosed by ECG have declined by 50%, whereas rates of AMI diagnosed by biomarkers have doubled. The advent of increasingly sensitive biomarkers for AMI diagnosis has substantially influenced AMIdetection rates in the United States over the past several decades. Our findings offer an explanation for the apparentlysteady national AMI rates in the face of improvements in primary prevention.1210 Circulation March 10, 2009 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on November 16, 2009 circ.ahajournals.org Downloaded from CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDY Breastfeeding in Infancy and Adult Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Nisha I.

ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Public health recommendations advocate breastfeeding in infancy as a means to reduce obesity in later life. Several prior studies relating breastfeeding to cardiovascular risk factors have been limited by lack of adjustment for maternal and participant confounding factors. METHODS: We ascertained breastfeeding history via questionnaire from mothers enrolled in the Framing- ham Offspring Study. In their young to middle-aged adult children enrolled in the Framingham Third Generation, we examined the relations between maternal breastfeeding history (yes, no) and cardiovascular risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total choles- terol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. We applied generalized estimating equations to account for sibling correlations and adjusted for maternal and partic- ipant lifestyle, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: In Third Generation participants (n /H11005962, mean age /H1100541 years, 54% were women), 26% of their mothers reported breastfeeding. Compared with non-breastfed individuals, breastfed adult participants had lower multivariable-adjusted BMI (26.1 kg/m2vs 26.9 kg/m2,P/H11005.04) and higher HDL cholesterol levels (HDL 56.6 mg/dL vs 53.7 mg/dL, P/H11005.01). On additional adjustment for BMI, the association between breastfeeding and HDL cholesterol was attenuated ( P/H11005.09). Breastfeeding was not associated with total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding in infancy is inversely associated with adult BMI and positively associated with HDL cholesterol. Associations between breastfeeding and BMI may mediate the association between breastfeeding and HDL cholesterol. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous stud- ies have demonstrated that breastfeeding in infancy can lead to small reductions in adolescent and adult blood pressure levels,4,6,11decreased total cholesterol and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in adult- hood,4,5,8and modest decreases in adult body mass index (BMI).4Funding: Supported by a National Institute of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, contract N01-HC-25195, 2K24 HL 04334 (RSV).

We hypothesized that breastfeeding in infancy would be protective for cardiovascular disease risk factors, but that these associations would be attenuated after accounting for maternal and participant socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Sample Participants for this study were part of the Third Generation cohort of the Framingham Heart Study; their mothers were members of the Offspring cohort. The Original Framingham Heart Study Cohort13and Framingham Offspring cohorts have been described.14Between July 1996 and May 1997, a breast health survey was mailed to Offspring cohort women that included questions regarding breastfeeding history of each of their children. The design and selection criteria for women chosen to receive the breast health survey have been described.15Briefly, women free of breast cancer with a rst-degree female relative enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study were sampled on the basis of 1 of 3 criteria: women having a mother or sister with documented breast cancer; women having a mother or sister with a non-gyne- cologic cancer; and women with mothers or sisters free of documented cancer. A total of 683 participants (77%) re- turned the questionnaire (Figure). Among these 683 offspring participants, participants were excluded who completed the questionnaire who did not have a child (n /H1100560), whose children did not attend the Third Generation study (n /H11005142), or who returned the questionnaire with incomplete or inconsistent information (n/H1100588). Because of these exclusion criteria, only 393 (44%) of the offspring women survey sample were included in the analysis. These 393 mothers provided the source for the Third Generation cohort participants (n /H11005962) (Figure). The393 offspring women included in this study when compared with offspring women with children enrolled in the Third Generation cohort who are not included in this study (n /H11005 1114) had similar cardiovascular disease risk factor proles at enrollment in the Framingham Heart Study with the exception of a slightly higher diastolic blood pressure (77 vs 75 mm Hg) and lower rates of cigarette smoking (42% vs 53%) (P /H11021.05) (Appen- dix, available online). The Boston University Medical Center Institu- tional Review Board approved the main study protocols for the Fra- mingham Offspring and Third Gen- eration cohort, and all participants signed written informed consent. Risk Factor Collection In the current study, we used in- formation on cardiovascular risk factors from the rst and second offspring examinations (Offspring cohort mothers) and the rst Third Generation examination (adult progeny). Details regarding the ascer- tainment of risk factors have been described.16Diabetes was dened as fasting plasma glucose /H11350126 mg/dL or treatment with either insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Lipids were measured on 12-hour fasting venous blood samples col- lected in tubes containing 0.1% EDTA. Plasma was sepa- rated by ultracentrifugation, and plasma lipid concentrations (total cholesterol and HDL-C) were measured as previously described.17HDL-C was measured after precipitation of apo B-containing lipoproteins, and low-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol concentrations were estimated using the Friedewald formula.18Intra-assay coefcients of variation for the Third Generation cohort cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-den- and 3.0%, respectively.

Our study suggests that the benets of breastfeeding extend beyond childhood to adult health outcomes. Figure Creation of study sample based on Framingham Off- spring (maternal) breastfeeding information.657 Parikh et al Breastfeeding and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factorsa trained physician after the participant had rested for 5 minutes, and the average of 2 physician-obtained readings was used. Hypertension was dened as systolic blood pres- sure/H11350140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure /H1135090 mm Hg, or use of blood pressure-lowering medications. Medication use was ascertained by physicians by detailed review of participant medication lists, and Third Generation partici- pants were asked to bring medication bottles to the clinic examination, including lipid-lowering medications, oral contraceptive pills, and hormone therapy use. Participants were considered to be current smokers if they smoked at least 1 cigarette per day for the year before examination. Categories of BMI were dened according to National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization guidelines19,20as follows: normal weight obese (/H1135030 kg/m2). Data regarding highest educational degree obtained were gathered via question- naire and categorized as follows: high school diploma or equivalent or less, Associate's degree/junior college, Bach- elor's degree, and Master's degree or doctorate. The phys- ical activity index was reflective of physical activity performed in a typical 24-hour period using a structured questionnaire that asked participants to report the number of hours asleep; at rest; and in slight, moderate, and heavy activity in a typical day.21,22 Moderate-to heavy alcohol intake was dened as consump- tion of more than 14 drinks per week in men or 7 drinks per week in women. Prevalent cardiovascular disease was de- ned as recognized myocardial infarction, coronary insuf- ciency (prolonged pain accompanied ischemic electrocardiographic changes), angina pectoris, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intermittent claudica- tion using previously described criteria.23 Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics of Third Generation participant char- acteristics were grouped by maternal breastfeeding status (age- and sex-adjusted generalized estimated equation mod- els were used to compare characteristics of participants by breastfeeding status). Descriptive statistics of maternal charac- teristics were presented according to whether mothers breastfed none, some, or all of their children. We examined cardiovascular risk factors described above as end points in the Third Generation Cohort. No cardiovascular events were examined in our study sample. Generalized estimated equation models were used to assess relations between di- chotomous (ever vs never) breastfeeding status and the following Third Generation participant cardiovascular dis- ease risk factors: BMI, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The intraclass correlation of BMI was 0.02 (P /H11005.47) among Third Generation Cohort siblings. We applied generalized estimated equation models to account for related observations given the presence of siblings in the Third Generation cohort. Statistical models were constructed with adjustment for the following: model 1\u2014age, sex, hypertension treatment, lipid treatment, smok-ing status, birth order, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement use, physical activity index, and education level; model 2\u2014model 1 covariates plus maternal smoking status, maternal education level, and maternal BMI at study entry. In secondary analyses, the dependent variable BMI was additionally adjusted for HDL cholesterol level, and the outcome HDL cholesterol was additionally adjusted for the following covariates: participant BMI, participant alcohol intake, and maternal HDL cholesterol. We also analyzed the dependent variables of cardiovascular disease risk factors dichotomously using clinically meaningful cut points. We tested potential effect modication by educational level. Finally, to assess the association of breastfeeding in infancy with an overall healthy lifestyle, we related breastfeeding status with participant higher education, smoking status, and physical activity. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statis- tical software (version 8.1). A Pvalue of less than .05 was considered to be statistically signicant. RESULTS Third Generation Participant Characteristics Study sample characteristics grouped by breastfeeding sta- tus are shown in Table 1. Twenty-six percent of participants were reported by mothers to have been breastfed in infancy. Of those individuals who were breastfed, the median breast- feeding duration was 4 months (range 1-22 months), and 29.6% were breastfed for more than 6 months. A higher prevalence of breastfed individuals had higher education levels and a lower prevalence of diabetes (Table 1). Maternal Characteristics Characteristics of mothers by whether they breastfed none, all, or some of their children are shown in Table 2. Mothers who breastfed all of their children also had the highest educa- tion levels, were the leanest, and were least likely to smoke. Breastfeeding Status and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adulthood In model 1, which adjusted for participant cardiovascular disease risk factors, physical activity, and education, breast- feeding (ever vs never) was associated with a lower BMI (P/H11005.03) (Table 3). Additionally adjusting for maternal factors in model 2 (maternal smoking, education, and BMI) did not materially change the association between breast- feeding status and BMI (P /H11005.04; adjusted mean BMI among those breastfed vs not breastfed was 26.1 vs 26.9 kg/m2, respectively). In model 1, adjusting for participant cardiovascular dis- ease risk factors, physical activity, and education, breast- feeding was associated with a higher HDL cholesterol level (P/H11005.01). Additionally adjusting for maternal factors (smoking, education, and maternal BMI) did not materially change the association between breastfeeding status and HDL cholesterol level (P /H11005.01; adjusted mean HDL cho-658 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 122, No 7, July 2009lesterol concentrations among those breastfed vs not breast- fed were 56.6 mg/dL relative to 53.7 mg/dL, respectively). Breastfeeding (ever vs never) was not associated with participant total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glu- cose, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure in either model 1 or model 2 (Table 3). Secondary Analyses Association between Breastfeeding Status and Body Mass Index and High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Categories. Breastfeeding was inversely associated with low HDL cholesterol levels (/H1102140 mg/dL in men and /H1102150 mg/dL in women) even after accounting for participant and maternal cardiovascular disease risk factors, lifestyle, and socioeconomic characteristics (multivariable-adjusted oddsratio/H110050.63 [0.42-0.96], P/H11005.03) (Table 4). Breastfeeding was not signicantly associated with any other dichoto- mized risk factors in fully adjusted models. (Table 4). Additional Model Adjustments. Additionally adjusting multivariable model 2 for participant alcohol intake did not materially change the positive association between breast- feeding status and HDL cholesterol. Similarly, additionally adjusting model 2 for maternal HDL cholesterol did not materially change the positive association between breast- feeding status and HDL cholesterol. Effect Modication. There was no evidence of effect mod- ication by educational level on the associations between breastfeeding with HDL or with BMI. Association between Breastfeeding and Healthy Life- style. In fully adjusted models there were no signicant associations between breastfeeding and having achieved a Bachelor's or higher degree (odds ratio /H110051.20 [0.84-1.72]), having a physical activity score of 37 or more (1.20 [0.84- 1.73]), or current cigarette smoking (1.17 [0.75-1.52]). DISCUSSION Summary of Findings In a community-based sample of 962 men and women in early to middle age, maternal report of breastfeeding was associated with modestly lower participant BMI and higher participant HDL cholesterol concentrations. Maternal report of breastfeeding was not signicantly associated with off- spring total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, or systolic or diastolic blood pressure levels. Breastfeeding was associated with higher mean HDL cholesterol concen- trations even after accounting for participant and maternal education, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, the association between maternal breast- feeding and participant HDL cholesterol appeared to be attenuated by adjustment for participant BMI. Breastfeeding and Body Mass Index In keeping with our data, prior studies have found an inverse association between breastfeeding in infancy and adolescent and adult adiposity.4,7,12,24-27Higher growth rates in early infancy among formula-fed compared with breastfed infants have been demonstrated in randomized trials of low birth weight and preterm infants,28as well as in observational studies among normal birth weight babies.29-31In contrast with some prior reports, a signicant attenuation in the association between breastfeeding and lower BMI was not found on adjustment for maternal and participant socioeco- nomic status dened using educational attainment. Further- more, a moderately heritable trait,32yet adjustment maternal BMI did not signicantly diminish the associ- ations. One prior study also demonstrated a signicant in- verse association between breastfeeding and childhoodTable 1 Third Generation Participant Characteristics by Breastfeeding Status CharacteristicsThird Generation Participant Breastfeeding Status Means (SD) or (%)No n/H11005712Yes Age (y) 41/H1100674 1 /H110069 Women Birth order (among siblings) 2.4/H110011.4 2.0 /H110061.2 Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 117 /H1100615 118 /H1100615 Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 76 /H1100610 75 /H1100610 Fasting blood glucose (mg/dL) 95 /H1100619.5 94 Total (mg/dL) /H1100614 Physical activity index 37.6/H110068 37.6 /H110068 Hypertension, % 7.8 8.0 Lipid treatment, % 5.9 7.2 Diabetes mellitus, % 3.0 1.2 Obesity (BMI /H1135030), % 23.5 20.4 Overweight ( 25 /H11349BMI/H1102130), Total cholesterol /H11022200, % 36.3 Triglyceride /H11022150, % 21.4 16.0 Fasting glucose /H11022126, % 2.7 0.8 Oral contraceptive use, % 20.4 14.8 Hormone replacement therapy use, % 3.8 3.2 Smoking, % 17.0 15.3 Moderate alcohol intake,b% 15.4 18.2 Education levela High school or less, % 17.5 9.6 Some college, % 32.3 30.9 Bachelor's degree, % 35.7 41.0 /H110227 drinks per week in women and /H1102214 drinks per week in men.659 Parikh et al Breastfeeding and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factorsoverweight even after adjusting for maternal obesity.33Our BMI data were ascertained directly in both mothers and study sample participants rather than self-reported.12Self- reported data used in prior studies may have led to some outcome misclassication with resultant biasing of mea- sures toward the null value. Finally, our study was con- ducted in a sample unselected for sex and occupation, incontrast with prior investigations conducted among female registered nurses.12 Exact mechanisms by which breast milk confers protec- tion against offspring weight gain are not known, but ag- gregate data from several recent studies suggest that adipo- kines may potentially mediate the association.

If we do not account for multiple testing, then /H9251/H110210.05 is signicant.

A recent study in a British birth cohort born in 1958 did not demonstrate an association between breast- feeding for more than 1 month and adult levels of HDL cholesterol.27A Dutch prospective study of adults aged 48 to 53 years demonstrated a lower total to HDL cholesterol ratio among breastfed compared with formula-fed individ- uals.8In a randomized prospective study of feeding among preterm infants, serum total to HDL cholesterol ratio mea- sured in adolescence was lower among those previously randomized to banked donated breast milk compared with formula feeding.39Choice of Covariates for Adjustment We thought it was particularly important to adjust for edu- cation, BMI, and smoking status. Breastfeeding is more prevalent among women with a higher education, which in turn is associated with a number of positive health indica- tors, including increased HDL cholesterol,40lower BMI,41 and abstinence from smoking. Lower BMI and abstinence from smoking in turn are associated with higher HDL cho- lesterol levels.42 Breastfeeding and Other Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors The absence of a signicant association between breastfeed- ing in infancy and later-life blood pressure in our sample is consistent with several prior investigations that did not nd a signicant association between breastfeeding and adult blood pressure.8,43,44Furthermore, ndings from a recent meta-analysis of several previously published studies raise the concern that the inverse association between breastfeed- ing and blood pressure from other studies may have been subject to selection or publication bias.6 We found no association between breastfeeding status and fasting blood glucose levels. This is in keeping with prior studies in adolescents45and middle-aged men4show- ing no association between breastfeeding in infancy and later-life insulin resistance (as measured by homeostasis model assessment). We did not specically study differ- ences in rates of diabetes by breastfeeding status because the prevalence of diabetes was too low in our sample for meaningful analysis. Given the lack of association between breastfeeding sta- tus and several cardiovascular disease risk factors studied, we assessed our statistical power to detect modest effects for associations between breastfeeding and the cardiovas- cular disease risk factors for which we did not detect sig- nicant associations. Taking sibling correlation into ac- count, we had 80% power to detect a systolic blood pressure difference of 2.9 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure difference of 2.0 mm Hg, total cholesterol difference of 7.0 mg/dL, triglyceride difference of 17.2 mg/dL, and fasting glucose difference of 2.9 mg/dL. We had more modest power to detect smaller mean differences. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS Direct and routine assessment of cardiovascular risk factors for 2 generations of participants to account for both mater- nal covariates and offspring cardiovascular disease risk fac- tors is a unique strength of our study. Risk factors were measured in offspring in adulthood, whereas most prior reports examined the relation of breastfeeding to childhood risk factors. Several limitations should be acknowledged as well. Breastfeeding assessment was done decades after the birth of participants, which could have led to recall bias. However, the recall of whether or not a women breastfed her child has been shown to be accurate for /H1135020 years later.46Furthermore, our study relied on maternal comparedTable 4 Odds Ratios for Dichotomized Adulthood Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors by Breastfeeding Status in Infancy Model 1aModel 2b OR sex, hypertension treatment, lipid treat- ment, smoking status, birth order, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement use, physical activity, and education level. bModel 2 covariates: model 1 variables plus maternal smoking status, maternal education level, and maternal BMI at study entry.661 Parikh et al Breastfeeding and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factorswith self-reported breastfeeding history, which has been demonstrated to be more accurate.47We did not adjust for other components of infant diet or account for birth weight in our multivariable analysis. It has been demonstrated that low birth weight infants tend to breastfeed for shorter du- rations and tend to have rapid catch-up growth, which is associated with later-life obesity.48We also did not account for paternal factors because not all Third Generation partic- ipants have fathers in the Framingham Offspring cohort. Our study participants are of white European ancestry; therefore, these ndings may not be generalizable to other ethnic populations. We accounted for socioeconomic status by means of highest education degree obtained, which might not have fully accounted for socioeconomic differ- ences.49HDL subfractions, which have demonstrated accu- racy in predicting cardiovascular disease,50were not mea- sured in this study. Although the incubation period between exposure and outcome in our study is relatively long, it is being increasingly recognized that exposures in early life affect adult health. In turn, evidence suggests that choles- terol and BMI measured in middle age confer later higher lifetime cardiovascular disease risk.51 Potential selection bias from the breast health survey sampling scheme cannot be excluded; however, Offspring mothers with adult children enrolled in the Third Generation cohort not included in our study did not differ with respect to BMI and HDL cholesterol levels from the Offspring mothers included in the study. Because the alternatives to breastfeeding in the 1960s and 1970s differed from what is available today, these comparisons might not be relevant to current long-term breastfeeding effects. We did not assess the exclusivity of breastfeeding within our study framework and were unable to carry out an analysis of risk factor levels among siblings discordant for breastfeeding because we had few of these in our study sample to permit a meaningful analysis. A discordant sibling pair analysis may have per- mitted better control of unmeasured potentially confounding maternal and family level factors. We did not account for the dietary intake of participants (ie, fat, carbohydrate, and protein intake). We may have limited power to detect very modest differences in blood pressure, total cholesterol, trig- lycerides, and fasting glucose. We did not account for mul- tiple testing in our interpretation of results. By using the most conservative approach, given that model 1 and model 2 adjustments were highly correlated, and there were 7 separate dependent variables, the Bonferroni correction would have yielded an /H9251level for signicance of 0.05/7 /H11005 0.007. Finally, this is an observational study, and therefore we cannot infer causality. IMPLICATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY Our ndings conrm previous reports of a protective asso- ciation between breastfeeding and later-life adiposity (as measured by BMI). Although the net reductions in BMI demonstrated in our study are modest, the benecial effectat the population level may have important public health relevance. The risk of death from cardiovascular disease and congestive heart failure has been demonstrated to increase even with small incremental increases in BMI,52,53suggest- ing that even modest differences in excess adiposity may increase cardiovascular disease mortality risks. Further- more, the mechanisms underlying the association between lower adulthood BMI among individuals breastfed in in- fancy are arguably of considerable importance. Our ndings taken in conjunction with recent experimental evidence linking adipokines to breast milk and infant weight suggest that further elucidating mechanisms relating nutrition in early life and cardiometabolic risk factor prole in later life is an important area of research. Furthermore, informed decisions about whether or not to breastfeed affect more than 4 million women annually54who give birth in the United States. Thus, understanding the association of breastfeeding with cardiovascular disease risk factors in later life remains an important public health issue. CONCLUSIONS Breastfeeding in infancy was associated with a modestly reduced BMI and elevated HDL cholesterol levels in adult- hood after accounting for several participant and maternal characteristics. The association between breastfeeding and HDL cholesterol was attenuated on accounting for partici- pant BMI. Studies elucidating the mechanisms underlying nutrition in early life and adiposity in later life are warranted. References 1. Gartner LM, Morton J, Lawrence RA, et al.

The strongest signal was at 9q31.2 ( P\u00bc1.7/C210/C09), TAL2 andZNF462 . near the LIN28B gene (rs7759938; P\u00bc7.0/C210/C09), which also influences adult height. We provide the rst evidence for common genetic variants influencing female sexual maturation. Menarche is the start of menstruation and occurs at a mean age of approximately 13 years, normally about 2 years after the onset of puberty1. Twin and family studies suggest a signicant genetic component to menarcheal age, with at least 50% heritability2-4. Linkage and candidate gene studies have not conrmed any loci that influence normal variation in age at menarche4,5.

As earlier age at menarche is associated with shorter stature and obesity, the identied variants may not only clarify the genetic control of female sexual maturation but may also point to regulatory mechanisms involved in normal human growth and obesity. We carried out a meta-analysis of 17,510 females from eight different population-based cohorts: Suscept-ibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik), Atherosclerosis Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Amish HAPI Heart Study, InCHIANTI Study, Rotterdam Study Iand II and TWINS UK Study ( Supplementary Note online). Women of European descent, with self-reported age at menarchebetween 9 and 17 years (representing the 1st to 99th percentile, withmean age at menarche of 13.12 (s.d. 1.5) years), were included. Agreement between adult-recalled and prospectively collected age at menarche is reported to be good ( kstatistic \u00bc0.81) 6.E a c hs t u d y conducted a GWA analysis using linear regression or linear mixed- effects models with an additive genetic model adjusting for birth year or birth cohort (FHS), with additional adjustments for population structure when appropriate. Approximately 2.55 million autosomal SNPs, imputed with reference to the HapMap CEU panel, passed quality control criteria. We then conducted a meta-analysis using a xed-effects model based on inverse variance weighting. Full details ofcohorts and methods are given in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Methods online. Twenty-eight SNPs passed the conventional genome-wide signi- /C08a n dw e r ea te i t h e r9 q 3 1 . 2o r6 q 2 1 (Supplementary Table 2 andSupplementary Fig. 1 online). The 18 SNPs on chromosome 9 were in linka ge disequilibrium (LD), with r24 0.31, as were the 10 SNPs on chromosome 6, with r240.96 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ). T o identify more than one signal that could account for the association ndings, w e carried out conditional analysis adjusting for the SNP with the lowest Pvalue in the region (rs7759938 for chromosome 6 and rs2090409 for chromosome 9). Within 1 Mb flanking each SNP , the lowest adjusted Pvalues for association with ageat menarche were P\u00bc0.0017 and P\u00bc0.0077 for chromosomes 9 (1,030 SNPs) and 6 (775 SNPs), respectively. These ndings suggest a single signal accounting for the associ ations at each locus. The quantile- quantile plot ( Supplementary Fig. 2 online) showed modest deviation away from the null when these top two signals were removed, suggest- ing the presence of additional loci for this trait. The strongest signal at 9q31.2 was observed with rs2090409, where each A allele was associated with approximately a 5-week reduction inmenarcheal age ( P\u00bc1.7/C210 /C09). All studies showed consistent evidence of association with the same direction of effect in all but one study, similar effect sizes and Pvalues between 0.8 and 0.0003 (Table 1 ). The recombination region containing rs2090409 includes only a hypothetical gene ( BC039487 ). Outside of this, the only RefSeq gene within a 1-Mb window is a transmembrane protein gene,TMEM38B , which is approximately 400 kb proximal to the GWAS signal. In mice, TMEM38B is expressed strongly in brain and the null mutation is neonatal lethal. Within 2 Mb of the signal, genes includeSLC44A1 ,FKTN ,FSD1L ,TAL2 and ZNF462 , none of which is an obvious candidate gene for involvement in menarche. However, a SNP inZNF462 , 650 kb from our signal but not in LD ( r 2\u00bc0.086), has been previously associated with variation in height6. The 6q21 signal was within a recombination interval that included only one gene, LIN28B (Fig. 1 )a n dw a sa l s oa s s o c i a t e dw i t h approximately a 5-week reduction in menarcheal age per T allele (rs7759938; P\u00bc7.0/C210/C09). The effect was consistent across all studies, with Pvalues between 0.27 and 0.001 ( Table 1 ). A common variant in the LIN28B gene has previously been associated with normal variation in adult height7. The most signicant menarche-associated variant (rs7759938) and the previously reported height variant (rs314277) lie within 28.7 kb of each other and are likely to represent t h es a m es i g n a l ,a s r2\u00bc0.26 and D\u00a2\u00bc1 in HapMap. The allele associated with earlier age at menarche is associated with decreased height, which is consistent with epidemiological data. Early menarche has been correlated with reduced stature, and the mechanism is probably mediated through earlier exposure to estrogens resulting in earlier closure of the epiphyseal plates8.W et h e r e f o r et e s t e da l lTable 1 Genome-wide signicant associations with age at menarche SNP 0.34 1.01 -0.08 0.04 individual-study genomic control inflation factors.

Six of the alleles were also associated with menarcheal age ( Po0.05), with the strongest associations at LIN28B (P\u00bc0.0001) and PXMP3 (P\u00bc0.003) (Supplementary Table 3 online). We also tested the association of the newly identied menarche-associated variant, rs7759938, with measured height in our study population ( Supplementary Methods ) a n df o u n dt h a ti tw a sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hh e i g h t , Pmeta\u00bc0.0001, in the same direction in all but one study; that is, the C allele was associatedwith reduction in age at menarche and also reduced stature. Thepublished height SNP (rs314277) did not reach nominal signicance with height in our study ( P meta\u00bc0.26). These data suggest that some of the previously identied loci that influence adult height may also have a general role in adolescent growth. At a given chronologic age, girls with earlier age at menarche tend to have greater body mass index (BMI) and adiposity than girlswith a later age at menarche 10-12. A marked secular decline in age at menarche occurred in Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which has been attributed to improved nutrition and health1. This trend may be continuing as a consequence of the obesity epidemic13and may involve a common metabolic response to the current nutritional environment14or be attributable, at least in part, to shared genetic influences or pleiotropy15.W et h e r e f o r ei n v e s t i g a t e d the effect on menarcheal age of the ten currently known common gene variants associated with variation in BMI. Of these ten loci, eight showed an association in the direction consistent with epidemiological data ( P\u00bc1.6/C210/C06, based on Fisher's P) nominally signicant ( Po0.05) ( Supplementary Table 4 online). The two loci with the largest observed effects on BMI ( FTO and TMEM18 ) also had the strongest evidence for association with menarcheal age (P\u00bc0.0008 and 7.0 /C210/C05, respectively). This study provides the rst evidence for common genetic variants influencing normal variation in the timing of female sexual matura- tion. Our ndings also indicate a genetic basis for the phenotypic associations between age at menarche and both height and BMI.Note: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Genetics website.

The ques tion asked to determine age at menarche was: \" At what age did your menstrual periods begin? \" Women answering between 9 and 17 years were included in the analys es. Height was measured at their first visit to the Reykjavik Study (1967 - 1997) when subjects were a mean age of approximately 50 years. ARIC: A reproductive history questionnaire was administered to all women at the baseline (1987-1989) visit. The following question was asked to determine age at menarche: \" At approximately what age were you when your menstrual periods started? \" Responses were given to the closest whole year value (11, 12, 13, etc). Mean age at menarche among ARIC White women was 12.88 (SD 1.54). He ight was obtained during the baseline clinic visit by trained technicians. FHS : At the second Offspring examination (1979 to 1982) and at the first Third Generation examination (2002 to 2005), women were asked, \"Age at start of menses\" and \" How old were you when you had your first menstrual period (menses)?\" respectively . The self-reported age at first period was recorded. Offspring women were asked agai n about menarche at the time of participation in the Frami ngham Osteoporosis Study (1996 - 2001: \"About how old were you when you had your first menstrual period?\" ). If menarche data were missing from Offspring examination two, the self-reported data from the Osteoporosis examination was used (n=214). There were 1777 Offspring Cohort and 2024 Third Generation women who reported an age at menarche between 9 and 17 y ears with genotyping available. The mean age at menarche was 12.8 years (SD 1.5 years) in the combined Offspring and Third Generation women in the sample. Height was measured by tr ained technicians at the first Offspring and Third Generation examinations. HAPI Heart Study : During the baseline vis it, women were given a reproductive history questionnaire. The self reported age at first period was recorded from the question \" How old were you when you had your first menstrual period?\" InCHIANTI : During baseline visit women were asked \" How old were you when you had your first menstrual period? \" RSI and RSII : At the first RSI interview (1989-1993) and at the first RSII interview (200- 2001) women were asked \" How old were you when you had your first menstrual period? \". Self-reported age at menarche was availa ble for 3,175 (RSI) and 1,000 (RSII) women. Mean age at menarche for the RSI cohort was 13.5 (S D 1.6 years) and 13.3 (SD 1.5 years) for RSII. TwinsUK: Data on age at menarche was obtained by self-administered questionnaire. All females from the TwinsUK cohort were asked a question \"how old were you when you had your first menstrual period?\" There were 5523 female twins reporting their age at menarche. Of them, 2276 females of European descent (458 MZ pairs, 548 DZ pairs, and 264 singletons) had genotyping data available a nd included in the analysis. The mean age at menarche was 12.99 years with SD=1.55 (range 9-17). 10 Nature Genetics: doi:10.1038/ng.386Genotyping and Imputation There were four different ge notyping platform used by the eight cohort studies: array and the 500K in combination with the 50K supplemental array (FHS) and the Illumina Infinium II Human Hap 550 SNP chip array (InCH IANTI, RSI, RSII). Each study performed genotyping quality control checks based on duplicate sample genotyping, SNP call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, Mendelian inconsis tencies, and sex mismatch, and principle components methods were used to evaluate the presence of population st ratification (details provided in Supplementary Table 1 ). Because there were only about 55,000 overlapping SNPs from the four genotyping platforms, each study imputed 2.5 million HapMap SNPs for each participant using currently and TwinsUK used IMPUTE ( 2) for the expected number of minor alleles. Imputation quality was determined by either the r2 value produced by MACH or calculated empirical variance divided by the expected variance (oevar) and for SNPTEST the 'proper info' output variable was used to determine imputation quality. SNP imputation methods and quality control procedures for each cohort are included in Supplementary Table 1 . Statistical Analysis AGES: Analysis was preformed using linear regr ession against the imputed genotype dosage with the ProbABEL Birthyear was included as a covariate. ARIC: Population stratification was estimat ed using principal component methods (EIGENSTRAT)(1), after removing few related individuals. Two principal components were significantly associated with age at menarche in linear regression models (alpha=0.05) and so they were included, along with year of birth and study center, as covariates in the genetic analyses. We used linear regression models and assumed additive genetic effects to study the association of imputed and genotyped SNPs (dos age data) and age of menarche. The analyses were implemented in the ProbABEL package from the ABEL set of programs (http://mga.bionet.nsc.ru/ yurii/ABEL/ )(2). FHS : SNP weights for 10 principal components (P Cs) were inferred using a maximal set of independent individuals; the PCs for the remain ing individuals were computed using the SNP weights obtained from the unrelated set of individuals. The first PC (PC1) was significantly associated with age at menarche (P<0.01), and therefore was included as a covariate in all SNP association analyses. In addition, we adju sted for birth cohort by decade. Linear mixed effects models were used to account for familial correlations. Each SNP was tested for association with age at menarche us ing an additive genetic model. HAPI Heart Study : Analysis was performed using in house developed software. In brief, we performed a measured genotype appr oach utilizing a t-test of the beta coefficient for the SNP variable. We included birth year as a fixed covariates in the model and a polygenic component modeled as a random effect to acco unt for the full 13-14 generation pedigree of the Amish. A total of 338,598 autosomal SNPs were used for imputation after applying filters: (1) not in HapMap, (2) frequency < 0.01, (3) Hardy-Weinberg p-value < 1 x 10 6, and (4) missingness > 0.05. 11 Nature Genetics: doi:10.1038/ng.386 InCHIANTI : Analysis performed using linear dosage in SNPTEST (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~march ini/software/gwas/snptest). Bi rthyear was included as a covariate. RSI and RSII : Adjusted linear regression an alysis was done using MACH2QTL (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/ abecasis/MaCH/ ), birthyear as a Because of the relatedness in the Tw insUK cohort, we utilized the GenABEL software package(2) which is designed for GWAS analysis of family-based data by incorporating pair-wise kinship matrix calculated using ge notyping data in the polygenic model to correct relatedness and hidden populat ion stratification. The sc ore test implemented in the software was used to test the associa tion between a given SNP and the age at menarche with adjustment for a covariate. Meta-analysis: Menarche GWA Inverse variance meta-analysis of the 8 studies was performed using th e latest version of METAL ( http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal/index.html ). A SNP within a study was not included if the minor allele frequenc y (MAF) was < 1% or imputation quality score was < 0.4 for SNPTEST or < 0.3 for MACH in th at study. Genomic control was applied to the meta-analysis in METAL to correct for relatedness and popula (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal samples. Meta-analysis: Height SNPs Association statistics for measured adult height were calculated for rs2090409, rs314277 and rs7759938 in the same study samples used for the age at menarche genome wide analysis. The total number with measured height of the 17,510 menarche samples was 16,371. The fixed-effects weighted meta-analysis METAL.

The Reykjavik Study cohor t originally comprised a random sample of 30,795 men and women born in 1907-1935 and living in Reykjavik in 1967 (3). A total of 19,381 people participated in the Reykjavik Stud y examination, a 71% recruitment rate. The study sample was divided into six groups by bi rth year and birth date within month. One group was invited to particip ate in all subsequent examinations, while one group was designated as a control group and was not incl uded in examinations until 1991. Other groups were invited to participate in specific examinations of the study. Between 2002 and 2006, the AGES-Reykjavik Study re-examined 5764 surviv ors of the original Reykjavik Study. Successful genotyping was available for 1849 AGES women participants who were eligible for this study. The AGES-Reykjavik Study GW AS was approved by the National Bioethics Committee and the Data Protection Authority and also was covered under the MedStar Institutional Review Board. All subject s provided written informed consent. ARIC: The ARIC study is a multi-center prospectiv e investigation of at herosclerotic disease in a bi-racial population (4). White and Afri can American men and women aged 45-64 years at baseline were recruited from 4 communitie s: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburban areas of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland. A total of 15,792 individuals participated in the baseline examination in 1987-1989, with four follow-up examinations in approximate 3-year intervals, during 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998.

In 1971, Offspring of the Original Cohort participants and Offspring spouses including 2641 women (mean age 36 years) were enrolled into the Framingham Offs pring Study. Offspring participants have been examined approximately every 4 years (7,8) . From 2002 to 2005, 4095 adults including 2641 women (mean age 40 years) with at least one pare nt in the Offspring coho rt were enrolled in the Framingham Third Generation cohort (9). The Framingham Heart Study examinations were approved by the institutional review board at Boston University Medical Center. All participants provided writt en informed consent. HAPI Heart Study: The Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study was initiated in 2002. Participants of the HAPI Heart Study comprise d adults from the Old Order Amish community of Lancaster County, PA, who were recruited over a three-year period. Study participants were included if they were aged 20 years and older and considered to be relatively healthy based on excl usion criteria of severe hypertension (blood pressure > 180/105 mm Hg), malignancy, and kidney, liver or unt reated thyroid disease. The study aims and recruitment details, including ascertainment cr iteria, have been desc ribed previously (10). Physical examinations were conducted at the Am ish Research Clinic in Strasburg, PA and a reproductive health questionnaire was complete d by female participants. Women presenting pregnant or within 6 months postpar tum were excluded from the study. InCHIANTI : The InCHIANTI study is a population-based epidemiological study aimed at evaluating factors that influence mobility in the older population living in the Chianti region of Tuscany, Italy. Details of the study have been previously repor ted (11). Briefly, 1616 residents were selected from the population registry of Greve in Chianti (a rural area: 11 709 residents with 19.3% of the population greater than 65 years of age) and Bagno a Ripoli (Antella village near Florence ; 4704 inhabitants, with 20.3% gr eater than 65 years of age). The participation rate was 90% (n= 1453) and participants ranged between 21-102 years of age. The study protocol was approved by the Italian National Institute of Research and Care of Aging Institutional Review. There were 85 parent-offspring pairs, 6 sib-pairs and 2 halfsibling pairs documented. We investigated any further familial relationships using IBD of 10,000 random SNPs using RELPAIR and uncovere d 1 parent-offspring, 79 siblings and 13 half-sibling (12). We utilized the correct family structure inferred from genetic data for all analyses. RSI and RSII : Rotterdam Study I and II, ongoing prospective population-based cohort studies, focus on chronic disabling conditions of the elderly in the Netherlands. In summary, men and women aged 55 years or older, living in Ommoor d, a suburb of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were invited to participate (13). TwinsUK: The TwinsUK cohort consisted of a group of tw ins ascertained to study the heritability and genetics of age-related diseases ( www.twinsUK.ac.uk ). These unselected twins were recruited from the general popula tion through national media campaigns in the UK and shown to be comparable to age-matc hed population singletons in terms of disease- related and lifestyle characteristics (14,15). 16 Nature Genetics: doi:10.1038/ng.386Institutional Climate for Faculty A Study of the Relational Aspects of the Culture of Academic Medicine Linda Pololi, MBBS, MRCP, Peter Conrad, PhD, Sharon Knight, PhD, RN, and Phyllis Carr, MD Abstract PurposeThe impact of medical school culture onmedical students has been well studied,but little documentation exists regardinghow medical faculty experience the culturein which they work. In an ongoing project,the National Initiative on Gender, Cultureand Leadership in Medicine, the authorsare investigating how the existing cultureof academic medical institutions supportsall faculty members' ability to function attheir highest potential. Method The authors conducted a qualitativestudy of faculty in five disparate U.S.medical schools. Faculty in differentcareer stages and diverse specialties wereinterviewed regarding their perceptions and experiences in academic medicine.Analysis was inductive and data driven. Results Relational aspects of the culture emerged asa central theme for both genders across allcareer categories. Positive relationships weremost evident with patients and learners.Negative relational attributes among facultyand leadership included disconnection,competitive individualism, undervaluing ofhumanistic qualities, deprecation, disrespect,and the erosion of trust. Conclusions The data suggest that serious problemsexist in the relational culture and that suchproblems may affect medical faculty vitality, professionalism, and generalproductivity and are linked to retention.Efforts to create and support trustingrelationships in medical schools mightenhance all faculty members' efforts tooptimally contribute to the clinical,education, and research missions ofacademic medicine. Future work willdocument the outcomes of a five-schoolcollaboration to facilitate change in theculture to support the productivity of allmedical faculty. Acad Med. 2009; 84:106-114. A central task of medical schools is to help students, faculty, and medicalpractitioners learn how to form caring,healing relationships with patients andtheir communities and with each other.The educational environments, or theculture or milieu of work, reinforcelearning, teaching, and the practicingagenda or belie the very intent behindour work. 1Given the relevance ofrelational issues to health care, we describe our findings regarding therelational aspects of the culture ofacademic medicine. A rich literature on relationships between physicians and patients provides evidenceof the importance of trusting relationshipsfor enhancing patient care and clinicaloutcomes. 2-5In medical education, effective relationship formation and trustis pivotal in facilitating learning 6,7and is helpful for interdisciplinary clinicalpartnerships and multidisciplinaryresearch collaboration. In hospitals,positive interpersonal relationships havebeen linked to enhanced nurse andphysician performance. 8,9More recently, relationship-centered health care hasbeen linked to quality of care andorganizational performance. 10-12 In a report to the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges (AAMC), Inui 13 \"acknowledges the importance of themany relationships between individualsand positions in academic medicalcenters that embody our culture andaffect any strategic plan we might deviseor implement. In our organizations manyof these relationships are hierarchical innature and must be in play for anysystematic change to go forward ....Other key relationships that may express and shape professional values andbehaviors as well as medical organizational change include thoseamong peers (clinical, research,education) and others.\" Beyondmedicine, relational trust is a hallmark ofeffective education in middle schools 14;i n management and sociology studies,positive workplace relationships havebeen shown to benefit careers, 15and in business schools, relationships betweenfaculty have been shown to impactprofessional life beyond career benefits. 16 Respected analysts have expressedconcern about a conflict betweentraditional professional values and thecommercialism of medicine. 17-21Others have concluded that the development andfunding of new knowledge in thebiomedical and clinical sciences, and pressure to increase clinical\"productivity,\" are given priority, withless attention devoted to social activism,humanistic concerns, or facultydevelopment, and with educationalexcellence a less prestigious individualaccomplishment. 22-24To our knowledge, there has been little study of how currentchallenges in academic health centersDr. Pololi is senior scientist, Brandeis University, resident scholar, Women's Studies Research Center,and director, National Initiative of Gender, Cultureand Leadership in Medicine : C - Change, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts.

Although the focus of our overall research project has been on culturechange to support the advancement ofwomen and underrepresented minority(URM) faculty in academic medicine,this report is restricted to a centralemergent theme, the relational aspects ofthe culture of AHCs, as reflected in ourinterviews with faculty. Little work hasaddressed cultural changes that wouldcreate environments more appropriatefor taking full advantage of women andURM faculty's potential contributions,although one report did suggest thatcultural and organizational issues inacademic medicine contribute towomen's lack of advancement 25; outside medicine, a body of literature describesorganizational issues for women in theworkplace. 26,27 The purposes of this article are therefore(1) to present insights into relationalaspects of the culture of academicmedicine at select institutions from theperspective of medical faculty, and (2)to consider the implications of theseinsights for all faculty, with specialattention to women and URM faculty.Our findings are part of a larger set ofqualitative data associated with theNational Initiative on Gender, Cultureand Leadership in Medicine (informallyknown a s C - Change, which is short for Culture-Change). 28This initiative, made possible by the Josiah Macy, Jr.Foundation, comprises a partnershipof five medical schools and BrandeisUniversity, collectively engaged in actionresearch to address the imperative ofdeveloping women and URM facultymembers' full potential and leadership inacademic medicine in the United States. Method We selected the fiv e C - Change medical schools to represent the diverseorganizational characteristics of the 126medical schools in the U.S. at the time ofour study (i.e., public/private, NationalInstitutes of Health [NIH] researchintensive, Schools were selected fromeach of the AAMC-designated regions.One school each was selected from theWestern, Southern, and Central regionsand two from the Northeastern region,which has the largest concentration ofmedical schools. Included were two public and three private schools.Aggregate statistics regarding women andURM faculty in these schools were almostidentical to national statistics. At the timeof this study (2006-2007), nationally,32% of medical faculty were women,and, in participating schools, 35% werewomen. Nationally, women madeup 16% full professors, and, schools, 17% were 7% of faculty were Hispanic), fromURM groups (2% African American/Black and 4% Hispanic). Participant criteria We selected medical faculty from the five C - Change medical schools usingstratified purposeful and chain samplingstrategies 29according to medical school site, gender, race/ethnicity, department/discipline, and career status. We usedstratified purposeful sampling to capturevariations of experience or perspectivethat may occur among individuals atdifferent career stages. The PI (L.P.) sentan e-mail invitation to participate topotential interviewees together withinformation about the purpose of thestudy. We did not offer anycompensation. Prior to interviews, wesecured written informed consent.Interviewers reiterated the purpose of thestudy and ensured confidentiality andanonymity at the beginning of eachinterview. IRB approval was obtained. Participants were research scientists, medical and surgical subspecialists, andgeneralist medical faculty who helddoctoral degrees (84% MD/DO, 16%PhD) and represented a wide diversity ofsubspecialties. We invited 170 facultymembers in four career stages toparticipate: (1) early career, that is, thosewho had been faculty members for two tofive years, (2) \"plateaued,\" that is, thosewho had not advanced as expected in rank and responsibility and who hadbeen faculty members for 10 or more years, (3) faculty in leadership roles suchas deans, departmental chairs, and centerdirectors (identified as \"senior\" in thequotations below), and (4) former facultywho had left academic medicine(\"departed\"). We divided intervieweesequally among the four groups, but withfewer participants in the early-careerstage because we reached data saturationin this category early in the study (Table1). We interviewed similar numbers offaculty from each of the five schools. Data collection and analysis The four coauthors conducted the one- on-one interviews. We audio-recordedand transcribed verbatim all interviews,which were typically one hour in length.The semistructured interview guideconsisted of open-ended questionsfocused on choice of medicine as a career,aspirations of faculty, energizing aspectsof their careers, barriers to advancement,interdisciplinary collaboration,leadership, power, values alignment, andwork-family integration. We developedthe guide through a pilot series ofinterviews. List 1 shows some of thequestions.

When have you felt most successful in your work? What has been your sense of being a part of your department/university/institution? What has been difficult or frustrating in your work? How are your aspirations for yourself in academic medicine being fulfilled?Institutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 107We analyzed aggregated data by repeatedly reading masked interviewtranscripts to develop understanding andinterpret meaning. After identifying andapplying codes to the more than 4,000pages of transcribed narrative data, westored coded data using Atlas.ti software.Our analysis involved data reduction orcondensation, from which we identifiedpatterns and themes emergent in thecoded data. We used an inductive anddata-driven analysis process, in line withgrounded theory. 30,31To verify our conclusions, we returned to thetranscripts, reevaluating the findings byreview among the four coauthors todevelop intersubjective consensus. Results Sample selection Of the 170 faculty who were invited to participate, 8 individuals refused (usuallybecause of time constraints), 54 did notrespond, and we were unable to schedulewith 12 potential interviewees. A total of96 faculty participated, for an acceptancerate of 56%. Fifteen percent (16) ofinterviews were in person, and theremainder (80) were by telephone. It wasmore difficult to identify male \"plateau\"faculty than similar-stage women facultymembers. Overall, those in leadershipwere more likely to agree to participate,and we found it most difficult to secureinterviews with early-career medicine, family medicine, andgeneral pediatrics). Relational aspects of the culture Relational aspects of the culture emerged as a central theme in the data, with noappreciable gender differences noted.Quotes in different categories are fromdifferent respondents. Relationalcomments tended to be spontaneouslymentioned rather than elicited byinterviewers, except in responses to thequestion about institutional support ofinterdisciplinary collaboration. Relativelyfew women and men described positiverelational attributes with colleagues.Where positive relationships with theircolleagues were described, there wasoften a sense that these relationshipsassumed important protective orbuffering effects against the dysfunctional aspects in the culture. A senior womansaid, I wouldn't say it's an overly socially warm place but I guess it is welcoming. Peopleare nice here, it's easy to interact. It is aplace that's relatively free of bias, at leastracial bias. Women haven't done anybetter here than they have in otheracademic places but it's still a niceenvironment and I've been able to do allthe things I've wanted. She went on to say later in the interview, You have to position yourself so that youare part of the decision making. You can'texpect and wait to be the beneficiary ofbenevolenc e...t h e recipient, and so I guess that's been my guiding principle;this is a marketplace environment. Eventhough we like to think we live the life ofthe mind, it in fact is a marketplace andyou have to have something to be able tobring to the table that gives you equality. A woman early in her career said, We have a small group of junior facultywho by all of the turmoil\u2014we have beenthrown together into each other's lapsand that has been a wonderful thingbecause we can say \"Oh my gosh, thisproject or line of thinking isn't workingout. There's basically something wrongthere and I can't figure out what it is.\" If Iwere to say that to a senior colleague, Iwould put at risk their evaluation of mebecause I had made such a grave mistake.So identifying those colleagues can helpyou sort out the problems you have atwork. When this individual was asked how her aspirations in medicine were beingfulfilled, she replied, I guess with establishing relationships in the workplace of trust, relationships inwhich I can howl my failures without fearof retribution in some way, so that part isterrific. I mean, to work in anenvironment doing something that youlike to do and having colleagues aroundyou who are for the most part supportiveor a number of them, that's veryrewarding. I still don't know if I'm goingto succee d...s o that's a scary or uncomfortable position. Other faculty also commented on how any closeness with a colleague wouldprovide some counterbalance to thenegative aspects of the culture. A seniorman said, I feel [a sense of connectedness] when I'm working or talking doctor to doctor andwe're discussing a mutual patient. That'swhere there's a real sense of family on theindividual level. And the flipside of that is the administrative side which forces all ofthe life out of everything you do. Respondents particularly valued their research collaborators. A senior femalescientist who had left academic medicinesaid, \"I felt very little of a sense ofbelonging except to my own researchgroup, which felt like a team with awonderful mix of people.\" Positive relationships with learners and patients Numerous faculty spoke of positive and valued relationships with students andresidents, and with patients. Male andfemale faculty found particularly rewardingtheir interactions with physicians-in-training, as illustrated below: I'm most successful in my work when I'm actually at the bedside. Yeah. When I'm atthe bedside with a learner. I feel like I'mgiving out. I'm giving in a way that youcan only give if you're with the patient.You're with a learner. That's when I'mmost gratified. (Senior male in obstetrics) And so to see the residents get excited about something that I'm excited about,and that's good for the community andgood for people who really don't haveaccess to care. I think right now that'swhat really gets me, so it is teaching, Butit's teaching, not so much the kind ofdidactic or the typical ward attendingkind of teaching, it's sort of the broaderteaching about the world of medicine incommunity. (Plateaued female generalist) The sense of belonging I had was really at its highest when I was with learners. Inever really felt a particular kinship toother faculty. I think it was really prettymuch at times when I was reallyimmersed and surrounded by studentsthat I felt like I was a member of theuniversity. (Senior woman in pathology) Faculty also referred to their relationships with patients when we asked about whatenergized them in their work. For example: I really do like the oneness of working with patients and getting to know them;establishing rapport and hopefully gettingthem to open up to . . . establishing thetrust and all. (Senior man) I take care of frail elders. That really energizes me in a way that I can't explain.I love these people. Even after I leave aday here, I can go to the nursing homeeven though I'm tired, and it willreenergize me. (Midcareer woman) Collaboration Some respondents described collaboration with a few colleagues where it was seen as aInstitutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 108very positive activity that enhances the environment, research, and education: Part of it is a network of colleagues\u2014I mentioned locally, but also nationally. SoI have a couple of folks whose values Ishare and we get together sporadically totrade stories. They tend to be inleadership roles in other institutions andwe support each other in trying to affectthese big complex institutions and train agroup of people to carry on the work.(Male senior generalist) I really try to make a collaborative environment where everybody feels thatthey're part of the decision making andpart of effective chang e... it's a much better environment if there'scollaboration and support. (Womanleader) It's great when it happens, but when it happens, it's because you're sitting withsomebody at lunc h... . It's because you're sitting there and talking about your workand you think, \"Oh, I work on that. Let'sdo something together\". I've gotten agrant by doing that .... \"Y o ug ot o meetings; you go to each other's seminars.That's how it happens. And so several ofus collaborate on that, but it's not becauseanybody told us to. It's because wefound each other. So that does work.Collaboration is the best thing. (Seniorfemale scientist) Dilemmas in relationships Disconnection. In contrast, many faculty members described feeling isolated andlacked supportive relationships.Narratives documented personaldisconnection and separation rather thanrelationship formation among colleagues.Respondents perceived that theenvironmental norms and structures didnot value or support relationships anddid not facilitate their formation. Thetroubling relational themes that emergedin the data were evident for both menand women and were expressed byfaculty in all career stages. A male subspecialist early in his career commented, I couldn't pick out anybody that I corresponded with by e-mail or lettersout of a line-up. I knew very few people indifferent divisions. It was very much anisolated situation. Go to your clinic, doyour thing, go back to your office, go tothe medical suite, do your procedures, goback to the office .... Comments from two faculty (midcareer and departed) illustrate their awarenessof barriers to relationship formation:I realized that I valued relationships and interpersonal behavior that the institutiondid not. (Female) So a lot of what women do to make a culture more nurturing\u2014help the peopleto grow as human beings, to become, inmy judgment, better clinicians\u2014is notsomething the institution values. Theycan do it if they want, they get all kinds oflaudatory praise, but they do it on theirown time. (Female) We heard these themes from many faculty in early or midcareer stages, butthose in leadership also commented ontheir disconnection with colleagues. Anumber of faculty commented thatleaders felt distant from them. Competitive individualism. Interviewees described an intensely individualistic andcompetitive environment where rewardsare usually accorded to individualcontributions. Respondents perceivedthat individuals and institutions tend tofunction on behalf of their own self-interests. It was accepted that a stressful,competitive environment is necessary topromote scientific progress andachievement. A senior male faculty said, You're encouraged to be a reductionist in your thinking, to get your niche to get tobe successful, which again I don't have aproblem with that in general. You areencouraged to be single minded, self-indulgent, selfish; the first question out ofpeople's mouths is, \"Well what is thisgoing to do for me?\" \"What paper do I getout of it, where do I go on the paper,who's looking out for me?\" and all thatstuff. And it's just like there should beenough to go around. He went on to comment, But I think what it breeds\u2014and this getsinto the heart of the academic culturecertainly at its lower and midlevels\u2014is anunpleasant place in a lot of ways, aspeople are scrambling up over oneanother trying to find their way and findtheir niche and find their grants and soforth . . . . I don't like what it does to people. And I think very nice, thoughtfulpeople become very selfish and self-indulgent because they're pushed to getthe grant. A number of faculty found individual self-promotion distasteful. A womannoted, She [her supervisor] said \"you have to brag, you really do.\" And that's verydifficult for many people because it's notthe nature of some of our cultures,experience, and maybe just family culture, too. A senior man who left academic medicine said, I wasn't driven by the self-promotion that I think has to come on in academicinstitutions. It's all about getting newgrants\u2014\"I have more than you\" and \"I'mthe expert in this.\" So it's a little bit of anunreal, self-promoting kind ofenvironment. The expectation of personal overextension was often expressed andmay be another result of the competitiveenvironment. The culture described byrespondents was often linked to havingother adverse effects on faculty. Thecompetitiveness of climbing the ladder inacademic medicine was related to facultymembers assuming aggressive, self-seeking, and uncollegial behaviors notpreviously evident. A number of facultysuggested that dealing with thisenvironment brought about changes inoutlooks and behaviors, both incolleagues and themselves. A seniorwoman who left academic medicinenoted, And there were colleagues of mine to whom power meant a great deal and Iwatched them become people I didn't likeas they dealt with this hostility andgrabbed for the power, and they achieveda great deal and I don't take it away fromthem, but in the course of it, they losttheir humanity. They became people Icould no longer respect. They becamedishonest and manipulative. Another senior woman who stayed in academic medicine pointed to thecreation of a \"toxic\" environment: I never felt like I belonged ....T h e environment that I was in was quite toxicin an interpersonal way ....Y o u learn to become extremely aggressive andobnoxious people. Undervaluing humanistic qualities. Numerous faculty spoke of not beingrecognized as people beyond theirprofessional roles at work. There was alack of attention to what individualfaculty were themselves feeling, with noinvitation or expectation to expresspersonal emotions or to talk aboutimportant personal issues either relatedto work or to their personal lives. Facultydescribed the environment as having a\"dehumanizing\" effect on them by onlyrecognizing the work aspect of faculty.The culture seemed to reduce theInstitutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 109qualities in faculty that make them able to meet human needs, be compassionate,and show sensitivity to others. Amidcareer female medical subspecialistsaid, Nobody cares what makes me tick here. I'm completely invisible\u2014as a human\u2014as a person. A nonprofessional person. Itjust seems like I go through most of myday with nobody recognizing who I thinkI am. Or acknowledges me in any\u2014in anycomplex sens e...o rm ea sa unique individual. I just appear to be what Irepresent. Another female faculty member commented, Check your humanity at the door, that was how it felt. Any sign o f... this is gonna sound harsh, bu t...a n y tendency towards kindness was viewed as weakness. Several interviewees felt that this situation had the effect of preventingthem from being fully themselves in theirwork life and that they only selectivelybrought aspects of themselves and theirthinking to their professional lives: One consequence of this is a dehumanizing effect on the faculty, wherean individual is not able to bring his orher feelings authentically into theworkplace. (Senior woman physician) Deprecation and disrespect. Interviewees gave little indication of medical schoolscultivating an appreciative culture, butrather one of finding fault. Researchers,educators, and clinicians spoke of feelingdisrespected or of not being valued asfaculty who have contributed to themedical school's successes. A femalemedical subspecialist commented on thecommon expectation of finding fault: People tend to defend their territory, defend and assume that you're attackingthem. This is an environment where theassumption is that people are trying tothink ill of you. Or are trying to find themoment where you slip up. Who wants towork in that kind of environment? A male medical subspecialist told of an experience: I have a relatively new [supervisor]; after he'd been here a year, he called me intothe office and said that he had reviewedeverything that the department had everdone, all our publications and in hismind\u2014this is a quote\u2014\"We'd neverdone anything important in the history ofthe department.\" [laughs] sat there andsaid, \"Really?\" I said \"Then could youperhaps clarify to me what counts asimportant?\" He said, \"Yes, publishing in [two elite medical and science journals].\"I said that \"within my department of 100faculty, I doubt there is anybody whoeven reads those journals, much lesspublishes in them.\" Another dimension of disrespect emerged as disloyalty, as faculty also perceived thattheir larger organizations are not loyal tothe faculty. A senior female basic sciencefaculty member commented, I think what they've done recently, not to me as much, but to faculty who havealways had grants and who are nowhaving trouble getting them ....A n dn o w they're turning around and if people can'tget grants, they're making them feel bad,making them feel kind of worthless. Ithink that's not nice. And instead ofsaying, \"Good job, you've done a goodjob. You've gotten grants for 20 years andyou've been a good teacher or you'vebeen a decent teacher.\" And now [theysay instead], \"You don't have a grant;now you're worthless.\" Numerous faculty members commented on not feeling recognized by the medicalschool for their contributions, as thisexample from an early-career womanphysician illustrates: We're not rewarded by the medical school at all. We're not recognized. A few peopleeach year might be recognized, but for theongoing day-to-day grind, we're notrecognized by the medical school for ourefforts. A midlevel male clinical faculty member articulated a common theme whererespect was associated with receivinggrants and disrespect with teachingactivities: I've seen it everywhere I've ever been, so it's not unique to this university. Whatthe university had was this hierarchy ofneeds that began with your ability tosupport yourself with grants, [and] withteaching at the bottom, and it was veryexplicit. Personal relationships weredefined by distrust and disdain if youdidn't get a grant. A senior woman remembered how she adapted, but at a cost: My assumption would be that a lot of their behavior was from a place ofinsecurity in which they learned somereally powerfully negative pushbackbehavior that I learned too. Erosion of trust. In the interviews, we found instances where faculty wereunwilling to say what they believed forfear of retaliation. Likewise, faculty feared being penalized for discussing homeproblems. A female plateaued facultymember explained her sense of not beingable to express herself for fear of losingher job: Well, I think the hardest thing for me was to be in a department where you couldn'texpress yourself [your opinion] withoutfeeling that you were jeopardizing yourcareer. The hardest thing was that I wasn'thonest to myself sometimes and because Iwas afraid earlier on that I would lose myjob\u2014I would get kicked out of thedepartment. Although I don't know ifthat would have happened, but it didhappen to other people. There werepeople in our department who lost theirjobs over their being expressive. Theirlives were made absolutely miserable. A midcareer female faculty member described how she overextended herselfbecause of her fear that if she was notseen to be doing this, she would risklosing her job: Early on, when I was doing purely clinical, in my division, I was bringing inmore money than anyone and part of it isbecause I would be working until 10:00 atnight and just thinking, \"These peoplemay fire me. I've got to do all this work.You know, I can't ever refuse anything.\"So I was really, really, really killing myselfand, of course, getting older in age andfeeling more and more tired. Respondents revealed breaches of academic integrity that seemed to betolerated or even expected in theenvironment. Some examples followfrom women: I work on projects, where if I present any kind of tantalizing evidence someonedown the hall will go and do thoseexperiments and just scoop you and justessentially take all your ideas andeverything and just run with it andbecause they're bigger and they're faster.It's also stealing of ideas. You know, yousend a grant to have a colleague look itover and lo and behold, your data end upin their grant and things like that. What he had a wonderful ability to do is to take all of my hard work and givehimself credit for it. My chairman asked me to take over the new faculty, and so he would give methese things that I was supposed to tellthem we were going to do for them. And Iwould say to him, \"We don't do this forpeople. How can I tell people this isavailable when you and I both know wedon't follow through on that?\" He said\"Well, you have to because that's the onlyInstitutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 110way they'll come here.\" Well, I don't lie. That's not what I do. The following quotations are from male leaders: I basically value being completely honest. You know, I'm asking for this, and this iswhy I'm asking for it, and this is what I'dlike to do with it. Honesty is not alwayseither rewarded or reciprocated inacademic medicine. I think there are plenty of people that will try to maneuver or get things done or getdecisions on their behalf by not beingfully forthright or honest about what theissues are. I have this with students as wellas faculty and administrators. So youhave to be very careful in the academicenvironment to ask the right questionsand look for the right motivations, or thewrong motivations, as they are in somecases. The theme of dishonesty emerged in the educational enterprise, too. A femalemidcareer faculty member said, We would tell students they were going to get excellent teaching, but they keptincreasing the number of patients that thedoctors had to see, and I watched theeducation of the students falling offeveryone's radar. I said, \"You know, we'relying to the people who are doing ourevaluations, we're putting things on paperthat we don't do, and we're not being fairto the students.\" It was like, \"We have tomake money so the students are going tohave to suck it up.\" And you know, whathappened was that the people who werethe best teachers ended up leaving overand over again. Discussion As illustrated at the beginning of the Results section, we did hear very positivecomments about teaching, whereeffective relationships with students wereevident and prized, and relationshipswith patients emphasized trust andcaring. Some faculty also spoke ofsupportive collaborative relationshipswith close colleagues. However, negativeperceptions of relational experiences werearticulated in the majority of allinterviews, despite the fact that thequestions posed were open-ended andpurposefully sought accounts of positiveexperiences in the tradition ofAppreciative Inquiry 32and did not request accounts of negative relationalissues. Even in this context, fundamentalaspects discussed by faculty of theexperience of academic medical culturewere a sense of disconnection and anerosion of trusting relationships with colleagues and supervisors. Our data suggest that serious problems exist in the relational culture and thatthese can affect faculty vitality,professionalism, and productivity and arelinked to retention. These aspects of theculture may undermine the goals ofmedical institutions and are antitheticalto fostering superior patient care,biomedical research, and educationalexcellence. At the very least, they makemedical schools much less supportive andpositive workplaces for professionalwork. This study was conducted in only five schools; the ability to generalize insightsfrom our qualitative findings is beingassessed by us through a nationalquantitative survey of medical faculty.However, the themes we report weregenerally consistent across the faculty weinterviewed. In earlier pilot studies whenthe PI interviewed a national sample of22 faculty, she found similar results(unpublished). Alignment with the findings of other researchers Our findings align with those of others; a recent survey study of four U.S. medicalschools found elevated rates ofdepression and job dissatisfaction,especially among younger faculty. 33These authors note, \"Current medical studentsare being taught by faculty who areincreasingly stressed and dispirited .... The majority of faculty respondentsindicated that their initial jobexpectations were not being realized, theywere not the contributors they used to be,and that their productivity wasdecreasing. Significant numbers of thefaculty felt unsupported.\" 33Additional evidence pointing to dysfunction in theculture are high levels of physiciandissatisfaction 34and faculty burnout in 37% to 47% of academic faculty,35 although burnout was found to beuncommon in deans. 36 Women physicians have 1.6 times the riskof burnout compared with malecolleagues, 37and the suicide rate in women physicians is twice that of otherworking women. 38Women may be more sensitive reactors to the milieu of AHCs,and, together with URM faculty, theymay be on the leading edge of a reactionto the perceived challenges of theenvironment of academic medicine (the \"canary in the coal mine\"). Relationships in health care A lack of positive relational attributes may also be found in nonmedicalworkplaces, but we and others believethat such a lack has particularsignificance for medical settings becausephysicians must be skilled in formingtrusting relationships with their patientsto effectively address the biological,psychological, and social impact ofillness. 39Substantial evidence links relational deficiency with adverse healthcare outcomes. Physicians who are self-aware of their own responses and feelingswhen they are with patients are moreeffective and more satisfied in providingpatient care, 40and physicians' humanism correlates with patient satisfaction andadherence to medical advice. 41Beach et al10recognized the quality of relationships as central to health care andarticulated core principles: relationshipsin health care ought to include thepersonhood of the participants, affect andemotion are important components ofrelationships, and all health carerelationships occur in the context ofreciprocal influence. Safran et al 11extend these concepts and propose a model ofrelationship-centered organizations.It has been shown that chronicdisconnection results in diminishedenergy and creativity and precludesgrowth-fostering relationships. 42-44 Our data also suggest that negative relationalattributes are barriers to faculty vitality,creativity, and satisfaction. Disconnectionand emotional detachment in the culturecan be viewed as a parallel to ineffectivecommunication between doctor andpatient, as well as influencingorganizational performance. 11Continuity of relationship is emerging in new trendsin medical education such as theCambridge Hospital initiative 45and a current Carnegie Foundation study.46 Linkage to professionalism Cohen and colleagues,23reflecting on a new guide to medical professionalism,47 noted recently that \"institutional andorganizational settings of contemporarymedical practice pose significantimpediments to achieving several of theresponsibilities to be assumed byphysicians.\" They suggest that thesestructural barriers to professionalism maybe beyond the control of physicians.Institutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 111Although we agree with their social structural analysis, we also ask whetherthere are additional barriers toprofessionalism in the culture andrelationships within academic medicine. In the past year, new accreditation standards mandate \"interpersonal andcommunication skills and professionalism\"for residency training. 48Moreover, \"medical schools (including faculty) mustensure that the learning environment formedical students promotes thedevelopment of explicit and appropriateprofessional attributes in their medicalstudents.\" 49These standards reinforce the American Board of Internal MedicineProject Professionalism 50and the AAMC's Medical School Objectives Project,51and they direct attention to effectiverelationship formation among medicalfaculty. Latent culture Medical students tend to lose their humanistic and altruistic attitudes duringtheir medical school years. 52-60 Current practices may, in fact, be barriers tophysicians-in-training developingcompassion and competence, and theymay contribute to unprofessionalbehaviors. 61,62A substantial literature describes the informal or \"hiddencurriculum\" for medical students wherestudents experience behaviors andattitudes, embodied in the organizationalapproach, that contrast with the school'sespoused mission. 63In effect, students undergo tacit social conditioning58,64,65 and learn certain informal norms andvalues that may be at odds withhumanistic and ethical comportment.Many attributes of the culture in medicalschools 66have been thought to be barriers to learning, team building, andcompassionate care. Just as the \"hidden curriculum\" has been linked to unwarranted stress for students,as well as to lapses in their professionaland ethical behaviors, 59,67-69 we postulate that faculty who experience the latentculture described in our findings mayexhibit similar feelings and behaviors.Furthermore, medical faculty are teachersto be observed and emulated by medicalstudents, and, in this latent culture, theymay pass on the norms and culture theyexperience for themselves. Part of theresponsibility of medical schools is toteach medical students to be humanistic,socially responsible, and compassionate 70and to provide learning experiences thatnurture trainees' self-awareness andemotional development. Lack ofmodeling of effective relational practicesby faculty would logically impact studentlearning as well as patient care. 71 A structure that rewards individualachievement, self-promotion, and beinglead author on publications, rather thancollaborative efforts, may seriouslyimpede interdisciplinary andcollaborative work in the biomedicalsciences. The NIH have recentlyrecommended interdisciplinarycollaboration between scientists as apriority for scientific discovery andtranslation of new knowledge to clinicaloutcomes. 72For example, teams of researchers that include practicingphysicians as well as laboratory scientistsare more likely to produce advancesin scientific knowledge that can betranslated and applied to improvedpatient care. High levels of ethicalmisconduct reported in federally fundedfaculty researchers 73may also be partially attributed to the culture in which facultymay find themselves working. Why faculty stay in academic medicine Similarly to students in Boys in White 74 who turned their medical school experience into something functional asthey learned the practice of medicine, ourfaculty may draw on more positiveaspects of their experience in AHCs tobuffer them from dysfunctions in thesystem. The qualities and rewards feltfrom their relationships with studentsand patients, the excitement of theintellectual challenge of medicine, analtruistic social contract, and the fewclose relationships that they do have withcolleagues buffer, protect, and supportfaculty in their contributions to healthcare, education, and research, anddecrease the likelihood of membersof this critical group leaving academicmedicine. Our data suggest thatbehaviors promoting relationshipformation can mitigate stress and mayhelp prevent burnout. Our experience ofworking with medical faculty stronglysuggests that most faculty wish to havetrusted colleagues and that most desireconnection and relationshipformation. 64,65,75-78 Collaboration involves formingrelationships, developing understandingof the perspectives of others, and learningeffective patterns of interpersonal communication. To be successful in thelong term, arriving at some enjoymentof working with other team membersis helpful. Essential are the cognitivecontributions and expertise of teammembers, but their emotions affect notonly their own work but the work of thegroup. So, in any workplace, supportingboth the emotional and intellectual well-being of workers will be vital for optimalwork. Recommendations \"The Human Condition of Healthcare Professionals aptly expresses the everyday essence and deeper meaning of medicalwork and the impact on the men andwomen who have chosen it.\" 39A logical response to the findings of our studywould be for medical schools to makeefforts to instigate and support practicesthat encourage relationship formationamong faculty and leaders. Supportingconnection in trusting relationships andthe human condition of healthprofessionals would facilitate a corechange in the medical school culture andcontribute to realizing the potential of allfaculty, including women and membersof URM groups. We suggest thatenhancing relational practices in medicalschools would result in improvedcommunication and collaborative effortsin patient care, research, education, andadministration, and a more satisfied andenergized faculty. This would allow theinstitution to avail itself of both women'sand men's potential contributions andskills. Similarly, in his recent AAMCpresidential address, Kirch suggested thatlow faculty personal morale is caused byan imbalance within our institutions andrecommended that \"we spend timeexplicitly assessing and building the rightkind of culture.\" 79 The eventual improvements achieved bythe C - Change Initiative should benefitall faculty in academic medicine andenhance the value of the nation'ssubstantial investment in health caredelivery and workforce development. Inaddressing what are national problems inmedical schools, the deans of the five C -Change schools have taken a leadershipstance and courageous approach tohaving their faculty confidentiallyinterviewed. Additionally, the deans arecommitted to being personally engagedin a collaborative Learning ActionNetwork to explore methods for makingInstitutional Climate for Faculty Academic Medicine, Vol. 84, No. 1 / January 2009 112changes in the cultures of th e C - Change schools. Efforts and outcomes of the C -Change Initiative will be disseminated asthe larger project more finely hones theissues. Efforts to create and supporttrusting relationships in medical schoolsare likely to enhance all faculty members'efforts to optimally contribute to theclinical, education, and research missionsof academic medicine.

BACKGROUND: Energized, talented faculty are essen- tial to achieving the missions of academic medical centers (AMCs) in education, research and health care. The alignment of individuals 'values with workplace experiences are linked to meaningfulness of work and productivity. OBJECTIVE: To determine faculty values and their alignment with institutional values. DESIGN: A qualitative hypothesis-generating interview study to understand the professional experiences of faculty and organizational approach in five AMCs thatwere nationally representative in regional and organi- zational characteristics. Analysis was inductive and data driven. PARTICIPANTS: Using stratified, purposeful sampling, we interviewed 96 male and female faculty at different career stages (early career, plateaued, senior faculty and those who had left academic medicine) and diverse specialties (generalists, medical and surgical subspe-cialists, and research scientists). APPROACH: Dominant themes that emerged from the data. RESULTS: Faculty described values relating to excel- lence in clinical care, community service (including care for the underserved and disadvantaged), teaching,intellectual rigor/freedom and discovery, all values that mirror the stated missions of AMCs. However, many faculty also described behaviors that led them toconclude that their AMCs, in practice, undervaluedexcellence in clinical care, and their social and educa- tional missions. Themes were seen across gender, career stage, race and discipline, except that femaleleaders appeared more likely than male leaders to identify incongruence of individual values and organi- zational practices. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of five diverse medical schools, faculty values were well aligned with statedinstitutional missions; however, many perceived that institutional behaviors were not always aligned with individual faculty values.

Grady Bogue 1 Energized, creative and compassionate faculty are essential to achieving the tripartite mission of medical schools to train physicians, advance knowledge through research and provide high quality care to the communitiesthey serve. High levels of faculty dissatisfaction, 2attrition3and burnout4,5have been documented, but little research has focused on faculty values, their alignment with institutionalvalues and the relation ship of these to faculty 'sw o r k experience. An important correlate of job satisfaction and optimal performance is the meaningfulness of one 's work. 5-6Our and Wright 's prior research on medical faculty suggested that values serve as motivators and that alignment of values with work may impact function and success.7-9Research in academic medicine has tended to focus on faculty satisfac- tion.2,10There has been a dearth of studies on the impact of values congruence. Values are beliefs or ideals about what isgood or desirable and act as guiding principles for choices,attitudes and behaviors. 11-15For example, a person who holds honesty as a prioritized value is less likely to cheat on tests than a person who prioritizes other values. Typically, anindividual 's values are acquired through interaction with family, peers and social systems. 16They tend to be fairly stable over a lifetime.17,18 During in depth interviews with faculty, we identified deeply held professional values as expressed through being optimally energized in work, and explored their relationship to faculty 's work experience and perceptions of institutional values.Prior Presentation: SGIM 32nd Annual Meeting, 2009: Plenary Re- search Presentation. Received May 26, 2009 Revised July 21, 2009Accepted September 9, 2009Published online October 16, 2009 1289METHODS Setting and Participants This study included faculty from five US medical schools engaged in an action research project: the National Initiativeon Gender, Culture and Leadership in Medicine (C - Change). 19 The Initiative promotes an organizational culture in academic medicine that helps all faculty realize their potential. The five schools were representative of different regions and organizational characteristics of medical schools, e.g., public vs. private ownership and NIH research intensive vs. primary care focus. Although the project addresses the needs of allfaculty, it spotlights women, under-represented minority (URM) and generalist faculty. The project received IRB approval, and all participants gave written informed consent. We selected equal numbers of medical faculty from each of the five C - Change schools through purposeful and chain sampling strategies. 20Interviewees were invited to participate in a study of faculty experiences in academic medicine.Participants were stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, depart- ment/discipline and career stage ( \"early 2 to 5 years; \"plateaued, \"i.e., faculty for >10 years who had not advanced as expected in rank and responsibility; faculty in leadership roles such as deans, departmental chairs and center directors (identified as \"senior \"in the quotations below), and former faculty who had left for a career outside academic medicine). Men and women interviewed were approximately equally divided among the career stages, but with fewer maleearly career participants since we reached data saturation inthis category early in the study. Data Collection In 2006 -2007, four research team members conducted 1-h semi-structured interviews (15% in person, 85% bytelephone), which were audi o-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview questions focused on aspirations of a career in medicine, energizing aspects of their work, barriers to advancement, leadership, power, values and work-familyintegration. The questions were open-ended, non-leading and unbiased in wording to permit the respondent to describe what was personally meaningful and salient. Theinterview guide was based on a pilot national series of 21 interviews of faculty conducted by the PI. Questions that specifically addressed values included :When have you felt most successful in your work? What do you see as valued at your institution? How do your personal values align or conflict with what you experience in academic medicine? Data Analysis We used an inductive and data-driven, grounded theory process of analysis.21,22The multidisciplinary research team identified codes for units of meaning in the masked tran-scripts. With coding consensus and aided by two research assistants, the team coded t he 4,000 pages of narrative data. We stored and organized coded data utilizing Atlas.tisoftware, and identified patterns and themes emergent inthe data. Data relevant to values were derived from the entire set of interviews. The example quotations in this paper illustrate dominant themes related to values.RESULTS Participant Characteristics One hundred seventy faculty were invited to participate: 8 refused (usually due to time constraints), 54 did not respond, and we were unable to schedule interviews with 12 individuals,leaving 96 completed interviews. Participants were research scientists, medical and surgical sub-specialists, and generalists, 84% MD or DO, and 16% composed 55%, AfricanAmericans/Blacks 17%, Hispanics/Latinos 4% and generalists20% (general internal medicine, family medicine and general pediatrics). On analysis, themes were not unique to any career stage, gender, race, school or discipline. Quotes were chosen toinclude a mix of gender, basic scientists, subspecialists and generalists. Quotes are identified by gender and career stage; discipline and race are not identified to protect anonymity. Energizing Aspects of Work that Reflect Faculty Values Dominant themes in the interviews, which delineated energizing aspects of their careers, reflected the faculty 'sc o r ev a l u e si nt h e i r work. Clinical caring, social mission, teaching, intellectual rigor,discovery and self-direction were themes that emerged from all categories of faculty. Clinical Caring. Physicians often described how clinical care was energizing for them and how rewarded they feel when they help a patient. This sense of reward extended beyond curing disease and treating medical problems to \"caring for people, \" ameliorating chronic disease, and getting to know and build trusting relationships with their patients. The thing that most energizes me is the one-on-one work with complicated children and their families ...it's the clinical work that energizes me most. (male, early-career) I still think probably the most satisfying thing in my work is when I feel I 've helped a patient in some way, that I've helped someone deal with a serious illness or helped them recover. (female, plateaued) I really do like the oneness of working with patients and getting to know them. Establishing rapport and getting them to open up to you and likewise, establishing trust. (male, left academic medicine) I take care of the frail elders. That really energizes me in a way that I can 't explain. I love these people. I love my nursing home residents. Even after I leave a day here, I can go to the nursing home even though I 'm tired and it will re-energize me. ...you are more often than not looking at caring over curing, because these people are at a point where you are not going to cure anything, butyou can provide them and their families with a lot of care. (female, senior) Social Mission. Faculty valued highly the social mission of medicine to care for the underserved and disadvantaged who1290 Pololi et al.: Faculty Values JGIMwould not otherwise be able to afford care. They expressed the desire to serve the community and address issues of diversity. I think that academic medicine aligns very closely with what I think is correct and ethical, in the sense that I can provide care to patients and I never have to ask anybodywhether they have insurance or not. I don 't ever have to ask anybody if they can pay. If you come to the hospital and you 're sick, I 'm going to take care of you. (female, early-career) ...my values are to provide health care, education for the community at large as well as the underserved commu- nity, and to pay particular attention to diversity in peopleand thinking. (female, senior) Responsibility for Medical Education. Excellence in teaching was held as an essential value by many faculty. Facultyfrequently commented on the personal meaningfulness of their role as teacher and medical educator. Numerous faculty described teaching as one of the reasons for choosing to workin academic medicine: Part of it is teaching others how to become a scientist or ap h y s i c i a n ,a n dy o u 're perpetuating this wonderful field. (female, senior) I like the mission of what we 're doing. I mean, it 's really fun being around our young students who are trying tofigure what their place in the world is going to be and how to do a good job of it and so I find that inspiring. (male, senior) And I get my biggest fire from taking young minds and helping shape them into physicians -high quality physi- cians. I 'm most successful in my work when I 'm actually at the bedside. When I 'm at the bedside with a learner. I feel like I 'm giving out. I 'm giving in a way that you can only give if you 're with the patient. That 's when I 'm most gratified. (male, senior) Intellectual Rigor, Discovery and Self-Direction. High level intellectual stimulation, pursuit of the advancement of knowledge through research and intellectual autonomy wereidentified by participants as highly valued and integral to their roles as faculty. I think academic medicine still does pride intellectual advancement, and an eagerness for exploration, and new knowledge; that fits with what I find rewarding. I value the flexibility and freedom to pursue my own intellectualends. (male, senior) Many spoke of the excitement of scientific inquiry \u2014of constructing research questions and of scientific work thatreveals new insights \u2014of how this new understanding adds to the global understanding of life and disease \u2014and of their great satisfaction in seeing their own discovery translated intoclinical application. Along with this came the gratification of having one 's ideas and new knowledge receive the external recognition and accolade of being published in scientificjournals. Faculty saw this as a legacy of their own hard work, intellect and contribution to the biomedical sciences. I had my own lab, ...there was an unbelievably driving passion to answer questions in a way that I would be adding to the information that would make children 's lives better. (female, senior) I think the few moments that I had when I was realizing that I was figuring something out that people hadn 't figured out before; I was seeing data that no one had everseen before because my experiments had generated it! That was pretty exciting. (female, left academic medicine) Others spoke of science as serving the social mission: My research also opened the door to the whole question of how we use race in medicine. So there was a socialpart and there 's a science part, and I guess I would have to say that that 's probably been the highest point. (female, senior) Other aspects of work that were described as energizing were external recognition for accomplishments, relationships with trainees, being involved in student graduation ceremoniesand other university functions, taking leadership roles and accomplishing policy change. Non-Alignment of Faculty and Perceived Institutional Values In contrast to the highly valued and energizing aspects of life in medical school, some disturbing and deeply felt issues emerged from the data that suggested that faculty often foundthemselves in a conflict situation where their own individualvalues were not aligned with the behaviors and expectations of the institution in which they worked. Three predominant themes emerged in the data with respect to the non-alignment o f faculty and institutional values: a sense of institutional betrayal of the public trust by academic medicine, values conflict with the institutionalculture regarding ethical issues and discomfort with the expectation of self-promotion. Public Trust. Many faculty were disheartened by their perception that academic medicine is at times betraying thepublic trust and that it has lost its social mission. Faculty voiced this as a major reason contributing to their dissatisfaction with or departure from academic medicine. So while we have this emerging technology and the ability to treat patients, we have no sense of socialpurpose or social policy. (male, early career) Excellence in clinical care. Embedded in the sense of betrayal of the public trust were faculty perceptions that clinical care1291 Pololi et al.: Faculty Values JGIMwas not adequately supported or valued by the institution. Even though the institutional mission stated excellence in patient care as a priority, faculty perceived a failure to providesupport for this mission and noted that clinical excellence was not rewarded: Publications and being invited to speak at other institutions, getting a lot of grants; that is valued higher than patient care. If you were to ask somebody,\"who is most accomplished? \"\u2014those people are not necessarily the ones most adept at patient care. (female, early career) I think that everybody has to re-examine what it is to be in academic medicine \u2014and it really came to light to me about a year ago, when I was on a search committee for a division chief in another department. We were there in acircle interviewing, talking, and every single candidatethat came in talked about how they needed to protect their faculty from clinical work. Yet on the other hand, patients come here expecting the most experienced andthe most savvy clinicians because it 's a big university academic medical center. (male, left academic medicine) In my discussions with the dean, he is always talking about \"no money \u2014no mission, \"and I understand what he is saying: if we can 't keep the doors open financially, then we won 't take care of any sick folks, we won 't train any medical students. But my point to him was that if we losesight of what we are here for, we have no reason to keep our doors open. I think the focus is too much on the bottom line, to the point where we talk about giving up whatmakes us physicians in the first place. (female, plateaued) Community responsibility. Similarly, faculty voiced the notion that the medical school was \"hypocritical \"in its responsibility to its local community. But in an academic institution that doesn 'tv a l u e community, culture, partnerships, collaboration, Iwouldn 't have wanted to stay there. I would not \u2014that's where I was going and what I valued. It was really a dead end. ...I think academic institutions are still about me, the individual. They 're not necessarily about community and collaboration. I think if academic medicine can figure this out, that they can change how they promote people, value collaboration, value communitypartnership, true partnership and what I mean by that is being able to share resources, share authority with the community, to share data, to take as long as it takes todevelop a study, as long as it takes to help communities choose issues that are important to the community, which is the antithesis of the individual faculty member,isn't it? (male, left academic medicine) I truly believe in health care for everybody, that it 'sa basic human right, and that it 's our goal to organize resources in our society to make sure that that canhappen, and that does not happen in academic medi- cine. (male, left academic medicine)Excellence in education. Faculty frequently commented on the institution 's inadequate provision of support for education, of not rewarding and recognizing those faculty who excel in thisarea. They described a devaluing of efforts devoted to medical education. I run the resident clinic. We 're not rewarded by the Medical School at all. Few people each year might be recognized, but for the ongoing day-to-day grind, we 're not recognized by the Medical School for our efforts ...We basically provide free labor, [for education] you might call it, for the school ...people stay because they feel a dedication to education ....(female, plateaued) A related theme was that institutions seemed to be self- serving and self-perpetuating rather than serving of their constituents. This was likened to a corporate culture. I think universities are looking much more like corpora- tions than they used to. I hear the same kind of business speak stuff at the university as I heard in the private, for-profit company that I worked for. In fact, I was notingthat there were fewer differences than ever before, so I think it 's become a business. And I don 't think that 's where education should be, and I also don 't think that 's where health care should be. (female, left academic medicine) Conflict with Perceived Institutional Culture Regarding Ethical Issues. A number of interviewees described experiences of unethical and fraudulent behavior that they believed were condoned by senior faculty. These instances were described as examples of lack of alignment of their own values with those ofthe institution or leadership. A male leader described asituation of major unethical use of funding. At an executive level discussion about the event, he remembered the following: We sat in that room for quite a while and after about a half an hour when people were hemming and hawing, I said, \"Isn't it pretty clear what we have to do? This man has to be fired. \"And, literally, a senior administrator of the institution said \u2014the words actually came out of his mouth: \"We can 't do that, he 's one of us. \"(male, senior) This was an example of the unethical use of funds and the concept of being a 'club 'member as more important than public trust or integrity. Other faculty described situations where the institution created or tolerated a situation where individualscould be motivated to be unethical in research, by placinggreater emphasis and value on the funding amount and quantity of research, rather than the integrity of the research. Two of his research assistants, young women, came in and talked to me yesterday that they couldn 'ts l e e pf o r2 weeks because they believe the person who is directlysupervising them is fraudulently creating data for a research project. (male, senior) I think my personal values don 't align terribly well with academic medicine, interestingly. Unfortunately, I find1292 Pololi et al.: Faculty Values JGIMthat sometimes I feel that studies are done for the sake of doing the study. When I actually look at it and say, \"What value is that going to provide either to patients or to ourknowledge or anything like that. \"I wonder, is it just because it 's another paper? (female, early career) A woman described times when she had been expected to lie by her supervisor and how she found this unacceptable: My chairman asked me to take over the new faculty, and he would give me these things that I was supposed to tellthem we were going to do for them and I would say to him, \"we don 't do this for people. How can I tell people this is available when you and I both know we don 't follow through on that? \"He said, \"Well, you have to because that 's the only way they 'll come here. \"Well, I don't lie. That 's not what I do. Or, I said \"we're lying to the people who are doing our school evaluations, we 're putting things on paper that we do that we don 't do, and we're not being fair to the students. The students think they 're getting a good deal because they don 't know any better, but you and I both know what we 're doing here. \" And it was sort of like \"well, we have to make money so the students are going to have to suck it up. \"(female, left academic medicine) Another faculty member described her experiences with her supervisor: Like the kind of leaders I saw in my early career, including my division chief. There 's no way I want to be in a situation where I have to be deceitful in order to getpeople to do what they need to do. Or where I would have to work on scheming and cover-ups, as a way of doing my job. And that 's what I think he felt he had to do \u2014hide money, lie about money or at least cook the books a little bit. And not be concerned about a student 's career, a fellow 's career, because you had financial obligations to meet. (female, plateaued) Twelve of 16 female leaders interviewed mentioned a lack of alignment of their own values and practices they observed intheir organizations, and 5 of 12 male leaders commented similarly. Both male and female leaders stated that they only act in accordance with their own values. Self-Promotion. Another area where participants were concerned was that they perceived self-promotion as necessary for survival and success. Some faculty commented on how distasteful they found being required \"to brag \" about themselves and that they found this behavior to be out of line with a personal value of being humble and more dedicated to achieving good than to personal aggrandizement. The followingare illustrative: She said you have to brag. She said you have to brag, you really do. And that 's very difficult, and I think that 's difficult for many people because it 's not the nature of some of our cultures, experience and maybe just family culture, too. It 's not there for some of us. (female, senior)I wasn 't driven by the self-promotion that I think has to come on in academic institutions. So that self-promotion becomes more important than the work from an aca-demic, non-tenured faculty member. All of a sudden, they lose sight of why they 're doing what they 're doing. It's all about getting new grants, it 's a club of 'I have more than you and I 'm the expert in this. 'So it 's a little bit of unreal, self-promoting kind of environment. (male, left academic medicine) DISCUSSION Our research adds to the literature on the culture of academicmedicine by more comprehensively and explicitly identifying faculty values, and faculty perceptions of the lack of alignment of their own and perceived institutional values. Facultyreported being most energized when they were engaged in clinical caring, the social mission of medicine to provide excellent care for all patients regardless of means, teaching,intellectual stimulation and advancement of knowledge. Thesevalued activities aligned with the stated values of their five institutions. The faculty members we interviewed often in- ferred the values of their institution by observing behaviorsand actions. They reported a significant lack of alignment between their own and perceived institutional values. In particular, numerous faculty perceived a lack of attention tothe social mission of providing care for all people and to the community, a lack of prioritization of excellence in clinical care, a devaluing of educational roles, questionable ethicalbehavior among leadership or management, and the necessity for self-promoting behavior to achieve success. Values incon- gruence was associated with dissatisfaction, demoralizationand sometimes with intent to leave their institution oracademic medicine. Several quotations were from former faculty, but the same perspectives were expressed within all career categories. Others have written about the link between authenticity and productivity. Authenticity reflects acting in accordance with one 's values, preferences and needs, as opposed to acting merely to please others, to attain rewards or avoid punish- ments. 6,23,24Faculty are more likely to instill a passion for medicine in their students or conduct stellar research if theyare working on something that they are personally passion-ate about and that is aligned with their values. 6The con- trasting state of 'burnout 'results in lesser performance and 'depersonalization 'or the absence of bringing one 'sp e r s o n a l self to work.24Literature from other fields suggests that institutions need the ideas, self-expression, questioning and creativity that comes from empowering employees.25,26 Faculty values aligned well with the stated missions of most medical schools: clinical care, education and research. However, faculty based their perceptions of institutionalvalues on observed behaviors rather than mission state- ments. An organization achieves congruence when its es- poused principles and actions are aligned; our facultyfrequently reported the lack of such congruence. Outsidemedicine, Waterman, 27found that nine companies that practiced according to their v alues outperformed the Dow Jones industrial average by 350%. Collins also found that1293 Pololi et al.: Faculty Values JGIMorganizations were most successful where their values were embodied in the fabric of the organization, in its systems, practices, process and rewards.28 O u rr e s u l t sa l i g nw i t ht h er e s e a r c hf i n d i n g s29that women value consistently more than men benevolence and univer- salism (understanding, appreci ation, tolerance and protec- tion for the welfare of all people), and female physicians are more motivated by helping others than males.8This would s u g g e s tt h a tl a c ko fa l i g n m e n to fv a l u e sa ss h o w ni no u rd a t amay contribute to women 's lack of advancement in academic medicine. Another study from our interview data set shows that URM faculty report a call to serving their own under- served communities. 30The latter data suggest that values incongruence may be one factor contributing to the difficulty of academic medicine in recruiting and retaining URM faculty members.31,32 One limitation of our study is that our data were drawn from just five medical schools, but the schools were chosen to be representative of the nation in regional and organizationalcharacteristics, and their faculty demographics at the time of this study were almost identical to national means. However, for a qualitative hypothesis-generating study, the large num-ber of respondents and multi-institutional sample arestrengths. The responses may not be representative of the responses of all faculty, but do come from a diverse group of faculty in terms of gender, discipline, career stage and racewithin each of the five disparate medical schools. The themes we heard were dominant in the data and evident across all career stages of faculty. To assess for generalizability, thefindings from this study are being tested in a nationally representative survey of faculty from 26 medical schools. Another strength of the study is that it involved a researchteam from different disciplines and used accepted and rigorousapproaches to hypothesis- generating qualitative research. The carefully maintained confidentiality and anonymity of inter- views protected respondents and probably increased theirwillingness to be frank. Many interviewees commented that they were grateful to have the opportunity to express their views. However, this strength is also a limitation as itprevented us from analyzing data by subgroups, which might have jeopardized the anonymity of participants. By identifying faculty 's deeply held values as expressed when they feel most vital and successful, we hope that this study will increase medical school leaders 'awareness and promote con- gruence between individual values and institutional values,assisting the realization of the full potential and contributionsof a diverse faculty. What may be more challenging are faculty perceptions that the stated social and educational missions of academic medical centers, which are well aligned with theirindividual values, are not fully congruent with institutional behaviors. The findings of this study should encourage academ- ic medical institutions to address these faculty perceptions ofthe culture.

Freund, M.D., M.P.H.,2Mary Kleinman,3Maureen G. Phipps, S. M.D., Ph.D.15 Abstract Background: Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. Research has identied that women are less likely than men to receive medical interventions for the prevention and treatment of heartdisease. Methods and Results: As part of a campaign to educate healthcare professionals, 1245 healthcare professionals in 11 states attended a structured 1-hour continuing medical education (CME) program based on the 2004 AHAEvidence-Based Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Women and completed a pretest andposttest evaluation. We identied signicant knowledge decits in the pretest: 45% of attendees would initiallyrecommend lifestyle changes alone, rather than statin therapy, for women diagnosed with coronary arterydisease (CAD); 38% identied statin therapy as less effective in women compared with men for preventing CADevents; 27% identied Asian American women at low risk (rather than high risk) for type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM); and 21% identied processed meat (rather than baked goods) as the principal dietary source of trans fatty acids. Overall, healthcare professionals answered 5.1 of 8 knowledge questions correctly in the pretest, im- proving to 6.8 questions in the posttest ( p<0.001). Family physicians, obstetrician =gynecologists, general in- ternists, nurse practitioners =physician assistants, and registered nurses all statistically signicantly improved knowledge and self-assessed skills and attitudes as measured by the posttest.Conclusions: Signicant knowledge decits are apparent in a cross-section of healthcare providers attending a CME lecture on women and heart disease. A 1-hour presentation was successful in improving knowledge andself-assessed skills and attitudes among primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, andregistered nurses. 1Iris Cantor-UCLA Women's Health Center, Los Angeles, California. 2Boston University Center of Excellence in Women's Health, Boston, Massachusetts. 3University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois. 4Brown University =Women & Infants Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island. 5Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana. 6Deborah E.

DOI: 10.1089 =jwh.2008.1260 1541 Introduction The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign was developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Ofce on Women's Health(DHHS =OWH), the American Heart Association (AHA), and other partner organizations to address the lack of heart dis- ease awareness among women. This campaign was based onrecommendations from experts who convened in 2001 todevelop a national action plan to reduce heart disease in women. 1The action plan recommended that women speak with their healthcare provider about specic risks that womenhave for cardiovascular disease (CVD); therefore, a provider education campaign component was commissioned by the NHLBI through the U.S. DHHS =OWH in 2003. Lack of healthcare provider knowledge of the guidelines for prevention of CVD in women has been identied as a barrier to reducing morbidity and mortality in this popula-tion. Historically, studies have shown that women receive less cholesterol screening, less lipid-lowering therapies, less use of heparin, beta-blockers and aspirin during myocardial infarc-tion (MI), and fewer referrals to cardiac rehabilitation com-pared with men. These studies suggest that women are less likely than men to receive guideline-recommended care across the spectrum of CVD prevention and treatment, includingthose within the scope of primary care. 2-5There is further evidence that minority women may be less likely to receive appropriate treatment than white women even when access tocare is similar or identical. 6-10We conducted the following study to assess healthcare providers' baseline knowledge of CVD and to determine the effects of a structured educationalprogram on provider knowledge and self-assessed skills. Materials and Methods The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign was developed by a consortium of federally designated NationalCenters of Excellence in Women's Health, based at academic medical centers, and National Community Centers of Ex- cellence in Women's Health, based in community healthcenters, community hospitals, and other community-based organizations providing healthcare. The Heart Truth Profes- sional Education Campaign educational objectives were basedon the 2004 Guidelines for the Prevention of CardiovascularDisease in Women developed by the AHA in consultation with NHLBI and other stakeholders. 11Educational materials development was informed by an advisory panel includingexperts from multiple medical associations and federal expert panels, as well as focus groups of women consumers who commented on information they wanted their healthcareproviders to know and communicate. Provider education materials included continuing medical education (CME) lectures, additional slide resources, web-based CME modules posted on Medscape /C210, standardized patient and problem-based learning materials for medical and nursing students, printed guides to web-based resources fordiagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CVD in women, abibliography, and a static website providing access to the materials. Versions of these materials (updated to reflect the 2007 AHA =NHLBI Evidence-Based Guidelines for the Pre- vention of Cardiovascular Disease in Women) can be accessed at www.womenshealth.gov =hearttruth =.The CME lecture component was developed as a 1-hour lecture. Lecturers selected a slide set from three standardized sets of materials, all with the same 31 essential slides ad- dressing guidelines for the prevention of heart disease inwomen (Appendix). The essential slides were supplemented with 15-20 slides that provided additional information on guidelines topics. At each lecture, the presenter chose whichsupplemental slides to include based on the presenter's as- sessment of the audience's knowledge base and interests. This format was based on expert recommendations that presen-tations should be available to address the interests of threemain groups: (1) healthcare professionals who do not them- selves prescribe medications for heart disease (expanded information on counseling and lifestyle information), (2)healthcare professionals judged to have average interest and experience in preventing, diagnosing and treating heart disease (expanded information most relevant to basic guide-lines), and (3) healthcare professionals judged to have above- average interest and experience in preventing, diagnosing and treating heart disease (expanded information on recentcontroversies, e.g., folic acid use, high-sensitivity C-reactiveprotein (hsCRP) testing). Lecture materials included anno- tated discussion of the information on each slide and refer- ences to support facts presented. Presenters were instructednot to deviate from the lecture format in order to standardize the material presented. The CME lecture was delivered by a local or regional expert on heart disease and women. The choice of qualications for the speaker was made based on the expected composition of the audience. These expert speakers included generalist andspecialist physicians, advanced practice nurses, and regis- tered nurses with cardiovascular expertise. CME venues in- cluded grand rounds presentations and other clinic andhospital-based CME programs as well as free-standing CMEprograms. Sixty-eight presentations were made in 11 states (Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, andWisconsin) during an 18-month period from July 2005 through December 2006. Participants were prompted by the presenter and a slide to complete a pretest form before the lecture and a posttest form after the lecture. The pretest-posttest evaluation questions were formulated by experts and pilot tested by groups ofhealthcare providers of varying background and exper-tise. The pretest form contained ve demographic questions, ve self-assessment of knowledge and preparedness (skills) questions, and eight multiple-choice knowledge assessmentquestions. The posttest contained four questions soliciting feedback on the program in addition to the original ve self- assessment of knowledge and preparedness (skills) questionsand eight multiple choice knowledge assessment questions from the pretest. Knowledge questions were drawn from content addressing the following curricular objectives: riskstratication, lifestyle modication, pharmacotherapy, and implications of race and ethnicity in CVD prevention in women. Following the lecture, participants were asked to complete a pretest-posttest evaluation form containing information about the research portion of the evaluation. This form was completed anonymously, and participants were given theoption to exclude their information from being used for re- search. The research portion of the project received Institu-1542 PREGLER ET AL. tional Review Board approval or exemption from all partici- pating institutions. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Results Of the 2155 healthcare professionals attending the CME lectures, 1285 (59.6%) completed and returned the pretest- posttest form. No information is available about the 40% of CME attendees who did not return the pretest-posttest form.One CME lecture was excluded from our data analysis be-cause no attendance information or pretest forms were ob- tained. Practice characteristics of providers are shown in Table 1. Subgroup analysis was performed for family physi-cians, general internists, obstetrician =gynecologists, nurse practitioners =physician assistants, and registered nurses. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are grouped forpurposes of reporting because no signicant differences were found between these two groups. Knowledge assessment Table 2 shows the pretest and posttest results for all healthcare professionals. Subgroups included family physi-cians, obstetrician =gynecologists, general internists, nurse practitioners =physician assistants, and registered nurses. A mixed-model ANOVA demonstrated a signicant interactioneffect between subgroups and a gain in knowledge as well as baseline differences. Overall, healthcare professionals answered 5.1 of 8.0 know- ledge questions correctly in the pretest. Family physicianswere signicantly more knowledgeable than obstetrician = gynecologists at pretest ( p<0.001). Registered nurses were signicantly less knowledgeable than other groups (p<0.001). Healthcare professionals improved their knowl- edge scores at posttest to 6.8 of 8.0 questions; this is a 28% increase over the pretest knowledge scores ( p<0.001) (Fig. 1). The increase in posttest over pretest scores was signicantlyimproved for each of the subgroups ( p<0.001). At posttest, there was one statistically signicant difference between subgroups: registered nurses were signicantly less knowl-edgeable than family physicians, obstetrician =gynecologists, and nurse practitioners =physician ( p<0.001). signicant knowledge ned as /C2120% of attendees endorsing a specic wrong answer) before the CME lecture. These decits included the following: 45% of attendees would initially recommend life- style changes alone (rather than statin therapy) for womendiagnosed with CVD; 38% identied statin therapy as less effective in women compared with men for preventing CVD events; 27% identied Asian American women as having alower risk (rather than higher risk) for type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM); and 21% identied processed meat (rather than baked goods) as the principal dietary source of trans fatty acids. At posttest, there was a signicant improvement in the knowledge decits for all questions; however, 30% of at- tendees continued to endorse lifestyle changes alone initially, rather than statin therapy, for women diagnosed with CVD,and 22% identied statin therapy as less effective in women compared with men for preventing CVD events. Prior to the CME lecture, attendees who indicated they treat patients with heart disease in clinical practice were sig- nicantly more knowledgeable than attendees who indicated they do not treat patients with heart disease ( p<0.001). After the CME lecture, there was no signicant difference inknowledge between these two subgroups. Self-assessment of knowledge Self-assessment of knowledge was judged on a 5-point Likert scale from Not at all knowledgeable to Very knowl-edgeable for two issues: (1) knowledge about current ap- proaches to smoking cessation, exercise, weight management, and diet to reduce risk for CVD in women and (2) knowledgeabout goals for major risk factor interventions to prevent CVDin women, including goals for management of blood pressure, lipids, and DM. Mean results for the pretest and posttest are presented in Table 3. All subgroups showed a highly signi-cant improvement in self-assessed knowledge after the CME session ( p<0.001). At pretest, family physicians rated them- selves as more knowledgeable than the other subgroups. Thisdifference disappeared at posttest, with the exception of reg- istered nurses; they continued to rate themselves as less knowledgeable than other groups despite their improvementafter the CME session. Self-assessment of preparedness (skills) Self-assessment of skills was judged on a 5-point Likert scale from Not at all prepared to Completely prepared for three issues: (1) preparedness to assess and stratify womeninto high, intermediate, low, and optimal risk categories for heart disease, (2) preparedness to counsel women about theTable 1.Practice Characteristics of Lecture Attendees: The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign Continuing Medical Education Specialty Number % Family physician 162 13 General internist 131 10Obstetrician =gynecologist 151 12 Cardiologist 9 0.7 Other M.D. or D.O.a94 7 Nurse midwife 29 2Nurse practitioner 151 12 Physician assistant 25 2 Registered nurse 346 27Other 181 14 Missing 6 0.5 Weekly clinical activity of attendees 0-25 patients 3726-50 patients 23 51-75 patients 19 76-99 patients 13>99 patients 8 Percentage of patients who are women 0-25% 9 26-50% 2851-75% 31 75-99% 24 of Medicine; D.O., Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.HEART TRUTH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGN 1543 Table 2.Pretest-Posttest Knowledge Scores by Specialty: % Correct by Learning Objective: The Heart Truth Professional Education Campaign All General internist Family practitioner OB =GYNaPA=NP RN Objective Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Identify factors that place women at high risk ( >20% over correct information about use Identify that African Americans, Latinas, and Asian Americans are not at low risk of type 2 DM59.4 Identify that African Americans are most likely to die from heart disease among women of all races and NP/ RN FIG. 1.

Discussion A standardized 1-hour didactic session with evidence- based materials tailored toward the presenter's assessment of audience needs improved healthcare providers' knowledge of gender-specic prevention and treatment issues in CVD. Thesession also increased providers' self-assessed efcacy in ad- dressing heart disease in women. The educational program was widely accepted by a range of healthcare professionals,including primary care physicians of various specialties, nurses, and nurse practitioners and physician assistants. De- spite knowledge gains, signicant knowledge gaps persistedafter CME training. CVD remains the most common reason for death in women in the United States. To reduce the incidence of CVD in women, efforts have focused on educating healthcare con-sumers about risk and supporting gender-specic re- search about CVD. Knowledge gaps identied in this studyTable 3.Pretest-Posttest Self-Assessment of Knowledge and Preparedness: Heart Truth Education Campaigna Pretest Posttest n MbSD M SD Self-assessment of knowledge question How knowledgeable are you about current approaches to smoking cessation, exercise, weight management and diet to reduce risk for CVD in women?Family physician 155 3.9 /C60.6 /C60.7 3.7 /C60.8 Total 943 3.5 /C60.9 3.9 /C60.8 How knowledgeable are you about goals for major risk factor interventions to prevent CVD in women?Family physician 152 4.0 /C60.6 3.4 /C61.0 3.9 /C60.8 Self-assessment of preparedness question How prepared are you to assess and stratify women into high, intermediate, lower, and optimal risk categoriesfor CVD?Family physician 155 3.6 /C6 0.8 320 /C61.0 3.4 /C60.8 Total 938 3.0 /C61.0 3.7 /C60.8 How prepared are you to counsel a woman who asks about the use of hormone therapy, antioxidant supplements, or aspirin to reduce coronary diseaseevent risk with up-to-date information?Family physician 149 3.5 /C60.8 General /C60.9 Total 924 2.9 /C61.0 3.8 /C60.9 How prepared are you to prevent, evaluate, and treat heart disease in women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds?Family physician 152 3.2 /C60.8 /C60.9 /C61.0 Total 927 2.6 /C61.0 3.6 /C60.9 aMean scores are based on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 dened as Not at all knowledgeable, and 5 dened as Very knowledgeable. bM, mean; SD, PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGN 1545 demonstrate that specic strategies to disseminate knowledge of CVD in women to healthcare professionals are urgently needed. The baseline knowledge assessment revealed some inter- esting gaps in knowledge. For example, a third or more of respondents were unaware that statins are recommended for all women with known CVD and that statins have specicbenets for women. Few studies have systematically assessed gender-specic gaps in provider knowledge. In one study, 300 primary care physicians, 100 obstetrician =gynecologists, and 100 cardiologists were asked to respond to experimental casesof CVD in women and men; this study found that women in the experimental cases were more likely to be inappropriately assigned to low-risk categories than men. Women who wereinappropriately identied as low risk were less likely to re- ceive appropriate recommendations for lifestyle change and preventive pharmacotherapy. 12More information is needed about gender-specic gaps in provider knowledge to better understand how to tailor gender-specic information in CME programs to ensure that women receive evidence-based carefrom their providers. Healthcare providers in our study demonstrated knowl- edge of the greater prevalence of risk factors for CVD in the African American population; however, they had lessknowledge about risk factors in Asian American women. Other studies have shown racial disparities in care even after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES), including onestudy that found cholesterol-lowering drugs are less com- monly used after MI by African Americans than by whites, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. 9Another study assessing racial disparities in clinical evaluation of CVD practice found that when presented with identical case his- tories deemed by experts to warrant further cardiac testing,physicians were signicantly less likely to suggest cardiacevaluation for an African American woman than for either a white or African American man or a white woman. In this study, clinicians evaluated identical case histories presentedby videotaped actors, so that the scenario varied only by the apparent race and gender of the patient. 10 Providers' lack of knowledge about trans fatty acids may reflect the timing of the intervention. CME presentations oc- curred before the announcement of proposed government regulations to reduce dietary trans fatty acids, which werepublicized at the end of 2006. 13However, lack of knowledge about dietary trans fatty acids may also accurately reflect healthcare providers' current lack of knowledge and training about dietary issues. A limitation of the study was the use of self-assessment to measure providers' preparedness and skills. Providers self- selected to attend the program; this may have resulted in agroup that was more knowledgeable or less knowledgeable than providers as a whole. The effectiveness of the program might be different if it were made mandatory or if presenterswere more or less expert in the topic area or skilled as edu- cators. Because presentations were made by different pre- senters and the presenters were standardized only in coreelements, some groups may have had repetitions in materialsor more effective verbal explanations than others. The deci- sion to test knowledge gained using an identical pretest and posttest could have introduced bias, as participants likely hadheightened interest in hearing information about questions initially posed.Because of the short-term follow-up period, the study did not reassess provider knowledge after a period of time had lapsed to demonstrate that the information learned at the CME lecture was retained. The study lacks data on actualclinical practice as pretest and whether the practice of the providers changes after the CME program. Efforts to study long-term effects of The Heart Truth CME programs areunderway. Conclusions Signicant knowledge decits are apparent in a cross- section of healthcare providers attending a CME lecture onwomen and heart disease. A 1-hour presentation was suc- cessful in improving knowledge and self-assessed skills and attitudes among primary care physicians, nurse practitioners = physician assistants, and registered nurses.

M. Cheng \u00c6E. M. Krupitsky 10 April 2008 /C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008 Abstract The purpose of this study was to assess whether HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk factors: risky sex (multiple sex partners and sex trade involvement), pastHIV or STI diagnosis and substance use (at risk drinking and injection drug use) are associated with the outcome any condom use in the past 6 months among Russian narcologyhospital patients. Participants ( N=178) included only those who reported unprotected sex in the past 6 months and were aged 18-55 years and 76% male. Any condom use inthe past 6 months was reported by 55% of the sample. His- tory of STIs was reported by 43% of participants; 15% were HIV-infected. Regression analyses adjusted for demo-graphics demonstrated that those reporting multiple sex partners (OR adj=4.2, 95% CI =2.0-8.7) and sex trade involvement (OR adj=2.4, 95% CI =1.1-5.1) in the past6 months had signicantly higher odds of reporting any condom use in this same timeframe. HIV/STI and substance use were not associated with increased odds of condom use. Keywords Condom use /C1HIV /C1Substance abuse Introduction HIV infection was rare in Eastern Europe in the mid-1990s, but its prevalence has been increasing without effective prevention efforts in the past decade. The Russian Feder-ation (heretofore referred to as Russia) currently has an adult HIV prevalence rate of 1.1%; this country also has the largest number of HIV-infected individuals in all ofEurope, 370,000 as of 2006 (UNAIDS 2007 ). At the heart of the Russian epidemic is the large number of young injection drug users (IDUs), primarily in urban centers(UNAIDS 2007 ). Approximately 2.5% of the adult popu- lation in Russia is an IDU (UNAIDS 2006 b); 66% of Russians infected with HIV in 2005 and 2006 acquired the virus via injection drug use (UNAIDS 2006 a; UNAIDS 2007 ). Notably, however, growing numbers of individuals in Russia are becoming infected via sexual transmission\u2014 from less than 10% in 2000 to more than 40% in 2005 (UNAIDS 2006 a). Recent clinical and epidemiologic data now indicate that sexual transmission of HIV may be the most rapidly increasing of all HIV infection transmission risk behaviors in the region (Aral et al. 2005 ). Sexual transmission of HIV infection within Russia is assumed to result from HIV-infected IDUs engaging in unprotected sex, bridging the epidemic to non-IDU popu-lations. Studies with IDUs recruited from urban centers within Russia have found that the majority reports recent sexual activity, multiple partners and non-condom use,A. Raj (&)/C1J. H.

Coleman Data Coordinating Center, Boston University School of PublicHealth, Boston, MA, USA 123AIDS Behav (2009) 13:310-317 DOI 10.1007/s10461-008-9383-3particularly with steady sex partners (Rhodes et al. 2004 ; Somlai et al. 2002 ; Takacs et al. 2006 ). The epidemic has been propelled even further via the link between injection drug use and sex work, particularly for female IDUs. Asubstantial proportion of female IDUs (37%) report having engaged in sex work (Benotsch et al. 2004 ), and those engaging in sex work are more likely to report both riskyinjection drug use and a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as compared with male IDUs or female IDUs reporting no history of sex work (Karapetyan et al. 2002 ; Platt et al. 2005 ). Nonetheless, awareness of HIV risk among IDUs is increasing (UNAIDS 2006 b), and HIV risk perceptions among IDUs in Russia are actually greater than that seen in the United States (US) (Ksobiech et al. 2005 ). Recent evidence from Russia raises the possibility that HIV may be spreading beyond IDUs and sex workers and reaching those with problem alcohol behavior (Krupitskyet al. 2004 ; UNAIDS 2006 a). Increased risk for HIV among Russians with unhealthy alcohol use would affect a substantial proportion of the Russian population, as Russiahas one of the highest per capita use of alcohol in the world (Nemtsov 2000 ; World Health Organization 2004 ). Research with a representative sample of Russian adoles-cents and adults found that one-third of sexually active individuals used alcohol prior to their last sex (Vannap- pagari 2004 ); additional research from Russia documents pervasive perceptions of at risk episodic drinking prior to sex and unprotected sex as social norms (World Health Organization 2005 ). Although Russian studies have not examined whether drinking risky amounts of alcohol increases likelihood of risky sexual practices, this may be the case given study ndings from the US documentingthat those reporting drinking risky amounts of alcohol are more likely to report a history of STI, sex with multiple partners, sex trade involvement and unprotectedsex (Kalichman et al. 2007 ; Markos 2005 ; Raj et al. 2007 ; Rasch et al. 2000 ; Weinhardt and Carey 2000 ). In summary, current research indicates that IDUs and risky drinkers in Russia are experiencing notable rates of HIV/STI and report notable HIV risks, including multiple partners, sex trade involvement and unprotected sex(Benotsch et al. 2004 ; Krupitsky et al. 2004 ; Platt et al. 2005 ; Rhodes et al. 2004 ; Somlai et al. 2002 ; Takacs et al. 2006 ; Karapetyan et al. 2002 ). Such research has not, however, examined associations between HIV/STI risk histories and condom use. Condom use in Russia generally is uncommon and primarily for pregnancy prevention whenit does occur (Bobrova et al. 2005 ; Vannappagari 2004 ; World Health Organization 2005 ); thus, increased likeli- hood of condom use among riskier Russian substance userscannot be assumed, although this has been shown to be the case among US substance users (Bogart et al. 2005 ;Kwiatkowski et al. 1999 ; Shlay et al. 2004 ). The current study seeks to build upon the growing body of work in the area of substance use and sexual risk in Russia by assessing whether history of HIV/STI and risky sexual and substanceuse behaviors are associated with increased likelihood of any condom use among Russian narcology patients reporting recent unprotected sex. Any versus proportion ofcondom use was examined to provide insight into which patients ever and never use condoms, among this sample of patients who have engaged in recent unprotected sex. Findings from this work can be used to inform the growing sexual prevention and intervention efforts in Eastern Eur-ope and other regions in which substance use plays a central role in the HIV epidemic (UNAIDS 2006 b). Methods Study Design & Subject Recruitment Data for this research came from the Russian PREVENT (Partnership to Reduce the Epidemic Via Engagement in Narcology Treatment) study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV behavioral intervention in narcologyhospital in-patients in Russia. The PREVENT study included alcohol and/or drug-dependent men and women recruited from two narcology hospitals in the vicinity of St.Petersburg, Russia: (a) the Leningrad Regional Center for Addictions (LRCA) and (b) the Medical Narcology Reha- bilitation Center (MNRC). Narcology hospitals are astandard treatment setting for drug and alcohol dependent persons in Russia and Eastern Europe. Typically, the hos- pitalization is 3-4 weeks in length and involves patientsundergoing detoxication and then receiving addiction treatment. Participants for this study were recruited from October 2004 to April 2005. Trained physician research associates approached all patients after initial detoxication (3-7 days after program entry) and assessed them for study eligibility.Eligible participants were 18 years or older, reported unprotected vaginal or anal sex in the past 6 months, and had a primary diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependence.Additional study entry criteria were the following: absti- nence from alcohol and other abusive substances for 48 h; willing to undergo HIV testing as per standard narcologyhospital protocol if not known to be HIV-infected; willing and able to provide contact information for themselves as well as a relative or close friend through whom they couldbe contacted; residing within 150 km of St. Petersburg; and possessing a home telephone. Individuals who were not fluent in Russian or demonstrated severe cognitiveimpairment as assessed by the research associate's clinical judgment at recruitment were excluded from the study.AIDS Behav (2009) 13:310-317 311 123Overall, 329 individuals were approached and screened for participation in this study. Of these, 129 were excluded due to not meeting eligibility criteria; 70 of these 129 ineligible participants reported no unprotected anal or vaginal sex inthe last 6 months; breakdown of participants reporting abstinence versus those reporting consistent condom use were not available. Of the 200 eligible participants iden-tied, 19 (9.5%) refused participation, yielding a nal sample size of N=181. All eligible and willing subjects provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment. Procedure Subsequent to recruitment and eligibility assessment, all participants provided written informed consent and receivedtheir baseline survey, which assessed demographics, HIV risk behaviors, substance use behaviors and other key health indicators. At baseline, while subjects were in the narcologyhospitals, survey data were collected in two ways: (a) a face- to-face interview with a staff trained in survey administra- tion and not providing care to the participant and (b) acomputerized survey\u2014Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interviewing (ACASI) system. ACASI removes the inter- viewer and, therefore, allows additional privacy, minimizesliteracy issues, encourages truth telling, and provides an identical recording of each question; using this system has been shown to enhance the quality of self-report behavioralassessments, to maintain condentiality, and to provide an acceptable method for collecting self-reports of HIV risk behavior (Newman et al. 2002 ). All interviews were con- ducted in Russian, and participants were compensated US$5 for the baseline assessment. The current analyses include data collected at the baseline assessment. Given the focus ofthe current study on condom use in the past 3-6 months, female participants reporting exclusively female sex part- ners ( n=3) were excluded from analyses, yielding a nal sample size of 178 subjects. Measures Independent VariablesThe six main independent variables for this study were risky sexual behaviors (multiple sex partners and sex tradeinvolvement), substance use behaviors (at risk drinking and injection drug use), history of STI, and HIV serostatus. Risky sexual behaviors were assessed via survey items from the Risk Assessment Battery (Navaline et al. 1994 ); the RAB was chosen based on its previously demonstrated validity with Russian narcology patients (Krupitsky 2005 ). A single item asked participants the number of sex partnersin the past 6 months; participants were dened as having multiple sex partners if they reported two or more partners in this time frame. Two additional RAB items were used to assess buying sex with money or drugs (buying sex) andselling sex for money or drugs (selling sex) in the past 6 months. Sex trade involvement was dened as either buying or selling sex within the past 6 months. Alcohol consumption in the past 30 days was collected using a Timeline Followback (TLFB) approach (Dillon et al. 2005 ; Midanik et al. 1998 ; Vinson et al. 2003 ; Weinhardt et al. 1998 ), in which participants noted the number of drinks they had in each of the past 30 days priorto hospitalization. At Risk Drinking was dened as having ve or more drinks per day for men and 4 or more for women, in the past 30 days, based on an NIAAA denitionof at risk drinking (NIAAA 2005 ). Two RAB items assessed recent injection drug use. The rst item asked whether the participant engaged in injection drug use in thepast 6 months; the second asked, for those reporting yes on item one, whether they had shared needles or works when injecting drugs in the past 6 months. IDU was dened asengaging in any injection drug use in the past 6 months. Additional data collected included substance use diagnosis based on the narcology hospital record; staff psychiatristsprovided diagnoses at intake as part of clinical care. Diagnoses were based on ICD-X criteria (the standard Russian diagnostic manual). STI diagnosis was collected via self-report. Participants were asked via survey whether they had ever been diag- nosed with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital warts,genital herpes, other STIs (dened to exclude HIV) or pelvic inflammatory disease (women only); history of STI was dened as having any STI diagnosis ever. HIV sero-status was determined by HIV test results documented in the narcology hospital record. All narcology hospital patients are tested for HIV at program entry unless they arealready known to be HIV-infected; patient HIV serostatus was then noted in the patient's medical record. Outcomes The primary outcome of interest was any condom use (yes vs. no), among all partners; this was assessed via a singleRAB item on frequency of condom use in the past 6 months. Secondary outcomes were any condom use with main partners (past 3 months) and any condom use withcasual partners (past 3 months). A series of questions examined condom use with main partners and casual partners: the number of times engaged in vaginal or analsex and condom protected vaginal or anal sex, with each type of partner in the past 3 months. A main sex partner was dened as ''the person you have sex with most oftenand regularly and/or the person with whom you feel most312 AIDS Behav (2009) 13:310-317 123attached,'' and casual partners were dened as ''people you have sex with less frequently and with whom you do not consider yourself in a steady relationship.'' Confounders Demographic data collected included age, gender, marital status, sex of partners, education and employment, assessedvia single survey items. The potential confounding factors included in regression analyses were: age, gender, and marital status (currently married vs. single, divorced, or widowed). Data Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study subjects at baseline. Logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders were conducted to assess asso-ciations between risky sexual behaviors (multiple sex partners and sex trade involvement), substance use behaviors (at risk drinking and injection drug use), andSTI/HIV diagnoses with the outcome any condom use. Separate models were t for each potential predictor. Independent variables that were signicant at an alphalevel of 0.05 were included together in a nal multivariable model that also adjusted for potential confounding factors. Analyses of the secondary outcomes any condom use bymain partner were conducted in the subset of subjects reporting a main partner and any condom use by casual sex partners were conducted only in the subset reporting acasual partner. The secondary outcomes were analyzed using the same approach as that described for the primary outcome. To minimize the potential for collinearity, weassessed correlation between pairs of independent variables and veried that no pair of variables included in the same regression model was highly correlated (i.e., r[0.40). Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results Sample Characteristics Participants were aged 18-55 years (mean age 33.2 years) and predominantly male (75.8%). Half (50.6%) were unemployed; 6.2% had less than a high school education (Table 1). One-third of the sample (33.1%) was married, and 75.3% had a main sex partner. Nearly everyone (96.1%) identied as heterosexual; involvement with same sex partners was reported by 7.9% of participants.Condom Use, STI/HIV Diagnosis, and Risky Sex and Substance Use Behaviors Condom use in the past 6 months was reported by 55.1% of the participants. Notably, although those screened into thestudy were required to have engaged in at least one unprotected sex episode in the past 6 months, 2.8% of survey participants reported no unprotected sex in the past6 months during the baseline assessment. Among those reporting sex with main partners ( n=125), 33.6% repor- ted condom use with these partners, with only 5.6%reporting that it was consistent condom use. Similarly, among those reporting sex with casual partners ( n=107), 50.5% reported condom use with these partners, with13.1% reporting that it was consistent condom use. Almost half the sample (42.9) reported a history of STI diagnosis, and 14.6% of the sample was HIV-infected. Themajority of the sample (69.1%) reported multiple sex partners in the past 6 months, with 26.4% of the sample reporting 4 or more sex partners in this timeframe.(Table 1) More than a quarter of the sample (27.0%) reported sex trade involvement, with 11.2% reporting selling of sex and 18.5% reporting purchase of sex. Almost three-quarters of the sample (71.9%) reported alcohol use in the past 30 days; 64.0% reported at risk drinking in this same period. Past 6 months injection druguse was reported by 39.5% of the sample, with 77.1% of these IDUs reporting needle or works sharing in this same timeframe. These ndings are consistent with subjects'clinical diagnoses, which indicate that 60.1% of this sample is alcohol-dependent, 31.5% heroin dependent, and 8.4% both alcohol and heroin dependent. Associations of HIV/STI, Risky Sex and Substance Use Behaviors with Condom Use In models adjusted for age, gender, and marital status, participants reporting multiple sex partners (OR adj=4.2, 95% CI =2.0-8.7) and sex trade involvement (OR adj= 2.4, 95% CI =1.1-5.1) had a higher odds of reporting any condom use in the past 6 months. (Table 2.) In the nal regression model including relevant demographics andboth multiple sex partners and sex trade involvement, only multiple sex partners remained signicantly associated with condom use (OR adj=3.6, 95% CI =1.7-7.9). Secondary analyses conducted to assess variables asso- ciated with condom use by type of sex partner, main or casual revealed that among those with a main sex partner,having multiple sex partners was signicantly associated with condom use with the main partner (OR adj2.5, 95% CI=1.0-6.0, P=.04). (Table 3.) Among those with a casual partner, the effect of having multiple sex partnersAIDS Behav (2009) 13:310-317 313 123could not be evaluated as only 3 of 107 (2.8%) subjects reported no multiple sex partners. Discussion Despite very high HIV/STI risk in this sample-43% with an STI history and 15% HIV-infected, almost half of the par- ticipants from this study of in-treatment substance users reported no condom use. Such ndings are not indicative ofRussian narcology patients as a whole, as the sampleexcluded those sexually abstaining and those using condoms consistently in the past 6 months, but the ndings do indicatethat among those patients engaging unprotected sex, many are not using condoms at all. Findings from the current study support previous research from non-substance using Russiansamples which indicate low condom use in this population (Bobrova et al. 2005 ; Vannappagari 2004 ; World Health Organization 2005 ), but do indicate greater condom use among substance users. Nonetheless, greater efforts remain needed to promote condom use in Russia, particularly amongat risk populations such as those in substance use treatment.Table 1 Demographics, HIV/ STI history, risky sexual and substance use behaviors amongnarcology hospital patients in St. Petersburg, Russia (N=178)Characteristic % For total sample% Reporting any condom use by characteristicChi-square (df), P-value Sex Male 75.8 54.1 .22 (1), .64Female 58.1 Employment status Employed 49.4 46.6 5.04 (1), .02Unemployed 50.6 63.3 Level of education \\High school education 6.2 54.6 .001 (1), .97 CHigh school education 93.8 55.1 Marital status Married 33.1 49.2 (1), .26Single/divorced/widowed 58.0 Positive 14.6 61.5 .52 (1), .47Negative 85.4 54.0 Risky sexual behavior Multiple sex 65.0 16.04 (1), \\.0001 No 8.47 (1), .004No 48.5 Substance useAt Yes 64.0 49.0 3.13 (1), .08No 36.0 62.2 Injection 60.5 49.5314 AIDS Behav (2009) 13:310-317 123Importantly, those participants with a history of HIV/ STI diagnosis were no more likely to report condom use. Such ndings may be a consequence of low HIV riskperceptions related to sexual behaviors, as they correspond to other Russian research indicating low HIV risk percep- tions among STI clinic patients (Benotsch et al. 2004 ). Those reporting recent injection drug use, which for themajority involved sharing of needles, also were no more likely to use condoms. This nding was particularly strik- ing given high rates of HIV among IDUs. A recent studyfrom St. Petersburg, the site of this study, indicates that 30% of IDUs in the city are HIV-infected (Shaboltas et al. 2006 ); further, cross-national research has found higher HIV risk perceptions with regard to injection drug use and yet greater use of needle sharing among Russian comparedto US IDUs (Ksobiech et al. 2005 ). Overall, these ndings suggest that HIV risk among Russian substance users may be affecting injection drug use but not sexual behaviors.Greater focus on sexual risk and risk reduction among IDUs is likely needed to address the HIV epidemic in Russia, given recent ndings from St. Petersburg IDUs thatdocument higher rates of HIV among those reporting a greater number of partners as well as among females reporting sex trade involvement (Kozlov et al. 2006 ). Condom use was found to be linked with other sexual practices in this study; specically, multiple sex partners in the past year and sex trade involvement. These ndings areconsistent with those seen with US substance using samples (Bogart et al. 2005 ; Kwiatkowski et al. 1999 ; Shlay et al. 2004 ).

Although, this association may also bethe case for casual relationships, it could not be established in the current study due to too few participants reporting only one casual sex partner. While the current ndings contribute to our growing understanding of the HIV epidemic in Russia, this study has several limitations. The cross-sectional design reflecting a single point in time limits the ability to establish causality. Reliance on self-report for behavioral risk variables poten-tially results in social desirability and recall biases. Recall bias was minimized by using short timeframes for behavior assessment (i.e., past 1-6 months prior to hospitalization).Social desirability bias was mitigated by use of the ACASI technology to assess risk behavior; such a bias typically results in an underestimate rather than overestimate of riskbehavior and STI prevalence (Newman et al. 2002 ). Conclusion and Implications Among substance dependent patients in Russia, condom use is low and does not appear to be associated with some of the important risk factors for HIV infection. The factthat condom use behaviors are affected in the context of steady relationships when the substance-using individual has multiple other sex partners, suggests that some sexualrisk reduction education is reaching this population and could be further reinforced with proper intervention. Fur- ther, this study demonstrates that narcology treatmentsettings are an important venue in which HIV intervention could occur. Overall, this study demonstrates that sexual risk among alcohol and drug dependent patients in Russiaspecically is an important HIV prevention issue meriting research and clinical attention.

Participants (N=181) were narcology hospital patients assessed on demographics, alcohol use, risky sex, and STD/HIV diagnoses. Adjusted GEE logistic regression analysis examined the association between binge drinking and same day unprotected sex across each of the past 30 days, per participant (N=5430 observations). Participants were age 18-55 years, 75% male, and 64% binge drinking. Sex trade was reported by 27%; history of STDs by 43%; and HIV by 15%. One-fourth of daily observations included sex; 88% of these involved unprotected sex. Binge drinking was not associated with same day unprotected sex (OR adj=1.0, 95% CI=0.7-1.4, 2 (1, N=5219)=0.01, ns). Findings document substantial HIV/STD risk and prevalence among Russian narcology patients, but no link between binge drinking and unprotected sex in this population, possibly due to very low rates of condom use generally. Keywords unprotected sex; condom use; alcohol INTRODUCTION HIV infection was rare in Eastern Europe in the mid-1990's, but its prevalence has been increasing in the past decade. AIDS deaths in this region doubled between 2003 and 2005 (1). The Russian Federation (heretofore referred to as Russia) currently has the largest number of HIV cases in all of Europe (1 ). At the heart of the Russian epidemic is the large number of young injection drug users (IDUs), primarily in urban centers (1). Data from early 2004 indicated that 80% of all officially reported cases in the country were transmitted by injection drug use (1). However, sexual transmission of HIV in Russia is rapidly increasing; 25% of HIV infections were attributable to sexual contact in 2004, compared to 6% in 2001 ( 1).

Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October Published in final edited form Abus Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptclinical and epidemiologic data indicate that sexual transmission of HIV infection in this region may be the most rapidly increasing of all HIV infection transmission risk behaviors (2). Sexual transmission of HIV infection within Russia is assumed to result from HIV-infected IDUs engaging in unprotected sex, bridging the epidemic to non-IDU populations. Studies with IDUs recruited from urban centers within Russia have found that the majority reports recent sexual activity, multiple partners and non-condom use (3,4). The epidemic has been propelled even further via the link between injection drug use and sex work, particularly for female IDUs. A substantial proportion of female IDUs (37%) report having engaged in sex work (5) and those engaging in sex work are more likely to report both risky injection drug use and a history of sexually transmitted diseases, as compared with male IDUs or IDUs reporting no history of sex work (6,7). Some evidence from Russia raises the possibility that HIV may be spreading beyond IDUs and sex workers and reaching those with alcohol dependence (8). Increased risk for HIV among Russians with alcohol problems such as binge alcohol use would affect a substantial proportion of the Russian population, as Russia has one of the highest per capita use of alcohol in the world (5,9,10). The issue of a possible association between unsafe sex and alcohol use is important as the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, which assesses behavior and health with a representative sample of Russians aged 14-49 years, found that one-third of sexually active participants engaged in alcohol use at last sexual episode (11). To better address how alcohol may be linked to sexual risk within this population, research is needed to assess the association between binge drinking and unprotected sex within the Russian context. Recent research has examined sexual risk among IDUs in Russia ( 3,7) but not between binge alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors. Nonetheless, studies from other countries suggest such a link likely exists and is a concern for an expansion of the HIV epidemic to Russians engaging in binge alcohol use. Studies in the United States and Western Europe indicate that binge drinkers are more likely to engage in riskier sexual activities (e.g., multiple sex partners) and less likely to use condoms generally (12,13). Further, there is some, albeit inconsistent, evidence that excessive use of alcohol when engaging in sex reduces the likelihood of protected sex in that episode (12,13). In summary, research demonstrates that HIV is at epidemic proportions in Russia and that those with substance abuse problems, specifically IDUs and perhaps binge drinkers, are at disproportionate risk for acquiring the virus and spreading it to others. The Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS recommends the use of sexual risk reduction interventions targeting substance abusing populations as an important means to inhibit the ongoing epidemic in this region (1). Development of such interventions will require more understanding of how substance use behaviors are linked to unprotected sex within a Russian treatment population than that provided by the current literature. This study seeks to build upon the growing body of work in the area of substance use and sexual risk in Russia by assessing the association between binge alcohol use and unprotected sex among Russian narcology hospital patients diagnosed with alcohol and/or drug dependence. METHODS Study Design & Subject Recruitment Data for this research came from the Russian PREVENT ( Partnership to Reduce the Epidemic Via Engagement in Narcology Treatment) study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV behavioral intervention in narcology hospital in-patients in Russia. The PREVENT study included alcohol and/or drug-dependent men and women recruited from 2 narcology hospitals in the vicinity of St. Petersburg Russia: a) the Leningrad Regional Center for Addictions (LRCA) and b) the Medical Narcology Rehabilitation Center (MNRC). Narcology et al. Abus manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptare a standard setting for drug and alcohol dependent persons in Russia and Eastern Europe to receive treatment. Typically, the hospitalization is 3 to 4 weeks in length and involves patients undergoing detoxification and then receiving addiction treatment. Participants for this study were recruited from October 2004 to April 2005. Trained physician research associates approached all patients after initial detoxification and assessed them for study eligibility. Eligible participants were 18 years or older, reported unprotected vaginal or anal sex in the past 6 months, and had a primary diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependence. Additional study entry criteria were the following: abstinence from alcohol and other abusive substances for 48 hours; willingness to undergo HIV testing as per standard narcology hospital protocol if not known to be HIV-infected; willingness and able to provide contact information for themselves as well as a relative or close friend through whom they could be contacted; residing within 150 kilometers of St. Petersburg; and possessing a home telephone. Individuals who were not fluent in Russian or demonstrated severe cognitive impairment as assessed by the research associate's clinical judgment at recruitment were excluded from the study. All eligible subjects provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment. Procedure Immediately subsequent to recruitment and eligibility assessment, all participants provided written informed consent and received their baseline survey, which assessed demographics, HIV risk behaviors, substance use behaviors and other key health indicators. At baseline, while subjects were in the narcology hospitals, HIV risk behavior questions were administered by both a face to face research associate interview as well as through an Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interviewing (ACASI) system. ACASI removes the interviewer and, therefore, allows additional privacy, minimizes literacy issues, encourages truth telling, and provides an identical recording of each question; using this system has been shown to enhance the quality of self- report behavioral assessments, to maintain confidentiality, and to provide an acceptable method for collecting self-reports of HIV risk behavior ( 14). All interviews were conducted in Russian, and participants were compensated US$5 for the baseline assessment. The current analyses include data collected at the baseline assessment. Measures Demographics including age, gender, marital status, education and employment were assessed via single survey items. Main Independent Variable\u2014 Our main independent variable, daily binge alcohol use, was collected using a Timeline Followback (TLFB) approach (15,18). Participants noted the number of drinks they had in each of the past 30 days prior to hospitalization; daily binge alcohol use was defined as having 5 or more drinks per day for men, 4 or more for women. Additional data collected included substance use condition, based on the diagnosis received at the narcology hospital, and injection drug use and risky injection drug user (\"sharing needles or works\") in the past 6 months, assessed via single items from the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB) (19). Outcomes\u2014 Our primary outcome variable, unprotected sex, was based on a TLFB assessment in which participants were asked the number of times they had vaginal or anal sex and if a condom was used in each of the past 30 days prior to hospitalization. Unprotected sex was modeled as a dichotomous outcome where subjects were categorized as either having an unprotected sex episode (any anal or vaginal sex without a condom on a given day) or having no unprotected sex (using a condom during all anal or vaginal sex on a given day or having no anal or vaginal sex) for each of the past 30 days. For descriptive purposes, we also assessed number of times unprotected vaginal or anal sex occurred with all primary and all casualRaj et al. Page 3 Subst Abus . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpartners in the past 3 months via separate survey items. A primary sex partner was defined as \"the person you have sex with most often and regularly and/or the person with whom you feel most attached,\" and casual partners were defined as \"people you have sex with less frequently and with whom you do not consider yourself in a steady relationship.\" Covariates\u2014 HIV behavioral risk factors (i.e., multiple sex partners, sex trade involvement, and recent risky injection drug use) were covariates in analyses and assessed via survey items from the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB). A single item asked participants the number of sex partners in the past 6 months; multiple sex partners was defined as 4 or more partners due to the large proportion of the sample reporting this behavior. Two additional RAB items with dichotomous responses were used to assess buying sex with money or drugs (buying sex) and selling sex for money or drugs (selling sex) in the past 6 months. Two dichotomous RAB items also assessed recent injection drug use and recent risky injection drug use. The first item asked whether the participant engaged in injection drug use in the past 6 months; the second asked, for those reporting yes on item one, whether they had shared needles or works when injecting drugs in the past 6 months. STD/HIV diagnoses were included as covariates in analyses. Self-reported STD was assessed by asking whether participants had ever been diagnosed with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital warts, genital herpes, other STDs (defined to exclude HIV) or pelvic inflammatory disease (women only); no positive response yielded a \"no STD diagnosis\" dichotomous response. HIV serostatus was determined by HIV test results. Data Analyses Descriptive statistics were used to assess participants' characteristics for the sample (N=181). We also assessed bivariate associations between any binge drinking in the past 30 days with demographics and HIV risk factors using Chi-square and t-tests as appropriate. For the primary hypothesis, we assessed the association between binge drinking and unprotected sex across each of the past 30 days per participant. Thus each of the 181 subjects could contribute a maximum of 30 observations to the analyses, resulting in N=5430 observations for the repeated measures analyses. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models to examine the association between binge drinking and unprotected sex on the same day for each observation, adjusting for potential confounding factors: demographics (age, marital status, gender), HIV serostatus, and HIV risk factors (multiple partners, same sex partners, sex trade involvement, no primary partner, injection drug use and STD history). The GEE approach was used to adjust for the correlation due to analyzing repeated measures from the same subject (20).The empirical standard errors from the GEE approach were used for all analyses. The primary analyses utilized all available observations (N=5430). Secondary analyses were also conducted that excluded observations in which sex was not reported (N=1535). All analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and a significance level of 0.05. Note: Data presented in the results include and indicate whether they come from unique subjects (N=181) or if they include repeated observations from the same subject (N=5430). RESULTS Subject Characteristics Study participants (N=181) were age 18-55 years (mean age 33.2 years), predominantly male (75%) and unmarried (67%). Although almost all had graduated from high school (94%), only half were employed. Nearly everyone (99%) identified as heterosexual; however 9% reportedRaj et al. Subst Abus Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscripthaving been with at least 1 same sex partner in the past 6 months, with women being more likely to report a same sex partner than men. Substance Abuse Behaviors and Diagnosis, Unprotected Sex, and HIV Risk Factors Almost three-quarters of our sample (72%) reported alcohol use in the past 30 days; 64% reported binge drinking in this same period. The 181 study subjects contributed a total of 5430 observations from the TLFB. Among the 5400 observations, 37% reported alcohol use (n=2020); 83% of these involved binge drinking (n=1669/2020). Recent injection drug use was reported by 40% of the sample. These findings are consistent with subjects' clinical diagnoses, which indicate that 60% of this sample is alcohol-dependent, 32% heroin dependent, and 8% both alcohol and heroin dependent. (Table I) Three-fourths of participants reported having a primary sex partner, and 67% reported having a casual sex partner. Among those reporting recent involvement with a primary partner (n=136), 88% engaged in unprotected vaginal sex and 17% in unprotected anal sex with this type of partner. Among those reporting recent involvement with a casual partner (n=121), 76% engaged in unprotected vaginal sex and 8% in unprotected anal sex with this partner. (Table I) TLFB data demonstrated that, among the 5430 observations, 28% included at least one episode of either vaginal or anal sex (n=1535); 88% of these involved unprotected sex (n=1345/1535). Sex with 2 or more partners in the past 6 months was reported by 70% of the sample; 26% had been with 4 or more sex partners in the past 6 months. More than 1 in 4 participants (27%) reported sex trade involvement--19% had bought sex and 12% had sold sex. One third of participants (31%) had engaged in recent risky IDU; notably, this is the majority of those engaging in recent IDU (78%, 55/72). Consistent with these risks, high rates of HIV and STD were observed in this sample; almost half (43%) had a history of other STDs, and a substantial minority (15%) was HIV-infected. (Table I) Bivariate Associations with Binge Drinking Participants reporting binge alcohol use in the past 30 days were significantly more likely to be older, male, and employed, compared with non-binge drinkers, and they were also significantly less likely to be engaging in injection drug use, have a history of STDs, and be HIV-infected. (Table II) Associations Between Binge Drinking and Same Day Unprotected Sex Across Each of the Past 30 Days, Per Participant Repeated measures analyses of daily observations indicated no association between binge drinking and same day unprotected sex in either unadjusted (OR=1.0, 95% CI=0.8-1.3, 2 (1, N=5219)=0.01, ns) or adjusted analyses controlling for demographics and HIV risk factors (OR adj =1.0, 95% CI=0.7-1.4, 2 (1, N=5219)=0.01, ns).

(Table IV) Notably, the multivariable model of daily observation did indicate associations between other factors and unprotected sex. (Table III) The odds of an unprotected sex observation were significantly higher among those having a primary partner (OR adj=2.9, 95% CI=1.7-4.7, 2 (1, N=5219)=15.65, <0.001) and those having 4 or more sex partners in the past 6 months (OR adj=2.2, 95% CI=1.4-3.2, 2 (1, 5219)=9.89, <0.01); the odds of an unprotected sex observation were significantly lower among those who had purchased sex in the past 6 months (OR adj=0.5, 95% CI=0.4-0.8, 2 (1, 5219)=7.84, <0.01). (Table III) In the model restricted to observations where sex was reported, the effects of having a primary partner, having 4 or more sex partners, and purchasing sex were attenuated and no longer statistically significant.

DISCUSSION Despite reported associations between alcohol use and unsafe sex in the medical literature (21,23) in this Russian cohort of narcology hospital patients with unsafe sex in the past 6- months, binge drinking was not associated with an increased odds of same day unprotected sex. These findings are similar to other event specific studies of substance use and unprotected sex in US adolescents ( 24,26 ). The absence of an association in this study may reflect a reality that binge alcohol use does not impact unsafe sex in this population, however, another possibility must be considered: the impact of alcohol may be difficult to detect when 88% of daily observations in which sex occurs do not include condoms. Currently, condoms in Russia are primarily used for pregnancy prevention and not, as yet, for prevention of sexually transmitted infections (11). However, as condom use becomes more normative in the Russian population, an impact of binge alcohol use may become evident. These data suggest that binge alcohol use, in a setting in which condom use is the exception, rather than the rule, is not a major issue for the promotion of the use of condoms. Nonetheless, as the HIV epidemic in Russia gains greater recognition in general, condom use will increase and the uptake of condoms may occur differentially between those with risky alcohol use and without such alcohol use behavior. Of note is the fact that for this sample, alcohol use predominantly meant binge alcohol use, with 83% of alcohol use incidents involving binge drinking levels. In addition to binge drinking, no significant association was observed between the following variables and an observation of unprotected sex: HIV seropositive status, recent risky IDU, and history of STD diagnosis. However, we did observe higher odds of an unprotected sex observation among those reporting 4 or more sex partners and those who did not purchase sex in the past 6 months, as well as those with a primary partner. Notably, these significant associations with unprotected sex were lost when the model was limited to observations in which sex occurred, suggesting that these variables may be associated with having sex, rather than with an unprotected sex episode. Overall these findings demonstrate substantial HIV risk and pervasive unprotected sex among Russian narcology patients, with unprotected sex being no less likely among those with greater HIV risk. These risk-specific findings are substantially different from those seen in the United States. Substance using and clinical samples from the United States demonstrate greater condom use among those with multiple sex partners, recent risky injection drug use and sex trade involvement (27,29). However, unprotected sex being more common among those with primary partners is consistent with US research ( 27,29 ) as well as with that seen in the general Russian population ( 11). Lack of significant findings in the model only including observations in which sex occurred may again be indicative of condom use simply not being normative in any Russia populations and more typically being used as a means of pregnancy prevention (11). These findings clearly speak to the need for better condom promotion in Russia generally and particularly among those in drug and alcohol treatment. Risky sexual behaviors were remarkable for the cohort overall, especially compared with the general Russian population. Whereas 13% of sexually active Russians from a nationally representative sample reported 2 or more partners in the past year, 26% in this cohort reported 4 or more partners in the past year. Another dimension of risky sexual behavior is the high proportion involved in sex trade, an activity reported by 27% of this sample. While sex trade involvement has been discussed among Russian IDUs ( 5,7), it has not received as much focusRaj et al. Page 6 Subst Abus . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptamong binge drinkers in treatment; our study demonstrates that sex trade involvement is as likely for binge drinkers as IDUs. Future research to understand and address HIV risk among Russians in substance abuse treatment should consider multiple sex partners and sex trade involvement by alcohol dependent patients as well as IDUs in order to better address the epidemic in this clinical population. While the current findings contribute to our growing understanding of the HIV epidemic in Russia, there are several limitations of the study. The study was observational at a single point in time which limits our ability to establish causality; however, the associations found do inform us regarding levels of HIV risk in sexually active Russian narcology hospital patients. Assessments were limited as they did not provide information on relative timing of same day binge alcohol use and unprotected sex; information on which occurred first and whether they occurred within the same relative period of the day was not collected. Additionally, reliance on self-report for behavioral risk variables potentially results in social desirability and recall biases on these, although, recall biases are likely minimal as timeframes for behavior assessment were short (i.e., past 1 to 6 months prior to hospitalization). We attempted to mitigate social desirability bias by use of the ACASI technology to assess risk behavior; such a bias typically results in an underestimate rather than overestimate of risk behavior and STD prevalence (14 ). Use of a single city in Russia and 2 narcology treatment sites for recruitment may also limit generalizablity of findings to other narcology hospital settings. CONCLUSION and IMPLICATIONS Sexual risk among alcohol and drug dependent patients is an important public health issue meriting research and clinical attention. While the hypothesized association between binge drinking and same day unprotected sex was not observed, findings did demonstrate substantial HIV risk for binge drinkers in treatment, as well as non-binge drinkers, a group that was predominantly IDUs. The exceedingly low condom use among a population at substantial risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV is alarming. The finding that episodes of unprotected sex are more common among some of those at greater risk for HIV infection, specifically those with a greater number of sex partners is of concern. These findings demonstrate that narcology treatment settings are an important venue in which HIV intervention could occur, and such intervention should not only promote condom use but guide patients to understand how their sexual behaviors increase risk for both acquiring and transmitting HIV. Efforts to address the HIV epidemic in Russia should address sex risk behaviors in the alcohol abusing population as well as among IDUs.

Logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between past 30 day binge drinkingand the following outcome variables: unprotected sex, six or more sex partners in the past year, sextrade involvement, and past 6 month HIV/STI diagnosis. Analyses were adjusted to control demographics,incarceration history, illicit drug use, and injection drug use.Results: Signicant associations were observed between binge alcohol use and unprotected vaginal sex with non-main female partners (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.3), anal sex non-main femalepartners (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0), sex trade involvement (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3-3.5), and = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.05-3.6).Conclusion: Heterosexual African American men engaging in binge alcohol use may be at increased risk for HIV/STI; ndings support the need for integrating alcohol risk reduction into HIV prevention programstargeting this population. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction Recent data from the United States (US) Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention document that new HIV infections in the USare 40% greater than originally thought (56,300 new infections peryear), and African Americans, though only 13% of the US population,account for 45% of these new infections ( Hall et al., 2008; Corresponding and Prevention, 2008 ). Although African Ameri- can MSMs remain the population at greatest risk for HIV/AIDS ( Hall et al., 2008 ), 22% of HIV-infected African American males acquired the virus via heterosexual transmission ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008 ). Notably, 66% of US men who acquired HIV heterosexually are African American ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007 ). High rates of heterosexual HIV in this pop- ulation are likely linked to their disproportionate representation inUS STI cases ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006 ); STI-infected men (and women) are at heightened risk for acquiringHIV ( Freeman et al., 2006; Fleming and Wasserheit, 1999; Cohen, 0376-8716/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. doi: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.11.008102 A. Raj et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 101 (2009) 101-106 1998 ). Condom use has been identied as the most effective means of preventing HIV and some STIs among those who are sexuallyactive, and as such, is recommended broadly to reduce HIV/STI riskacross populations ( Sangani et al., 2004 ). However, condom use is actually greater among African American compared with Whitemales ( Eaton et al., 2006 ), and racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STI persist ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006, 2007, 2008 ). Other factors must be explored to understand what propels the HIV/STI epidemics in African American communities despitehigher rates of condom use. Both binge alcohol and illicit drug use have been identied as risk factors associated with HIV/STI diagnosis among with hetero-sexual African American males; notably, unprotected sex appearsnot to be associated with HIV/STI diagnosis in this population(Adimora et al., 2006a, 2006b; Raj et al., 2008 ). Such ndings may best be explained by other risky sexual practices linked withsubstance use. In terms of illicit drug use, a number of studies indi-cate that such use, particularly crack/cocaine use, increases AfricanAmerican males' involvement in concurrent and multiple sex part-nering as well as sex trade, risky sexual behaviors which are inturn associated with HIV/STI ( Adimora et al., et al.,2004a, 2004b; Whitehead, 1997 ). Those engaging in heavier illicit drug use appear additionally to be more likely to engage in unpro-tected sex ( Braithwaite and Stephens, 2005; Raj et al., 2007; Rasch et al., 2000 ). These risky sexual behaviors, and the illicit drug use related to them, are more common among African American men contend-ing with social marginalization (i.e., poverty, homelessness) and ahistory of incarceration ( Adimora et al., 2001, 2003, Whitehead,1997 ). these ndings indicate that unprotected sex in isola- tion is not propelling the HIV epidemic among heterosexual AfricanAmerican men. However, among those men engaging in illicit druguse, unprotected sex does occur, and it occurs in the context ofmultiple partnering and sex trade involvement and within a cli-mate of social risk. Hence, even if fewer unprotected sex episodesoccur, exposure opportunities are greater for these more sociallyvulnerable men contending with illicit drug use. The above ndings provide important insight into the impact of illicit drug use on HIV/STI risk heterosexual African Americanmen. However, such research on the role of binge alcohol use inthis population is more limited. Alcohol use may be heightening riskfor HIV/STI among heterosexual African American men by imped-ing their condom use at sexual incidents, however, it could also,like illicit drug use, be a marker or a risk factor for other riskysexual behaviors, such as multiple partnering and sex trade involve-ment Collins et al., and Sommers, 2005; Maisto et al., 2004 ). Research directly assessing associations between alcohol use and HIV/STI risks among exclusively or predominantly het-erosexual samples of African American males has been limited tosubstance using or prison populations and reveals mixed ndings.Alcohol was associated with multiple partnering and unprotectedsex among African American crack users ( Rasch et al., 2000 ), but not among detoxication patients ( Raj et al., 2007 ) or incarcer- ated males ( Braithwaite and Stephens, 2005 ). Research is needed to needed to explore these issues with a more generalizable sam-ples of heterosexually at risk African American males, e.g., those notexclusively substance using or currently incarcerated. The purposeof this study is to assess associations between binge alcohol useand risky sex practices, as well as HIV/STI diagnosis, among hetero-sexually at risk African American men (i.e., men reporting multiplefemale sex partners), recruited from primary and urgent clinicalcare.2. Methods 2.1. Study population Study participants were from the Black and African American Men's Health Study (BAAMH), a cross-sectional study of black/African American adult men at sexual riskfor HIV acquisition and/or transmission ( n= 703). Participants were recruited from primary care and urgent care clinics within community health centers and a largeteaching hospital; all recruitment sites were located in the Roxbury, Dorchester,and South End neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts; these neighborhoods havehigher proportions of HIV/AIDS prevalence compared to that seen in the city as awhole ( Boston Public Health Commission, 2007 ). The study involved a 30-45 min anonymous survey of participants on their sexual risk behaviors, demographics andrelated social and health concerns. 2.2. Recruitment and sample size Trained research staff approached African American men attending ve collab- orating health centers and clinics during designated recruitment days and timesfrom May 2005 to May 2006. Rotating days and times were used for recruitmentacross sites to reduce potential sample biases attached to work schedules. Eligi-ble participants were those aged 18-65 years and reporting sex with two or morepeople in the past year; this latter criterion was used to obtain a more sexually atrisk sample. Men scoring less than 21 on the Folstein Mini-Mental Exam ( Folstein et al., 1975 ) were excluded from the study due to demonstrated cognitive impair- ment. Among the 2331 men approached, 85% ( n= 1988) agreed to be screened for study eligibility. Of those screened ( n= 1988), 47% (930) were eligible; 81% ( n=7 5 4 ) of eligible men agreed to study participation. Those who were ineligible or thosewho were eligible but refused participation were provided with local, low-cost orfree social and health service referrals, including referral to HIV/STI counseling andtesting, substance abuse treatment, batterers' intervention programs, mental healthand trauma intervention, and job placement. Of the 754 surveys collected, 51 (7%) were removed from further data analysis, as data from these participants indicated that they did not meet study criteria. Fiftyparticipants did not respond to a question on number of sex partners; one participantindicated that he did not meet the age eligibility criterion. Current analyses wererestricted to men reporting sex exclusively with women in the past year ( n= 617); thus, an additional 86 men (12%) were excluded from analyses. 2.3. Study procedure Written informed consent was obtained from eligible participants who were willing to complete the behavioral survey. After providing informed consent, par-ticipants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that wasadministered to obtain data on demographics, sexual risk histories, and relatedhealth and behavioral risks. ACASIs took approximately 20-25 min to completeand were administered in a private setting with a research staff member nearbyto respond to participant questions, if needed. ACASI rather than interviewer-administered surveys were used due to evidence of more accurate responses tosensitive questions being obtained via ACASI ( Simoes et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2005; Abbey, 2005 ). Upon survey completion, all participants received $35 and low cost or free social and health service referrals. This study was approved by the Insti-tutional Review Boards of Boston University Medical Campus and the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. Additionally, a Federal Certicate of Condentialitywas obtained to provide further protections for study participants. 2.4. Measures Measures for this study were obtained via self-report on ACASI items and included sociodemographics, sexual relationship characteristics, alcohol and illicitdrug use, risky sexual behaviors and HIV/STI diagnosis. 2.4.1. Sociodemographics Age, main relationship involvement, US born, education, employment status, homelessness, incarceration were assessed via single item measures. Although agewas obtained as a continuous variable, this variable was dichotomized based ona median split due to skewed distribution. National origin was dichotomized toreflect population born in the US and US territories. Education was categorized toreflect whether the participant did not complete high school, received at least ahigh school education or equivalent (diploma or GED), or received at least somecollege. Employment was assessed by asking participants if they were unemployed,employed part-time or employed full time. Homelessness was assessed by askingwhere the participant was currently residing; those responding \"on the streets\" or\"homeless in a housing shelter\" were dened as homeless. Incarceration history wasassessed via a single item on whether the participant had ever been to prison or jaiand whether such an incident had occurred in the past year. 2.4.2. Alcohol use Any Alcohol Use and Binge Alcohol Use were calculated using the past 30-day alcohol use questions from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI; McClellan et al., 1992 ).A. Raj et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 101 (2009) 101-106 103 Participants reporting alcohol use in the past 30 days were classied as having engaged in Any Alcohol Use; all reporting alcohol use were asked the number of daysalcohol was used in the past 30 days. Additionally, binge alcohol use was assessedvia an item on whether they had ve or more drinks on an occasion, in the past 30days. 2.4.3. Alcohol use and alcohol intoxication prior to sex and prior to unprotected sex These items assessed, via yes/no questions created for this survey, whether the participant drank alcohol and whether they drank to intoxication within 2 h priorto vaginal or anal sex in the past 30 days; these items were each followed with anassessment of whether the participant used a condom the last time they engaged inthat behavior. 2.4.4. Illicit drug use Illicit drug use was calculated using the drug use frequency questions from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI; McClellan et al., 1992 ). Illicit drug use was assessed via a series of items on whether the individual used any of the following in the past 30days: marijuana, heroin, hallucinogens, cocaine, inhalants, ecstasy, non-prescribedbarbiturates, sedatives, opiates/analgesics and/or amphetamines. Those indicatinguse of any of these substances within this timeframe were dened as having engagedin illicit drug use. An additional item assessed whether injection drug use occurredin the past 6 months, to provide the variable Any IDU . 2.4.5. Unprotected Vaginal or Anal Sex with Main and Other (Non-Main) Female Partners Any unprotected vaginal sex with a main female partner was constructed by ask- ing the participant the number of times, in the past 90 days, they had penile-vaginalsex to ejaculation with a main female partner and subtracting that response fromtheir response to the number of times, in the past 90 days, they used a condom whenhaving this type of sex with that partner. This same procedure was also used to assessany unprotected vaginal sex with other (non-main) female partners in the past 90days. The same questions (although specic to anal sex with main and non-mainpartners) and procedures described above were also used to assess any unprotectedanal sex with a main female partner and any unprotected anal sex with other (non-main) female partners in the past 90 days. Due to highly skewed distributions, thesevariables were dichotomized as any versus no unprotected sex. 2.4.6. Number of sex partners and sex trade involvement Number of female sex partners was assessed by asking participants the number of women with whom they had sex in the past year; due to skewed distribution,this variable was dichotomized via a median split (less than six female partners inthe past year versus six or more female partners in the past year). Selling sex wasassessed by asking participants if they had sold sex for drugs or money in the past6 months, yes or no. Buying sex was assessed by asking participants whether or notthey had given drugs or money to have sex with someone in the past 6 months, yesor no. Due to a high correlation between these variables and very low prevalence ofselling sex, a summation score was created from these items and dichotomized toprovide the Sex Trade Involvement variable.

Recent HIV/STI diagnosis Recent HIV/STI diagnosis was assessed by asking participants a series of items on whether or not they had ever or in the past 6 months been diagnosed withsyphilis, gonorrhea, herpes or HPV (e.g., genital warts), or some other STI (unspec-ied) by a health provider. They were also asked if they had ever been told by ahealth care provider that they were HIV-positive and, if yes, when that occurred.STI responses were summated and dichotomized to yield STI diagnosis ever and inthe past 6 months. HIV diagnosis was also created to yield ever and past 6-monthdata. 2.5. Data analysis Descriptive data were obtained for all study measures, including frequencies on demographics, risky sexual behaviors and HIV/STI diagnoses, binge alcohol useand binge alcohol use-related unprotected sex. Simple logistic regression analy-ses were conducted to assess signicant associations between binge alcohol useand the dependent variables (unprotected vaginal sex, unprotected anal sex, sextrade involvement, and HIV/STI diagnosis). Multivariate models were then cre-ated to determine whether binge alcohol use was signicantly associated withthe dependent variables, after controlling for potential confounders, including age,homelessness, employment, current steady relationship involvement, incarcerationhistory, illicit drug use and IDU. Odds ratios and associated 95% condence inter-vals were used to assess effect sizes and signicance for variables in the crude andadjusted regression models. 3. Results 3.1. Sample characteristics The majority of participants were unemployed (61%), and 23% were homeless (see Table 1 ). The majority (73%) reported current involvement in a steady relationship with a main partner, 88% ofthese had been in this relationship for 6 months or more, 40% hadbeen in the relationship for 3 or more years. 3.2. Risky sexual behaviors and HIV/STI diagnosis history In this sample of men reporting two or more female sex part- ners in the past year, 45% ( n= 279) reported six or more female sex partners in the past year. ( Note : Subsample sizes will be provided in this section, as the data are not presented in a table.) Almost all participants (93%, n= 581) reported vaginal sex with a main female partner in the past 90 days; 53% of these ( n=3 2 4 ) reported never using condoms for any of these sexual episodes.More than one-third of participants (36%, n= 220) engaged in anal sex with a main partner in the past 90 days; 23% of these(n/n= 50/220) never used condoms in these contexts. The majority of the sample (79%, n= 486) reported vaginal sex with other female partners in the past 90 days; 21% of these never used condoms withthese partners. One-fth of men (22%, n= 140) reported anal sex with a non-main partner in the past 90 days; 24% reported never Table 2 Prevalence of Alcohol use and alcohol use-related sexual behaviors reported byAfrican American men who have sex with women ( n= 617) - Black and African American Men's Health Study, Boston, 2005-2006. %(n) Alcohol use, past 30 days Any alcohol use 57.7% (423)Mean number of days alcohol used Mean = 10.3 days (SD = 9.6)Binge alcohol use 33.9% (209) Alcohol use-related sexual behaviors Sex within 2 h after any alcohol use 33.7% (208)Unprotected sex within 2 h after any alcohol use49.0% (102/208) Sex Within 2 H After Drinking to Intoxication17.5% (108) Unprotected sex within 2 h after drinking to intoxication49.1% (53/108) As number of drinking days in the past 30 days is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 30 days, mean and standard deviation rather than % ( n) were used.104 A.

One in seven men (15%, n= 90) reported sex trade involvement, with 13% ( n= 81) having bought sex and 6% ( n= 34) having sold sex. Approximately one-third of the sample (31%, n= 190) had a history of STI diagnosis, with 8% ( n= 47) having received such a diagnosis in the past 6 months. HIV diagnosis was reported by 3% of the sample(n= 18), 1% ( n= 8) were diagnosed with HIV in the past 6 months. 3.3. Alcohol use and alcohol use-related sexual behaviors; illicit drug use Over half of participants (58%) reported past 30-day alcohol use, 34% reported binge alcohol use (5+ drinks in one sitting) in the past30 days (see Table 2 ). One-third of the sample (34%) reported alco- hol use prior to sex in the past 30 days, of these, 49% reportedunprotected sex in this context. Eighteen percent of the samplereported binge alcohol use prior to sex in the past 30 days, 49%of these reported unprotected sex in this context. Almost half the sample (44.7%) reported past 30-day illicit drug use. Approximately one-third of participants (31.8%) reportedmarijuana use, 16.0% reported crack/cocaine use; reported use of other opiates. Less than 2%reported past 30 days use of ecstasy, sedatives/benzos, barbiturates,amphetamines, hallucinogens, and inhalants, respectively. 3.4. Past 30 day binge alcohol use and relation to risky sexual behaviors and recent HIV/STI diagnosis Binge alcohol use was signicantly associated with unpro- tected vaginal sex with non-main female partners (AOR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.2-2.3) and unprotected anal sex with non-main female part-ners (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0); it was not signicantly associationwith unprotected vaginal or anal sex with main female partners(see Table 3 ). Binge alcohol users were also signicantly more likely to report sex trade involvement (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3-3.5).Exploratory analyses were conducted to assess whether theseeffects differed for buying compared with selling sex, signicantlycorrelated items collapsed to create the sex trade variable. Bingealcohol use was similarly associated with both variables (buying sexAOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-3.0; selling sex AOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.1-5.0).Finally, binge alcohol use was also signicantly associated withrecent HIV/STI diagnosis (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.05-3.6). 4. Discussion Findings from the current study with heterosexually at risk African American men recruited from urban primary and urgentclinic care demonstrate that one-third of these men have engagedin binge alcohol use within the past 30 days; this is a higherlevel of binge alcohol use than that seen in population-basednational data with African American men (34% vs. 19%) ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2007 ). Study results additionally document that such behaviors are occurring,not uncommonly, prior to sex. Almost one in ve participantsreported alcohol intoxication prior to sex in the past 30 days; halfof these reported no condom use at their last sex subsequent toalcohol intoxication. While data from the current study do not pro-vide a comparison of condom use at last sex without alcohol use oreven condom use at last sexual episode, these ndings nonethelessreveal that heavy alcohol use prior to sex is an important issue tounderstand for heterosexually at risk African American men. This isreinforced by study ndings demonstrating increased likelihood ofriskier sex and recent HIV/STI diagnosis among those men reportingbinge alcohol use. Binge drinkers were more likely than non-binge drinkers to engage in unprotected vaginal and anal sex with non-main femalepartners and to be involved in sex trade, both buying and sellingsex. Further, they were signicantly more likely to have received arecent HIV/STI diagnosis. However, binge alcohol use was not sig-nicantly associated with unprotected sex in main relationships.Overall, these ndings demonstrate that similar to illicit drug use,binge drinking in this population is linked to riskier sexual activi-ties and HIV/STI. These results are consistent with previous researchinvolving samples with a large proportion of African American maleparticipants, including crack/cocaine users ( Rasch et al., 2000 ), injection drug users ( Stein et al., 2000, 2001 ), STI clinic patients (Kalichman and Cain, 2004 ), and HIV-infected patients ( Kalichman et al., 2002; Stein et al., 2005 ). Notably, although many of these previous studies additionally documented an association betweenalcohol use and having a greater number of sex partners, such nd-ings did not hold true for this sample; this is likely a consequenceof the current samples' inclusion of only those reporting multiplesex partners in the past year. Further study is needed to deter-mine if a link between alcohol and multiple sex partnering existsin a broader sample of African American men who have sex withwomen. Overall, ndings from this study provide important insight into studies, including previously published work with this study sam-ple, which have found that unprotected sex is not signicantlyassociated with recent HIV/STI diagnosis among heterosexualAfrican American men ( Adimora et al., 2006a; Raj et al., 2008 ). As described in the introduction and related to illicit drug use, studyresults indicate that binge alcohol use is linked to unprotected sex inthe context of higher risk sexual situations, rather than unprotectedsex generally (inclusive of sex with steady partners), for heterosex-ually at risk African American men. This unprotected sex in higherrisk sexual situations (i.e., with casual sex partners, in a sex tradecontext) may help drive the disproportionate rates of HIV/STI in thispopulation. Further research is needed to conrm that unprotectedsex with sex trade partners is more likely in this population as cur-rent ndings only provide information on sex trade involvement,A. Raj et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 101 (2009) 101-106 105 regardless of unprotected sex, and unprotected sex with casual sex partners. 4.1. Limitations While current study offers important insight into HIV/STI risk among heterosexual African American men, these results mustbe considered in light of several study limitations. Findings havelimited generalizability due to our use of a northeastern UScommunity-based clinic sample of African American men reportingtwo or more sex partners in the past year and with very high ratesof incarceration, unemployment and homelessness. Additionally,our assessments of numbers of partners did not provide sufcientinformation with regard to concurrent sexual partnering. Further,although our collaborating health centers and clinics are typical ofthose throughout the region in terms of location within a lowerincome area and serving predominantly racial/ethnic minority andlower income client populations, these collaborators may havestronger links to substance abuse treatment programs, prison re-entry programs, and transitional housing programs as compared tomany other health centers. Hence, our sample may over-representmen misusing alcohol or illicit drugs, engaging in sex trade, havinga history of incarceration or experiencing homelessness. Addition-ally, as our study included men seeking varied types of assistanceand non-medical programs at our recruitment sites, ndings cannotbe generalized to those seeking traditional clinical care. In addition to limitations related to generalizability, there are a number of limitations related to study design. This research wascross-sectional; hence, causality cannot be assumed. Further, time-frames used to assess substance use behaviors, risky sex practices,and HIV/STI diagnoses were not always consistent, ranging from 30days to 1 year. Reliance on self-report also make these data subjectto social desirability and recall biases. However, these biases wouldlikely result in the under-reporting rather than over-reporting ofsensitive issues such as illicit drug use and sex trade involvement.We used ACASI methods to at least partially mitigate these biases.Biological markers of HIV/STI and behaviors such as illicit druguse would have been helpful for validation of self-reported data.In addition to these concerns, analyses involved multiple compar-isons increasing the risk for spurious ndings. Longitudinal studyof these issues among a larger and more representative sampleof African American men and with more direct rather than self-report measurements is needed to improve examinations of theseissues. Additionally, qualitative research to explore the mechanismsof observed associations is also needed to support development ofHIV/STI prevention and intervention programs for this population(see Essien et al., 2005 ). 4.2. Conclusion and implications In our primary and urgent care clinic sample of heterosexual African American men reporting multiple sex partners in the pastyear, those reporting recent binge alcohol use were signicantlymore likely than non-binge drinkers to report unprotected vaginaland anal sex with casual sex partners, sex trade involvement (buy-ing and selling), and recent HIV/STI diagnosis. Such ndings clarifyrecent research documenting a signicant association betweenbinge alcohol use and HIV/STI, but not unprotected sex and HIV/STI,among heterosexual African American men. Within this population,binge alcohol users appear to be more likely to engage in unpro-tected sex within higher exposure contexts (i.e., with casual or sextrade partners), and such behavior within such contexts, ratherthan unprotected sex generally, may be propelling the HIV/STIepidemic in this population. Longitudinal study is needed to deter-mine whether this is the case; qualitative research is needed tounderstand why this may be the case. Effective HIV/STI behavioralinterventions for heterosexually at risk African American men will likely need to be integrated with alcohol treatment or risk reductionto meet the needs of this vulnerable population.

PhD6; Hurd, Battaglia, MD, MPH9; and Jeanne Mandelblatt, MD, MPH10, for the Patient Navigation Research Program Group Patient navigators\u2014individuals who assist patients through the healthcare system to improve access to and understanding of their health and healthcare\u2014are increasingly used for underserved individuals at risk for or with cancer. Navigation programs can improve access, but it is unclear whether they improve theefficiency and efficacy of cancer diagnostic and therapeutic services at a reasonable cost, such that they would be considered cost-effective. In the current study, the authors outline a conceptual model for evalu- ating the cost-effectiveness of cancer navigation programs. They describe how this model is being appliedto the Patient Navigation Research Program, a multicenter study supported by the National Cancer Insti- tute's Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. The Patient Navigation Research Program is testing navi- gation interventions that aim to reduce time to delivery of quality cancer care (noncancer resolution orcancer diagnosis and treatment) after identification of a screening abnormality. Examples of challenges to evaluating cost-effectiveness of navigation programs include the heterogeneity of navigation programs, the sometimes distant relation between navigation programs and outcome of interest (eg, improvingaccess to prompt diagnostic resolution and life-years gained), and accounting for factors in underserved populations that may influence both access to services and outcomes. In this article, the authors discuss several strategies for addressing these barriers.

Populations with limited access to or knowledge of the healthcare system often have difficulty using the sys-tem effectively for cancer services, and this may result indelays in cancer diagnosis, 1,2added costs,3and less effi- cient and effective use of recommended therapies. Patient navigation programs provide support and guidance to persons with the goal of improving access to the cancercare system and overcoming barriers to timely, qualitycare. 4-14In this article, we present a conceptual model for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of cancer patient naviga-tion programs, discuss methodologic challenges, and sug-gest approaches for addressing these challenges. Rationale for and History of Patient Navigation Programs The origins of patient navigator programs are widely attrib- uted to Harold Freeman, who, as president of the Ameri-can Cancer Society (ACS), commissioned a study ofbarriers to cancer care among the poor in the United States.The report documented substantial disparities in both can-cer care and outcomes between poor and nonpoor Ameri-cans, identifying, among other issues, significant barriers tocare and a sense of fatalism regarding cancer that preventedmany from seeking care in the first place. 15As a result of this report, the ACS supported the first Patient Navigationprogram in 1990 at the Harlem Hospital Center. A pre-post comparison of women diagnosed with breast cancer atthis facility demonstrated that 41% of breast cancer patientsdiagnosed between 1995 and 2000 were diagnosed withearly disease, compared with 6% of patients diagnosedbetween 1964 and 1986. 16,17Five-year survival rates increased from 39% to 70% over the same period. Because of the success of this pioneer program, and in recognition that significant barriers to effective cancer screening, diagnosis, and care continue to exist amongminority and underserved populations, patient navigationprograms are becoming more common, particularlyamong health systems that serve these populations. TheCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services is fundingdemonstration projects to reduce barriers to care at all lev- els. 18Despite their growing popularity and the publica- tion of promising observational studies,19-22to our knowledge very few prospective, controlled trials haveevaluated the efficacy of navigator programs. Controlled trials, most of which are small, have shown significant improvements in time to diagnosis, reductions in anxiety,and greater levels of satisfaction with the care process. 23-25 The impact of navigation programs on cancer-relatedmorbidity and survival, and the cost-effectiveness of theseprograms, are not yet known. The Patient Navigation Research Program The National Cancer Institute and the ACS are sponsor- ing a 9-site Patient Navigation Research Program (Table1). 10The primary aim of the Patient Navigation Research Program is to evaluate navigation programs' impact onthe time from an abnormal finding (from a screening testor clinical examination for case finding) to definitive diag-nosis and treatment initiation. Secondary aims includeevaluating the impact of navigation on patient satisfactionand the cost-effectiveness of navigation. Patient Navigation Research Program sites serve diverse patient populations. Navigation programs focuson follow-up of abnormal breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening tests, among minority popula- tions including African Americans, American Indians,Asians, Hispanics, and the rural underserved. Navigationmodels vary across sites, using different professionals andhealthcare systems (Table 1) to follow patients throughthe completion of initial treatment. Rationale for Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of PatientNavigation Programs Patient navigator programs can be time and resource inten- sive. Similar to other interventi ons that may improve the health of poor and underserved populations, navigationprograms must be viewed in the context of allocatingCost-Effectiveness of Patient Navigation/Ramsey et al Cancer December 1, 2009 5395resources such that health o utcomes are maximized under limited budgets. It is particularly important to evaluate thecost-effectiveness of publicly funded navigator programs,because funding for these programs typically come fromglobal health budgets that are fixed in the short run withmany competing needs. Cost-effe ctiveness analysis can assist decision makers by demonstrating the health benefit for ex-penditure of navigator programs relative to other interven-tions, particularly those that are targeted to the same diseaseor condition of interest. The desirability of navigator pro-grams can also be assessed in terms of commonly acceptedthresholds (eg, $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year[QALY] gained) in the health system or country. 26 Conceptual Model for Cost-EffectivenessAnalysis of Patient Navigation Interventions For the Patient Navigation Research Program, we are using cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the added(incremental) costs of navigation interventions versus those of the status quo for the given target populations. 27 Cost-effectiveness analysis is a comparison of alternatives,typically a new intervention such as navigation versus usualcare, which is patients and their family members seekingcare without formal assistance. Costs and consequencesflowing from each alternative (navigated vs usual care) aresummarized over the time period that is relevant to theepisode of care (Fig. 1). The incremental cost-effectivenessof navigation is derived using the following formula: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Navigation \u00bc\u00f0C Nav/C0CUC\u00de=\u00f0ENav/C0EUC\u00de (1) in which CNavandCUCrefer to the incremental difference in total costs of the navigation program compared withusual care, and E NavandEUCrefer to the difference in total effectiveness between navigation and usual care (Fig.Table 1.

Although the comparator is typically usual care; that is, care as it occurs in usual practice in the absence of navi-gators, one could also compare /C212 navigation programs versus usual care, or 1 program with another. Both thenavigator program and usual care have costs that flowfrom the point of entry (eg, abnormal finding on mam- mogram) to short-term and long-term downstream costs and consequences. Generally the time horizon is the indi-viduals' remaining years of life. Because the Patient Navi-gation Research Program will only observe individualsover a maximum of the 5 years of the program, examiningimpact on survival and costs per QALYs saved will requireestimation using mathematical models. Navigation Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Approaches for Addressing Challenges Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of patient navigation programs poses several unique challenges (Table 2). Inthis section, we describe particular challenges for evaluat-ing the cost-effectiveness of the Patient NavigationResearch Program and how we plan to address thoseissues. Defining the navigation intervention The first issue in conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis of navigation is that the navigator interventionitself is not uniform for all patients, because part of theprinciple of navigation is to identify patient-specific issuesand tailor the program to those needs. Moreover, naviga- tion interventions (including the Patient Navigation Research Program) are quite heterogeneous, and are typi-cally tailored to the needs and available resources of a par-ticular region and the cancers of interest. Even within asingle program site, the navigator will tailor the interven-tion to the needs of the particular patient-client, withwide variation in services provided between individuals. A related issue is that programs differ in expectations, quali-fications, training, and supervision of navigators. In manysettings, navigators are trained to assist patients withabnormal screening tests for several cancers (eg, cervicaland colorectal, or breast and prostate). Although there areeconomies of scale in these situations, it is more difficult to segregate the time costs for each cancer and model each separately. One could capture the economies of scale bymodeling all screening, but this requires extension of thetime horizon in a model capturing the natural history ofmultiple cancers at once. At present, we are not aware of models that are designed to incorporate the natural history of multiplecancers simultaneously. However, this is an importantresearch priority, because the majority of providers recom-mend screening for multiple cancers to their patients, andnavigators assist individuals in navigating through to diag-nostic resolution for >1 cancer type. Therefore, we address the issue of the heterogeneity of interventions by defining the navigation programsbroadly, as specified by the study protocols. 28This approach emphasizes the type of navigator (eg, nurse, lay-person) and the general scope of services that that individ-ual is able to provide. We will then have to model the cost-effectiveness of navigation for each individual cancer separately, allocating navigator time and other efforts inproportion for each cancer site. Measuring effectiveness of navigation programs The recommended measure of effectiveness of navi- gation programs for cost-effectiveness analyses is the FIGURE 1. A conceptual model of patient navigator interven- tion versus usual care is shown. *Examples may include per- sons eligible for cancer screening procedures or those with cancer who are eligible for treatment.Table 2. Unique Challenges to Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Navigation Programs Relation between navigation and endpoints (costs, survival, QALY) is nonlinear Content (and costs) of navigation interventions are variable due to site-specific program needs Confounding between need for navigation and stage, mortality endpoints Difficulty in allocating costs and effects over multiple cancers Short-term intervention outcomes (eg, distress) do not map easily to QALYs Difficulty collecting uniform data across sites and at relevant time points (eg, time costs) Difficulty detecting the impact of modest reductions in diagnostic or treatment delays on mortality Personal characteristics of navigators (difficult to measure) may influence program effectiveness QALY indicates quality-adjusted life-year.Cost-Effectiveness of Patient Navigation/Ramsey et al Cancer December 1, 2009 5397QALY,29which requires data on survival with and with- out the program and evaluation of health state preferences(utilities). However, outcome measures being directlytracked by the Patient Navigation Research Programresearch sites are intermediate outcomes: time to defini- tive diagnosis/resolution and time to initiation/comple- tion of recommended cancer therapy for those with acancer diagnosis. 28Moreover, the period of observation under the 5-year Patient Navigation Research Programwill be too short to observe any mortality endpoints. Estimating QALYs will require simulation model- ing. To address the need to extrapolate from the observa-tion period to estimate the impact of navigation over alifetime, we will use simulation models to extend the timeframe of observation and look at stage distribution ofpatients diagnosed under navigation and usual care, usinglocal cancer registries, hospitals, and patient charts. Age-specific, race-specific, and stage-specific survival fromcancer registries (local or national) can then be used toproject the life expectancy, or mortality experience of eachgroup of patients. Even using this approach, modeling the effects of mortality based on delays in diagnosis or treatment is challenging and requires modeling assumptions. For example, most models portray screening benefits in termsof decreases in tumor size (and number of lymph nodesinvolved) or stage shifts. In this situation, for navigationto demonstrate a benefit, the intervention would have tolead to an early stage diagnosis in a patient who wouldotherwise have been lost to follow-up and only presentedclinically at more advanced stages. Less dramatic within-stage shifts (eg, early in the course of local disease vs laterin local disease, but before transition to regional spread)are also likely to improve survival, but to our knowledgethere are only limited primary data on which to modelthese effects. It is also possible that small within-stageshifts do not affect cancer-specific mortality. We will usesensitivity analysis to evaluate how different assumptionsregarding stage shift or cure affect results. If navigation isnot cost-effective under the most favorable assumptionsconcerning small effects, then one could conclude that the investment does not yield a return on investments in QALYs. However, if programs would be considered cost-effective under assumptions that are clinically reasonable, then programs with small effects could be considered tohave the potential to be cost-effective.The relation between the intervention (navigation) and the endpoints (survival, QALYs) may not be straight-forward, because the intermediate outcome of naviga-tion\u2014adherence to timely diagnostic services (in whichthe majority does not have cancer) and to recommended therapy\u2014will not necessarily be uniform and linear in its relation to endpoints. We address this issue with simula-tion modeling and sensitivity analysis, the latter evaluat-ing how changes in the association between specific inputparameters (eg, expenditures on navigation services andadherence to screening recommendations over time)influence long-term outcomes. Even if navigation interventions do not improve sur- vival, they still may improve an individual's quality of life.In cost-effectiveness analyses, these effects are recorded ashealth state utilities to be used in computing QALYs.Utilities are measures of health state preference, measuredon a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (ideal health). QALYs are asummary measure of survival weighted by utilities overthe period after the intervention. 29Utility weights for navigator program participants and a comparator groupcan be measured using a generic multiattribute utilityinstrument such as the EQ-5D. 30Multiattribute utility instruments are questionnaires filled out by respondents assessing their quality of life across several domains. Theindividual responses are weighted using data derived fromlarge population surveys on the utility of the differentquality of life states. Scores are summed and converted toa 0 to 1 scale, with 0 representing the worst health imagi-nable (or death) and 1 representing perfect health. Thisapproach provides societal rather than individual patientratings of the potential quality of life improvements thatmight occur with navigation, so that results aregeneralizable. Because of budget constraints, not all Patient Navi- gation Research Program sites will administer multiattri-bute utility instrument surveys to their participants.Utility weights for the comparison (no navigator) groupwill be based on the literature and, when available, surveysof low-income populations with cancer but no navigationservices. 31We will compare patient populations where utilities are being collected and those where they are not. In cases in which health and socioeconomic status are sim-ilar, we use data from the populations in which utilitiesare collected as proxies for those where utilities were notcollected. We also explore the use of regression modelsReview Article 5398 Cancer December 1, 2009based on navigator study populations with utility data to impute utilities for those without utility data. It should be noted that problems that are highly prevalent in underserved populations that are being tar-geted by navigation (such as low literacy rates and fre- quently changing residences) pose challenges to measuring outcomes after navigation using existing utilitysurveys. For example, populations with very low literacyor special groups such as the homeless or persons withmental illnesses may have great difficulty completing writ-ten questionnaires. The Patient Navigation Research Pro-gram address this issue 28by allowing telephone and face- to-face interviews with patients and, if necessary, patientrepresentatives. Another issue that is embedded in the navigation program that poses a challenge to cost-effectiveness ana-lysts is that patients with significant barriers to access to health systems often have complex social and health issues, such as poor educational attainment or non-cancer-related comorbidity, that themselves may influence long-term outcomes, such as life expectancy and/or cancer-specific survival rates after treatment. 32,33Education, health status, and comorbidity are measured in the parent Patient Navigation Research Program study. In our pro- jections of effects from the trial horizon to a lifetime hori-zon, we construct multivariate models with covariates toaccount for these characteristics to allow us to vary pro-jected outcomes based on the characteristics of the cohortof interest; we can also use national data on the distribu-tion of these factors to conduct sensitivity analyses to esti-mate the impact of navigation in broader settings andpopulations. Navigator programs also aim to improve patient sat- isfaction and self-efficacy, and reduce the short-term dis-tress associated with evaluation of an abnormal screeningresult. However, self-efficacy and satisfaction with care aregenerally not incorporated in surveys that measure util-ities. In such situations, one could calculate a cost per unitdecrease in distress. 34However, to our knowledge, there are no established benchmarks for comparison to deter-mine whether particular reductions in stress are cost-effi- cient compared with other ways to accomplish the same goal. Navigation programs aimed at cancer patients may also have goals such as informed use of procedures basedon patient preference (eg, lumpectomy vs mastectomy) orcompletion rates of planned therapy. These measures of outcome, as well as distress and other outcomes (eg, stageat diagnosis, time to diagnostic resolution, and satisfac-tion), can be summarized using cost-consequence analy-sis. 35Cost-consequence analyses summarize program costs and effects in tabular fashion (Table 3). For example, one can evaluate the costs per patient of timely diagnosticresolution for the navigator program versus usual care.Cost-consequence analysis can be useful to decision mak-ers who use components of cost-effectiveness analysisrather than the cost per QALY ratio. 36 Interpersonal styles and commitments of navigators may influence the outcomes of particular programs.Although this factor is very difficult to measure andaccount for across sites, we will evaluate variations in sen-sitivity analysis, using proxy measures such as volume-out-come correlations (eg, volume of patients seen andadherence to follow-up abnormal mammograms) andsociodemographics of the navigators themselves (age, sex,education). Cost Impact of Navigation Programs Navigation program costs include allocated fixed (eg, office space, proportional allocation of supervisory per-sonnel, new equipment or contracts initiated for the pro-gram) and variable (eg, navigator time and transportationcosts, direct medical care) components (Table 3).We denote the sum of allocated fixed and variable costs asC navigator(program) . There are also costs associated with training navigators, including replacements or additionalnavigators as needed (C training[program] ). We denote the total direct medical care cost of diagnostic services andtreatments received for persons using navigation programsas C medical(program) . Patients who receive care without using navigator services have a cost, denotedC medical(usual care) . Patients and their caregivers incur nonmedical costs when seeking care, such as transportation costs, time costsrelated to testing and treatment, and time lost from work. We denote related nonmedical patient costs for those receiving and not receiving navigator services as C non- med(program) and C nonmed(usual care) .N o t et h a ti nt h es h o r t run, medical and related nonmedical costs are likely to behigher for the navigation program because of improve-ments in patient access to care and adherence to protocolsCost-Effectiveness of Patient Navigation/Ramsey et al Cancer December 1, 2009 5399for care. Longer-term costs for the navigation program may be lower if a program results in diagnostic resolution at ane a r l i e rs t a g eb a s e do na na b n o r m a ls c r e e n i n gt e s t ,b e c a u s epatients lost to follow-up are likely to present again withmore advanced, more time-consuming (and costly) stagesof disease. Navigation may also lower costs if patients usecare more appropriately and efficiently or better adhere toplanned therapy such that cancer recurrence rates fall. Thus, in the long run, the net cost of navigation programs can be more or less than those under usual care. One of the potential cost offsets of a navigator pro- gram is decreasing the time required by the medical staffand office support staff in trying to support patients whoneed help through the complex medical system. Becauseof the heterogeneity of care settings involved, it is not pos- sible to track these offsets directly. We will explore theimpact of offsets, based on time navigators spend withpatients, in sensitivity analyses. Direct medical care related to navigation (eg, screen- ing tests and care related to follow-up of abnormal tests) will be assessed based on the routine core data elementscollected by the Patient Navigation Research Programand valued using representative reimbursement rates, suchas regionally adjusted Medicare payments. Longer-termcosts, such as lifetime costs related to cancer treatment,will be estimated based on the stage at diagnosis, usingpublished sources. 37Navigators' time costs are likely to be the most significant program cost. Time costs will varysubstantially depending on training (eg, professionals vslaypersons), the complexity of the care system, and theneeds of the target population. Time spent by volunteernavigators is not free and should be valued as the opportu-nity cost of those persons, given other options for spend-ing their time. Time costs for professionals can be valuedbased on their wages. Valuing time costs for volunteerscan be more difficult. For persons who are employed,time is typically valued based on their wages or the prevail- ing national wage rates for those of the individual''s age and sex. For those who do not work for pay (eg, home-makers or retired persons), there is no generally agreed onmethod, but most base costs on national wage surveys. 27 By using navigator logs, the Patient Navigation ResearchProgram will collect self-reported information on thetime spent by navigators in direct contact with patientsand in activities required for coordination of care. In the process of seeking care, patients incur costs that may be significant barriers to accessing care in thefirst place. 38Patient costs can be evaluated using patient logs or, if this is infeasible, by estimating time and associ-ated expenses when traveling to specific services. Althoughthe Patient Navigation Research Program will not collectpatient log data, navigator logs will include informationon the provision of these patient services, including trans-portation and child care costs. Patient time costs will bevalued using census region-specific wage rates for individ- uals that match the age and sex of the patient population. It is important to separate research-related costs from intervention costs. For the Patient NavigationResearch Program evaluations, research costs will be iden-tified from audits of research budgets during site visitsTable 3. Cost Consequence Analysis Sample Table, With Specific Elements of Interest in Navigator Interventions Costs Training costs (C training[program] ) Initial training Training replacements and additional navigators Navigation program (C navigator[program] ) Fixed costs: navigator program Costs associated with developing navigator-related materials (eg, pamphlets, telephone scripts) Allocated fixed operation costs (office space leasing, telephone, furniture, etc) Variable costs: navigator program Time spent in navigation (travel, meeting with patients, documentation) Travel-associated costs Variable direct nonmedical costs: all patients (Cnonmed[program] and C nonmed[usual care] ) Patient time costs seeking treatment Travel-associated costs Variable direct medical costs: patients (Cmedical[program] and C medical[usual care] ) Outcomes Time from abnormal screening test or suspicious finding to diagnosis Time from diagnosis to initial therapy Time from initial therapy to resolution (end of initial therapy including therapeutic combinations such as surgery plus chemotherapy) Percentage of patients receiving initial therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) Percentage completing therapy Satisfaction with care Quality of life during care Quality of life after careSurvival (years of life)* Quality-adjusted Cancer 1, 2009with investigators (eg, navigator time filling out study- related paperwork and complying with institutionalreview board documentation). In practice, it can be diffi-cult to separate research from intervention costs, thusnecessitating the documentation and reporting of assump- tions made when there is uncertainty. In cases in which navigation influences the use of multiple cancer screening programs, we will disaggregatecosts to particular services (eg, mammography) based onthe patient and navigator diaries. If feasible, we will alsoestimate the cost-effectiveness of a bundle of services (eg,mammography \u00fePapanicolaou smear \u00fecolorectal can- cer screening) compared with usual care. Perspective and Time Horizon In cost-effectiveness analysis, perspective refers to the point of view taken for evaluating the impacts and costs ofthe study. The societal perspective is favored for cost-effectiveness analysis in which public health issues areunder evaluation, 27and is particularly important for navi- gation programs, because the resources for navigators maycome from 1 source (eg, foundations, government pro-grams, hospitals), whereas payment for medical care maycome from another (eg, Medicaid). As discussed above,navigation programs have short-term and long-termimpacts. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of navigation pro-grams is best estimated over the entire period that the pro-gram is expected to influence costs and outcomes. Therelevant time horizon for navigation programs that assistpatients with evaluation of abnormal findings is the time from the initial point of detection of abnormal findings to their resolution. For navigation programs that change caresuch that longer-term endpoints are affected (eg, survival),this implies using a lifetime time horizon. Because thePatient Navigation Research Program will only observeparticipants over a 4-year to 5-year horizon, evaluatingcost-effectiveness will require simulation modeling to esti-mate the lifetime impact of navigation on populations. Uncertainty Analysis One-way sensitivity and multiway uncertainty analyses can identify factors that most substantially influence thecost-effectiveness of the programs. 39One-way sensitivity analysis is a process of varying individual parametersacross a range, then recalculating the cost-effectiveness ra- tio. This gives a sense of the relative influence of individ-ual factors (eg, the hourly wage of navigators) on theoverall cost-effectiveness of the program. Multiway analy-sis is a process of varying all parameters simultaneously such that a distribution or confidence interval can be derived around the point estimate of cost-effectiveness. Particular attention should be paid to the impact of various assumptions regarding costs, quality of life, andsurvival for the usual care (non-navigator) group. Thecomparison or usual care group in some Patient Naviga-tion Research Program studies uses historical data fromthe period before navigation or convenience samples fromcomparable communities that are not involved in thePatient Navigation Research Program; to the best of ourknowledge, few use randomized controlled trials (Table1). Navigator program-specific factors that should be con-sidered for sensitivity analyses include patient time, typeof navigator used, ranges of time to navigate different sub-groups of patients, and the basis for time costs (eg, local vsnational, average or race-specific wages). Conclusions It is rare for an economic evaluation to be free of concep- tual and/or practical challenges, and cost-effectivenessanalysis of cancer patient navigation is no exception. Inthis report, we outline several special conceptual chal-lenges to evaluating navigation interventions, as well asmany practical issues of data collection, instrument choice, and cost measurement. We have outlined severalissues related to assessing costs and effectiveness in naviga-tion programs, as well as methods Patient NavigationResearch Program investigators will take to identify them.Although it is possible to derive nationally representativeestimates of cost-effectiveness for particular programs,many navigation programs are tailored to specific local sit-uations, and thus also merit evaluation of economic valuein a local context. However, we do not know if navigationwill translate into improved cancer survival, and if it will improve the effectiveness of cancer care at a reasonable cost (ie, be cost-effective). 40-43Thus, the process of defin- ing processes, costs, and outcomes that is part and parcelof cost-effectiveness analysis can also provide valuableinformation for local decision makers allocating limitedhealth resources to navigation programs.Cost-Effectiveness of Patient Navigation/Ramsey et al Cancer December 1, 2009 5401Conflict of Interest Disclosures Funding was provided by the National Cancer Institute, via the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities, through Contract263-FQ-612391; by National Institutes of Cancer Society Grant SIRSG-05-253-01.

Rongey, MD, MSHS, Fasiha Kanwal, MD, MSHS, Tuyen Hoang, PhD, L. Gifford, MD, Steven M. Asch, MD, MPH Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 1.3% of the U.S. population. As up to 30% of HCV-antibody (anti-HCV)-positive patients have negativeHCV ribonucleic acid (RNA), indicating resolution of infection, VA (Veterans Affairs)guidelines recommend RNA testing on all anti-HCV-positive patients. As HCV RNA testingis a prequel to treatment, perceived eligibility for treatment may influence the decision toorder an RNA test. This study was designed to determine the patient and healthcare facilityfactors associated with patient receipt of HCV RNA testing. Methods: Two logistic regression analyses were conducted in anti-HCV-positive patients, includingthe entire sample and then on a subsample excluding sites with routine HCV RNA testingpolicies, using data stored in the VA Southern California Network data warehouse.Signicant patient- and site-level predictors of patient receipt Of the 13,257 antibody-positive received HCV RNA testing. Excludingsites with HCV RNA testing, patients aged /H1102265 years (RR/H11005 0.79) and illicit drug users (RR/H11005 0.94) were signicantly less likely to receive HCV RNA testing. Patients with abnormal transaminases (RR/H11005 1.14), presence of non-HCV hepatitis (RR/H11005 1.08), or decompensated liver disease (RR/H11005 1.22) were signicantly more likely to receive HCV RNA testing. Conclusions: Without policies for routine RNA testing, patients with hepatitic C who either are aged/H1102265 years or are illicit drug users are less likely to be tested. Also, patient receipt of RNA testing becomes dependent on clinical cues of hepatic decompensation orinflammation. The results support the implementation of routine RNA testing foranti-HCV-positive patients. (Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3):235-238) \u00a9 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is preva- lent and expensive, affecting more than 1.3% of the U.S. and 5.4% of the Veteran Affairs (VA) population.1,2In clinical practice, the rst step in HCV diagnosis is to test patients for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV). H owever, as up to 30% of anti-HCV-positive patients have negative HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA), indicating res-olution of HCV infection, VA guidelines recommend ribo-nucleic acid (RNA) testing in all anti-HCV-positive patients. 3 In addition to establishing viremia, HCV RNA status modi-es clinical follow-up measures, such as hepatic functionassessment and hepatocellular cancer screening, and healthcounseling, such as risk behavior reduction. Because HCVRNA testing is thought of as a prequel to treatment, per-ceived eligibility for treatment may influence the decision toorder an RNA test. Published studies within the VA population have examined the proportion and characteristics of HCV-infected veterans eligible for treatment. 4,5This is the rst study to examine the patient and center character-istics associated with the decision to initiate RNA test-ing. Administrative and clinical data were used fromanti-HCV-positive patients within VA facilities in South-ern California. Two had a policy to test routinely forHCV RNA after a positive antibody test. In sites withoutroutine testing policies, it was anticipated that patientswith illicit drug-use behaviors, psychiatric disorders,medical contraindications, or a normal hepatic proleFrom the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program (Rongey), Center for Outcomes Research and Education (Kanwal), Departmentof Internal Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine (Asch),University of California at Los Angeles; Veterans Affairs Greater LosAngeles Healthcare System (Rongey, Hoang, ofGastroenterology, University of Southern California (Rongey), California; John Cochran VA Medical Center (Kanwal),Division of Gastroenterology, Saint Louis University (Kanwal), SaintLouis, Missouri; Department of Internal Medicine, Boston University(Gifford), Boston, Massachusetts Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Catherine A.

Methods Data Source Data were collected from the VA Southern CaliforniaNetwork (VISN-22), which in-cludes clinical and adminis-trative medical record infor-mation from ve VISN-22centers (Los Angeles, Las Ve-gas, San Diego, Loma Linda,and Long Beach). The data-base includes patient demo-graphics, outpatient and in-patient services utilization,vital signs, pharmacy utiliza-tion, and laboratory data. Study Subjects Patients dened as positive for HCV were those with one ormore positive HCV-antibody tests between 10/02/2000 and3/30/2006. A patient's treating facility was dened as themost frequently visited site during the 5-year study period,with at least two visits/year to the treating facility. Outcome Variable Outcome was receipt of an HCV RNA test as either aqualitative or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Predictors of HCV RNA Testing Patient factors included sociodemographic characteristics (age,race/ethnicity, household income, marital status); healthcareutilization and comorbidities (psychiatric,cardiopulmonary, renal, endocrine, cancer, cytopenia). Table 1 includes a list of patient factors by category. Absolute and relative treatment contraindications are based on guidelines from the American Association for the Study ofLiver Diseases (AASLD) and the VA. 3,6Treatment contraindica - tions are dened as the presence of one inpatient or twooutpatient diagnostic codes for renal failure, cardiac disease,cancer, organ transplant, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmuneconditions, cytopenias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,or HIV. Demographic data from VISN do not include race/ethnic- ity; race/ethnicity was listed as \"missing\" for 40% in theprimary analysis. A sensitivity analysis in the multivariatemodels was performed. The impact of RNA routine testingpolicies was evaluated at each of the ve sites and adjusted forfacility.Statistical Analysis Two logistic regression analyses were conducted including the entire sample and a subsample excluding sites withroutine RNA testing. The unit of analysis was a patient with apositive HCV-antibody test. The dependent variable was HCVRNA testing, and the predictors were those mentioned above.Intrasite correlation was adjusted using the generalized esti-mating equation method. Risk estimation was expressed asrelative risk. Results Of the 13,257 anti-HCV-positive patients in the total sample, 10,038 (76%) received RNA testing. Table 1 provides the descriptive analysis. The total samplemean age was 58 years; 97% were testing sites, 5562 (64%) received RNA testing.The two routine testing sites had HCV RNA testing of92.5% and 99%, whereas sites without routine testingpolicies ranged between 47% and 76%. In adjustedanalysis, routine testing sites are 1.5 times more likely tocheck HCV RNA than sites without policies. Table 2 provides multivariate logistic regression analysis results. In the total sample, controlling for the presence ofroutine RNA testing, patients with decompensated cirrho-sis (RR/H11005 CI/H11005 1.05, 1.1) were signicantly more likely to receive RNA testing. Conversely, patients aged/H1102265 years (RR/H11005 0.89; 95% CI/H11005 0.8, 0.99) (RR/H11005 0.98; 95% CI/H11005 0.96, 0.99) wereTable 1.

The sub- sample excluding routine testing sites yielded the samesignicant variables but with stronger effect. Patients aged/H1102265 years (RR/H11005 0.79; 95% CI/H11005 0.94; 95% CI/H11005 0.91, 0.97) were signicantly less testing. Patientswith 95% CI/H11005 1.03, 1.20) were more likely to receive RNA testing. Discussion The results show signicant underutilization of RNAtesting. Providers use treatment eligibility as a prompt forobtaining HCV RNA tests, whereas routine testing policieseliminate biases in RNA testing. In sites without routinetesting, several groups of patients were less likely to receiveRNA testing. Infection with HIV at age /H1102250 years is associated with more rapid progression to cirrhosis, 7but such patients are less likely to receive RNA testing. Activedrug users, in whom reported HCV prevalence is 65%-95%, 8,9were less likely to receive RNA testing. Individualized assessment of treatment eligibility in active users is recom-mended by AASLD. 6There is increasing evidence that illicit drug users can comply with HCV treatment10,11; regardless, review of RNA test results provides an important counseling opportunity to remind patients that HCV is transmittedmore efciently than HIV. 12 Providers relied on clinical cues such as elevated transami- nases and hepatic decompensation to initiate RNA testing.Typically, HCV is an indolent disease with poor correlationbetween degree of transami-nase elevation and liver in-jury. 13,14The disease is more treatment-responsive priorto the development 15Treatment be- comes precarious after he-patic decompensation 16,17 and would merely serve as abridge to liver transplantation.Without clinical guidance, pa-tients may not seek care untilthey have noticed clinical signsof decompensation. 18 Regardless of a patient's appropriateness for ther-apy, RNA conrmation ofinfectivity presents an im-portant patient educationaland counseling opportunity. 19 Risk-reduction counseling is important in the predom-inantly male VA popula- tion, as there is some evidence that progression tocirrhosis is faster and that risk of hepatocellular carci-noma is higher in men. 20,21Smoking,22alcohol con- sumption,23,24hepatitis B,25and HIV26co-infection increase the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis. Thebenet of counseling to reduce the likelihood of pro-gression to cirrhosis outweighs the additional RNAtesting cost, as the cost of end-stage liver disease isestimated to be $10.7 billion by 2019. 7 The results support the implementation of routine RNA testing in anti-HCV-positive patients. Histori-cally, VA quality initiatives have beneted otherhealthcare centers. 27Although this study focused on a VA population, it is anticipated that most medicalcenters do not conduct routine RNA testing inanti-HCV-positive patients. Laboratory routine testing algorithms improve the efciency of laboratory evaluation in other condtions. 28 In the absence of such policies, many patients will missthe benets of knowing how their RNA status should affect their care, whether that care be pharmacologicmeasures, clinical surveillance, or behavior modica-tion counseling.

However, some areas of clinical practice remain relatively unaffected by qualitymeasurement. In some cases, this is because it would be diffi-cult to measure quality for uncommon conditions, when clini- cians or even whole medical centers may manage only a fewpatients per year. 1In other cases, quality measurement may not seem warranted for conditions that seem relatively benign and self-limited, although it could be argued that any conditionwith sufficient expenditures deserves a program of rigorousquality measurement. There are still conditions, however, that are both common and serious for which quality measurementhas not yet become a reality\u2014it should be a high priority toinstitute programs of quality measurement for these conditions. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin is an increasingly com- mon medical intervention in the United States: The number ofoutpatient prescriptions for warfarin increased from 21.1 mil-lion in 1998 to 30.6 million in 2004. 2The increasing use of warfarin is due to two factors. First, warfarin is highly effica- cious for such relatively atrial fibrilla-tion, 3-9venous thromboembolism,10-14and valvular heart disease.15Second, as indications for antico- agulation such as atrial fibrillation are increasing in preva-lence. 16 Despite its efficacy, warfarin is notoriously difficult to man- age: Its therapeutic window is narrow,17,18it has significant interactions with diet and other medications,19,20and it its action is affected by comorbid conditions and other inherentpatient characteristics. 19The difficulty of managing warfarin contributes to great potential for patient harm,21both from excessive anticoagulation22-24and insufficient anticoagulation (which can allow the occurrence of thromboembolic eventsdespite warfarin therapy). 18,23,24Therefore, it is a major patient safety goal to improve the quality of oral anticoagulation care.Many have hoped that novel anticoagulants, which would beeasier to use than warfarin, would themselves improve qualityand outcomes in oral anticoagulation care. 25-27This may even-Article-at-a-Glance Background: Oral anticoagulation with warfarin is an increasingly common medical intervention. Despite its effi-cacy, warfarin is difficult to manage, contributing to poten-tial for patient harm. Efforts to measure the quality of oralanticoagulation care have focused disproportionately on the identification of ideal candidates for warfarin therapy, withcomparatively little effort in measuring the quality of oralanticoagulation care once therapy has begun. To addressthis gap in the literature, a MEDLINE search was conduct-ed for all papers relevant to possible quality measures in oralanticoagulation care, including measures of structure,process, and outcomes of care. Limitations, Concerns, and Challenges of Quality Measurement in Oral Anticoagulation: Because they do not have intrinsic significance, measures of structure and process should be strongly related to outcomes that matterto merit our interest. Consensus guidelines may provideuseful guidance to practicing clinicians but may not repre- sent valid process measures. Outcome measures must bestudied with databases that provide sufficient statisticalpower to reliably demonstrate real differences betweenproviders or sites of care. Conclusion: Oral anticoagulation care, a common and seri- ous condition, is in need of a program of quality mea- surement. This article suggests a research agenda to beginsuch a program. Previous research has established the evi-dence for anticoagulant therapy across a broad spectrum of indications and has helped to achieve consensus on the opti-mal target intensity for various indications. The next taskwill be to use this body of evidence to develop valid meas-ures of the structure, process, and outcomes of oral antico-agulation care. Quality indicators provide a framework forquality improvement, two goals of which are to maximizethe effectiveness of therapy and to minimize harm.Adam J. Rose, M.D., M.Sc.; Dan R.

In addition, doubts about the safe-ty 28and cost-effectiveness29of such novel agents may slow their adoption into routine clinical practice. Therefore, it remainsworthwhile to improve the quality of oral anticoagulation careas it currently exists, that is, with warfarin. Previous efforts inmeasuring the quality of oral anticoagulation care have focused disproportionately on the identification of ideal candidates forwarfarin therapy, and comparatively little effort has gone intomeasuring the quality of oral anticoagulation care once therapyhas begun. To address this gap in the literature, we searched MEDLINE for the intersection of \"warfarin OR anticoagulants\" and \"qual-ity of care.\" We performed an exhaustive search for other papersusing the \"find related articles\" function of PubMed and thebibliographies of all articles retrieved. Through further search- es, we specifically located all papers relevant to possible qualitymeasures in oral anticoagulation care, including measures ofstructure, process, and outcomes of care. 30We completed our first search in March 2008 and repeated our search again in December 2008 prior to the final acceptance of this article. In this narrative review, we discuss candidate quality mea- sures for anticoagulation care and what is already known about them. We sequentially discuss quality measures in the threedomains of quality first proposed by Donabedian: structure,process, and outcomes. 30We then detail a research agenda to advance the understanding of how to measure the quality of care in oral anticoagulation. This narrative review can also serveas a general example of how to conceptualize a program of qual-ity measurement for any field that does not yet have one. Developing an Evidence Base in Oral Anticoagulation Care A fundamental step in quality of care research in anticoagula- tion was establishing that anticoagulation does in fact preventthromboembolism. During the last 50 years, the efficacy ofwarfarin in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolicdisease has been firmly established, especially for atrial fibrilla- tion, 9venous thromboembolism,12and valvular heart disease.15 The of these indications are still under inves- tigation in some cases. For example, research is ongoing todefine the optimal duration of therapy for venous thromboem-bolism 31-33and to define patients for whom the benefits of anti- coagulation for atrial fibrillation are likely to exceed therisks. 34-38Along with the establishment of the major indications for long-term anticoagulation, a parallel research agenda aimed todetermine the optimal degree of anticoagulation for each indi-cation. A necessary first step was the development of a stan-dardized test to measure the degree of anticoagulation. The prothrombin time was used to monitor anticoagulation as earlyas the 1950s 39but was plagued by a lack of standardization between laboratories.40This issue was resolved through the development and widespread adoption of the International Normalized Ratio (INR), which allows results from differentlaboratories to be comparable. 40 Having agreed on a way to measure anticoagulation, investigators were now able to achieveconsensus regarding optimal INR target ranges for various indi-cations. 9,12,15 Achieving consensus about indications for long-term antico- agulation, a method for measuring the degree of anticoagula-tion, and INR targets for different indications have been majorresearch accomplishments. The existence of such high-qualityevidence produces new obligations to use it to guide treatment decisions. Quality indicators can help us to quantify the degreeto which we are succeeding in this endeavor. What Is a Quality Indicator, and How Might It Be Used? Ideally, a quality indicator will either be an outcome that is rel- atively common or an aspect of structure or process that hasbeen linked to outcomes. 41Quality indicators can be used to profile and compare performance between different providersor sites of care. 42In addition to profiling process or outcome measures, it is useful to study sites that are performing best orworst on a measure (\"outliers\") to determine which factors maybe contributing to their performance. The results of such studycan be used to define and disseminate \"best practices\" that may improve care through widespread implementation. Finally,there has recently been great interest in tying reimbursementlevels to improvements in process and outcomes of care (\"payfor performance\") 43-47to provide an additional incentive for providers and sites of care to pursue quality improvement. In addition to profiling performance on a provider or site level, quality indicators can also be used to examine disparities in health care.48,49Disparities in the structure, process, and out- comes of care based on race, socioeconomic status, mental ill-ness, and other patient characteristics have been documented inalmost every conceivable area of medical practice. 49-51The reduction and elimination of such disparities is an importantgoal, and one that will not necessarily be fulfilled through gen-eral quality improvement alone. 49-52Valid systems of quality Copyright 2009 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations148March 2009 Volume 35 Number 3The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety measurement are necessary to monitor, and hopefully reduce and eliminate, such disparities over time.53 Many candidate measures in oral anticoagulation care have already been used extensively in research, but have not yet beenused as quality indicators. The review will now discuss possiblequality indicators for oral anticoagulation care. Each sectionwill begin with what is known about some candidate measures and will finish by proposing a research agenda to advanceknowledge in that area. STRUCTURAL MEASURES OF QUALITY Structural measures of quality identify health care delivery systems that represent best practices, ideally ones that have been linked to improvements in the process and outcomes of care.30,41 For anticoagulation care, structural quality measures that havebeen examined include different systems of management andthe presence or absence of computerized decision support. Oral anticoagulation can be managed in one of three set- offices self-testing and self-manage-ment (PST/PSM). If one of these settings were clearly superiorto the others, then the proportion of patients receiving care inthat setting could be used as a quality indicator. Althoughobservational studies have suggested that ACCs may improveINR control and decrease complications compared with usualcare, 54,55the few randomized trials that have been undertaken have not been able to show a clear difference between settings, possibly due to a lack of statistical power.56,57 Several studies have suggested that PST/PSM can produce improved INR controlcompared with routine care 58,59or ACC,60-62whereas another study found it to be at least as good as ACC.63In one study, there were fewer major complications of therapy in thePST/PSM group compared with ACC 60; in no study was the reverse effect seen. Although we may be moving toward a consensus that ACC and PST/PSM represent an improvement over usual care, weare in need of structural measures that might be used to com- pare ACCs with one another. For example, nursing ratios areknown to affect outcomes in many domains of care, 64but it is not yet known whether the ratio of staff in an ACC to the patient load has an impact on outcomes of care. Similarly, stud-ies of care for other conditions have shown that high-volumecenters produce superior outcomes. 65,66Do higher-volume ACCs similarly achieve better outcomes than lower-volumeACCs? Finally, there may be differences between ACCs instaffing, leadership, or organizational structure. It is not knownwhether such factors have measurable consequences in terms ofoutcomes or whether they have utility as structural quality indi- cators. Another body of literature has examined a different structure of care issue: anticoagulation management software. Studieshave consistently shown that managing warfarin doses via stan-dardized computer-based algorithms results in improved INRcontrol and stability compared with management withoutcomputer assistance. 67-71The research findings in this area are strong enough that the use of such software can already be con- sidered a quality indicator, even if no further work is done. PROCESS MEASURES OF QUALITY Process measures of quality assess whether optimal care is provided to the correct patient in a timely fashion.30,41 Ideally, improvements in process measures can be linked to improvedoutcomes of care. 30,41Many studies of process measures in oral anticoagulation have focused on atrial fibrillation, the mostcommon indication for long-term anticoagulation. T wo rela-tively recent studies, both of which represent great advances inthe general science of process measurement, nevertheless illus- trate the limitations of previous process measures in oral anti-coagulation. In the Community Quality Index (CQI) Study 72(Table 1, page 149), anticoagulation-related indicators assess the initia- tion of warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation and the timing ofsuch initiation. The only indicator that relates to the quality ofmanagement of warfarin, beyond the decision to use it at all, is Number 10, which states that the first INR test should occurwithin a week of the first dose. In the more recent AssessingCare of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE) Study 73-75(Table 2, page 149), some additional dimensions of process are measured. Compared with the earlier CQI Study, the ACOVE authorsadded a requirement to set a target INR range of 2-3 or todocument the reason for another range (Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation, Indicator 5). In addition to specifying the timingof the first INR test after initiation of therapy (now within fourdays), a maximum interval of six weeks between subsequentINR tests is now specified (Medication Use, Indicator 7).Finally, an indicator measures the receipt of comprehensiveeducation regarding warfarin therapy, or else referral to anACC, where such education would presumably occur(Medication Use, Indicator 6). In addition to CQI and ACOVE, a recently released set of performance measures deserves mention here: the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association performancemeasures for atrial fibrillation. 76The committee set forth three performance measures: assessing all patients for stroke risk fac- Copyright 2009 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations149March 2009 Volume 35 Number 3The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety tors, offering warfarin to all patients with any high-risk factor or more than one moderate-risk factor for stroke, and monitoringINR at least monthly. These performance measures generallyecho the approaches used in the CQI and ACOVE studies. The use of INR testing interval as a quality indicator (ACOVE Medication Use, Indicator 7, and ACC/AHAGuidelines) illustrates some of the limitations of previousefforts at process measurement in oral anticoagulation. Currentconsensus guidelines recommend that all patients have an INRtest at least every 28 days or every six weeks, 19,77-79but these rec- ommendations are based on expert opinion rather than evi-dence that a minimum testing interval improves outcomes ofAtrial Fibrillation, Indicator 3: Patients with atrial fibrillation of greater than 48 hours duration or of unknown duration who do not have contraindications to warfarin should receive warfarin if theyare under 65 with one or more other risk factors for stroke.

Because of the expense and inconvenience of laboratory checks, it is important to measure the INR sufficiently fre-quently to optimize therapy, but not more often than that,given that patients and their caregivers bear the burden of fre-quent clinic visits. Kent colleagues have derived a computerized algorithm to titrate follow-up intervals on the basis of INRvariability, 80with the premise that the risk associated with a testing interval of six weeks in a patient with stable control would be different than that of a patient with erratic control.They were able to demonstrate, in a randomized trial, that useof the algorithm increased follow-up intervals without compro- mising INR control, a desirable result. 81Although their system is not widely used, their findings do not necessarily suggest the need for an absolute maximum interval between INR tests butrather suggest that testing intervals can be tailored to the indi-vidual patient. Another potential process measure that was not included in prior efforts is the timeliness of follow-up for an aberrant INR value. In clinical practice, the exigency related to an out-of-range value is largely predicated on a particular patient's base-line risk of hemorrhage or thromboembolism and the Evidence regarding the optimal follow-upinterval for aberrant INR values is lacking, and the topic isunlikely to be subjected to a clinical trial due to ethical con-cerns. However, the importance of adequate follow up for espe- cially extreme INR values ( > 5.0, for example) could be empirically demonstrated through a link to intermediate ordefinitive outcomes, providing evidence in an area unlikely tosee a clinical trial. There is increasing interest in the use of genetic markers to predict a patient's steady state dose of warfarin before inceptionof therapy or early in the course of therapy. 82Such a strategy might allow the earlier achievement of a therapeutic INR while avoiding supratherapeutic INR values and their attendant riskof hemorrhage. 82T rials comparing this strategy to usual care at the inception of warfarin therapy are ongoing83; if this strategy is shown to improve care in a cost-effective manner, it could bean important process measure in the future. Another aspect of process deserving further study is the opti- mal way to adjust doses of warfarin. There have been important advances in this area; for example, a validated dose calculator isnow freely available on the Internet. 84In addition, our group has recently shown that reserving dose changes for patients whose INR is at least 0.3 outside the target range has the poten-tial to improve percent time in the therapeutic INR range(TTR) in clinical practice. 85Optimal warfarin dose manage- ment remains an important but understudied topic; furtherstudy may yield better evidence and useful quality indicators. Other process measures could be studied but have not been, possibly because of a lack of sufficiently detailed data. For example, there are guidelines for which patients should receivevitamin K in response to a very high INR 19; adherence to such guidelines could be studied, and the effect on outcomes quan- tified. INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES It is often impractical to follow large enough groups of patients for long enough to study definitive outcomes, whichmay occur rarely. As long as intermediate outcomes of care havebeen convincingly linked to definitive outcomes, they mayserve as a useful surrogate, allowing for more-feasible study designs. The most commonly used intermediate outcome inanticoagulation is TTR, which uses linear interpolation toassign an INR value to each day between INR measurements. 86 Several studies have provided strong evidence of a link between TTR and definitive outcomes.23,24,87-89 The most direct evidence for TTR as a predictor of adverse events comes from a study that divided patients into three groups by TTR: < 60%, 60%-75%, and > 75%. The group with the worst con-trol had more adverse outcomes than the other groups, includ- ing death, stroke or systemic embolus, major bleeding, andmyocardial infarction. 23Another study estimated that of thromboembolic events among war- farin patients are attributable to time spent above and below thetarget range, respectively. 24The importance of keeping patients within the target range was further illustrated by another study,which estimated that unless a TTR of at least 58% can beachieved, patients with atrial fibrillation would receive no morebenefit from warfarin than they would from aspirin, the sec- ond-line therapy. 87 Intermediate outcomes other than TTR have also been used to assess INR control. Fihn et al. have proposed an INR vari- ability measure and have demonstrated that it also predictsadverse events. 90,91This measure is calculated by finding the mean INR value for each patient and then the standard devia-tion around that mean; the standard deviation is a measure ofINR variability. 80Although it is known that both TTR and INR variability predict adverse events, their predictive abilityhas never been compared in the same study. It is even possiblethat both together will predict adverse events better than eitherone alone. An even simpler measure would be to calculate the propor- tion of INR values within the target range, without linear inter- polation between values. This is especially attractive because Copyright 2009 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations151March 2009 Volume 35 Number 3The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety sites of care could measure the quality of anticoagulation care without the need for more complicated statistical analysis.However, it would be important to document that the propor-tion of INR values in range has the same ability to predictdefinitive outcomes as TTR. 23Several studies have compared this simpler measure to interpolated TTR in terms of thenumerical results produced, 92,93but it would be more important to compare intermediate outcome measures with regard to agold standard of definitive outcomes. In addition, it is likely that TTR can be improved as a qual- ity indicator by identifying and remediating measurement arti- facts. For example, some ACCs may intentionally documentlow INR values prior to procedures, a practice that wouldreduce TTR but would not imply inferior quality of care.Deleting INR values proximal to an intentional interruption oftherapy may improve the performance of TTR as a quality indi-cator. 94In addition, previous studies using TTR to compare sites have been ambiguous about the method used to accom- modate differential contributions of patient-time. Some studieshave evaluated entire clinics as if they are one patient observedfor thousands of person-years 57,95; others have calculated TTR for each patient and then averaged them, without weighting fortime in the database, 56,60,96,97and others have calculated mean site TTR both ways63or have not specified the method used.88,97A formal comparison of these methods could establish a standard,which would be important for future attempts to compare sitesof care on TTR. Whether TTR or some other measure is used, intermediate outcomes seem to be ideal quality indicators for oral anticoag- ulation care. They measure what is arguably the single mostimportant function of an anticoagulation provider\u2014to keepthe patient within the target range as much as possible. In addi-tion, they have been linked to definitive outcomes, which haveobvious importance. 23,24,87-89However, if intermediate outcomes are to be used to profile sites of care, they must be risk adjust- ed, and no study has yet attempted to formulate a risk-adjust-ment scheme for TTR or any other intermediate outcome inoral anticoagulation. A clinically credible and statistically valid risk-adjustment mechanism would be an important step towardcomparing intermediate outcomes among sites of care. DEFINITIVE OUTCOMES : M AJOR BLEEDING AND THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS The two most commonly studied definitive outcomes of oral anticoagulation care are thromboembolism and hemor- rhage; disease-specific mortality is a third definitive outcome,but one that occurs too infrequently for practical study.Thromboembolic events potentially preventable through anti- coagulation include stroke, systemic embolus, and venousthromboembolism. In most studies, bleeding is divided intominor hemorrhage, which is generally conceptualized as bleed-ing that does not require medical management, and majorhemorrhage, which includes bleeding requiring transfusion orbleeding into a critical anatomic site. The definitions forthrombosis, and even more so for hemorrhage, 98have varied among studies, making comparisons difficult. This issue has diminished over time but has not disappeared entirely. The most important difficulty in studying these definitive outcomes is that they occur infrequently. This would severely limit their use as quality indicators, even for the largest sites ofcare. 1The traditional solution to such limitations is to link definitive outcomes to intermediate outcomes, and then to use the more convenient intermediate outcomes in subsequentstudies. As discussed above, previous research has sufficientlyestablished a link between at least one intermediate outcome (TTR) and definitive outcomes to enable the use of TTR as aquality indicator. 23,24,87-89Future research should aim to more precisely define the relationship between intermediate and definitive outcomes of anticoagulation care, including effectsizes. Figure 1 (page 152) summarizes our research agenda toadvance quality measurement in oral anticoagulation care. Limitations, Concerns, and Challenges of Quality Measurement in OralAnticoagulation It will be important to continuously gauge our level of confi- dence in our quality indicators and to have realistic expecta-tions of those that may be more imperfect than others. Forexample, because they do not have intrinsic significance, mea-sures of structure and process should be strongly related to out- comes that matter to merit our interest. 30,41Process measures, in particular, should be sophisticated enough to account for the complexity of real patients with multiple comorbidities. Overlysimplistic or poorly conceived process measures may do muchharm by oversimplifying what are often complex clinical deci- sions, especially in patients who have multiple comorbid con-ditions. 99,100For example, a simplistic process measure might require that any patient with atrial fibrillation receive warfarin, whereas a better process measure might make an exception fora patient with a history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. An evenbetter process measure might weigh the relative importance of a non-life-threatening hemorrhage in the distant past against amarkedly elevated stroke risk in this particular patient. Recentadvances have greatly increased the validity of quality measure- Copyright 2009 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations152March 2009 Volume 35 Number 3The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety ment in the area of process,72,75,101-104but there is still potential to improve the sophistication of process measurement. It is important to note that although consensus guidelines may provide useful guidance to practicing clinicians, they can- not automatically be assumed to represent valid process mea- sures.99,105Consensus guidelines may be heavily based on the results of randomized trials, which would have excluded most patients.106In addition, many consensus guidelines are written by experts in a single field, with relatively little attention to thewhole patient and his or her many comorbid conditions andcompeting priorities. 100,107Although elements of consensus guidelines may be excellent candidates to serve as quality indi-cators, the burden of proof is on investigators to demonstratethat they have utility as quality indicators before they are readyfor such use. Outcome measures, to be useful as quality indicators, must be studied with databases that provide sufficient statistical power to reliably demonstrate real differences betweenproviders or sites of care rather than merely showing differencesattributable to chance alone. 1As discussed, this would preclude the use of definitive outcomes as quality indicators for all but the largest sites of care; instead, attention should be focused onintermediate outcomes as possible quality indicators. To becredible, outcome measures must be adjusted for case mix to ensure that differences in performance are due to the quality ofcare rather than inherent patient characteristics. 42Ideally, such risk adjustment would control for not only patient demograph- ics and comorbidities but also for variables that may be harderto obtain, such as socioeconomic status. Finally, it is important to move beyond a relatively narrow focus on outcomes as comprising definitive clinical events and intermediate measures of INR control. Of the six dimensionsof health care performance identified by the Institute ofMedicine\u2014safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeli-ness, efficiency, and equity 108\u2014only safety and effectiveness are addressed by the above research agenda. Although some studies in oral anticoagulation have focused on patient satisfaction orthe cost of care, 29,56,62,97,109more work is needed in this area; greater consideration of these outcomes will help us to makeour care more responsive to patient needs and the needs of soci-ety. Despite some previous research describing disparities inoral anticoagulation, 110-114additional research will be needed to define and reduce such disparities over time. Conclusion Oral anticoagulation care, a common and serious condition, isin need of a program of quality measurement. Previous researchFigure 1.

Identify high and low outlier sites forfurther study, and use them to identify strategies to improveTTR at all sites of care. DEFINITIVE OUTCOMES OF CARE 11. More precisely define the relationship between TTR and definitive outcomes of care (stroke, venous thromboembolism,major hemorrhage). Copyright 2009 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations153March 2009 Volume 35 Number 3The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety has established the evidence for anticoagulant therapy across a broad spectrum of indications and has helped to achieve con-sensus on the optimal target intensity for various indications.The next task will be to use this body of evidence to developvalid measures of the structure, process, and outcomes of oral anticoagulation care. Valid quality indicators will give us aframework for quality improvement, whose two goals will be tomaximize the effectiveness of therapy and to minimize harm.Similar methods could be used to develop a program of quali-ty measurement in other areas of clinical practice.

Berlowitz, MD, MPH; Meredith Manze, MPH; Orner, MPH; Nancy R. Kressin, PhD Background \u2014Greater treatment intensification (TI) improves hypertension control. However, we do not know the ideal way to measure TI for research and quality improvement efforts. We compared the ability of different TI measures to predict blood pressure (BP) control. Methods and Results \u2014We enrolled 819 hypertensive outpatients from an urban academic hospital. Each patient was assigned 3 scores to characterize TI. The any/none score divides patients into those who had any therapy increases during the study versus none. The norm-based method models the chance of a medication increase at each visit, thenscores each patient based on whether they received more or fewer medication increases than predicted. Thestandard-based method is similar to the norm-based method but expects a medication increase whenever the blood pressure is uncontrolled. We compared the ability of these scores to predict the final systolic blood pressure (SBP). Theany/none score showed a paradoxical result: any therapy increase was associated with SBP 4.6 mm Hg higher than noincrease ( P/H110210.001). The norm-based method score did not predict SBP in a linear fashion ( P/H110050.18); further investigation revealed a U-shaped relationship between the norm-based method score and SBP. However, thestandard-based method score was a strong linear predictor of SBP (2.1 mm Hg lower for each additional therapy increaseper 10 visits, P/H110210.001). Similarly, the standard-based method predicted dichotomized blood pressure control, as measured by SBP /H11021140 mm Hg (odds ratio, 1.30; P/H110210.001). Conclusions \u2014Our results suggest that standard-based method is the preferred measure of treatment intensity for hypertension care. (Circ Cardiovasc Qual /H18546quality of health care /H18546ambulatory care Improving cardiovascular outcomes will require valid ap- proaches to measuring quality of care. Measuring the quality of hypertension management is an especially impor-tant goal because improved blood pressure (BP) control hasgreat potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes. One possible measure of the quality of hypertension care is theintensity of clinical management when BP is uncontrolled. Asearly as 1979, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-upProgram demonstrated that as compared with usual care, analgorithmic stepped-care approach to treating hypertensionimproves BP control and reduces morbidity and mortality. 1 More recently, investigators have also shown that in obser- vational settings, patients who receive more intensive man-agement for hypertension have better BP control. 2,3Because of this demonstrated importance, there is increasing interestin measuring treatment intensification (TI) in the manage-ment of hypertension. A valid measure of TI could be used toprofile providers and could be an important element ofresearch and quality improvement efforts in hypertension care. However, there is no consensus regarding the best wayto measure TI, and at least 3 methods have been used inprevious studies. 2-4 The first method examines whether a patient has had any medication increases during a period of time (versus none).4,5 This approach has 2 flaws. First, it cannot distinguish gradations of TI, only any intensification versus none. Sec-ond, it fails to account for confounding by indication, thephenomenon wherein patients with the most severe diseasereceive more intensive medical therapy. 6As might be ex- pected, therefore, previous studies using this method havefound the paradoxical result that greater TI seems to worsenBP control. 4However, this method has remained in use through 2008,4,5so it is important to evaluate its validity. The other 2 approaches can measure gradations of TI and do not produce paradoxical results, suggesting that they arenot confounded by indication.

Several different systems of measuring treatment intensification have been used in the literature, butthese systems have not previously been compared regarding their ability to predict blood pressure over time (predictive criterion validity). WHAT THE STUDY ADDS We found that a standard-based method, which essen- tially \"expects\" a medication change whenever the blood pressure is elevated, performs better than other methods of measuring treatment intensification. Future research and quality improvement efforts should preferably use the standard-based method of measuring treatment intensification rather than the other methods we studied. Improved measures of treatment intensification and other quality-related constructs can increase the rel- evance of research efforts and magnify the effect on clinical care. on a norm-based method (NBM) for defining care as more or less intensive, whereas the other relies on a standard-basedmethod (SBM). The NBM, described by Berlowitz et al, 2first derives a model to predict the probability of a dose increaseat each visit according to various visit characteristics, thencompares observed versus predicted dose changes to charac-terize each patient's care as more or less intensive than expected. The SBM, described by Okonofua et al, 3simply compares the number of dose changes observed with the number of occasions on which the BP was 140/90 mm Hg orhigher. In this system, a dose change is essentially \"expected\"whenever the BP is uncontrolled. Some have noted that SBM has certain inherent advantages over NBM because it is easierto calculate and interpret. 7However, NBM incorporates a more nuanced view of clinical decision making because it allows for the possibility that factors other than the BP mayinfluence the decision to intensify therapy, as well as the possibility that gradations of BP may exert differential influence on this decision. If NBM were the most valid measure of TI, asmeasured by BP control, it might be preferred, despite difficul-ties of calculation and interpretation. However, different methods of measuring TI have not been directly compared regarding their ability to predict BP controlover time. Because TI is a measure of process of care, linkingit to BP control outcomes can demonstrate its validity andutility. 8,9We therefore used data from a study of hypertensive patients at an academic urban safety net medical center to address 2 questions: (1) To what extent do these differentmeasures of TI identify the same patients as having receivedmore or less intensive management, and (2) Which, if any, of these 3 measures of TI best predicts BP control over time?Whatever our results, we expected them to inform futureefforts to measure TI in the management of hypertension.Methods Enrollment This report is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial designed to test whether a clinician-directed curriculum about patient-centered counseling could improve doctor-patient communication, ad-herence to therapy, and BP control (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:NCT00201149). Patients were enrolled from 7 outpatient primary care clinics at Boston Medical Center, an inner-city safety net hospitalaffiliated with the Boston University School of Medicine. The study wasapproved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston UniversityMedical Center. We identified all patients of white or black race, age 21 and older, with outpatient diagnoses of hypertension on at least 3separate occasions between August 2004 and June 2006. Using this \"universe\" of 10 125 hypertensive patients from 7 clinics, the study staff tracked these patients' clinic visits over a19-month period, and, as they presented for care, approached 3526 ofthem to request participation in the study. All willing respondents were then asked a series of questions and administered a cognitive screen to determine eligibility. A total of 1082 patients wereexcluded. Reasons included seeing a medical student at their visit (n/H11005257), use of a daily medication dispenser (because it might invali- date collection of adherence data, n /H11005247), cognitive impairment ac- cording to our cognitive screen (n /H11005199), ethnicity other than white or black (n /H11005149), unable to speak English (n /H1100571), not prescribed antihy- pertensive medication (n /H1100561), participation in another hypertension study (n /H1100530), hearing impairment (n /H1100516), and other (n /H1100552), leaving 2444 eligible patients. Of those, 654 patients overtly refused to partic-ipate and 920 patients responded that they did not have time toparticipate that day. Total enrollment was therefore 870 patients. Dependent Variable: Final Systolic Blood Pressure The primary outcome was each patient's final systolic blood pressure (SBP) value, drawn from the clinical record of Boston MedicalCenter. We chose SBP rather than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as our primary outcome because many more patients have poorly controlled SBP. 10However, we also examined several secondary outcomes of hypertension care, including DBP and dichotomized measures of SBP, DBP, and overall BP control. Categorizing Medication Increases Automated data from Boston Medical Center's electronic medicalrecord were examined. Our database included all prescriptionswritten, as well as all clinical BP values recorded within the study period. The unit of analysis was a visit to the primary care clinic, as identified by a date on which a BP value was recorded. When therewere multiple BP values recorded on one date, we chose the one withthe lowest SBP; if two values were tied, we selected the one with thelower DBP. We recorded the patient's initial regimen of antihypertensive medications, ie, the regimen before study inception. One of theauthors (A.J.R.) manually reviewed all prescriptions for each patientto see when the BP regimen was increased. An increase in medica-tion was defined as either a new medication being added to theregimen or an increase in the dose of an existing medication. Theperiod between each 2 BP values was assigne da1i ft h e regimen was increased during that period, o ra0i fi tw a s not. Multiple increases during a single period were counted as a 1. Dose changes occurringafter the final visit were not recorded. A subset of 42 patients,representing 495 (5%) of all clinic visits, were randomly selected forblind reabstraction by another author (D.R.B.). Agreement betweenthe 2 ( /H9260/H110050.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98). Covariates We collected patient demographic data, including race (black or white), gender, and age. Using both ICD-9 codes and problem listsfrom the electronic medical record, we noted whether the patients had the following comorbid conditions, all of which could impact the BP, the use of antihypertensive medications, or the perceivedurgency of controlling hypertension: benign prostatic hypertrophy,386 Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes July 2009 by on July 15, 2009 circoutcomes.ahajournals.org Downloaded from cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia,obesity (body mass index /H1102230), peripheral vascular disease, and tobacco use. Independent Variable: Any/None Score The any/none score was \"1\" if the patient had at least 1 therapy increase during the study; otherwise, it was \"0.\" The any/none scoredoes not account for the number of visits or the degree of BPelevation. Independent Variable: Norm-Based Method Score To create the NBM score,2we began by deriving and validating a model to predict medication increases at each visit. The unit of analysis was each individual clinic visit; the outcome was whether or not the medications were increased at the visit. Our hypotheses regarding likely predictors were derived from our clinical judgmentas well as our experience with the strongest predictors in previoussimilar models. 2,11,12 We considered the following possible predic- tors: SBP at the current and the previous visit, DBP at the current and the previous visit, number of days since the previous visit, whetherthe medications were increased at the previous visit, and the entirelist of variables described above under \"Covariates.\" We initially screened variables using recursive partitioning (CART modeling), 13using the R statistical package, version 2.6 (R Foundation, 2007). This method assigns each clinic visit into 1 ofseveral categories according to several important predictors; eachcategory is characterized by a particular frequency of medicationincrease. The important variables and cutoff values are empirically determined by the modeling procedure. Having used CART to screen variables, we proceeded to derive and validate our predictive model using logistic regression. Thedataset was split 60/40, with the larger subset used for derivation andthe smaller for validation. We tried all candidate variables in ourmodels, focusing particularly on those identified as important byCART modeling. In selecting cutoff values for continuous variables,we were guided by the output from CART model results and resultsof bivariate analyses. There were 5 predictors in the final model: (1)current SBP, (2) current DBP, (3) days since last visit, (4) DBP atprevious visit, and (5) whether the medication was adjusted at thelast visit (see online-only Data Supplement A for model details). Thec-statistic was 0.74 in the derivation set and 0.72 in the validation set;the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated good model fit ( P/H110050.59 in the derivation set and 0.44 in the validation set). We then calculated the total number of expected medication changes for each patient in the dataset by summing probabilities overall of their visits. For example, if a patient had 3 visits, with predicted probabilities of a medication change of 0.20, 0.30, and 0.50, thenexactly one medication change would be expected over this 3-visitperiod. We assigned each patient an NBM score, using the followingformula: (observed medication changes /H11002NBM-predicted medication changes)/number of clinic visits NBM scores are between /H110021 and 1, with 0 as the midpoint of the score. A score of 0 indicates a precise match between observed and expected medication increases, with positive numbers indicatingmore medication increases than expected and negative numbersindicating fewer increases than expected. As an example, over a10-visit period, a patient might have a total of 5 predicted medicationincreases using NBM. If this patient actually had 3 visits withmedication increases, the NBM score would be /H110020.2, indicating 2 fewer medication increases than expected per 10 visits. If the patienthad 6 visits with therapy increases, the NBM score would be 0.1,indicating 1 more medication increase than expected per 10 visits. We also created an alternative NBM score for each patient, based solely on the results of our CART model (online-only Data Supple-ment B), as in the original article by Berlowitz et al. 2Results obtained using this score were not meaningfully different from our main NBM score and are not shown.Independent Variable: Standard-Based Method Score For the SBM analysis,3the expected number of medication increases was the number of occasions on which the recorded BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Using this number and the number of occasions on which the medication was intensified each patient was assigned a score between /H110021 and 1. To make comparisons with NBM more straightforward, we reversed the polarity of the SBMscore from what was originally described by Okonofua et al. 3 Therefore, we computed the SBM score using the following formula: (observed medication changes /H11002SBM-predicted medication changes)/number of clinic visits For example, a patient with 5 elevated BP values over 10 visits would have a predicted value of 5 therapy increases. If this patient actually had 3 visits with medication increases, the score would be 3/10 to 5/10 /H11005/H110020.2, or 2 fewer therapy increases than expected per 10 visits. If the patient had 6 visits with therapy increases, the scorewould be 6/10 to 5/10 /H110050.1, or 1 more therapy increase than expected per 10 visits. We recognize that for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, current guidelines set a lower BP target (ie, 130/80 mm Hg). 14We therefore created an alternative SBM score only for patients with a low BP target. For this alternative SBM score, a medication increase was expected on each occasion when the recorded BP is 130/80 mm Hg or higher as opposed to 140/ 90 mm Hg for the main TI score. We divided the sample into patientswith the higher and the lower BP thresholds and repeated ouranalyses for each group using the appropriate TI score. Results ofthis sensitivity analysis were similar to our main analysis and are notshown. Statistical Analyses Each patient was assigned 3 scores to measure TI in their hyperten- sion care: any/none, NBM, and SBM. We examined the degree towhich these 3 measures of TI were intercorrelated. For comparisons involving the any/none score, we used ttests to compare means of the other 2 scores when the any/none score was \"any\" versus \"none.\" We compared the NBM and SBM scores using Spearman correlation(because of the non-Gaussian distribution of the SBM score) as wellas dividing them into quartiles and constructing a 4 /H110034 table. We then examined the predictive validity of these 3 scores for the main dependent variable, the final SBP (continuous), as well as several secondary measures of BP control, including final DBP(continuous) and whether the final SBP was /H11021140 mm Hg (categor- ical). For the any/none score, we compared the \"any\" group with the\"none\" group using ttests or /H92732, as appropriate. For the NBM and SBM scores, we used linear or logistic regression to model the relationship between the score and the BP outcomes, as appropriate. We repeated these analyses, controlling for patient-level covariates.We also divided the NBM and SBM scores into quartiles andperformed ANOVA tests regarding the ability of the quartiles topredict the final SBP. For all analyses except the CART modeling,we used SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute). The authors had fullaccess to the data and take responsibility for their integrity. All authors have read and agree to the manuscript as written. Results Patient Characteristics Of 870 patients enrolled in the study, 51 were excluded from this analysis because they had 2 or fewer BP values. There-fore, 819 patients with hypertension, managed at BostonMedical Center, constituted our study population (Table 1).The mean follow-up time was 24 months; on average, patients visited the clinic once every 2 months. The mean agewas 59.6 years, 34% of patients were male, and most (58%)were of black race. Considering their relatively young age, theRose et al Comparing Measures of Treatment Intensification 387 by on July 15, 2009 circoutcomes.ahajournals.org Downloaded from population had a high burden of comorbidity: 54% had hyper- lipidemia, 33% disease,and obese. Most patients (74%) were receiving 2 ormore antihypertensive medications at study inception. Thepopulation was characterized by relatively well controlled hy-pertension at baseline: the mean BP was 134/80 mm Hg, and55% of patients were below 140/90 mm Hg. Medication Increases and Measures of Treatment Intensity After excluding the initial and final clinic visits for each patient (which were not analyzed regarding therapy in-creases), therapy was increased at 835 of the 9828 clinic visits (8.5%); 406 patients (50%) had at least 1 therapy increaseduring the study. Among patients with at least 1 therapyincrease, the mean number of increases was 2.1, and themedian was 2.0. We calculated NBM and SBM scores foreach patient in the database. NBM scores were narrowlydistributed (median, /H110020.50, /H110020.05; 5th and 95th percentiles, /H110020.80, 0.05). Before examining the scores as predictors of BP control, we compared their classification of patients. The mean NBMscore was 0.09 when the any/none score was \"any,\" versus/H110020.07 it was \"none\" ( P/H110210.001). In contrast, the SBM score did not differ meaningfully between the 2 groups(/H110020.27 versus /H110020.30, P/H110050.15). The Spearman correlation between the NBM and SBM scores was 0.44, a fairly lowcorrelation for 2 scores that are intended to measure the sameconstruct. We also divided the NBM and SBM scores into quartiles and compared their classification of patients (Table 2). The /H9260statistic for agreement between these 2 scores was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.18). Extreme differences in quartile classification were not uncommon; for example, there were 209 patients (26%) whose quartile classifications differed by more than 1 category. Any Therapy Increases as a Predictor of Blood Pressure Control Any therapy increase (versus none) was examined as a predictor of the final BP. Patients with at least 1 therapyincrease had a mean final SBP of 135.2 mm Hg as compared with a mean final SBP of 130.6 mm Hg among patients who had no therapy increases ( P/H110210.001). As expected, because this measure does not control for confounding by indication,it produces a paradoxical result (therapy increases are asso- ciated with a higher final BP). Norm-Based Method Score as a Predictor of BP Control NBM score was a poor predictor of BP control (Table 3). In a linear regression, the NBM score was not a significantpredictor of the final SBP (model R 2/H110050.001, P/H110050.28). Adding patient-level covariates improved the model fit some- what. We investigated further by dividing the NBM score into quartiles (Table 4). A U-shaped relationship, rather than alinear relationship, was observed between NBM score quar-tiles and the final SBP. The NBM score also performedTable 1.

Standard-Based Method Score as a Predictor of Blood Pressure Control In contrast to the NBM score, the SBM score was an excellent predictor of the final BP (Table 5). In a linear regression, the /H9252coefficient was /H110022.1, indicating that for each 0.1 of the SBM score (1 more therapy increase per 10 visits), the final SBP was 2.1 mm Hg lower ( R2/H110050.12, P/H110210.001). Adding covariates to the model improved its fit by a margin similar tothat with the NBM model, but SBM persisted as a powerfulpredictor of the final SBP. In additional stratified analyses, SBM performed similarly in males and females, in white andblack patients, and among subgroups of patients with partic-ularly severe comorbid conditions such as chronic kidneydisease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. We investigated further by dividing the SBM score into quartiles (Table 4). A strong linear relationship was observedbetween SBM score quartiles and final SBP ( Pfor linear trend/H110210.001). The SBM score was predictor of the final DBP ( /H9252coefficient, /H110020.8;P/H110210.001) and of whether the final SBP would be below 140 mm Hg (OR, 1.30 per change of 0.1; c-statistic, 0.70, P/H110210.001). Discussion Optimizing approaches to measuring the quality of caredelivered to patients with chronic diseases is an importantresearch goal. This is particularly true for measuring treat- ment intensity in the care of hypertension because we have decades of evidence showing that more intensive treatmentimproves BP control. 1-3We therefore compared the predic- tive criterion validity of 3 approaches of measuring TI in hypertension care. We found that the any/none measure produces paradoxical results because it does not account for confounding by indication. To our surprise, we found that theTable 3.

Further inves- tigation demonstrated that the NBM score appeared to have aU-shaped relationship with BP outcomes, complicating its use as a predictor and calling into question its validity as a measure of TI, which is meant to be monotonic. In contrast, the SBM score was a powerful predictor of the final BP, a relationship that remained undiminished aftercontrolling for covariates. It is important to remember that the /H9252coefficient we found for the effect of SBM on final SBP, /H110022.1 mm Hg, was for each additional therapy increase per 10 visits, a relatively small difference in management. Larger differences in management would obviously improve BP control much more. For example, the difference in final SBPbetween the highest and lowest quartiles of TI (125 mm Hgversus 141 mm Hg) suggests an effect of considerable mag-nitude and clinical significance. We had expected to find that the any/none measure performs poorly as a measure of TI because previous studies have shown that a failure to account for confounding byindication produces paradoxical (or attenuated) results. 4-6 We had also expected to find that NBM is superior to SBM as a predictor of BP control because it incorporates a morenuanced representation of clinical decision making. The apparent lack of predictive criterion validity for NBM in our study contrasts with the findings of earlier studies, particu-larly the original article by Berlowitz et al. 2This difference may be attributable to improved BP control: mean initial BP was 134/80 mm Hg in our study versus 146/83 in the earlier study.2NBM may have worked better in an era of mediocre BP control, whereas SBM may be more suited to pursuing what are ultimately smaller improvements in BP. Our study has several limitations. First, TI is not univer- sally accepted as an ideal theory to understand poor control of asymptomatic chronic conditions, especially when it is pre-sented as \"clinical inertia,\" 15the obverse of TI. Some studies have suggested that on deeper inspection, what seems to be clinical inertia could also be attributed to \"competing de- mands,\"16,17 \"clinical uncertainty,\"18or \"appropriate inac- the relationship between TI and adherence,4,5,20-23 or the patient and visit-level predic- tors of TI.10,17,24-26 This study did not include specific measures of adherence, competing demands, patient com- plexity, clinical uncertainty, or appropriate inaction, although we did account for the burden of comorbid disease, which relates to several of these concepts (competing demands andpatient complexity). However, because we compared multi-ple measures of TI using the same database, we can be assured that unmeasured covariates would have been equally true for all comparisons. In addition, although refinements tothe TI concept are always welcome, our study reinforces thenotion that TI, as embodied in the SBM score, is an importantdeterminant of BP control. Second, our study compared different methods of measur- ing TI in hypertension care. It should not be assumed,however, that SBM would also be the ideal system for measuring TI in the care of diabetes or hyperlipidemia; futureresearch should address those questions. Finally, our datawere drawn from an academic urban hospital, which maylimit generalizability. The clinicians at Boston Medical Cen-ter may have managed hypertension differently than nonac- ademic clinicians. Similarly, the BP control in this cohort wasquite good; it is possible that the SBM score may workparticularly well in such a setting. In addition, many of thepatients in our study were immigrants, ethnic minorities, andof low socioeconomic status. However, given the relativelygood BP control achieved among this population, the chal-lenges these patients face in their everyday lives do not seemto threaten the generalizability of our findings. We have known for 30 years that more intensive manage- ment leads to better hypertension outcomes, in both clinicaltrials and observational settings. 1-3What we have lacked is consensus about the best method to measure TI in the care of hypertension. Our study found that any/none and NBM were not valid measures of TI, whereas a SBM was an excellent predictor of BP control. Unless these results are challengedby other studies, SBM should be the preferred method ofcharacterizing TI in future studies of hypertension care. SBMcan now serve as the basis of research and quality improve- ment efforts to improve the process and outcomes of hyper-tension care.

Rose, Dan R. Berlowitz, Meredith Manze, Michelle B. Orner, Nancy R. Kressin Abstract\u2014More intensive management can improve control blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. However, many would posit that treatment intensification (TI) is not beneficial in the face of suboptimal adherence. We investigated whether the effect of TI on BP varies by adherence. We enrolled 819 patients with hypertension, managed in primarycare at an academically-affiliated inner-city hospital. We used the following formula to characterize TI: (visits with amedication change/H11002visits with elevated BP)/total visits. Adherence was characterized using electronic monitoringdevices (\"MEMS caps\"). Patients who returned their MEMS caps (671) were divided into quartiles of adherence,whereas patients who did not return their MEMS caps (148) had \"missing\" adherence. We examined the relationshipbetween TI and the final systolic blood pressure (SBP), controlling for patient-level covariates. In the entire sample, eachadditional therapy increase per 10 visits predicted a 2.0 mm Hg decrease in final SBP ( P/H110210.001). After stratifying by adherence, in the \"best\" adherence quartile each therapy increase predicted a 2.1-mm Hg decrease in final SBP, followedby 1.8 for the \"next-best\" adherence quartile, 2.3 in the third quartile, and 2.4 in the \"worst\" adherence quartile. Theeffect size for patients with \"missing\" adherence was 1.6 mm Hg. The differences between the group with \"best\"adherence and the other 4 groups were not statistically significant. In this observational study, treatment intensificationwas associated with similar BP improvement regardless of the patient's level of adherence. A randomized trial couldfurther examine optimal management of patients with suboptimal adherence. (Hypertension. 2009;54:524-529.) Key Words: hypertension /H18546adherence /H18546medication therapy management /H18546quality of care /H18546ambulatory care For almost 30 years, we have known that more intensive management of hypertension can improve blood pressure (BP) control, both in the setting of clinical trials1and in observational studies of routine clinical practice.2,3Similarly, it has long been appreciated that greater adherence to medi- cation regimens can improve BP control.4,5More recently, there have been several efforts to understand the relationshipbetween adherence and treatment intensity (TI) in the man-agement of hypertension. 6-10 Some of these studies have addressed whether clinicians are more or less likely toincrease therapy according to patient adherence, 6,7whereas others have probed the relationship between TI and adherencein determining BP control over time. 8-10 Explorations of the relationship between TI and adherence in determining BP control have been limited in their scope,mostly demonstrating that both TI and adherence haveimportant effects on BP control. 8-10However, a more impor- tant question has not yet been addressed, namely whether theeffect of TI on BP control differs by adherence. Thisinformation would help inform the difficult clinical decisionof how best to manage a patient suspected of suboptimaladherence to therapy. Despite the lack of evidence regarding this topic, there seems to be widespread agreement that it isnot advisable to intensify therapy when a patient is nonad-herent. 7,8,11 This may be because of a belief, on the part of clinicians, that nonadherent patients may not benefit fromtreatment intensification, and that it in fact may harm them bypredisposing to hypotensive episodes when t herapy is actually taken. However, the conviction that therapy should not be increased for nonadherent patients has not been subjected toempirical evaluation, and it seems to be based on a binary viewof patients as completely adherent or completely nonadherent,when in fact most patients fall somewhere in between. 12 We therefore set out to examine the association between TI, adherence, and BP control. Our study had 2 objectives: (1) to determine whether patient adherence to antihypertensivetherapy predicts clinician decisions regarding therapy inten-sification, and (2) to determine whether the effect of TI on BPcontrol differs among strata of adherence. We hypothesizedthat patients with suboptimal adherence would indeed haveimproved BP control with more intensive therapy, because amore potent regimen, even one taken less than 100% of thetime, is likely to be more effective in controlling BP.

Hypertension is available at http://hyper.ahajournals.org DOI: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.133389 524 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on August 11, 2011 http://hyper.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from Methods Enrollment This report is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial designed to test whether a clinician-directed curriculum aboutpatient-centered counseling could improve doctor-patient communi-cation, adherence to therapy, and blood pressure control (Clinical-Trials.gov Identifier: NCT00201149). Patients were enrolled from 7outpatient primary care clinics at Boston Medical Center, an inner-city safety net hospital affiliated with the Boston University Schoolof Medicine. The study was approved by the Institutional ReviewBoard of Boston University Medical Center. We identified allpatients of white or black race, age 21 and older, with outpatientdiagnoses of hypertension on at least 3 separate occasions betweenAugust 2004 and June 2006. Because of this requirement for 3previous outpatient diagnostic codes, our study enrolled only patientswith prevalent as opposed to incident hypertension. Study staff thentracked the clinic visits of these 10 125 patients over a 19-monthperiod, and, as they presented for care, approached 3526 of them torequest participation in the study. Of those, 654 patients (19% of3526) overtly refused to participate and 920 patients (26% of 3526)responded that they did not have time to participate, but we wereunable to assess their eligibility before they declined. All willingrespondents were then asked a series of questions and administered acognitive screen to determine eligibility; 1083 patients (55% of theremaining 1952) were excluded, for reasons detailed in Figure S1(please see http://hyper.ahajournals.org). Assuming a similar rate ofineligibility among patients whose eligibility was not assessed, werecruited 869 patients from a likely pool of 1578 eligible patients (55%). Dependent Variable: Final Systolic Blood Pressure The primary outcome was each patient's final SBP value, ie, the oneimmediately before study completion. These BP values were drawnfrom the clinical record of Boston Medical Center. We chose SBPrather than diastolic blood pressure as our primary outcome, becausemany more patients have poorly-controlled SBP. 13,14 Categorizing Medication Increases Automated data from Boston Medical Center's electronic medicalrecord (EMR) were examined. Our database included all prescrip-tions written, as well as all clinical BP values recorded within thestudy period. The unit of analysis was a visit to the primary careclinic, as identified by a date on which a BP value was recorded.When there were multiple BP values recorded on one date, we chosethe one with the lowest SBP; if two values were tied, we selected theone with the lower DBP. We recorded the patient's initial regimen of antihypertensive medications, ie, the regimen before study inception. One of theauthors (A.J.R.) manually reviewed all prescriptions for each patientto see when the BP regimen was increased. An increase in medica-tion was defined as either a new medication being added to theregimen or an increase in the dose of an existing medication. Theperiod between each 2 BP values was assigne da1i ft h eregimen was increased during that period, ora0i fi tw a snot. Multiple increases during a single period were counted as a 1. A subset of 42 patients,representing 495 (5%) of all clinic visits, were randomly selected forblind reabstraction by another author (D.R.B.). Agreement betweenthe 2 ( /H9260/H110050.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.98). Independent Variable: Treatment Intensity Score We characterized TI using an observed-expected scoring systemoriginally described by Okonofua et al. 3We have shown that this scoring system is a valid predictor of BP control over time and is thepreferred scoring system to measure TI in the care of hypertension. 15 One of the strengths of this measure is that it avoids confounding byseverity, the tendency for patients with more severe disease toreceive more intensive management. 15Without accounting for con- founding by severity, one can obtain the paradoxical result that moreintensive management is associated with worse control of BP. 15Because this TI measure inherently accounts for BP control, it is not necessary to also control for initial BP as a covariate. For this TI measure, a medication increase is expected on each occasion when the recorded BP is 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Usingthis number, and the number of occasions on which the regimen wasintensified, each patient was assigned a score between /H110021 and 1, using the following formula: (observed medication changes /H11002expected medication changes)/number of clinic visits As an example, over a period of 10 visits, 5 of which had an elevated BP value, a patient would have an expected proportion ofvisits with medication increases of 5/10. If this patient actually had3 visits with medication increases, the score would be 3/10/H110025/10/H11005/H110020.2, indicating that therapy was increased at 20% fewer visits than expected. If the patient had 6 visits with therapy increases, thescore would be 6/10/H110025/10/H110050.1, indicating that therapy was in- creased at 10% more visits than expected. We recognize that for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, current guidelines set a lower BP target (ie, 130/80 mm Hg). 13We therefore created an additional TI score only for patients with a low BP target. For this alternative TI score, amedication increase was expected on each occasion when therecorded BP is 130/80 mm Hg or higher, as opposed to 140/90 mm Hg for the main TI score. We conducted a sensitivityanalysis, dividing the sample into patients with the higher and thelower BP thresholds, and repeating our analyses for each groupseparately using the appropriate TI score. Results were similar to ourmain analysis, and are not shown. Stratification Variable: Adherence to Antihypertensive Therapy We characterized adherence to antihypertensive therapy using Med- ication Events Monitoring System ([MEMS], AARDEX). Thesedevices use a microchip to record all bottle openings. Adherence asmeasured by MEMS caps has been linked to improvements innumerous clinical outcomes, 16,17including hypertension control.18,19 Patients were each given one MEMS cap, corresponding to theantihypertensive medication that they took the most times per day.Clinicians were not given feedback about their patients' adherence asmeasured by MEMS caps. When processing MEMS data into adherence scores, we began by identifying all patients who either did not return their MEMS cap ordid not open it enough times to calculate an adherence score (forexample, once). For all others, we used MEMS data from the first 90days after they began using their MEMS cap, or a shorter period forpatients who stopped using their MEMS cap sooner. We calculatedthe proportion of days in this period on which the patient took at leastthe number of doses prescribed. Patients who did not return theirMEMS caps were considered to have \"missing\" adherence. Theremaining patients were divided into quartiles by adherence; thus,there were 5 adherence groups included in the analysis: 4 quartilesand \"missing.\" Covariates We collected patient demographic data, including self-reported race(black or white), sex, and age. Using both ICD-9 codes and problemlists from the EMR, we noted whether the patients had the followingcomorbid conditions, all of which could impact the blood pressure,the use of antihypertensive medications, or the perceived urgency ofcontrolling hypertension: benign prostatic hypertrophy, cerebrovas-cular disease, chronic heart failure, kidney disease, coronaryartery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity (BMI/H1102230), and peripheral vascular disease. We noted whether patientswere actively using tobacco at any time during the study. Finally, we controlled for assignment to the intervention or control arm of the parent randomized trial as a covariate. Clinicians treatingthe patients in the study arm received a one-time educationalintervention designed to improve doctor-patient communication andRose et al Therapy Intensity and Adherence in Hypertension 525 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on August 11, 2011 http://hyper.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from cultural competency; clinicians treating patients in the control arm did not receive the intervention. Statistical Analyses We compared baseline characteristics among the 5 adherencegroups, using ANOVA and /H92732tests as appropriate. We used a test of linear trend to compare TI scores among the 5 adherence strata. Weexamined the effect of TI on the final SBP using a generalized linearmodel, controlling for patient-level covariates. We then addedinteraction terms to our model to test whether the effect of TI on thefinal SBP differed among the adherence strata, controlling forpatient-level covariates. Finally, we analyzed each adherence stratumseparately, controlling for covariates, to confirm that the effect of TIon SBP remained statistically significant in all strata. For allanalyses, we used SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute). Results Patient Characteristics Of the 869 patients enrolled in the study, 50 were not analyzed because they had 2 or fewer BP values. Therefore,819 patients with hypertension, all managed at Boston Med- ical Center, constituted our study population (Table 1). Themean follow-up time was 24 months; on average, patientsvisited the clinic once every 2 months. The mean age was59.6 years, 34% of patients were male, and most (58%) wereof black race. Considering their relatively young age, thepopulation had a relatively high burden of comorbidity: 33%had diabetes, 13% had coronary artery disease, 7% hadchronic kidney disease, and 59% were obese. Most patients(74%) were receiving 2 or more antihypertensive medicationsat the beginning of the study. The population was character-ized by relatively well-controlled hypertension at baseline:the mean initial BP was 134/80 mm Hg, and 55% of patientshad an initial BP below 140/90 mm Hg. There were 5 adherence groups: 4 quartiles of adherence (98% and higher, 94% to 98%, 80% to 94%, below 80%) and patients who did not return their MEMS caps (missingadherence). Within the poor adherence quartile, the medianadherence was 62% (Interquartile Range 42% to 73%). Comparison of baseline characteristics among these 5 adher-ence strata revealed several differences (Table S1, please seehttp://hyper.ahajournals.org). Most notably, black race wasassociated with poorer adherence or not returning the MEMScap; the best adherence group contained 45% black patients,compared to the worst adherence group (69%) and themissing adherence group (76%, P/H110210.001 for /H92732test). In addition, patients with poor or missing adherence had worseBP control at baseline. For example, 45% of patients withmissing adherence and 50% of patients with the worstadherence had controlled BP at baseline, compared to 61%among patients with the best adherence (probability value for /H92732test/H110050.03). Treatment Intensity, Adherence, and Blood Pressure Control Blood pressure was elevated at 4894 of 11 530 clinic visits (42%), and therapy was increased at 7.4% of 11,530 visits.The median TI score was /H110020.50); the mean was /H110020.28 (SD 0.29). Among the 671 patients with complete adherence data, the average patient was adherent on85% of days (median 94%, interquartile range 80% to 98%).Patients with better adherence received more intensive man-agement (Table 2). The difference in the mean TI between thebest and worst adherence quartiles was 0.09, approximatelyequivalent to 1 extra therapy increase per 11 clinic visits.Table 1.

We added interaction terms (Table 3) to reflect membership in the other adherence groups, compared to the reference category(best adherence). The effect size in the best adherence groupwas a 2.1 mm Hg decrease in SBP for each additional therapyincrease per 10 visits. The effect sizes in the other adherencegroups were 1.8 mm Hg in the second quartile, 2.3 mm Hg inthe third quartile, 2.4 mm Hg in the fourth (worst) adherencequartile, and 1.6 mm Hg among patients with missing adher-ence. These effect sizes did not differ from that of the bestadherence group at the 0.05 level of significance. In addition,we reran the multivariate regression separately for eachadherence stratum; the effect of TI on final SBP remainedstatistically significant for each stratum ( P/H110050.01 for missing adherence and P/H110210.001 for all other groups). We also explored the effect of TI for patients with even lower adherence to therapy than the worst adherence quartile:less than 60% adherence (n /H1100575). The effect of TI in that group, controlling for covariates, was similar to our otheranalyses (final SBP 2.0 mm Hg lower for each additionaltherapy increase per 10 visits, P/H110050.006). Discussion In this observational study, we investigated the interaction ofadherence and TI in determining BP control. We found thatmore adherent patients received somewhat more intensivemanagement, suggesting that clinicians may hesitate to inten-sify therapy in the face of suspected nonadherence. We alsofound that greater TI was associated with improved BPcontrol over time, and that this effect was similar in size forpatients with varying levels of adherence. This is a nonintui-tive finding, and one which may surprise many. We wouldsuggest that the key to understanding this finding is toremember that adherence is not a binary concept, withpatients divided into those who are \"adherent\" and those whoare \"nonadherent.\" In our study, even patients with the worst adherence generally took approximately half their doses ofmedication. Many antihypertensive medications have longhalf-lives, and drugs with long half-lives may have a degreeof \"forgiveness\" when some doses are missed. 20Previous studies have shown that blood pressure response to manyantihypertensives persists for several days after the last dosewas taken, although the period of \"forgiveness\" varies amongdrugs. 21 Many clinicians address suspected nonadherence by asking the patient to improve adherence, and then rechecking the BPat the next visit. This strategy may well reduce treatmentintensity over time, especially if another reason not tointensify therapy is found at the following visit. 2,3,22 Our results suggest that, whereas clinicians in our study were lesslikely to intensify therapy in patients with suboptimal adher- ence, they could have improved these patients' BP controlconsiderably by intensifying therapy. We do not mean to suggestthat it is not worthwhile to address suboptimal adherence\u2014theevidence is quite clear that greater adherence improves BPcontrol. 4,5However, it is notoriously difficult and effort- intensive to improve adherence, and not all patients will respondto such efforts. 23,24Indeed, we know that clinicians often are not even aware of issues with adherence.25-27 Although improving adherence remains an important priority, our results suggest thatclinicians need not reserve therapy increases for patients withideal adherence to therapy. Our study population, in general, had a relatively high degree of adherence to therapy, which some might findsurprising among an urban safety net population. It is impor-tant to note, however, that previous studies have recordedsimilar degrees of adherence to antihypertensive medications.For example, Choo et al studied patients in a managed careorganization in Massachusetts and found that the meanpercentage of days with adherence was 86%, and the medianwas 92% (IQR 0.77 to 0.98). 28By comparison, we found a mean adherence of 84% and a median of 94% (IQR 0.80 to0.98). In another study, Fung et al found that 27% ofMedicare/H11001Choice beneficiaries were poorly adherent, de-fined as taking less than 80% of their medication 29;i no u r study, 24% of patients were less than 80% adherent. Thesecomparisons remind us that divergent patient populations canhave very similar patterns of adherence, and suggest that ourresults may be broadly generalizable to other populations. Our study has several limitations. First, although MEMS caps have strengths as a measure of adherence, 26-28,30-32 they also have weaknesses.28,33Patients may take their medication more often than MEMS data would suggest, particularly if they are using some other sort of pill box rather than the bottleused for the MEMS cap. 33We made efforts to minimize this effect, excluding patients from our study who stated that theyuse a pill organizer, but it is still possible that some patientsidentified as very poorly adherent in our study were actuallyquite adherent to their medication, but not to using the MEMScap. Similarly, we cannot fully characterize adherence amongpatients who did not return their MEMS caps. However, thefact that these patients had higher BP at baseline than thosewith complete MEMS data supports the contention that thesepatients may have had the worst adherence of all. In anyTable 3. Effect of Treatment Intensity Score on Final Systolic Blood Pressure Adherence Group Adjusted Effect* PValue Best /H110022.4 0.55 Missing adherence /H110021.6 0.22 Interaction terms were used to test whether the effect sizes in patients with suboptimal adherence differed from the effect size among patients in the top quartile of adherence (n/H11005819). *Analyses adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, and treatment assignment (intervention vs control). All beta coefficients are expressedin mm Hg. Effect of TI is per change of 0.1 in the treatment intensity score(equivalent to one additional therapy increase per 10 visits). For example, abeta coefficient of /H110022.0 means that for every additional therapy increase per 10 visits, the mean final systolic blood pressure will be 2.0 mm Hg lower. Pvalues for adherence strata test for a difference from the excellent adherence group. The effect of the entire TI variable was statistically significant(P/H110210.001). In addition, when each adherence stratum was analyzed sepa-rately, the effect of TI was statistically significant.Rose et al Therapy Intensity and Adherence in Hypertension 527 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on August 11, 2011 http://hyper.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from event, patients with incomplete MEMS data also benefited from TI.

However,improved BP control (an intermediate outcome) has robustlybeen tied to improvements in morbidity and mortality. 13In addition, it is possible that patients whose therapy wasintensified despite nonadherence experienced some episodesof hypotension, a commonly raised concern in such a situa-tion. This would raise concerns that, although more intensivemanagement of hypertension in suboptimally adherent pa- tients might lower BP, it might also increase risk for adverseevents. However, there were no hypotensive episodes re-ported to study staff by patients or clinicians. Third, this study shares the limitations of any observational study. Although our results suggest that patients with less-than-ideal adherence do benefit from intensification of theantihypertensive regimen, it cannot determine the ideal man-agement for a nonadherent patient with hypertension. Arandomized trial could assign nonadherent patients to inten-sification, adherence interventions, both, or neither, andwould be ideally suited to answer this question. Fourth, wehad few, if any, patients in our study who took none of theirmedication at all. Our results may not apply to such uncom-mon patients, and we would agree that intensifying antihy-pertensive therapy for such a patient would not be beneficial.Fifth, our study enrolled only patients with prevalent asopposed to incident hypertension. Therefore, our findingsmay not be generalizable to patients with newly diagnosedhypertension, who may have different patterns of adherence.Sixth, this study relies on data from one medical center,which may not be representative of other settings. BostonMedical Center is an academic, inner-city safety net hospital.Its academically oriented clinicians and largely immigrantand poor patient population are a somewhat unique combi-nation. These results remain to be confirmed in other settings. Finally, there are many legitimate reasons why a clinician- patient dyad might decide not to intensify therapy, includingcompeting priorities, medication side effects, and patientunwillingness to accept a more intensive regimen. We do notmean to suggest that intensifying therapy is always thecorrect response to an elevated BP value. Rather, our studysuggests that, when therapy intensification is mutually ac-ceptable to the patient and the clinician, and there are no otherreasons not to intensify, then suboptimal adherence alone isnot a sufficient reason to forego intensification. Although it isimportant to communicate effectively about adherence and totry to improve it, it is not necessary to await proof of perfectadherence before intensifying therapy for hypertension. Perspectives In this observational study, more intensive management ofhypertension improved blood pressure control to a similarextent regardless of the patient's level of adherence. Thefindings of this study do not diminish the importance ofidentifying patients with suboptimal adherence and trying tohelp them improve their adherence, because adherence re-mains an unquestioned determinant of control for hyperten-sion and numerous other conditions. However, this studydoes call into question the widely held assumption that \"nonadherent\" patients cannot benefit from therapy intensifi-cation. Indeed, one of the major contributions of this study isto remind us that adherence is not a binary concept, withpatients divided into those who are \"adherent\" or \"nonadher-ent.\" Instead, all patients should be viewed as somewhere ona spectrum of adherence. The issue that we examined (ie,whether patients with uncontrolled hypertension and subop-timal adherence benefit from therapy intensification) has notpreviously been subjected to investigation because the answerwas widely assumed. Now that this assumption has beenchallenged, we think it is time for further studies, particularlyrandomized trials, to determine the most effective manage-ment strategy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension andsuboptimal adherence.

Seeking to harmonize these mixed results into a unifying theory, Piette and Kerr 10 proposed that symptomatic conditions may have a greater effect on quality of care than asymptom-atic conditions and that conditions with dissimilar management goals (\"discordant conditions\") may have a greater effect than those with similar goals (\"concordant conditions\"). By this reasoning, chronic pain could have a considerable adverse effect on quality of care for unrelated conditions. Pain is highly symp-tomatic, and pain management is discordant with the management of other conditions. 11 While the use of opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain is increasingly accepted,12 opioid therapy may present additional challenges due to the potential for abuse, dependence, and diversion and due to conflicts over appropriate dosages. 13-19 However, opioid therapy could also facilitate care for unrelated conditions. Patients receiving opioids may visit the clinic more often, allowing more opportunities for medical management. 10 Adequate treatment of pain may improve the patient's functional status and quality of life,12 allowing greater focus on self-care activities. Diabetes mellitus, a common, costly, and highly morbid condition,20,21 is a good condition in which to examine this possibility. Adequate man-agement of diabetes requires collaboration among clinicians and the pa-tient within a system of care, 22-27 and explicit guidelines and diabetes performance targets exist with which to examine the adequacy of dia-betes care. 28-30 Krein et al31 showed that among patients with diabetes, chronic pain is a barrier to the completion of self-care activities such as taking medications, exercising, and pursuing a prudent diet. However, the effect of pain on process and outcome measures of diabetes care is unknown. In addition, no study has specifically examined the effect of opioid therapy on the quality of care for unrelated chronic conditions, but there is reason to believe that opioid therapy may impart more com-plexity and challenge than pain alone. 32 To clarify whether the net effect of opioid therapy is to promote or im-pede care for diabetes, we analyzed a large database of patients with diabe-tes in the US Department of Veterans In this issue Take-Away Points / p222 www.ajmc.com Full text and PDFDoes Opioid Therapy Affect Quality of Care for Diabetes Mellitus? Adam J. Rose, MD, MSc; John A. Hermos, MD; Susan M. Frayne, MD, MPH; Leonard M. Pogach, MD, MBA; Dan R. Berlowitz, MD, MPH; and Donald R. Miller, ScD Objective: To examine whether veterans who re- ceived chronic opioid therapy had worse diabetes performance measures than patients who did not receive opioids. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.Methods: We identified all patients with diabetes mellitus receiving care in US Department of Veter - ans Affairs facilities during 2004. Cases received at least 6 prescriptions for chronic opioids during 2004, while controls were randomly selected from among patients with diabetes who received no opioids. We compared process measures (glycosylated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels tested and an eye examination performed) and outcome measures (glycosylated hemoglobin level <9.0% and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol level <130 mg/dL) between groups. Results: Cases (n = 47 ,756) had slightly worse diabetes performance measures than controls (n = 220,912) after adjustment for covariates. For example, 86.4% of cases and 89.0% of controls had a glycosylated hemoglobin test during fiscal year 2004 (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; P <.001). Among cases, receipt of higher-dose opioids was associated with additional decrement in diabetes performance measures, with a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: Chronic opioid therapy among patients within the Veterans Affairs system is associated with slightly worse diabetes perfor - mance measures compared with patients who do not receive opioids. However, patients receiving higher dosages of opioids had additional decre- ments in diabetes performance measures; these patients may be appropriate targets for interven- tions to improve their care for pain and diabetes.

We compared patients receiving chronic opioids ver - sus patients not receiving opioids regarding selected diabetes performance measures. We hypothesized that the distractions and concerns associated with chronic opioid therapy, as well as perhaps other characteristics of patients with chronic pain, would be reflected in worse diabetes performance measures. We also hypothesized that among those receiving opioids there would be a dose-response relationship between higher opioid dosages and decrements in diabetes performance measures. METHODS Study Sample We identified subjects from the Diabetes Epidemiology Cohort, which comprises all patients with diabetes seen in the VA. 21 The Diabetes Epidemiology Cohort links admin- istrative, laboratory, and pharmacy data from the VA with Medicare claims, providing a rich data set for analysis. 21,33 We first looked at all veterans treated for diabetes during fiscal year (FY) 2004 whose diabetes had been diagnosed before the start of FY 2002. Based on earlier work, 21 we defined patients as having diabetes if they had at least 2 International Classifica-tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9- CM) codes for diabetes or any prescriptions for antiglycemic medications within a 2-year period. We excluded patients who had an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of malignant neoplasm (other than basal or squamous car - cinoma of the skin) within 2 years of study inception. The management of cancer-related pain is qualitatively different; moreover, diabetes performance measures may not apply to patients with active malignant neoplasms. We also excluded all patients receiving methadone hydrochloride or buprenor - phine hydrochloride-naloxone hydrochloride for treatment of opioid dependence. Finally, we excluded patients who had fewer than 2 VA primary care visits in FY 2004, as a large portion of their diabetes care may not appear in our database. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bedford VA Medical Center. Independent Variable: Chronic Opioid Therapy Our independent variable was the prescription of chronic opioids. We considered the all are Schedule II or III controlled substances according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration. 34 Any formulation suitable for outpatient administration was considered, includ-ing tablets, patches, elixirs, and sprinkles. We also included formulations that combine opioids with other drugs such as acetaminophen. Buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalbuphine hydrochloride, pentazocine, and propoxyphene, which are less potent, were considered \"minor\" opioids. 34 Patients who received at least 6 prescriptions for major opioids during FY 2004, with or without additional minor opi-oids, constituted the chronic opioid group (cases). This cut-off of 6 prescriptions was chosen to distinguish treatment for chronic pain from treatment for acute pain and is consistent with previous definitions of chronic pain. 17,18 Patients who re- ceived any major or minor opioids during FY 2004 but did not meet criteria for the case group were excluded from the study. We randomly selected controls from among the remain-ing patients, who had received no opioids during FY 2004, to achieve a control group approximately 4 times as numerous as the case group. Dependent Variables: Diabetes Performance Measures Our 3 process measures, which could be completed at any time during FY 2004, were testing of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) level, testing of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and a dilated eye examination. Our 2 outcome measures were at least 1 A1C level of 9.0% or less and at least 1 LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or less during FY 2004 (to con- vert A1C level to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01; to convert cholesterol level to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). If no test results were available among VA data, patients were considered to have levels above these thresholds. These diabetes performance measures are based on VA clinical practice guidelines for diabetes and reflect a minimal standard of care. 28,29 We also examined lower targets for glycemic and lipemic control (ie, A1C level <8.0% and LDL-C level <100 mg/dL). Covariates Age was divided into the following 4 categories: 54 years or younger, 55 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or older. Race/ethnicity was categorized into the following 4 groups: white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, all others, and miss-ing. The VA priority status, which characterizes the degree of entitlement to VA care, was defined as follows: poverty, full disability, partial disability, or none of the above. More or less intensive management of diabetes may be in- dicated depending on life expectancy and comorbidities. 29 We focused on the following complications of diabetes by identi-fying conditions with at least 1 ICD-9-CM code during FYs 1997 through 2004: cellulitis, gangrene/ulcer, other diabetic infections, congestive heart failure, other heart diseases, cere-brovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, and diabetic eye disease. Mental health conditions may also VOL. 15, NO. 4 n THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE n 219Does Opioid Therapy affect Quality of care for Diabetes Mellitus? conditions, and the number of VA primary care visits during the study). We did not adjust for eye disease when studying the eye examination process measure. To investigate the possible effect of missing data on our results, we repeated key analyses among subsets of patients who were likely to have complete data. We restricted process measures to patients 65 years or older, who would presumably use Medicare when not using the VA and thus would have complete data for process measures. We restricted outcome measures to patients who had an A1C or LDL-C test within the VA at least once during the study (ie, those for whom laboratory values were available). Finally, we added the mean daily opioid dose to our models and examined its ability to risk stratify the cases regarding dia-betes performance measures. Our analyses were conducted us-affect diabetes care. 2-5 Using similar ICD-9-CM code-based definitions, we identified the following mental health con-ditions: major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. We also recorded the number of VA primary care visits; more visits might allow more opportunities to complete diabetes perfor - mance measures. We also examined pain diagnoses, dividing them into the following 4 broad categories: neuropathic pain, musculoskeletal pain, chronic headache, and psychogenic pain. Using ICD-9-CM codes, we categorized patients ac- cording to whether or not they had any diagnoses in each category (vs none). We hypothesized that patients receiving higher daily doses of opioids might be at risk for additional decrements in diabe-tes performance measures, as the receipt of higher dosages sug- gests difficulties in pain management and possibly physiologic tolerance and an increased risk of dependence. 13,17,35 We used a standard equivalency table36 to convert all opioid dosages to oral morphine equivalents. We calculated a mean daily dose of opioid therapy in FY 2004 for each patient in the study and categorized patients into quartiles based on their daily opioid doses. Finally, we assigned each patient to 1 VA medical center so that we could control for site of care. Our assignment was based on the site the patient vis-ited most often for diabetes care during FY 2004. If 2 sites were visited equally, we selected the site visited closest to the end of the year. Statistical Analysis We began our analysis with bivari- ate comparisons of demographics, co- morbidities, and healthcare utilization between cases and controls. Using 2 tests, we then performed unadjusted comparisons of the proportions fulfill-ing each of the 5 diabetes performance measures. We performed adjusted anal- yses using generalized estimating equa- tions to account for the clustering of outcomes by site of care, while adjust-ing for other covariates (sex, age, race/ethnicity, VA priority status, pain diag-noses, diabetic complications [includ-ing neuropathic pain], mental health n Figure.

RESULTS Demographics The Figure shows the exclu- sions that led to our case and control groups. We compared summary statistics between cas- es and controls (Table 1). Cases were younger (eg, 60.3% were <65 years vs 35.8% of controls). Despite their younger age, they were more likely to have at least 1 diabetic complication (70.9% vs 60.5%) and to have each particular diabetic com-plication. They were also more than twice as likely to have at least 1 mental health condition (36.8% vs 15.9%) and to have each specific mental health condition. They had more VA primary care visits than con-trols (eg, 41.1% vs 18.0% had >6 primary care visits). Despite the differences in age and VA primary care utilization, the 2 groups used Medicare at similar rates. Among the cases (Table 2), most (67.4%) received only short-acting opioid formula-tions. The 1 opioid during FY 2004. Among 89.4% of cases for whom dosage information was available, the mean total daily dose (in mil-ligrams of morphine) was 88.9 mg. The median total daily dose was much lower (22.7 mg), indicating a rightward skew to this distribution. Opioid dose quartile was found to be highly n T able 1.

For example, patients receiving only short-acting drugs were unlikely to be in the highest-dose quartile (3.2%) compared with patients receiving only long-acting drugs both long-acting and short-acting drugs (56.1%). All pa- tients for whom dose quartile was unavailable were receiving only short-acting drugs; therefore, it seems likely that most of them were also receiving lower total daily doses. Comparison of Diabetes Performance Measures An unadjusted comparison of diabetes performance mea- sures between cases and controls is given in Table 3. There were small differences between groups, all of which attained statistical significance because of large sample size. Among process measures, cases were less likely to have their A1C level tested (86.4% vs 89.0%) and to have their LDL-C level tested (75.9% vs 80.3%) but were more likely to have an eye examination performed (67.0% vs 66.3%). Among outcome measures, cases were slightly less likely to have A1C control (75.9% vs 76.5%) and LDL-C control (65.2% vs 66.1%). To evaluate the effect of missing data on our results, we repeated our analysis of process measures among patients 65 years or older, whose data would presumably be more com-plete. While diabetes performance measures were slightly improved in both groups, between-group differences were unaffected. Similarly, for outcome measures, we restricted our analysis to patients who had at least 1 test within the VA. While diabetes performance measures improved considerably in both groups, between-group differences did not change appreciably (eg, A1C level <9.0% increased from 75.9% in cases and 76.5% in controls to 91.8% and 92.6%, respective-ly). Examination of stricter targets for glycemic control (A1C <8.0%) and for lipemic control (LDL-C level <100 mg/ dL) worsened diabetes performance measures, but between- group differences remained slight. In unadjusted analyses that accounted for the clustering of outcomes by site of care (Table 3), odds ratios echoed the unadjusted proportions. After adjustment for covariates, cases now lagged behind controls for each of our 5 diabetes performance measures, with effect sizes somewhat widened (eg, the odds ratio for A1C level measurement was 0.78 be-fore adjustment and 0.69 after adjustment). Between-group differences remained small for outcome measures even af- ter adjustment for covariates (adjusted odds ratios, 0.90 and 0.87 for A1C mg/dL, respectively). After stratification by opioid dosage, higher daily doses predicted worse performance on all 5 diabetes measures we studied (Table 4). For example, patients in the highest-dose quartile had an odds ratio of 0.55 for having their A1C level tested and an odds ratio of 0.79 for having an A1C level of 9.0% or less compared with controls. DISCUSSION Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy had only slightly worse diabetes performance measures than those not receiving opioids; the difference was smaller than we had anticipated. Within the opioid group, the receipt of higher daily opioid doses predicted further decrements in all of our diabetes performance measures, with a dose-response rela- tionship. This suggests that the small difference in diabetes performance measures between cases and controls is largely attributable to patients receiving higher dosages of opioids. Resources should be focused on improving care for patients receiving high dosages of opioids. For example, a mean daily dose exceeding 60 mg of morphine (our highest-dose n T able 2.

The receipt of chronic opioid therapy is a compound concept that includes elements of pain, provider prescribing patterns, and medication utilization. Krein et al 31 previously showed that chronic pain distracts patients with diabetes from self-care tasks, including adherence to diet, exercise, and medication use. In that study, taking a medication for pain seemed to mitigate the negative effect of pain on some self-care activities, possibly because well-treated pain is less all-consuming. 31 To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the relationship between a specific therapy for pain (opioid use) and process and outcome measures of diabetes care. Our study reminds us of the potential to use large clinical databases (such as those available within the VA) to answer meaningful questions about the care received by previously understudied groups of patients. Our study has some limitations. First, we did not control for pain scores or for the severity of pain. It may be that our finding of a dose-response relationship for opioid therapy may partly or wholly reflect the effect of increasing severity of pain. Future research might be able to separate the effect of opioid therapy from that of pain severity, but given the subjective nature of any measure of pain, this would require detailed data and might still be of questionable validity. Second, the highly integrated nature of VA care and the standardized clinical care provided throughout the VA may have minimized the detrimental effects of opioid therapy in our study. In non-VA settings, opioid therapy may affect dia-betes care more negatively. Third, our VA cohort was mostly male and had a high in- cidence of poverty, comorbidity, and disability. These factors limit the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Fourth, we were unable to capture some elements of care that occurred outside the VA. However, our reanalysis of subsets of patients with complete data suggested that, while incomplete data capture affected rates of diabetes performance measure completion, it did not greatly alter between-group comparisons. Fifth, our data set was insufficiently detailed to identify patients who were abusing prescription opioids. Defining prescription drug abuse in clinical practice is challenging, 37 identifying it from paper medical record review can be difficult, 38 and identifying it from automated data is even more problematic. It is plausible that our finding of a dose-response curve for opioid therapy is partially due to an n T able 3. Comparison of Diabetic Performance Measures Between Cases and Controls T ake-Away Points Within the Veterans Affairs system, patients who received opioids for chronic pain had slightly worse diabetes performance measures than patients who did not receive opioids. n Comparisons included measurement of glycemic and lipemic control, achievement of mod- erate or better glycemic and lipemic control, and a yearly eye examination.n Among the group receiving opioids, the receipt of higher daily opioid doses predicted worse results for all 5 diabetes performance measures. A dose-response relationship was ob- served, lending additional credibility to this finding.% VariableCases (n = 47 ,756)Controls (n = 220,912) POdds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)a Unadjusted level <8.0% 67 .7 68.4 .007 0.97 (0.92-1 .02) 0.97 (0.91-1 .02) LDL SI conversion factors: To convert A1C level to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01; to convert cholesterol level to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259. aOdds ratios are the odds of completing diabetes performance measures among cases compared with controls.

Adjusted odds ratios also account for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and number of primary care visits in FY 2004.

In addition, quartiles of opioid dosage may reflect the physical tolerance that naturally develops over time with chronic opioid therapy, necessitating higher dos-ages of this medication. 39 A more complete examination of the effect of prescription drug abuse on the quality of care for unrelated conditions would ideally be conducted with a detailed paper medical record review rather than with auto-mated data. Sixth, our comorbidity data were not sufficiently detailed to identify patients for whom tight glycemic or lipemic con-trol would not be indicated because of limited life expec-tancy. We addressed this by having modest expectations for glycemic and lipemic control (ie, an A1C level of <9.0% and an LDL-C level of <130 mg/dL). Although the application of more stringent standards to some patients may be of question-able value, 5,29,40-42 these targets should apply to most, if not all, patients. In summary, patients receiving chronic opioids to treat pain had slightly worse diabetes performance measures than patients who did not receive opioids. However, stratification by opioid dosage revealed that patients receiving high dosages had additional decrements in diabetes performance measures. Efforts should be focused on improving the quality of care in such patients for pain and for diabetes. Acknowledgment We thank Qing Shao for his expert SAS programming.

Summary. Background: Little is how patterns of warfarin dose management cont ribute to percentage time in the therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) range(TTR). Objectives: To quantify the contribution of warfarin dose management to TTR and to dene an optimal dose management strategy. Patients/methods: We enrolled 3961 patients receiving warfarin from 94 community-based clinics.We derived and validated a model for the probability of awarfarin dose change under v arious conditions. For each patient, we computed an observed minus expected (O )E) score, comparing the number of dose changes predicted by ourmodel to the number of changes observed. We examined theability of O )E scores to predict TTR, and simulated various dose management strategies in the context of our model. Results: Patients were observed for a mean of 15.2 months. Patients who deviated the least from the predicted number ofdose changes achieved the best INR control (mean TTR 70.1%unadjusted); patients with gre ater deviations had lower TTR (65.8% and 62.0% for fewer and more dose changes respec-tively, Bonferroni-adjusted P< 0.05/3 for both comparisons). On average, clinicians in our study changed the dose when the INR was 1.8 or lower/3.2 or higher (mean TTR: 68%); optimal management would have been to change the dose when theINR was 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher (predicted TTR: 74%).Conclusions: Our observational study suggests that INR control could be improved considerably by changing the warfarin doseonly when the INR is 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher. This should beconrmed in a randomized trial. Keywords : anticoagulants, medication therapy management, quality of healthcare, warfarin.Warfarin is highly efcacious for the prevention of strokes [1- 3], the treatment of venous thromboembolism [4], and otherindications. Numerous studies have focused on the underuti-lization of warfarin for patients with atrial brillation, the mostcommon indication for warfarin [5 -8]. However, relatively little is known about how best to manage warfarin once it isinitiated. This lack of evidence regarding optimal managementstrategies probably contributes to our limited success in maintaining patients within the target International Normal- ized Ratio (INR) range. Even the highly selected and carefullymanaged patients in clinical trials only achieve a meanpercentage time in the therapeutic INR range (TTR) of66.4% [9], a gure that leaves much room for improvement.Suboptimal INR control has important clinical implications: ina recent study of patients in Ontario, time spent above thetarget INR range accounted for 26% of hemorrhagic events in patients receiving warfarin, and time below the target range accounted for 11% of thromboemboli [10]. For patients toderive maximal therapy, we must ndways to improve INR control. Many factors might contribute to suboptimal INR control, including inadequate adherence to warfarin therapy [11],inadequate or erratic dietary intake of vitamin K [12],interactions with other medications [13], and genetic differ- ences between patients [14]. Clinician variation in the decision to change the warfarin dose may likewise affect INR control,but this has not yet been studied. Clinicians are likely to differin their probability of changing the warfarin dose in responseto a given INR value, especially when the value is only slightlyout of range. Studies have shown that managing warfarindoses via standardized computer-based algorithms results inhigher TTR than management without computer assistance [15-17]. Even in settings where such computer programs are not utilized, these studies suggest that reducing variation in themanagement of warfarin doses can improve the stability ofINR control. We therefore used a large, nationally representative database of patients receiving warfarin without the aid of acomputerized dosing algorithm to examine variations in themanagement of warfarin doses. In order to do this, we addressed the following four issues. First, we derived and Correspondence: Adam J. Rose, Center for Health Quality, Outcomes, and Economic Research, Bedford VA Medical Center, 200 SpringsRoad, Building 70, Bedford, MA 01730, and Thrombosis and Haemostasisvalidated a model to predict when clinicians would change warfarin doses. This model describes what the /C212average /C213 clinician would do under various circumstances. Second, wedocumented deviations from this model, to demonstrate thatthe management of warfarin varies among patients andamong sites of care, even in similar clinical situations. Third,we examined variations in practice as a predictor of TTR, on both a patient and a site level. Finally, we simulated the effect of different warfarin dose management strategies on TTR.Through this study, we sought to provide insights intooptimal dose management strategi es to improve the stability of INR control. Methods Collection of data/study cohort Data collection for this study has been described in detail elsewhere [18-21]. Physician practices that were registeredusers of CoumaCare /C210software (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA) were invited to participate. CoumaCare/C210 was freely available and was used by many anticoagulationmanagement services for patie nt tracking, data entry, and record keeping. It does not include dosing algorithms or otherforms of decision support. This uniformity of data structureamong sites made our study possible at a time when only 18%of US medical practices had an electronic medical record [22].In total, 174 practices registered online to participate, and 101sites had the technological capability and the review board approval necessary to proceed. All sites had at least one dedicated provider managing warfarin (most often a nurse),usually within the setting of a community-based, physiciangroup practice. Enrollment began in April 2000 and follow-upended in March 2002. To be eligible, patients had to be18 years of age or older and provide written informedconsent. The study protocol was approved by the WesternInstitutional Review Board (WIRB) of Olympia, WA, and by local review boards where they existed. Database To create the database for this study, we excluded patients whohad a target INR range other than 2.0-3.0 for any part of the study period. We wished to study variations in the managementof warfarin doses under similar clinical circumstances; there-fore, we only included patients with the most common INRtarget range [13]. To limit our study to experienced users ratherthan patients in the inception phase of warfarin therapy, wealso excluded all patients who had received less than a fullmonth of warfarin at the time when they were enrolled in our study. Among the patients remaining in the database, we excluded all INR values recorded within 14 days before andafter an intentional interruption of warfarin therapy for aprocedure. The management of warfarin proximal to anintentional interruption is a different issue from routinewarfarin management.Variables Patient age and gender were recorded. Patient race wasrecorded by site clinicians; and was collapsed to threec a t e g o r i e s :W h i t e ,B l a c k ,a n da l lo t h e r s .T h ef o l l o w i n gcomorbid conditions were recorded: diabetes, hypertension,congestive heart failure, history of prior stroke, and coronaryartery disease. All INR values were recorded, with the dates on which they were obtained. From the INR values, we calculated TTR [23] for each patient. The total weekly warfarin dose wasupdated for each patient at each clinical visit; therefore, wewere able to determine when the dose of warfarin was increasedor decreased between two visits. It is of note that our analysisconsidered changes in the weekly dose of warfarin, but did notidentify occasions when the patient was asked to omit doses ofwarfarin. In addition, the relative sizes of dose changes were not considered. Statistical analyses - overview Analyses consisted of four steps. First, we derived andvalidated two models to estimate, for each clinical encounter, the probability that the warfarin dose would be increased ordecreased respectively. Second, we used these two models topredict the total number of expected dose changes for eachpatient throughout the study period. By comparing theexpected dose changes to observed dose changes over thecourse of our study, we were able to characterize each patientas having more or fewer dose changes than predicted by our model, and to characterize the extent of the deviation. Third, we used these observed minus expected (O )E) scores to characterize the warfarin dose management received byindividual patients and the dose management styles at the sitesof care in our database. These scores quantify the deviationfrom usual management in a given clinical situation, as denedby our models. We examined the relationship of these O )E scores to the stability of INR control, as measured by TTR. Fourth, we simulated the effect on TTR of several possible INR cutoffs for adjusting the warfarin dose, using the modelsthat we had developed. Each cutoff was associated with anexpected O )E score and an expected mean TTR for the entire cohort. Statistical analyses - details We examined the following predictors of warfarin dosechanges: INR at the current visit, INR at the previous visit,dose change at the previous visit, number of days since theprevious visit (0-7, 8-14 or 15+ days), and patient character- istics (age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, prior stroke, and congestive heart failure). Because ofthe need for at least two previous visits to calculate dosechanges at the previous visit, the rst two INR values for eachpatient were excluded from this and later predictive models. Weused separate logistic regressions to model dose increase anddose decrease, respectively. The dataset was split 60/40 forWarfarin dose management aects INR control 95 /C2112008 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasisderivation and validation of the models, respectively. Model performance was assessed by the c-statistic for discrimination and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for calibration. Multipleselection procedures were tried to achieve models with the bestpossible t, including using all of the variables together, bestsubset selection, backward and forward selection, and sequen-tial trials of adding variables that had strong effects in bivariate analysis. The total probability of a dose change at each visit was the sum of the predicted probability of a dose increase and of adose decrease, with a maximum combined probability of100%. We subtracted the total number of expected dosechanges for each patient from the observed number of dosechanges; we divided by the number of visits for that patient.Each patient received an O )E score, with a score of 0 indicating that the observed and expected dose changes were the same, negative scores indicating fewer dose changes thanexpected, and positive scores indicating more dose changesthan expected. Each unit of 0.1 indicates either one more or onefewer dose change than expected per 10 visits. The O )Es c o r e largely examines decision-making in marginal situations, whenclinicians might reasonably make either choice (i.e. to changethe dose or refrain from doing so). An example of a marginal situation might be an INR of 3.1, which is only slightly out of range. An INR of 5.0, by comparison, would prompt mostclinicians to reduce the dose. We described the distribution of O )E scores among patients and of mean O )E scores among sites of care. We compared O )E scores to TTR on the patient level and the site level. For patient-level analyses, we used generalized estimatingequations, to account for the intraclass correlation of patient outcomes among sites of care. We have previously shown, using this database, that gender, race, coronary artery diseaseand congestive heart failure predict TTR on a patient level [21];we therefore controlled for these variables in our patient-levelanalyses. For site-level analyses, we used correlation, linearregression, and analysis of variance. We also compared actualmanagement during the study to the management that wouldhave occurred using various INR cutoffs for adjusting the warfarin dose. We computed the O )E score that would have resulted from each of these cutoffs, as well as the predictedTTR for each cutoff. We derived and validated our modelsusing SAS, Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and performed other analyses using the R statistical package,version 2.2 (R Foundation, 2007). Results There were 6761 patients in the entire database; after exclusions for INR target range and patients new to warfarin, 4248patients remained, with a total of 67 199 INR values. Weexcluded 1206 INR values, due to proximity to an interruptionof therapy, and 8408 INR values because they were among the rst two values for a patient, leaving a total of 58 791 INR values for analysis. An additional 650 INRs that were morethan 56 days from the previous INR measurement wereexcluded because of difculty in computing TTR, leaving 58 141 INR values. Finally, after t hese maneuvers, 287 patients had fewer than three INR values and were excluded fromanalysis; 3961 patients remained. Characteristics of the 3961patients in our database appear in Table 1. Their mean age was 71.9 years, and 42% were female. Atrial brillation was the most common indication for anticoagulation (62%); valvularheart disease was relatively uncommon, due to the requirementfor an INR target range of 2-3. The mean TTR was 68.4%. The dose of warfarin was decreased at 14.4% of visits, increased at 16.4% of visits, and remained the same at 69.3%of visits. Both dose decreases and dose increases were bestpredicted by three-variable models (Appendix A); different selection procedures gave the same result. Dose decrease was best predicted by a model containing INR at the current visit,number of days since the previous visit, and dose increase at theprevious visit ( c-statistic = 0.90). Dose increase was best predicted by a model containing INR at the current visit,number of days since the previous visit, and dose decrease atthe previous visit ( c-statistic = 0.88). In both models, the INR value was by far the most important predictor. For both models, a shorter follow-up interval predicted a higherTable 1 Demographics, clinical characteristics, warfarin management and International Normalized Ratio (IN R) control for patients in the study (n= 3961) ParameterNumber (%) or mean (SD) Mean age (SD) 71.9 (11.1) Female gender (%) 1678 (42%)Race/ethnicity (%) White 3673 (93%) Black 101 (2%) All other indications combined 399 (10%) (%) Coronary artery disease 969 Mean number of INR values* (SD) 14.6 (7.8) Mean interval between INR tests*, days (SD) 22.1 (6.2)Mean total months in database* (SD) 15.2 (5.6)Mean weekly warfarin dose*, mg (SD) 30.6 (13.4) Mean number of interruptions of warfarin* (SD)0.068 (0.25) Percentage time in therapeutic INR range (TTR)* IQR, interquartile these calculations, we excluded the rst two INR measurements for each patient, because of the need for twoprior visits in our prediction models.96A.

Rose et al /C2112008 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasislikelihood of a dose change, and a dose change in one direction at the previous visit was predictive of a dose change in the opposite direction at the current visit. Other variables were notmeaningful predictors of dose changes, including age, gender,race, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and priorstroke. The mean O )E score for the 3961 patients was )0.006 (SD 0.13); O )E scores were approximately normally distrib- uted. Fifty-seven per cent of patients had an O )Es c o r e between )0.1 and 0.1 (i.e. within one dose change of predicted per 10 visits), and 88% had an O )Es c o r eb e t w e e n )0.2 and 0.2. Using a cubic smoothing spline function [24], we tted acurve to describe the relationship between O )Es c o r e sa n d TTR on the patient level (Fig. 1). In general, extremes ofO)E score were associated with lower TTR than O )E scores closer to zero. The maximum of the tted curve occurs atan O )Es c o r eo f )0.083, or approximately one fewer dose change than predicted per 12 visits. To further evaluate the relationship between the O )E score and TTR, we divided patients into three groups based on their O )E scores: group A (considerably fewer dose changes than predicted),group C (considerably more dose changes than predicted), andgroup B (all others). Group B, the group whose managementconformed most closely to the norm, had the highest TTR inboth unadjusted and adjusted analyses, a statistically signicant result (Table 2). We also simulated the possible impact of four INR cutoffs for change of the warfarin dose. The rst strategy would be toadjust the warfarin dose whenever the INR is 1.9 or lower/3.1or higher. This strategy, applied to our database, would haveyielded a mean O )E score of 0.071 and a mean predictedTTR of 67% (see Fig. 1). The second strategy would be to adjust the dose whenever the INR is 1.8 or lower/3.2 or higher;this would have yielded a mean O )E score of 0.003 and a mean TTR of 69%. The third strategy would be to adjust the dose whenever the INR is 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher; this would have yielded a mean O )Es c o r eo f )0.064 and a mean predicted TTR of 74%. The fourth strategy would be to adjustthe dose whenever the INR is 1.6 or lower/3.4 or higher; thiswould have yielded a mean O )Es c o r eo f )0 . 1 1 5a n dam e a n predicted TTR of 71%. According to this simulation, theaverage management in this study was extremely similar to thesecond strategy (change dose when the INR is 1.8 or lower/3.2 or higher), whereas the management strategy expected to produce the highest TTR would be extremely similar to thethird strategy (change dose when the INR is 1.7 or lower/3.3 orhigher). We calculated mean O )E scores for the sites of care represented in the database. It was not possible to calculate amean O )E score for seven of the 101 sites, because these sites had only one or zero patients who met our inclusion criteria. Among the other 94 sites, there was a wide range of practice (Appendix B): 17 sites had a mean O )Es c o r eb e l o w )0.1, whereas eight sites had a mean O )E score above 0.1. Extremes of practice in this regard were not solely contributedby sites with few patients, suggesting that we observed truedifferences in practice rather than merely statistical variation.For example, the three sites with the highest average O )E scores had relatively large patient panels of 57, 40, and 124 patients each. To explore the possible impact of this site-level variation in management, we divided sites into deciles based on their meanabsolute value O )E scores and plotted the deciles against mean site TTR (Fig. 2). There was a strong negative correla-tion between mean absolute O )E score and mean TTR (r=)0.77, P = 0.003), indicating that extremes of warfarin dose management were associated with worse INR control on t h es i t el e v e l . 0.75 0.70 0.65 0.60 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 Mean O-E score, by decileMean TTR Fig. 1.

We modeled norms of behavior regarding dose changesin certain clinical situations. Our models were able to predictclinical behavior with great accuracy using relatively fewvariables: the INR value at the current visit, the number of dayssince the previous visit, and whether or not the dose waschanged at the previous visit. We then used these models to describe variations in practice. T here was considerable varia- tion among patients and among sites of care regarding warfarindose management styles in clinically similar situations. Both onthe patient level and on the site level, a moderate tendency tochange the warfarin dose was associated with higher TTR thaneither extreme of management. The apparent impact of O )E score upon TTR in our study was considerable. For example,TTR at the peak of the O )E curve (Fig. 1) was 74%. By contrast, TTR at an O )E score of 0.2 was 64% and TTR at an O)Es c o r eo f )0.2 was 62%. By comparison, Poller et al. found that mean TTR in a group randomized to computerizeddose management was 63% vs. 53% among controls [16], asimilar effect size. Our simulation of four dosing strategies suggests that average management in this database was to change the dosewhen the INR was 1.8 or lower/3.2 or higher, whereas optimal management would be to change the dose when the INR was 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher. This relatively minor change inmanagement would be expected to increase TTR from 68% to74%. It should not be surprising that this apparently smalldifference in management would make such a large differencein INR control, because 15% of the dose increases in our studyoccurred at an INR of 1.8, and 7% of the dose decreases occurred at an INR of 3.2. Our results suggest that such dosechanges, which occurred when the INR was only slightlyoutside the target range, served merely to perturb the INR,setting up a cycle of adjustment and readjustment. It is likelythat the patient would have done better if the INR were simplyrechecked a week later, when many patients would have been found to be in-range once again, without any particular intervention. Our ndings actually echo those of an audit ofanticoagulation care by Rose, in which only 50% of patientswere found to be within 0.5 of a target INR of 2.5 at any giventime, whereas a full 80% of patients were within 0.75 of thetarget [25]. It appears to be incompatible with humanphysiology to expect patients to remain exclusively within anINR target range of 2.0-3.0; the target range that might be suggested by our results, namely 1.8-3.2, seems more attain- able. Citing this article by Rose as evidence that target rangesare impractical, the British Society of Haematology Guidelineson Oral Anticoagulation [26] suggest target INR values forvarious indications (e.g. 2.5), rather than specifying target INRranges (e.g. 2.0-3.0). An important strength of this study is that we used the O)E method to describe warfarin dose management. By modeling norms of management, and then documenting deviation from those norms, we were able to ensure that dosemanagement was being compared in similar situations. Inparticular, the variable regarding the follow-up interval ensuredthat our models captured not only the effect of the INR level,but also the clinician /C213sap r i o r i suspicion that the patient /C213s warfarin dose would need to be adjusted at the visit. Theinterval between visits is likely to reflect many unmeasured factors (comorbid conditions, medication changes, bleeding risk, and history of INR stability) that would enter intoclinician decision-making. T hese features of our predictive model strongly suggest that warfarin dose management was thecause of between-group differences in TTR rather than thereverse. In addition, the fact that TTR drops off on both sidesof the optimal O )E value makes it difcult to imagine a plausible mechanism for reverse causation. Finally, controlling for important covariates did not alter between-group compar- isons of TTR (Table 2), suggesting that differences in man-agement rather than patient charact eristics explained the effects that we observed. However, our study does have limitations. Our results were derived from analysis of a single dataset, albeit a large andnationally representative dataset. Conrmation of these nd-ings, using a different dataset, would provide an additional level of support. In addition, our study shares the limitations of any observational study, in that it cannot denitively establishcause and effect. Although our study may suggest an optimaldose management strategy in the absence of computerizeddecision support, denitive evidence would require prospective,randomized studies. We would urge that such a trial beundertaken as soon as possible, as our study suggests thatimproving the dosing of warfarin could meaningfully improve 0.680.66 decile0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 Fig. 2.

Rose et al /C2112008 International Society on Thrombosis and HaemostasisSecond, we did not examine pat ients with target INR ranges other than 2-3, and nor did we examine warfarin dosemanagement during the inception of therapy; our resultscannot be generalized to these situations. Finally, although wedid not consider the magnitude of dose changes, it should benoted that for the marginal situations that we modeled (e.g.INR of 1.8 or 3.2), a 5-10% adjustment of the weekly warfarin dose is likely to be the ideal choice. Larger dose changes would be reserved for more extreme deviations of INR from the targetrange, when the decision regarding whether to change the doseat all would be more obvious. In summary, we found that warfarin dose management varied widely in similar clinical situations. This variation inpractice had implications for INR control; extremes ofmanagement were associated with lower TTR than manage- ment closer to the mean. Our sim ulation suggests that, when the target range is 2.0-3.0, optimal management of warfarinwould be to change the warfarin dose only when the INR is1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher; a smaller tolerance for slightlyout-of-range values seems to destabilize the INR throughexcessive dose adjustments. Finally, our study suggests thatin addition to offering warfarin to as many optimalcandidates as possible, we also need to optimize warfarin dose management to fully realize the benets of anticoagu- lation.

Grant, MD, MPH; Lori E. Henault, MPH; Elaine M. Hylek, MD, MPH Background \u2014Low international normalized ratio (INR; /H113491.5) increases risk for thromboembolism. However, little is known about the epidemiology of low INR. Methods and Results \u2014We prospectively collected data from 47 community-based clinics located throughout the United States from 2000 to 2002. We examined risk factors for low INR ( /H113491.5), reasons given in the medical record for low INR, and proportion of thromboembolic events that occurred during periods of low INR. Of the 4489 patients in our database, 1540 (34%) had at least 1 low INR. Compared with men, women had an increased incidence of low INR(adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.44; P/H110210.001). Compared with patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation, patients anticoagulated for venous thromboembolism had an increased incidence of low INR (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.48; P/H110210.001). The 5 most common reasons for low INR were nonadherence (17%), interruptions for procedures (16%), recent dose reductions (15%), no reason apparent after questioning (15%), and second or greater consecutive low INR(13%). A total of 21.8% of thromboembolic events (95% CI, 12.2 to 35.4%) occurred during periods of low INR; 58%of these events were related to an interruption of warfarin therapy. Conclusions \u2014In this cohort of patients receiving warfarin, more than 1 in 5 thromboembolic events occurred during a period of low INR. Women and patients anticoagulated for venous thromboembolism were particularly likely to experience low INR. Improving adherence, minimizing interruptions of therapy, and addressing low INR more promptly could reduce the risk of low /H18546medication therapy management Warfarin is a highly effective therapy to prevent throm- boembolic of extremely challenging therapy inclinical practice 5; a recent meta-analysis found that patients spend an average of only 66% of time in the therapeutic rangewhen managed in specialized anticoagulation clinics, andonly 57% of time when managed in usual care. 6The large amount of time spent outside the target range has importantclinical consequences: patients with better control have fewerhemorrhagic and thromboembolic events. 7 Many studies have focused on the risk factors for and effects of high international normalized ratio (INR), andtherefore, we know a considerable amount about thesetopics. 8-21For example, Hylek et al12showed that decreased oral intake, and taking more warfarin thanprescribed. However, there has been considerably less research regarding low INR. Some studies have demonstrated that low INR is associated with attenuation of the protective effects ofanticoagulation therapy, as would be expected. 7,22-24 Although we know that low INR increases the risk of thromboembolism, relatively little is known about the epidemiology of low INR. We therefore used data from a large nationally represen- tative anticoagulation cohort to describe the epidemiology of low INR. We examined patient-level risk factors for INR /H113491.5, the threshold below which the risk of thromboembo- lism rises most acutely.22,23We report clinician-documented explanations for low INR, recorded at the time the INR result was obtained. We examine predictors of time until the nextINR and the next in-range INR. Finally, we estimate theproportion of thromboembolic events attributable to low INR. Low INR has been an understudied topic, and our study canserve as the beginning of an effort to understand, address, andreduce this phenomenon. Received March 5, 2009; accepted August 3, 2009.

Reducing its occurrence in clinical practice could improve patient outcomes. However, little is known about the epidemiology of low INR, especially which patients are more likely to experience it and what factors may contribute to it. WHAT THE STUDY ADDS In our study, the 5 most common reasons for low INR were nonadherence (17%), interruptions forprocedures (16%), recent dose reductions (15%), no reason apparent after questioning (15%), and second or greater consecutive low INR (13%). Low INR was more common among women and patients anticoagulated for venous thromboembo- lism, even after controlling for covariates. These novel findings require confirmation and further investigation. Our study identifies groups of patients who may be at higher risk for low INR and factors that seem to cause it. This can serve as the beginning of a concerted effort to reduce the incidence of low INR in clinical practice. Methods Study Enrollment Data collection for the Anticoagulation Consortium to Improve Outcomes Nationally (ACTION) study has been described else-where. 18,25-29 Physician practices that were registered users of CoumaCare software (Bristol-Myers Squibb) were invited to partic-ipate. CoumaCare was a freely available software package whichprovided a rudimentary electronic medical record for anticoagulationmanagement. The software assisted with record keeping and patienttracking, but did not provide advanced functions such as dosingguidance. The uniformity of data structure provided by the softwarepackage allowed us to collect data from diverse community-basedsites at a time when few such sites had any sort of electronic medicalrecord. In total, 174 practices registered online to participate, and 101 sites had the technological capability and the review board approvalnecessary to proceed. One of the functions of CoumaCare is to allowproviders to input a note regarding each INR value and how it was addressed. Data for the current study are drawn from the 47 study sites which had text notes for at least 90% of INR values. Excludedstudy sites had some text notes, but often only when the INR was outof range, precluding a full investigation of the reasons for low INRvalues. All sites had at least 1 dedicated provider managing warfarin, usually within the setting of a community-based physician grouppractice. Enrollment began in April 2000 and follow-up ended inMarch 2002. Missing data fields and data entry errors were resolveddirectly with the sites by the data coordinating center on a weeklybasis before the data were transmitted to study investigators. Thestudy protocol was approved by the Western Institutional ReviewBoard of Olympia, Wash, and by local review boards where theyexisted. Variables We identified all INR values /H113491.5 and reviewed anticoagulation clinic notes to determine the stated reason for the low value.Investigators developed 10 categories to encompass the reasons for low INR, and then assigned a reason to each value using chartreview. One of these 10 categories, \"initiation phase,\" was defined asall consecutive low INR values before the first in-range or high INRwas recorded. Another category, \"continuing low,\" was used for allsuccessive low INRs, regardless of the reason for the first in theseries, until the next in-range or high INR value. We characterized all patients regarding age, gender, race, indica- tion for anticoagulation, and comorbid conditions. In addition, werecorded instances when warfarin was intentionally interrupted (a\"hold\") by reviewing all 84 915 anticoagulation notes. The greatmajority of these holds were for minor procedures such as biopsiesor colonoscopies, whereas relatively few were for major surgery. For the purpose of this analysis, however, all holds were considered thesame. We confirmed all thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke,systemic embolus, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embo-lus) through chart review. Statistical Analyses We tabulated demographics (age, gender, and race) and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke, coronary arterydisease, congestive heart failure) and performed bivariate compari- sons between patients with at least 1 low INR versus those without. Because of correlated data within sites of care, we computedprobability values for bivariate comparisons using 10 000 MonteCarlo permutations (stratified on clinical site) of the indicator for atleast 1 low INR value. We modeled the rate of low INR per person-year using patient-level risk factors as independent predic-tors. Covariates included demographics, indication for therapy,comorbid conditions, and warfarin holds. For indication for therapy,the reference category was atrial fibrillation without prior stroke,chosen because it was the most numerous. Patients with valvularheart disease comprised another category of indication for therapy;most such patients had mechanical replacement valves (90%), but some had other conditions (such as mitral stenosis). We further divided patients with valvular heart disease into those with targetranges of 2 to 3 versus 2.5 to 3.5, with the hypothesis that those witha high target range would be protected from low INR. We used a Poisson regression model, fit with generalized estimating equations(SAS PROC GENMOD, SAS version 9.1, SAS Institute, Inc), toaccount for intraclass correlation by site of care. For this analysis, weexcluded low INR values attributable to the inception phase ofwarfarin therapy, when low INR is to be expected. Among patients who had at least 1 low INR, we computed the relative frequencies of the 10 reasons for low INR, which had beenassigned through chart review (see \"Variables\" above). We then usedCox regression to model the effect of these reasons on the time untilthe next INR and the next in-range INR, controlling for the same patient-level covariates described above. The patient's next in-rangeINR was identified using either a normal (2 to 3) or high (2.5 to 3.5)target INR range, corresponding to the target range stated in theclinical record. The reference category for these analyses was lowINR because of a previous dose reduction. Such patients might beexpected to have a relatively uniform risk for future INR instability,and to receive relatively uniform management. Our Cox modelsassumed separate baseline hazards by site of care, and our standarderrors accounted for the fact that some patients contributed multiplelow INR values (SAS PROC TPHREG). We used linear interpolation 30to divide all patient-time into 3 categories: days when the INR was /H113491.5, days when the INR was 1.5 to 2.0, and days when the INR was /H113502.0. For several patients, interpolation was not possible because the final INR determination occurred before a thromboembolic event; in such cases, we carriedthe last known INR value forward. We compared rates of thrombo-embolic events among these 3 categories of patient-time, using 1000bootstrap resamples of the major event INR values to calculate 95% CIs. Finally, we calculated the proportion of thromboembolic eventsoccurring during periods of low INR. Analyses were performedusing the R statistical package version 2.8 (R Foundation) and SASversion 9.1.

Most demographic and clinical parameters weresimilar between patients with and without low INR, with the exception of gender and holds. We examined risk factors for low INR using multivariable Poisson regression (Table 2).Women had an increased incidence of low INR (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.44; P/H110210.001).

P/H110210.001.Rose et al Epidemiology of Low INR 593 by on November 18, 2009 circoutcomes.ahajournals.org Downloaded from collectively accounted for three quarters of low INR values: nonadherence (17%), holds (16%), no reason apparent afterquestioning dose reductions attributable to high INR or bleeding (15%), and continuing low values (13%). The initiation phase of warfarin therapy (8%), dietary intake ofvitamin K (6%), and interactions with other medications (4%)accounted for most remaining low INR values. The frequen-cies of these reasons were not meaningfully different when compared by age group, gender, race, and indication fortherapy. We further examined the category of \"continuing low.\" The mean time between a continuing low value and thepreceding INR value was 8.1 days (SD, 5.6); the median was7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 10). The distribution of reasons for a low INR preceding a continuing low differed from the overall distribution of reasons for low INR values(Table 4). In particular, the most frequent reasons for the INRbefore a continuing low were another continuing low (22%),dose reductions (20%) and holds (20%). These 3 reasonswere much more common preceding a continuing low than inthe overall sample; other reasons were reduced accordingly. Care Provided to Address Low INR After a low INR, the median time until the next INR was 8 days (interquartile range, 7 to 14), and the median time untilthe next in-range INR was 16 days (interquartile range, 8 to 30). The next INR occurred sooner (Table 5) when the patientwas anticoagulated for valvular heart disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; P/H110210.001), but these patients did not record an in-range INR sooner than other patients (HR, 1.01; P/H110050.91). The next INR also occurred sooner during the initiation phase of warfarin therapy (HR, 1.93; P/H110210.001); an in-range INR was also recorded sooner for this category (HR, 1.33;P/H110210.001). Conversely, patients whose low INR values were attributed to nonadherence, dietary vitamin K, and no appar- ent reason waited longer for a repeat INR than the referencecategory (HR, 0.78, 0.77, and 0.80; P/H110210.05 for all). In general, with the exception of initiation-phase patients, dif-ferences in time until next INR test did not translate intodifferences in time until the next in-range INR. Impact of Low INR on Thromboembolic Events There were 55 major thromboembolic events during the study (Table 6), 12 of which occurred when the INR was /H113491.5, 9 of which when the INR was 1.5 to 2.0, and 34 when the INR was /H113502.0.

The crude IRR for the lowest INR category, compared with INR /H113502.0, was 16.3 (95% CI, 8.1 to 25.7), whereas the IRR for mildly low INR was only 1.59 (95% CI, 0.70 to 2.64). The fraction of thromboembolic events occurring with an INR value /H113491.5 was 21.8% (95% CI, 12.2% to 35.4%). However, anadditional 7 events occurred within 30 days of an INR /H113491.5, so the true fraction could be as high as 19/55, or 34.5% (95%CI, 22.6% to 48.7%). Although the relative rate of thromboembolism during periods of low INR was high, the absolute rate of thrombo-embolism per episode of low INR was quite low. There werea total of 3375 separate episodes of INR /H113491.5 in our database, considering continuing low values as part of a single episode. A thromboembolic event occurred during or within 30 daysafter the end of only 19 of these episodes (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3to 0.9%), whereas the majority of episodes (99.4%) did notresult in a thromboembolic event. Discussion We examined patient-level risk factors for low INR ( /H113491.5) using a large nationally-representative database of anticoag- ulation care. Low INR was not a rare event, occurring among 34% of our study population and accounting for 4.1% of INR values and 1.8% of patient-time. Low INR also had importantconsequences: there was an approximately 16-fold increase inthe rate of thromboembolism during periods of low INR. We found that the fraction of thromboembolic events occurring during periods of low INR was at least 21.8%, considerablyhigher than the estimate by van Walraven et al (11%). 24Our results suggest that reducing or eliminating low INR could improve patient outcomes considerably. Despite the impressive relative risk of a thromboembolic event during periods of low INR, the absolute risk of thromboembolism related to an episode of low INR was small(0.6%). Therefore, careful consideration should be given to balancing expected risks and benefits of interventions such as \"bridging\" with low-molecular-weight heparin, which is as-sociated with a significant risk of bleeding complications.Ongoing clinical trials may settle the issue of whether, and for which patients, the benefits of bridging outweighs the risks. 31 Until the results of such trials become available, our estimate of the absolute risk of thromboembolism related to an episodeof low INR may help to guide clinical decision-making. Regarding risk factors for low INR, warfarin holds pre- dicted more low INR values, whereas a high-target INR range predicted fewer. More novel and unexpected findings in-cluded increased incidence of low INR among patientsanticoagulated for VTE and among women. These findings,which persisted after controlling for age, comorbid condi- tions, and holds, are potentially important, but require con-firmation and further investigation. One possible explanationmight have been a difference in target INR ranges betweengroups; however, we compared target ranges by gender andby indication and did not find differences that could haveexplained our findings. If confirmed, our findings may beattributable to different physiological responses to warfarin indifferent groups of patients, or may reflect disparities inanticoagulation management. For example, it is possible thatclinicians fear the consequences of high INR more in femalepatients, which may affect dosing decisions. We also examined reasons given to explain low INR values in the clinical record. Although no single reason predomi-nated, the 4 most common reasons bear comment. Nonadher- ence was the most commonly cited reason for low INR. Theimpact of adherence on anticoagulation control has beendescribed by Kimmel et al. 32In that study, 36% of patients missed more than 20% of bottle openings as measured by electronic bottle caps (\"MEMS caps\"); these patients had an odds ratio of 2.10 for INR below the target range. In ourstudy, 17% of INR values /H113491.5 (a more serious deviation than merely below the target range) were attributed to adherence. We note that 15% of low INR values in our cohortcould not be explained\u2014it is possible that at least some ofthese were also attributable to inadequate adherence, whichthe patient did not recall or did not declare. The next most common reason for low INR was intentional interruptions of warfarin for procedures (\"holds\"). Our grouphas previously demonstrated that holds are associated withthe relatively poor anticoagulation control experienced bycancer patients. 28Although some holds may be necessary, our results suggest that avoiding holds whenever possible will reduce low INR. As an example of a situation in which a holdmay be avoided, dental procedures can often be performedwithout holds, 33,34but this may be inconsistently applied in clinical practice. The third most common reason for low INR was a recent dose reduction, most often in response to a previouslyrecorded high INR value. This seesaw effect, where patients bounce between excessive and insufficient anticoagulation,may be partly attributed to the well-known fact that warfarinis a difficult drug to manage in clinical practice. 5However, at least part of this erratic control may be associated with excessive \"tinkering\" with warfarin doses when the INR isclose to the target range. 27In another analysis of this database, our group has already shown that INR control couldbe improved by reserving dose changes for patients whoseTable 6. Rates of Thromboembolic Events in INR values determined by linear interpolation.Rose et al Epidemiology of Low INR 595 by on November 18, 2009 circoutcomes.ahajournals.org Downloaded from INR deviates from the target range by 0.3 or more in either direction.27 The fourth most common reason for low INR was a \"con- tinuing low.\" Recall that we defined \"low INR\" as /H113491.5\u2014a level of underanticoagulation clearly associated with patient harm.22-24 Nevertheless, we found that the median time until a next INR test was 8 days, and the median time until a nextin-range INR value was 16 days. These values themselves arenot alarming, but the 75th percentile for each (14 and 30days) indicate that for a considerable proportion of patients inour dataset, low INR was addressed without a particular senseof urgency. Indeed, we found that the most common reasonfor the INR preceding a continuing low was another continu-ing low. Current guidelines may reinforce a lack of urgency in addressing low INR values, because they contain limitedguidance about how to address low INR. For example, the2008 ACCP guidelines 5contain detailed instructions about how to deal with elevated INR, but limited informationregarding how to address low INR, beyond the recommen-dation that \"bridging\" with low-molecular-weight heparin isnot necessary for most patients. Although we agree thatlow-molecular-weight heparin is not warranted by the rela-tively low daily risk of thromboembolism in most patients, 35 it would be prudent to measure the INR weekly amongpatients with changes in clinical status or anticipated doseinstability, to prevent prolonged or extreme deviations fromthe target INR range. We recognize, however, that somepatients may not readily accept the burden of such frequenttesting. Our study has important strengths. This is the first system- atic investigation of low INR in community practice. We useda large, nationally-representative database of community-based anticoagulation care in the United States, ensuring thatour results are broadly generalizable. Finally, manual reviewof all 84 915 notes provided a level of clinical detail missingfrom many previous studies, which have used predominantly automated data. However, our study also has limitations. Wewere only able to ascertain the reason for low INR as statedby clinicians in the notes, but were unable to test the veracityof such claims. In addition, the reason for 15% of low valuescould not be determined by the clinician at the time of thevisit, despite questioning the patient. In conclusion, we used a nationally-representative database of community-based anticoagulation care to describe theepidemiology of low INR. In our study, low INR wasassociated with a 16-fold increase in the rate of thromboem-bolism. Despite this impressive relative risk, the absolute riskof thromboembolism per episode of low INR was only 0.6%per episode. Women and patients anticoagulated for VTEwere at elevated risk for low INR. Nonadherence, interrup-tions for procedures, and insufficient urgency in addressinglow INR all contribute to the incidence of low INR. Theincidence of low INR could be reduced by interventions toimprove adherence, minimize unnecessary interruptions oftherapy, and encourage clinicians to address low INR with anappropriate (but not excessive) sense of urgency.Sources of Funding This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the makers of Coumadin brand warfarin.

Russell, D.D.S.,1Ralph V. Katz, Background: Given the history of vulnerability of women of childbearing age to medical treatments that have caused injury, for example, diethylstilbestrol (DES) and thalidomide, it is surprising that, to date, little researchhas directly examined attitudes of the general public regarding the vulnerability of women when they partic-ipate in biomedical research studies.Methods: We asked three questions about beliefs of women as biomedical research subjects of 623 white, 353 black, and 157 Hispanic people in four U.S. cities: (1) Do you believe that women are more likely to be \"takenadvantage of\" when they become subjects in a medical research project as compared to men? (2) Do you be-lieve that women of childbearing age (15-45-year-olds) should become study participants in medical researchprojects? and, if the response was no or don't know/not sure, (3) Would you still say no or don't know/notsure to question 2 even if it meant that we would not know anything about the health and medical treatmentsfor women aged 15-45 years?Results: Overall, women were 60% more likely than men to state that women were more likely than men to be \"taken advantage of,\" even when controlling for potential confounders, and both black and Hispanic par-ticipants were much more likely than white participants to state that this was the case. The majority of re-spondents (57.4%) said that women of childbearing age should not be research subjects; among women, bothblack and Hispanic people were less likely than white people to change their minds when prompted that thismight mean that \"nothing would be known about the health and medical treatments for women aged 15-45years.\"Conclusions: A substantial proportion of the participants reported knowledge of historical events, and this knowledge was related, particularly in black participants, to attitudes toward vulnerability of women as bio-medical research subjects. 235Introduction IN LIGHT OF A HISTORY of unethical human experimentation in the United States (e.g., the Tuskegee Syphillis Study), it is not remarkable that much has been written about actualor perceived vulnerability of racial and ethnic minority re-search subjects. 1-6Given the history of vulnerability of women, specifically women of childbearing age, to medicaltreatments in the past that have caused injury not only tothem but to their children, for example, diethylstilbestrol(DES) 7and thalidomide,8it is surprising that, to date, littleresearch has directly examined attitudes of the general pub- lic about the vulnerability of women when they participatein biomedical research studies. Although investigations re-porting on inclusion of women in studies have documentedsex differences in clinical trial recruitment rates 9-12or have reported on reasons women decline to participate in clinicaltrials, 13-16there are no reports of beliefs and attitudes among the lay public regarding whether women, compared withmen, are more likely to be \"taken advantage of\" when theybecome subjects in biomedical research studies, whether thebenefits of including women of childbearing age outweigh 1New York University College of Dentistry, Epidemiology and Health Promotion, New York, New York. 2Department of Veterans Affairs and Center for Health Quality, Outcomes & Economic Research, Bedford, Massachusetts. 3H.

The purpose of this analysis was to examine (1) attitudes about women as subjects in biomedical research in a geo-graphically, sociodemographically, ethnically, and raciallydiverse group of adults, (2) whether beliefs about perceivedrisks to women when they participate in biomedical researchstudies vary by sex or by race/ethnicity, and (3) the rela-tionship of knowledge of two historical events (DES andthalidomide) to attitudes of whether women should partici-pate in biomedical research studies. Materials and Methods The Tuskegee Legacy Project (TLP) questionnaire, a sur- vey designed to examine reasons for lack of participation ofracial and ethnic minorities, was administered via random-digit dial (RDD) telephone interviews to participants aged/H1135018 years in four cities: Birmingham, Alabama; Tuskegee, Alabama; Hartford, Connecticut, and San Antonio, Texas.The TLP questionnaire, a 60-item instrument, primarily de-signed to address a range of issues related to the recruitmentof minorities into biomedical studies, also contains questionsrelated to inclusion of women in biomedical research. De-tails on the history and development of the TLP question-naire and justifications of the methodological decisions bothfor the selection of the four cities and for the analysis of theTLP questionnaire have been published elsewhere. 1,17This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards ofthe University of Connecticut Health Center and of NewYork University.The Survey Research Unit (SRU) of the University of Al- abama at Birmingham (UAB) administered the TLP ques-tionnaire via RDD telephone interview. The target popula-tion was noninstitutionalized persons aged /H1135018 years living in households with working telephones in the four targetedcities. The goal was to complete the 25-minute telephoneinterview with 900 adults in the following racial/ethnicgroups: (1) 300 black respondents (100 in Hartford, 100 inBirmingham, 100 in Tuskegee, AL), (2) 100 Puerto Rican His-panics (Hartford), (3) 100 Mexican Americans (San Antonio),and (4) 400 white adults (100 in Hartford, 100 in Birming-ham, 100 in Tuskegee, 100 in San Antonio). A simple ran-dom sample was drawn based on the three-digit telephoneexchange used for local calling areas within each city. SRUat UAB screened for nonworking and business numbers; un-resolved numbers were retired after 20 attempts. A total of13 interviewers were trained for the survey using computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) technology; these inter-viewers were supervised at all times and randomly elec-tronically monitored. Key variables from the TLP questionnaire Figure 1 shows the three questions from the TLP (the Women as Research Subjects questions, or WARS domain)that specifically explored attitudes about women's partici-pation in biomedical studies. These questions were aroundthe midpoint of the questionnaire (questions 34-36 of 60) di-rectly after questions that explored attitudes regarding racialand ethnic minorities' vulnerability as biomedical researchsubjects. The general concept of vulnerability of women asresearch subjects is introduced in the first question, and theRUSSELL ET AL. 236 FIG. 1. Questions that explored attitudes toward the vulnerability of women as participants in biomedical research; TLP questionnaire. second question specifically asks if women of childbearing age should be included in research studies. The third ques-tion is a probe for those who responded No or Not sure aboutwhether they think women of childbearing age should be in-cluded in research studies; that is, the interviewer informedthe respondent about the potential negative consequences ofa total lack of knowledge about women's health for womenof childbearing age that would inevitably result and inquiredif this consideration changed their mind. In addition, because we were also interested in determin- ing if knowledge of DES and thalidomide was related to re-sponses on the WARS domain questions, people were asked:Which of the following medical research studies have youheard about? Respondents answered either Yes, No, or don'tknow/not sure to a series of eight studies, one described asthe DES or Diethylstilbestrol Study and another as the Thalido-mide Study. For purposes of these analyses, we grouped thosewho stated No/don't know with those who responded No.We hypothesized that knowledge of DES and thalidomidewould vary by age, by sex, by racial/ethnic group, and by ed-ucation and income. Age was calculated using date of birth,and we classified education as either less than high schoolgraduate, high school graduate alone or with some college vs.college degree or greater. We categorized income as /H11021$20,000 a year, /H11350$20,000 but /H11021$75,000 a year vs. /H11350$75,000 a year. Statistical analysis For bivariate analyses, study participants were stratified by sex and by racial/ethnic category and compared regard-ing the WARS domain questions using Pearson chi-squareanalyses and ANOVA. The responses to the WARS domainquestions were collapsed for the purpose of bivariate andmultivariate analyses. We collapsed responses of question 1into two categories: Yes (all, most, and some of the time) vs.No (rarely and never). Questions 2 and 3 were also collapsedinto two categories for the purpose of bivariate and logisticregression analyses: Yes vs. No (no and don't know/notsure). We used logistic regression in order to control for po- tential confounders, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-cation, income, and city/county. We report adjusted oddsratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Characteristics of study participants The TLP questionnaire was administered to 1133 adults in Birmingham, Tuskegee, Hartford, and San Antonio, with re-sponse rates of 70%, 65%, 49%, and 50%, respectively. Thefinal study sample comprised 353 black (31.2%), 157 His-panic (15.9%), and 623 white respondents (55.0%), and 51.7%of respondents were women. Hispanics self-identified as ei-ther Puerto Rican (24.8%) or Mexican American (75.2%). Thedemographic characteristics of the participants are shown inTable 1. Hispanic participants were younger than black andwhite participants (ANOVA, p/H113490.001) and were more likely to be women than were white and black respondents (chi-Square 7.0, df2, p/H110050.03). White participants were more ed- ucated 80.7, df4, p/H113490.001) compared to black or Hispanic participants. Analysis of question 1: Do you believe that women in the United States are more likely to be \"taken advantage of\"when they become subjects in a medical research projectas compared to men? Overall, for the total respondent sample, a majority of per- sons (52.1%) stated that women, compared to men, weremore likely to be \"taken advantage of\" as research subjectseither always or most of the time (17.3%) or sometimes(34.8%) (Fig. 2). Overall, women were more likely to statethat this was the case always, most of the time, or sometimes(19.1% of women vs. 15.5% of men; chi-square 13.0. df2, p/H11005 0.002). Blacks were nearly 5 times more likely as whites andHispanics were nearly 3.5 times more likely as whites to stateBELIEFS OF WOMEN'S RISK AS RESEARCH SUBJECTS 237 TABLE 1.

When we examined differences by sex within each racial/ethnic category we found that among both whiteand black respondents, women were more likely than mento state that women as research subjects are more likely\"taken advantage of\" (whites: df2, p/H110050.024). Among His- panics, however, men and women did not significantly dif-fer in their responses (62.0% of women vs. 61.7% of men, chi-square 0.30, df2, p/H110050.88). When controlling for differences in age, income, and race/ethnicity between the sexes, the odds of believing thatwomen are more likely to be \"taken advantage of\" when they become subjects in a medical research study was 60% higherfor women compared with men (OR adjusted /H110051.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.1). When controlling for differences in age, income, educa-tion, and geographic location between racial/ethnic groupsamong women only, we found that the odds of believing thatwomen compared to men are more likely to be \"taken ad-vantage of\" when they become subjects in a medical researchproject were four times higher in black women (OR adjusted /H11005 3.9, 95% CI 2.5, 6.2) and two times higher in Hispanic women(OR adjusted /H110051.9, 95% CI 1.2, 3.1) compared to white women. For men, the odds of believing that women compared to menare more likely to be \"taken advantage of\" when they be-come subjects in a medical research project were also higherRUSSELL ET AL. 238 FIG. 2.

When we examined responses to question 1 by sex within each race/ethnic group, we found that for white and blackparticipants, women were more likely to believe that womenwould be \"taken advantage of\" when they become subjectsin a medical research project compared to men (controllingfor differences in sex in income level for whites and in agefor Blacks) whites: OR adjusted /H110051.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.4; blacks: OR adjusted /H110051.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.0). For Hispanics, the odds of believing that women were more likely compared to men tobe \"taken advantage of\" when they become subjects in amedical research project did not vary by sex in logistic re-gression analyses. Analysis of question 2: Do you believe that women of childbearing age (15-45-year-olds) should become studyparticipants in medical research projects? Overall, 45.0% of the respondents said that women of childbearing age should not be research subjects, and an ad-ditional 12.4% were unsure whether they should be researchsubjects (Fig. 3). In order to test for differences by sex andby race/ethnicity when controlling for differences betweengroups, we grouped those who stated Don't know/not surewith those who stated No. We found no differences in thedistribution of responses to question 2 between men andwomen, or between white, black, and Hispanic respondentsin the overall sample in either bivariate or multivariate analy-ses, controlling for differences in age, geographic location,income, and education between the sexes (for women, com-pared to men, the OR adjusted /H110051.1, 95% CI 0.8, 1.4) and con-trolling for differences in sex, age, and income between the racial/ethnic groups (for blacks, compared to whites, theOR adjusted /H110051.0, 95% CI 0.8, 1.4; for Hispanics, compared to whites, the OR adjusted /H110051.2, 95% CI 0.8, 1.9). In addition, when we examined responses to question 2 within each sexgroup, we found that for both men and for women, therewas no significant difference by race/ethnicity (black womenvs. white women, OR adjusted /H110051.1, 95% CI 0.7, 1.5; Hispanic women vs. white women, OR adjusted /H110050.9, 95% CI 0.5, 1.7; black men vs. white men, OR adjusted /H110051.2, 95% CI 0.7, 1.8; Hispanic men vs. white men, OR adjusted /H110051.4, 95% CI 0.6, 3.1). We also failed to find differences in responses by sexwithin each racial/ethnic group (white men vs. whitewomen, OR adjusted /H110051.2, 95% CI 0.8, 1.8; black men vs. black women, OR adjusted /H110050.8, 95% CI 0.7, 1.1; Hispanic men vs. Hispanic women, OR adjusted /H110050.5, 95% CI 0.3, 1.1). Analysis of question 3 (includes only those who stated No or don't know/not sure to question 2, n /H11005659): Would you still say No or Don't know/not sure that women ofchildbearing age should not be subjects in medicalresearch studies, even if it meant that we would not knowanything about the health and medical treatments forwomen aged 15-45 years? Less than half of those who stated No or Don't know/not sure to question 2 (39.0%) changed their minds when re-minded of the resulting negative consequences for knowl-edge about women's health that would result from barringwomen from clinical research (Fig. 4). The odds of chang-ing one's mind did not vary by sex (OR adjusted /H110051.4 for women vs. men, 95% CI 1.0, 2.1), although the difference be-tween the sexes overall did approach statistical significanceBELIEFS OF WOMEN'S RISK AS RESEARCH SUBJECTS 239 FIG. 4. Response to question 3: Percentage, by race/ethnicity and gender, who would still say No or Don't know/not sure whether women of childbearing age should become research subjects, even if it meant knowing nothing about thehealth and medical treatments for women aged 14-45 ( n/H11005659). (p/H110050.06). We found that both black women and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to change theirminds when reminded of the negative consequences forwomen's health (blacks, OR adjusted /H110050.5, 95% CI 0.3, 1.0; Hispanics, OR adjusted /H110050.5, 95% CI 0.3, 1.0, both compared to whites), whereas among men, we found no difference inthe proportion of those who changed their minds (OR adjusted for blacks 0.6, 95% CI 0.3, 1.1; OR adjusted for Hispanics, 1.0, 95% CI 0.4, 2.8). Bivariate analysis of knowledge of historical events (knowledge of either thalidomide or DES) anddemographic characteristics of participants Of the total study sample, 12.0% of participants reported having heard of DES, and 22.7% reported having heard ofthalidomide. Knowledge of neither thalidomide nor DESwas related to sex. Black participants were less likely thanwhite participants to report knowledge of thalidomide(33.4% of whites vs. 10.8% of blacks; chi-square 61.32, df1, p/H113490.001), but there was no difference between blacks and whites regarding knowledge of DES (14.7% of whites vs.12.1% of blacks; chi-square 1.25, df1, p/H110050.26). Hispanics were less likely than whites to report knowledge of thalido-mide (33.4% of whites vs. 7.7% of Hispanics; chi-square DES) was related to age, with 30.7% of thoseage 50 /H11001reporting knowledge of 43.57, df1, p/H113490.001). Knowledge of both thalidomide and DES was clearly related to both ed-ucation and to income. Of those with \"some college,\" 44.1%reported knowledge of thalidomide and 23.4% reportedknowledge of DES. In contrast, of those with a high schooleducation or less, only 14.7% knew of thalidomide (chi-square 51.23, 110.56, df1, p/H113490.001). Of those with family incomes /H11350$35,000 per year, 33.3% reported knowledge of thalido- mide and 16.4% reported knowledge of DES vs. 14.4% and9.2%, respectfully, of those with incomes /H11349$34,000 per dif- ferences in knowledge of thalidomide, with more respon-dents in Hartford (49.8%) than in Birmingham (13.2%),Tuskegee (16.3%), df3, p/H113490.001). Geo- location to knowledge of DES (chi-square 2.15, df1, p/H110050.54). Analysis of relationship between DES and thalidomide and responses to the WARS domain questions Results of the adjusted analysis of the relationship be- tween knowledge of DES and thalidomide and responses tothe WARS domain questions are shown in Table 2. Overall,knowledge of DES, but not of thalidomide, was indepen-dently, albeit moderately, increased in those who believedthat women were more likely, compared to men, to be \"takenadvantage of\" when controlling for potential confounders(sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and geographic lo-cation), with those who stated that women, compared tomen, are likely Always, Most of the time, or Sometimes tobe taken advantage 60% more likely to report knowledge of DES (OR adjusted /H110051.58, 95% CI 1.02, 1.93) compared to those who responded Never or Rarely. Knowledge of DES, but not of thalidomide, was also in- dependently related to whether one thought that women ofchildbearing age should participate in biomedical researchas participants (question 2), with those who stated thatwomen of childbearing age should not participate in bio-medical research as participants less likely to report knowl-edge of DES (OR adjusted /H110050.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.86). On further examination, we found that the relationship between statingthat women of childbearing age should not participate in bio-medical research as participants and being less likely to re-port knowledge of DES was evident only among black par-ticipants (OR adjusted /H110050.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.86) (OR adjusted /H110050.51, 95% CI 0.30, 0.87). In fact, we also found that blacks who stated that women of childbearingage should not participate in biomedical research as partic-ipants were also less likely to report knowledge of thalido-mide (OR adjusted /H110050.36, 95% CI 0.17, 0.76). Responses to question 3, whether one changed one's mind about women of childbearing age participating in biomedicalresearch, given the consequences, were not related to knowl-edge of DES (OR adjusted /H110050.91, 95% CI 0.77, 1.73) overall. However, this is likely due to the difference in directionality of responseseen between men and women. Although the differenceswithin the sexes were not statistically significant (perhaps be-cause of reduced sample size), we found that among men,those who changed their minds from No or Not sure to Yes,women of childbearing age should be research subjects, giventhe negative consequences for women's health, were about twotimes more likely to report knowledge of DES and of thalido-mide; among women, those who changed their minds were60% less likely to report knowledge of DES and were 40% lesslikely to report knowledge of thalidomide. Discussion In the late 1970s, largely because of the recognition of the deleterious effects of two medications (thalidomide andDES) taken by thousands of pregnant women on both them-selves and their fetuses, the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) prohibited women of childbearing age from partici-pating in clinical research as research subjects. 18Within 10 years from their expulsion from clinical research, however,it was recognized by the U.S. Public Health Service TaskForce on Women's Health that the subsequent fallout fromwomen's exclusion from research was that women's healthhad been compromised because of lack of knowledge aboutwomen's health and treatment of diseases in women. 19It soon become apparent, for example, that certain diseases(e.g., cardiovascular disease) presented or behaved differ-ently in women than in men and that drug metabolism mightvary by sex, for example, with important side effects moreprevalent in women than in men. 20Despite this legislation, several reports have shown that in some cases, especially inthe case of racial/ethnic minorities, women still may be un-derrepresented in biomedical research. 10,21,22 We examined beliefs and attitudes regarding vulnerabil- ity of women when they participate in biomedical researchstudies. Specifically, we examined whether people believedRUSSELL ET AL. 240 TABLE 2.

We found that a substantial proportion\u2014roughly half\u2014of participants in this RDD survey thoughtthat women, compared to men, were more likely to be \"takenadvantage of\" as research subjects and that most respondents(67%) were either against or unsure if women of childbear-ing age should participate as research subjects. When the in-terviewer informed these respondents about the potentialnegative consequences of a total lack of knowledge aboutwomen's health for women of childbearing age that wouldinevitably result, fewer than half (39%) of respondentschanged their minds about participation of women of child-bearing age. Clearly, it is likely that this reluctance on thepart of the general public to recognize the importance of in-clusion of women in research studies could be one of the bar-riers in achieving the goals of the NIH mandate 23and the le- gal obligation that all federally funded studies includewomen unless there is a clear reason to exclude them. 24 Those who stated that women were more likely to be taken advantage of were more likely to be either black or Hispanic.It has been widely reported that African Americans and otherminority groups are more reluctant than white people to par-ticipate in biomedical research because of a history of researchabuses against black people in this country. 4,25,26Although it is understandable that racial/ethnic minorities might bemore suspicious of potential research abuses against womenof childbearing age (a group whom many might view as es-pecially vulnerable to exploitation or more likely to receivespecial protection due to their childbearing potential and thepotential dangers to a developing fetus), it remains to be es-tablished whether knowledge of research abuses translatesinto hesitance or refusal to participate in biomedical research.Indeed, several investigations have found no difference be-tween racial/ethnic minorities and white people in willing-ness to participate in biomedical research, 1,27and other in- vestigators have found that racial/ethnic differences inbiomedical research participation can be accounted for by dif-ferences in socioeconomic status. 28,29When we controlled for differences in socioeconomic status among the three racial/ethnic groups, however, the profound differences we foundby race/ethnicity persisted: the odds of believing that womenare more likely to be \"taken advantage of\" when they becomesubjects in a medical research project were almost 4 times ashigh for black respondents and 2.5 times as high for Hispanicrespondents, compared to whites respondents. Women were more likely than men to believe that women were more likely to be \"taken advantage of\" than men asparticipants in biomedical studies. Given the power imbal-ance by gender that exists in the United States, it is not sur-prising that most women would be more suspicious of re-search abuses on women than would men. We found thisattitudinal difference by sex, however, only among whiteand black people, but not among Hispanics. Despite the factthat Hispanics are now the nation's largest ethnic minoritygroup, comprising 14% of the nation's total population, andthe fact that higher rates of certain prevalent diseases, for ex-ample, diabetes, are found in Hispanics, data on recruitmentof Hispanic women in biomedical research are sparse. 9,10,30 Further research should determine if the NIH RevitalizationAct, which, since 1993 has required federally funded stud-ies to include women of childbearing potential unless there was clear justification for exclusion, has caused a substantialchange in recruitment of women, especially those who areracial and ethnic minorities. We found that a substantial proportion of the participants reported knowledge of historical events that have caused in utero or subsequent medical harm to the children of preg- nant women who took thalidomide or DES during preg-nancy and that knowledge of DES, in particular, was morecommon in those who stated that women were more likelyto be \"taken advantage of\" and to beliefs of whether womenof childbearing age should participate in biomedical researchstudies. Interestingly, those who stated that women are morelikely than men to be \"taken advantage of\" were more likelyto report knowledge of DES, although on further analysis,we found that this was the case only among white partici-pants. Those who stated that women of childbearing ageshould not participate in biomedical research were actuallyless likely to report knowledge of DES. We found this rela-tionship, however, only in men and only in black respon-dents, for whom, in particular, knowledge of either his-torical event was independently, inversely, and strongly re-lated (thalidomide: OR adjusted /H110050.36, 95% CI adjusted /H110050.32 95% CI 0.16, 0.63); that is, those who stated that women of childbearing age should not participate in bio-medical research as participants were, as was the case of theoverall analysis, less likely to report knowledge of thalido-mide or DES. One explanation for the directionality of therelationship between knowledge of DES and stating thatwomen should be participants is that persons who knew ofthe DES study were aware of details, including the lack oftesting performed on DES and the recognition that it was thelack of appropriate testing and use of this drug that causedsubsequent harm. This finding supports the view that blackpeople might be more sensitive than white people to issuessurrounding clinical research in the United States. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to doc- ument high levels of wariness and differences in attitudes, bysex and by race/ethnicity, regarding women's participation inbiomedical research in a large, racially/ethnically diversegroup of American adults and to examine if knowledge of pasthistorical events that caused in harm to offspring influencesthese beliefs. Although level of education has been found tobe a predictor of participation in biomedical research, 15 further investigation into the relationship of race/ethnicity (and otherdemographic factors), beliefs, and attitudes toward biomedicalresearch, and willingness to participate in clinical studies isclearly warranted. Also, studies that examine the relationshipamong sex, race/ethnicity, and participation should includemeasures of socioeconomic status in their analysis, as differ-ences in socioeconomic status between the sexes and betweenthe various racial and ethnic groups in the United States tendto be profound. Cultural differences and gender differences(i.e., beliefs and attitudes that vary between men and womenas a result of the roles they play in society) should also be ad-dressed. 13Indeed, studies have found recruitment strategies to be more successful when they are culturally appropriate anddirected toward a particular subgroup of the population, forexample, high-risk persons. 31 In 1994, the Institute of Medicine, at the request of the NIH, issued a report on Women in Health Research, in which theyexplained that their report was focused on \"justice,\" that is,that \"women and men should have the opportunity to par-RUSSELL ET AL. 242 ticipate equally in the benefits and burdens of research.\"32 Although one should bear in mind the principal arguments to support the NIH policy of increased representation ofwomen (first, to increase generalizability and to allow forvalid analyses of differences by sex, and, second, becauseparticipation in biomedical research is often seen as advan-tageous to participants), our findings are parallel to those ofothers, who have suggested that more needs to be under-stood about whether both men and women, perhaps espe-cially those who are racial/ethnic minorities, find these ar-guments compelling. 33 Disclosure Statement The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.

Objective: Studies of alcohol brief intervention for medical inpatients have mixed results. We explored potential modera- tors of the effectiveness of brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use among medical inpatients. Method: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of brief motivational counseling among 341 urban-hospital medical inpatients (99 women) with unhealthy alcohol use. Self-reported main outcomes were receipt of alcohol treatment by 3 months in subjects with dependence and change in the mean number of drinks per day 3 and 12 months after enrollment in all subjects. Re-sults: Among subjects with dependence, the effect of brief intervention on receipt of alcohol treatment differed signi cantly by gender and age (p = .02 for each interaction). In strati ed analyses, brief intervention was associated with receipt of alcohol treatment in women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.9, 95% con dence interval [CI]: 1.2-12.7), 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3-10.1). Among subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use, brief intervention was signi cantly associated with fewer drinks per day and better physical health-related quality of life at 3 months. However, among those with dependence, intervention was associated with worse physical health-re-lated quality of life and more hospital use, and no changes in drinking. In adjusted analyses among those with and without dependence, brief intervention was not associated with mental health-related quality of life, alcohol problems, or readiness to change. Effects of brief intervention on consumption outcomes were not consistently moderated by demographic characteristics, comorbidity/health, or readiness to change. Conclusions: Some medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use, particularly women, younger adults, and patients without dependence may bene t from brief intervention. Few factors that were expected to moderate brief interven-tion effects did so. Additional research should assess which medical inpatients, if any, can bene t from brief intervention. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 426-435, 2009) PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS RECOMMEND screening and brief intervention for all adults with un- healthy alcohol use (i.e., the spectrum from drinking risky amounts through dependence; Institute of Medicine, 1990; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2004). Brief interven-tion, however, has proven ef cacy in decreasing alcohol con-sumption and related consequences only in outpatients with unhealthy, but not dependent, alcohol use (Wilk et al., 1997). Further, the results from studies of the ef cacy of brief intervention among other populations, such as hospitalized patients, are unclear and sometimes negative, as reported in several large randomized trials (Emmen et al., 2004; Freyer-Adam et al., 2008; Saitz et al., 2007). Many factors may moderate the ef cacy of brief inter-vention. Y ounger adult women and patients with an alco-hol-attributable diagnosis (e.g., alcoholic hepatitis) might bene t more than others from intervention (Blow et al., 2006; Weisner et al., 2001). Race and ethnicity may affect receipt of alcohol-treatment services (Schmidt et al., 2007), and cognitive impairment may lower adherence to alcohol treatment (Bates et al., 2006). In an emergency department brief intervention, stage of change and self-ef cacy did not appear to moderate brief intervention effects on consump-tion, whereas the patient' s attribution of injury to alcohol did moderate these effects (Walton et al., 2008). Similarly and perhaps surprisingly, in another study (with a pre-/post- Received: January 24, 2008.

SAITZ ET AL. 427 design) the presence or absence of dependence did not ap- pear to affect changes in drinking after brief intervention (Guth et al., 2008). However, many hospital studies that support the use of brief intervention exclude patients with characteristics that may decrease the intervention' s effective-ness (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity, other drug use), despite the fact that these patients represent the population identi- ed by alcohol screening (Chick et al., 1985; Heather et al., 1996; McManus et al., 2003). In the few inpatient studies on brief intervention that have included the broad spectrum of patients with unhealthy alcohol use, results generally have been negative (Saitz et al., 2007; Watson, 1999). Therefore, it is likely that brief intervention has ef cacy only in certain people and settings. Despite this limited ef cacy, large and well-funded federal efforts are underway to implement brief intervention for all patients with unhealthy alcohol (and drug) use (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2007). In addition, few studies have examined moderators of brief intervention ef cacy, and none (to our knowledge) have done so in hospitalized patients. Therefore, to help clarify the effects of brief inter-vention among medical inpatients and to study moderators of these effects, we explored data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial involving a broad spectrum of patients with unhealthy alcohol use that did not support the ef cacy of brief intervention in the study group overall. We examined whether demographic factors, alcohol use severity (dependence), health/comorbidity, and readiness to change moderated the intervention' s effects on receipt of treatment, alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, readiness to change, health-related quality of life, and health care use. Method Subjects As described previously (Saitz et al., 2007), we enrolled 341 adult subjects (99 women) from the medicine service of a large, urban teaching hospital. Eligibility criteria included current (past-month) drinking of risky amounts (de ned for eligibility as >14 standard drinks per week or 5 drinks per occasion for men; >11 drinks per week or 4 drinks per oc- casion for women and people age 66 years); 2 contacts to assist with follow-up; no plans of moving from the area in the next year; and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21 or more (Folstein et al., 1975; Smith et al., 2006). Eligible subjects who enrolled in the clinical trial provided written informed consent. The Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Center approved this study. Assessments Research associates interviewed subjects before random- ization to assess the characteristics listed in Table 1. One co-author (R.S.) reviewed medical records to determine current primary and alcohol-attributable medical diagnoses (Adams et al., 1993). At 3 and 12 months, research associates reas-sessed, via interview, most domains covered at enrollment. Randomization and intervention Subjects were randomized to the control or intervention group. Control subjects received usual care (i.e., they were told their screening results and advised they could discuss their alcohol use with their physicians). Intervention subjects were assigned to 30 minutes of brief motivational counseling that was based on the principles of motivational interviewing (Miller and Rollnick, 1991, 2002; Miller et al., 1995a). Ses-sions were conducted by counseling and clinical psychology doctoral students whom we trained and included feedback, an open discussion (lasting about 20 minutes), and construc-tion of a change plan (Saitz et al., 2007). Outcomes and measurements The primary outcomes in this study were self-reported receipt of alcohol treatment in the past 3 months among sub-jects with alcohol dependence and change in the mean num-ber of drinks per day from enrollment to 3 and 12 months in subjects with and without dependence. We measured receipt of treatment with a standardized interview based on the Treatment Services Review (McLellan et al., 1992a) and Form 90 (Miller, 1996). Treatment included residential treatment, outpatient treatment (e.g., counseling or therapy), medications, employee-assistance programs, or mutual-help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous). We measured past-30-day consumption with the Timeline Followback method (Sobell and Sobell, 1992). From this, we determined mean drinks per day, days abstinent, and heavy drinking episodes (5 drinks per occasion for men and 4 for women and people age 66 years). We also assessed the proportions of subjects who abstained for all 30 days, had at least one heavy drinking episode, and drank risky amounts (>14 drinks per week or 5 drinks per occasion for men; >7 drinks per week or 4 drinks per occasion for women and people age 66 years). Additional secondary outcomes included alcohol problems (total score on the Short Inventory of Problems; Miller et al., 1995b), readiness to change (Taking Steps scale of the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale [SOCRATES]; Miller and Tonigan, 1996), physi- cal and mental health-related quality of life (physical and mental component summary scale scores on the Short-Form Health Survey [SF-12]; Ware et al., 1998), and emergency-department visits and days of medical hospitalization (both determined by a standardized interview based on the Treat-ment Services Review and Form 90; McLellan et al., 1992a; Miller, 1996).428 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MA Y 2009 TABLE 1.

Reported p values are two-tailed, and a p value less than .05 was considered statistically signi cant. We analyzed data with SAS/STAT software Versions 8.2 and 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To describe the study sample and compare groups, we used the chi-square test, Fisher' s exact test, two-sample t test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test, as ap-propriate. We analyzed dichotomous outcomes using the chi-square test and logistic regression models, continuous outcomes using the two-sample t test and linear regres-sion models, and counts (i.e., drinking and health care use) using Poisson models that accounted for overdispersion. We planned, a priori, to assess possible moderators of the intervention, including demographic factors (gender, race, age [<44 and 44 years], homelessness [ 1 night in the past 3 months]), comorbidity/health (mental health-related quality of life [<45 and 45 on the mental component sum- mary scale of the SF-12], any alcohol-attributable medical diagnosis at current admission, any past-30-day heroin or cocaine use), and readiness to change (<30 or 30 on the SOCRATES Taking Steps scale). Post hoc, we decided to include cognitive functioning (<27 and 27 on the Mini- Mental State Examination) among the comorbidity/health factors. Within dependence strata, we tested for these pos-sible moderators. When moderators were signi cant, we reported strati ed analyses. Regression analyses strati ed only by dependence controlled for clinically important base-line imbalances between the treatment arms; analyses with further strati cations adjusted for the baseline value of the outcome only. Results Screening and enrollment data have been described else-where (Saitz et al., 2006, 2007). In summary, 341 patients of 986 who screened positive for drinking risky amounts enrolled in the randomized trial (Figure 1). Of enrolled sub-jects, 172 were randomized to the intervention group and 169 to the control group. Over 12 months, 11 subjects died; 90% (308) of all enrolled subjects completed at least one follow-up interview. Subjects who completed any follow-up were generally similar to those lost to follow-up. Subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use in the control group were similar to those in the intervention group with the exception of mental health-related quality of life, which was signi cantly higher in the intervention group (Table 1). Among subjects with dependence, those in the control group were signi cantly more likely than those in the intervention group to be women; controls were less likely to have received alcohol treatment, detoxi cation, or halfway house services in the past 3 months and to have any alcohol-attributable diagnosis, a family history of alcoholism, and substantial depressive symptoms. Alcohol treatment (subjects with dependence only) In the main study ndings previously reported by Saitz et al. (2007), brief intervention was associated with receipt of alcohol treatment, but the association was not signi cant and it was attenuated in adjusted analyses (Table 2). In analyses adjusted for potential confounders and simultaneously for interactions that were signi cant (p .10) in unadjusted analyses, interactions between the intervention and gender and age remained signi cant (both p = .02). In subsequent strati ed analyses, brief intervention was associated with in-creased receipt of alcohol treatment by women and younger men (<44 years) in unadjusted models (Table 2). In adjusted analyses, the results remained statistically signi cant for women but not for younger men. Of note, older men with dependence were signi cantly more likely than younger men with dependence to be white (46% vs 30%), live alone (47% vs 27%), be unemployed (69% vs 53%), and have worse physical health-related quality of life (mean SF-12 physical component summary score, 36 vs 40) but were signi cantly less likely to have substantial symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (39% vs 58%). Because women, regardless of age, appeared to bene t most from the brief intervention, we explored other pos-sible gender effects. We detected an interaction between the intervention and alcohol-attributable medical diagnosis among women (p = .006) but not men. Of women with any alcohol-attributable medical diagnosis, those in the interven-tion group were more likely than those in the control group to receive treatment (Table 2). Among women with higher cognitive function, receipt of treatment was more likely among subjects in the intervention group than in the control convulsion, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal hallucinosis, other alcoholic psychosis, alcoholic amnestic syndrome, other alcoholic dementia, alcoholic pancreatitis, or other diagnoses thought to be alcohol-attributable by the investigator (e.g., holiday heart, alcoholic ketoacidosis, alcohol-related rhabdomyolysis) (Adams et al., 1993); cdetermined by a validated questionnaire (Katz et al., 1996); ddetermined by the Family History-Research Diagnostic Criteria (Andreasen et al., 1977); n = 38 for controls with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use; ebased on a response of \"yes, every day in the past 30 days\" to the question: \"Do you currently smoke?\" (Patrick et al., 1994); fdetermined by the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan et al., 1992b); gdetermined by the Ad- diction Severity Index and includes use of heroin, methadone, other opiates/analgesics, barbiturates, sedatives/hypnotics/tranquilizers, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana/cannabis, or hallucinogens; hdetermined by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire (Spitzer et al., 1994); i16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (Boyd et al., 1982; Radloff, 1977); j44 on the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (Blanchard et al., 1996); kdetermined by adapted items from the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire-Revised (Kubany et al., 2000); lincludes alcohol treatment, except for medications, plus hospitalization for detoxi cation (any type); participation in any detoxi cation program; or halfway house services.TABLE 1 Notes Continued430 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MA Y 2009 FIGURE 1.

We found no signi cant interactions between the intervention and race, mental health-related quality of life, homelessness, heroin or cocaine use, or readiness to change among women or men. Findings of the analyses adjusted for prior alcohol treatment were similar (Table 2). Alcohol consumption At 3 and 12 months in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses, across the six outcome measures (Table 3) for those with and without dependence, only one comparison was signi cant: In adjusted analyses, among subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use at 3 months, the in-tervention group drank less than controls (adjusted means 1.5 vs 3.8 drinks per day, incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.38, p = .02). At 12 months among subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use, 19% were abstinent, 67% had at least one heavy drinking episode, and 67% were drinking risky amounts. For subjects with dependence, the proportions were 31%, 61%, and 61%, respectively.432 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MA Y 2009 To identify possible reasons why we failed to nd the hypothesized intervention effects on consumption outcomes, we examined 12-month data and found no signi cant interac-tions between the intervention and possible moderators (de-mographics, comorbidity/health, or readiness to change) on abstinent days or heavy episodic drinking. For drinks per day, we identi ed only two interactions, age ( p = .01) and heroin or cocaine use ( p = .03), among subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use. Among younger (<44 years) but not older subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use, the intervention decreased drinks per day (adjusted mean drinks 0.6 vs 2.7, IRR = 0.24, p = .004). In strati ed analyses, inter- vention effects appeared larger among drug users compared with nonusers (adjusted mean drinks 0.8 vs 4.9, IRR = 0.17 for drug users [p = .17]; and adjusted mean drinks 1.6 vs 1.9, IRR = 0.85 for nonusers [p = .64]). However, effects were not signi cant in either subgroup. The intervention effect ap-peared to be stronger for those who used heroin or cocaine. Readiness to change, quality of life, health care use, and alcohol problems At 3 months among subjects with nondependent, un- healthy alcohol use, intervention subjects had better physical health-related quality of life (adjusted mean SF-12 physical component summary scores 43 vs 38, adjusted mean differ-ence 5, p = .03), but among subjects with dependence, in-tervention was associated with worse physical health-related TABLE 3.

Physical component summary scores did not differ by intervention group at 12 months. Aside from an improvement in mental health-related quality of life in unadjusted analyses among nondependent intervention subjects at 12 months (mean SF-12 mental component summary scores 51 vs 43, unadjusted mean difference 8, p = .02), mental component summary scores did not differ by intervention group in unadjusted or adjusted analyses at 3 or 12 months. In adjusted and unadjusted analyses strati ed by the presence or absence of dependence, intervention was not signi cantly associated with alcohol problems or readiness to change. Aside from a greater number of days hospitalized in adjusted analyses (12.3 vs 5.0 days, IRR = 2.47, p = .01) and greater emer-gency-department visits in unadjusted analyses (1.5 vs 1.0 visits, IRR = 1.55, p = .03) at 3 months, health care use among dependent intervention subjects did not differ by intervention group in unadjusted or adjusted analyses at 3 or 12 months. Discussion We assessed brief intervention effects and the possible moderating effects of various demographic and health char-acteristics among patients with the spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use who were identi ed by screening on a hospital medicine service. As such, our study is unique. In this study, SAITZ ET AL. 433 the brief motivational intervention had both hypothesized and unanticipated effects. The intervention increased receipt of treatment in women and may be bene cial in younger men but not older men with alcohol dependence. An alcohol-at-tributable medical diagnosis and higher cognitive functioning moderated the effects of the intervention in women; these women in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to receive treatment. Of note, poorer mental health, homelessness, other drug use, and readiness to change did not impact the effects of brief intervention on receipt of treatment. Contrary to our hypothesis, brief intervention had little effect on alcohol consumption. Both intervention and con-trol groups had lower consumption at follow-up than at study entry. Factors other than, or in addition to, the brief intervention may have played a role in decreasing consump-tion, including subjects' medical illnesses, hospitalization and related services, natural history, regression to the mean, and a detailed research assessment of alcohol use that may have motivated change. Among subjects with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use, one adjusted comparison was signi -cant\u2014brief intervention was associated with less consump-tion (drinks/day) at 3 months. In subgroup analyses, the effect of brief intervention on consumption was limited to younger people, and appeared to be larger among those who used drugs (an unexpected nding). Homelessness, mental health-related quality of life, cognitive impairment, and readiness to change did not appear to moderate the effects of brief intervention on drinking. However, the sample sizes of the subgroups were small and thus were likely underpowered to detect interactions. Brief intervention may also have led to improved physi-cal and perhaps mental health-related quality of life among those with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use. But we also found unexpected possible detrimental effects of brief inter-vention among dependent subjects on physical health-related quality of life and hospital and emergency-department use. Although unexpected, these potential adverse effects of brief intervention should not be ignored in future studies because we should not expect all brief intervention effects to be favorable. Intervention did not signi cantly affect the other nonconsumption outcomes we assessed. Studies of the ef cacy of brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in hospitalized patients have produced mixed results. In a systematic review of controlled studies of inpa-tients on hospital services, brief intervention was associated with decreased alcohol-related problems but not changes in consumption (Emmen et al., 2004). Among studies speci c to medical inpatients, results are also confl icting\u2014some support brief intervention, and others do not (Chick et al., 1985; Freyer-Adam et al., 2008; Kuchipudi et al., 1990; Saitz et al., 2007). Studies of inpatients who are hospitalized on nonmedical services (e.g., trauma, orthopedic surgery), however, have more consistently demonstrated the ef cacy of brief intervention for decreasing alcohol consumption (Antti-Poika et al., 1988; Blondell et al., 2001; Elvy et al., 1988; Gentilello et al., 1999) and increasing alcohol-treat-ment entry and mutual-help group use (Antti-Poika et al., 1988; Blondell et al., 2001; Dunn and Ries, 1997; Elvy et al., 1988). Several limitations should be considered when interpret-ing these results. First, this is a secondary data analysis as-sessing multiple associations; the results should be viewed only as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than con rmatory (Lagakos, 2006). Second, the sample size pre-cluded adjustment for all confounding factors in subgroup analyses and also limited the detection of both moderators and intervention effects in subgroups, particularly in women and subjects without dependence. Despite these limitations, this study suggests that although universal screening and brief intervention on a medicine service may not be effective across a wide spectrum of patients, certain groups may ben-e t from such efforts. Brief intervention shows promise for (1) increasing receipt of treatment among alcohol-dependent women (particularly those with higher cognitive functioning or an alcohol-attributable diagnosis) and younger men, and (2) decreasing consumption among those with nondependent, unhealthy alcohol use. But in this setting, brief intervention' s effects on a wide range of clinically important outcomes were not robust (regardless of dependence status). Still, there is some reason for optimism given that factors hypothesized to impede the success of brief intervention (e.g., poorer mental health, drug use, homelessness) do not appear to be responsible for the lack of overall effects on consumption. The evidence from controlled trials in primary care set-tings is clear: Brief intervention for patients with nonde-pendent, unhealthy alcohol use identi ed by screening has modest ef cacy for decreasing consumption. Evidence from studies in other populations, however, remains confl icting. Regardless, screening and brief intervention programs for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use are being disseminated worldwide (e.g., by large federal efforts in the United States and by the World Health Organization) in diverse medical settings in which patients may differ greatly in circumstance and severity from those deemed most likely, according to the best evidence, to bene t from brief intervention. As such, attention should return to issues of ef cacy as well as to effectiveness. Further, it should be clear that the targets of screening and brief intervention\u2014unhealthy alcohol and other drug use\u2014are not monolithic and amenable to single, simple solutions. Therefore, research should begin to ad-dress when, for whom, and under what circumstances these procedures are and are not effective (O'Connor, 2007), and clinical implementation efforts should consider these com-plexities as dissemination of screening and brief intervention programs proceeds.434 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MA Y 2009 Acknowledgment We are grateful for the data management efforts of Alison Pedley at DM-STAT, Malden, MA.

BACKGROUND An integrated approach to assess ventricular pump function, myocontractility (end-systolic pressure-volume (end-diastolic pressure- volume relation [EDPVR]) is of high clinical value. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is well established for measuring global pump function, and catheterization-combined CMR was previously shown to accurately measure ESPVR, but not yet the EDPVR. METHODS In 8 pigs, the CMR technique was compared with conductance catheter methods (gold standard) for measuring the EDPVR in the left and right ventricle. Measurements were performed at rest and during dobutamine administration. For CMR, the ESPVR was estimated with a single-beat approach by synchronizing invasive ventricular pressures with cine CMR-derived ventricular volumes. The EDPVR was determined during pre-load reduction from additional volume data that were obtained from real-time velocity-encoded CMR pulmonary/aortic blood flow measurements. Pre-load reduction was achieved by transient balloon occlusion of the inferior vena cava. The stiffness coefcient /H9252was calculated by an exponential t from the EDPVR. After validation in the animal experiments, the EDPVR was assessed in a pilot study of 3 patients with a single ventricle using identical CMR and conductance catheter techniques. RESULTS Bland-Altman tests showed good agreement between conductance catheter-derived and CMR-derived EDPVR. In both ventricles of the pigs, dobutamine enhanced myocontractility (p /H110210.01), increased stroke volume (p /H110210.01), and improved diastolic function. The latter was evidenced by shorter early relaxation (p /H110210.05), a downward shift of the EDPVR, and a decreased stiffness coefcient /H9252(p/H11021 0.05). In contrast, in the patients, early relaxation was inconspicuous but the EDPVR shifted left-upward and the stiffness constant remained unchanged. The observed changes in diastolic function were not signicantly different when measured with conductance catheter and CMR. CONCLUSIONS This novel CMR method provides differential information about diastolic function in conjunction with parameters of systolic contractility and global pump function.

DOI:10.1016/j.jcmg.2009.09.007Heart failure is a common cause of mortality and death. In pathophysiology, different forms of systolic and diastolic heart failure can be dened (1-3). In many patients, combined forms of systolic and diastolic dysfunc- tion coexist and are difcult to differentiate. Sub- stantiated knowledge about the predominant form of heart failure is essential for optimizing treat- ments. Thus, an integrated approach for evaluating systolic contractility in conjunction with diastolic relaxation and compliance would be of high clinical value. See page 1282 Recent innovations in imaging provided a variety of new methods for the noninvasive assessment of cardiac function. These methods allow determination of stress-strain relation or inflow proles of the ventricles, for exam- ple. However, many of these parameters are pre-load-dependent and/or afterload- dependent or only reflect regional myocar- dial function. Therefore, analysis of pres- sure-volume relations is still regarded as the most reliable way to obtain load indepen- dent parameters of contractility and diastolic compliance (1,2). Advances in fast imaging techniques made diagnostic cardiac magnetic reso- nance (CMR) catheterization a realistic option (4-8 ). It was shown to provide accurate estimates of the end-systolic pres- sure-volume relationship (ESPVR) by derived of systolic contractile function (6,8). In the current study, we propose a novel CMR approach that combines real-time-derived ventric- ular volumes with invasively ventricular end-diastolic pres- sure-volume relationship (EDPVR). The rel- atively load-independent fashion and showed prac- tical importance for the assessment of patients with diastolic dysfunction (1,2,9,10). The aim of this experimental study was to develop a CMR method for assessment of the EDPVR and to validate this method in the pig right and left ventricle using conductance cathe- ter techniques as a gold standard reference. Sub- sequently, the applicability of this method in aclinical context was evaluated in a pilot study involving patients with a single ventricle after Fontan operation. In these patients, diastolic dysfunction has been reported by several investi- gators (11,12). METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Animal experiments. The animal experiments were authorized by the responsible animal care authori- ties. The validation study was conducted in 8 pigs (31/H110065 kg). The animals were pre-medicated with CMR and conductance catheter measurements were performed at end ex- piratory breath-hold and during muscle relaxation with 0.01 mg/kg vecuronium bromide intrave- nously. After completion of measurements, animals were euthanized. The timeline and brief description of the proto- col are shown in Figure 1. Right and left ventricular pressure-volume relations were rst assessed by conductance catheter (gold standard). Thereafter, the animals were transferred to the neighboring CMR laboratory. All measurements were per- formed at rest and repeated during continuous infusion of dobutamine at 10 /H9262g/kg/min with at least a 10-min interval between inotropic stimula- tion and repeated measurements at rest. Measured parameters. Parameters of ventricular global, myocontractile, and diastolic function were obtained using conductance catheter and/or CMR techniques. GLOBAL PUMP FUNCTION (BY CINE is composed of MYOCONTRACTILE FUNCTION (BY CONDUCTANCE AND CMR CATHETERIZATION). The slope of the ESPVR (Emax) was dened as a measure of con- tractility and was derived from the pressure-volume loops as determined with conductance catheter and CMR techniques. The Emax was indexed to 100 mg myocardial muscle mass (Emax,i). DIASTOLIC FUNCTION (BY CONDUCTANCE AND CMR From pressure ments, we derived /H9270as a parameter of early diastolic relaxation.

Concept of CMR-derived EDPVR. Because of its inher- ent nonlinearity, the assessment of the EDPVR ideally requires pressure-volume data acquired at multiple loading conditions. Therefore, ventricular loading was gradually altered by vena cava balloon occlusion. Beat-to-beat alteration in volume load and pressure were measured simultaneously with real-time CMR and liquid-lled catheters. The concept for measuring EDPVR using CMR- catheterization is based on working steps that are shown in Figures 2 to4. STEP A: CINE CMR. Biventricular phasic absolute volumes cycles with multislice-multiphase cine CMR. During CMR, ventricular pressures were averaged, and synchronized with the cine CMR derived volumes to construct a baselinepressure-volume loop under steady-state condi- tions. Synchronization of pressures and volumes was achieved by a trigger signal (Fig. 2, left). The ESPVR was estimated from the baseline loop using a single-beat approach as previously described (7,13). STEP B: REAL-TIME CMR. Instantaneous blood flows were measured using real-time velocity- encoded cine (VEC) CMR in the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta. Recording of ventricular pres- sures was started with the beginning of CMR and synchronized with the flow using the trigger signal. At steady state and in the absence of atrioventric- ular valve insufciency, effective right or left ven- tricular stroke volumes are considered being equiv- alent to the effective antegrade pulmonary or aortic blood flow volumes. Therefore, ventricular chamber volumes can be computed by subtracting the effec- tive stroke volumes from the end-diastolic volume of the cine CMR measurements (marked baseline EDPV in Fig. 3). After 3 to 4 heartbeats, pre-load was lowered by transient balloon occlusion of the vena cava. Importantly, for these unloaded beats Figure 1. Time Line of the Study The animals were rst assessed at rest and during dobutamine administration using a conductance catheter technique. Then they were moved to the neighboring CMR laboratory and investigated again at rest and during dobutamine application. The gure shows the posi- tion of the catheters in the left and right ventricle and the inferior vena cava. The CMR was performed using a cine CMR method in the axial plane (shaded box in A) and by VEC CMR measurements in the aorta and the pulmonary truncus IMAGING, VOL. 2, NO. 11, 2009 NOVEMBER 2009:1271-81Schmitt et al. Integrated Myocardial Function Analysis by CMR1273ventricular lling is unknown, thus the absolute volume (horizontal position of the pressure-volume loop) is undetermined. Initially, end-diastolic vol- umes of all unloaded loops were arbitrarily arranged to show diminishment in stroke volume. STEP C: POST-PROCESSING. To calibrate the abso- lute volume of the flow-derived real-time pressure- volume loops, we matched the end-systolic volume of each unloaded beat with the ESPVR volume intercept at the measured corresponding end- systolic pressure. The resulting end-diastolic pres- sure-volume points were used to determine the EDPVR and to calculate /H9252.Conductance catheter. The conductance catheter study was performed using a Leycom signal proces- sor (CD-Leycom, Zoetermeer, 7-F dual-eld catheters (Millar, Hous- ton, Texas). Catheter tips were positioned in the left or right ventricular apex, and measurements were performed during transient pre-load reduction by vena cava balloon occlusion using a 36-mm sizing balloon inflated with isotonic saline solution (AGA Medical, Plymouth, Minnesota). Parallel conductance was determined by the saline dilution method (14). The calibration factor alpha was calculated from CMR-derived stroke volumes. Figure 2. Baseline Pressure-Volume Loop at Steady-State Condition The baseline loop (right) was constructed by synchronizing ventricular pressures with cine CMR-derived absolute volume data. The ESPVR was estimated from a single-beat approach. Pmax was calculated by a sinus wave extrapolation of the ventricular pressure curve. Further details are provided 1. Figure 3.

CMR ACQUISITION OF VEN- TRICULAR PRESSURES AND VISUALIZATION OF CATHETERS. After completion of conductance catheter measurements, catheters were replaced un- der X-ray angiography by 4-F fluid-lled pigtail diagnostic catheters (Cordis, Warren, New Jersey). The balloon catheter for vena cava occlusions was kept unchanged in the inferior vena cava. The pressure catheters were connected to a pressure transducer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) amplied, recorded, and analyzed with Ponemah software (all DSI, St. Paul, Minnesota). Initial pressure recordings were obtained in the catheter laboratory. Thereafter the animals were moved to the CMR laboratory, where steady state hemodynamic conditions were conrmed. In the CMR laboratory, an additional pressure transducer was placed together with the animal within the bore. Radiofrequency pulses induced pressure signal artifacts on this transducer at the beginning of each VEC CMR measurement. These artifacts were used as a trigger signal for synchronizing measured pressures with acquired volume and flow signals (Figs. 2 and 3). Correct catheter position during CMR was conrmed on interactive real-time CMR as previously described (15). Ventricular volumes and myocardial mass. All CMR studies were performed on a 1.5-T scanner (release 2.6.1, Philips Intera, Best, the Netherlands). Ven-tricular chamber volumes and myocardial mass were determined from a stack of multislice-multiphase steady-state free-precession cine CMRs covering the were: repetition time/echo time 3.4/1.7 ms, slice thick- ness 6 mm, no gap, in-plane resolution 1.9 /H110031.3 mm, 45 phases per cardiac cycle, number of aver- ages 1, sensitivity encoding reduction factor 2. Analysis was performed using View Forum software (Release 6.1, Philips). Biventricular endocardial and epicardial borders were manually traced for com- puting ventricular volumes and myocardial mass where the septum was accounted left ventricular. Papillary muscles and prominent right ventricular trabeculation were excluded for volume measure- ments. Stroke volume was calculated as the differ- ence between the diastolic and systolic volumes. Ejection fraction was calculated as the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volumes. Pulmonary and aortic blood flow. Quantitative blood flow was measured using real-time VEC CMR (17) orthogonal to the dominating flow direction in the pulmonary trunk and the ascend- ing aorta. For the measurements, we corrected for potential phase errors arising from the concomi- tant magnetic eld. Sequence parameters were: repetition time/echo time 23/6.5 ms, matrix 128 /H11003256, eld of view 400 mm, slice thickness 8 mm, encoding velocity 150 cm/s, sensitivity en- coding reduction factor 3, half-scan factor 0.6, echo planar imaging factor 41.

Stepwise Arrangement of Baseline and Real-Time Pressure-Volume Loops for Assessment of EDPVR The horizontal position of the real-time pressure-volume loops (lower left and Fig. 3) was calibrated by matching the end-systolic pres- sure-volume points with the ESPVR determined from the baseline pressure-volume loop (upper left and Fig. 2). The ESPVs of each beat were shifted to match to the intercept of the ESPVR at the corresponding pressure (middle). The EDPVR was determined by an exponen- tial t through the resulting EDPVs (right).

Integrated Myocardial Function Analysis by CMR1275tion of 1 phase-contrast image, thus an average of 15 acquisitions per heartbeat depending on heart rate. Data analysis was performed with View Forum software. Antegrade and retrograde flows were measured as described elsewhere (18). For validation purposes, we compared left and right ventricular stroke volumes at baseline (without pre-load reduction) as measured with cine CMR and real-time VEC CMR each at rest and during dobutamine administration. Clinical pilot study. The clinical study was per- formed in 3 patients with total cavopulmonary connection (Fontan). The patients were referred to our institution for cardiac catheterization and CMR because of decreasing exercise capacity and there- fore to determine ventricular systolic and diastolic function and cardiovascular anatomy. After cathe- terization, the conscious patients were transferred to the CMR laboratory. Measurements were per- formed during breath-hold at end expiration. All gave informed consent for the study, which was approved by the responsible institutional review committee (reference number 47/04). Except for minor variation in size of the catheters, the conduc- tance and CMR procedures were performed exactly as described in the animal experiments. Statistical analysis. Agreements between conduc- tance catheter- and CMR-derived /H9252were be- tween conductance catheter- and CMR-derived parameters as well as measurements at rest and during dobutamine administration were analyzedwith a paired Student ttest and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons where appro- priate. Data are expressed as mean /H11006SD. RESULTS Validation study. COMPARISON OF CINE CMR AND VEC CMR STROKE VOLUMES. The data are shown in Table 1. At rest and during dobutamine adminis- tration, there was no signicant difference conductance catheter-derived diastolic compliance. Sequential conductance catheter and CMR measurements were realized at similar hemodynamic conditions, evidenced by the fact that right and left ventricular pressures as well as heart rates were not signicantly different be- tween the 2 experimental stages (Table 2). The hemodynamic responses to dobutamine also were similar (Table 2). The Bland-Altman test showed good agreement between /H9252values determined with the 2 methods at rest and during dobutamine administration (Fig. 5). Importantly, conductance catheter-derived and CMR-derived pressure-volume loops showed par- allel changes for measurements of /H9252at rest and during stress (Table 2, Fig. 6). The relative changes of Emax,i were also at similar levels (Table 2). Response to dobutamine. GLOBAL PUMP FUNCTION (BASED ON CINE CMR). As expected, in response to dobutamine, the right and left ventricle showed a signicant increase in stroke volume and cardiac output (p /H110210.01) (Table 1). MYOCONTRACTILITY (BASED ON CONDUCTANCE /H110210.01). The response to dobut- amine was more pronounced in the left compared with the right ventricle (Table 2). The noted changes of Emax,i were similar for the conductance catheter and CMR measurements (Table 2). DIASTOLIC FUNCTION (BASED ON CONDUCTANCE AND CMR CATHETERIZATION). Active early relax- ation, as indicated by smaller /H9270, improved signicantly during dobutamine administration in both ventricles (p/H110210.01) (Table 1). In addition, in all animals and both ventricles, the EDPVR shifted toward the bottom right of the pressure-volume diagram ( Fig. 6). There was also a slight but signicant decrease of /H9252(p/H110210.05) (Table 2, Fig. 5). The noted changes were again similar for the conductance catheter and CMR measurements.Table 1.

In contrast, the EDPVR shifted toward the left in the pressure-volume diagram and /H9252remained nearly unchanged (Table 3, Figs. 6 and7). Similar observations were made with conductance catheter and CMR tech- niques (Fig. 6). DISCUSSION We developed and validated a novel method for estimating the EDPVR, an index of ventricular cham- ber stiffness, by combining invasive pressure measure- ments with noninvasive real-time CMR volume and flow data. Our results indicate that the proposed method is suited to determine left and right ventric- ular chamber stiffness in conjunction with parameters of contractility and global pump function. Technical consideration. The ESPVR and EDPVR are widely used in physiological studies because they reflect intrinsic systolic and diastolic myocardial function in a relatively load-independent fashion. Clinical application is still limited, mainly because of technical difculties in performing the required measurements. The proposed CMR method might potentially expand clinical application because it is technically straightforward, and once the small and user-friendly catheters are in place, a complete set of right and left ventricular pressure-volume acqui- sitions can be obtained in /H1102110 min. Ideally, ESPVR and the EDPVR are determined from a family of pressure-volume loops during tran- sient pre-load reduction (9,10). Previously, methods introduced to estimate the ESPVR by single-00.01MRI CCPig LV Pig Dobutamine0.020.030.04 MRI Patient 1-3CC Patient 1-3 Figure 6.

Integrated Myocardial Function Analysis by CMR1278beat approaches (7,8,13,19). However, similar simpli- ed approaches to estimate the EDPVR are compli- cated by its inherent nonlinearity. Therefore, load interventions, which are commonly performed by balloon occlusion of the vena cava, are needed for determining proles of ventricular chamber stiffness. The conductance catheterization is an established method for measuring ventricular pressure-volume relations in animal experiments and human studies. However, by theory it requires a symmetrically shaped ventricle, and derived volumes need calibration with volumes obtained by a valid reference method, such as CMR (20). Consequently, conductance measure- ments in the nonsymmetrically shaped right ventricle or in a variety of congenitally malformed hearts can be problematic. Particularly these patients often need a differential analysis of ventricular systolic and diastolic function to determine optimal treatments. To date, CMR is considered the gold standard in terms of accuracy and reproducibility for quantica- tion of ventricular volumes (4,5). As mentioned, this measurement accuracy is crucial for the assessment of pressure-volume relations, particularly in asymmetri- cally shaped ventricles. Measurement errors by cali- brating issues or by geometric assumptions are avoided (14,21). Similar to the conductance catheter, theCMR method proposed in this study requires invasive measurement of pressures. The fluid-lled CMR catheters used were, however, substantially smaller in size (4-F vs. 7-F) and easily positionable. To avoid susceptibility artifacts or radiofrequency pulse-induced heating during CMR, the application of metallic high-delity pressure-tipped catheters was excluded, and consequently materials without metallic compo- nents were used (15). A potential down side of fluid-lled catheters is the attenuation of pressure amplitudes. To minimize this effect, we limited the total length of the catheter and the connecting pres- sure line to /H110211m . In the current study, we determined the ESPVR using a single-beat approach as previously reported (7,8,13,19). This approach implies that ventricular volumes are measured by cine CMR over several beats and are synchronized with pressures averaged for the same time period. To minimize beat-to-beat variabil- ity, keep the hemodynamic condition and state of ventilation at identical levels during data acquisition. Physiologic aspects. In the animal study, during dobutamine administration, diastolic function im- proved by faster early relaxation in conjunction with a slight bottom-right shift of the EDPVR.

The EDPVRs are shown more detailed (right). Note the left shift of the relation in the patient as opposed to the right-bottom shift in the pig's right and left ventricle during dobutamine administration. Abbreviations as in Figure 1.JACC: CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING, VOL. 2, NO. 11, 2009 NOVEMBER 2009:1271-81Schmitt et al. Integrated Myocardial Function Analysis by CMR1279noted a decrease of /H9252. In contrast, in the patients, the EDPVR shifted during dobutamine adminis- tration toward the upper left in the pressure-volume diagram. Early relaxation improved slightly, and /H9252 did not change substantially. Several reasons can account for the noted abnor- mal diastolic function in Fontan patients. The single ventricle, no matter of left/right type, is mostly of abnormal geometric shape with a direct impact on the mechanical properties of the ventricle and thus on systolic and diastolic function ( 12). Moreover, a recent pathohistological study showed abnormal myoarchitecture of the connective tissue matrix (23). During infancy these ventricles are exposed to prolonged cyanosis and volume load, which may induce brosis and thus have an impact on diastolic stiffness (24). Accordance exists that the EDPVR reflects chamber capacity and compliance. Similar to the ESPVR, this relation is influenced by ventricular conguration, including size, and heart rate. There- fore, the impact of volume and heart rate changes during dobutamine administration must be consid- ered when interpreting these data. The tendency toward a smaller /H9252in the animal study and an invariable /H9252in the patients was, however, also noted when /H9252was indexed to ventricular chamber size (Tables 2 and3). In our study, parameters of contractility and chamber stiffness were measured with conductance catheter and CMR techniques nonsimultaneously. As mentioned earlier, alteration in volume load and heart rate, which can be induced among other factors by prolonged sedation, may have an impact on the ESPVR and EDPVR. We were able to keep baseline hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate, stable with changes of /H1102110% between the sequential measurements (Table 2). We recom- mend measuring the EDPVR with the proposed CMR catheterization technique at heart rates of no more than 150 beats/min. This is for purely phys- iological reasons and for allowing reasonable tem- poral resolution in the real-time CMR flow mea- surements. The development of faster real-time CMR applications should be subject to future research. Normalization of contractile and stiffness indexes may be required when comparing different study populations. Concerning the diastolic /H9252, Burkhoff et al. (9) suggested the use of a dimensionless index by multiplying /H9252by the myocardial wall volume, which can be directly obtained from the acquired cine CMR scans. The variability of wall volume measurements, particularly for the right ventricle, isknown to be substantial (25). As an alternative, /H9252 might be normalized to chamber volume. This important issue must be systematically investigated in future research. Study limitations. The CMR and conductance cath- eter measurements cannot be performed simulta- neously. For comparison of measured data, we aimed for keeping the animals' physiological con- ditions, such as heart rate and blood pressure constant. Care must be taken when comparing physical exercise with dobutamine stress ( 26). Therefore, it would be inappropriate to directly translate our ndings regarding chamber stiffness during dobutamine administration to exercise con- ditions. Some technical limitations should be men- tioned. In the CMR setting, we measured ventric- ular pressures with fluid-lled catheters to avoid metallic components, in contrast with the high- delity, solid-state sensors incorporated in the con- ductance catheter. A fluid-lled catheter manome- ter system acts as a low-pass lter, thus high- frequency components are attenuated. However, by using relatively stiff and short catheters and carefully removing trapped air bubbles, adequate recordings of cardiac and arterial pressure signals can be obtained and the impact on derived indexes is expected to be very limited (27). For indexes that require high-frequency components, such as relax- ation time constants, CMR-compatible pressure catheters or sophisticated signal processing may need to be considered (28,29). VEC CMR mea- surements are susceptible to several potential sources of error, which include turbulent flow and moving valve planes. The CMR method was intro- duced to the clinical scenario in a small, well- controlled pilot study. Future studies must include a much larger number of patients. CONCLUSIONS This work presents an CMR catheterization method for the assessment of diastolic and systolic pressure- volume relation in the left and right ventricle. applied method combines cine CMR ventricular VEC CMR ventricular pressure measurements.

After excluding ineligible prescreened patients, accrual rates were higher for the Call method (188 of 531 [35.4%]) than either the Click (12 of 72 [16.7%]; p\u00bc0.002) or Letter (17 of 816 [2.1%]; p<0.001) methods. The average cost per patient enrolled for the Call ($156) method was competitive with the Click ($129) and substantially lower than theLetter ($1967) methods; the Callmethod was least expensive if combined with automated patient identification ($99). Data extrapolation suggest it would take 2.4 years at an overall cost of $138,518 to recruit a target sample of 900 patients by theCall method, 40.5 years at $62,419 for the Click method and 27.9 years at $1,737,757 for the Letter method. Limitations The study was nonrandomized and findings may not be generalizable to other research settings.Conclusion The investigator-initiated direct contact 'opt-out' strategy is signifi- cantly cost-effective and feasible than provider-initiated and provider- mediated 'opt-in' strategies for patient recruitment to clinical trials.

BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from Introduction Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) serve as the gold standard for evaluating new screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions. Regardless of theoutcome of interest, successful completion of a RCTis contingent upon its ability to recruit a predeter-mined number of eligible patients within a plannedtime frame. Failure to enroll the projected samplein a timely manner not only results in costly delaysbut also compromises a trial's statistical power andscientific validity. Despite its importance, lowpatient accrual is one of the main reasons for the RCT failure [1-4]. Recent changes in regulatory standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule [5] have been identified as a major barrier to patient recruitment in clinical research. Although the Privacy Rule does notdirectly regulate human studies research, it limitsthe ability of 'covered entities' (e.g., healthcareproviders and hospitals) to disclose 'protectedhealth information' (e.g., names and contact infor-mation) to investigators without a patient's writtenpermission ('authorization') or, in select circum-stances, a waiver that permits access without writtenauthorization [6,7]. Consequently, common recruit- ment strategies employed in the past, such as medical record reviews and use of clinical databasesor registries, are no longer permitted in the absenceof written authorization, a waiver or use of de-identified data; instead, investigators are nowrequired to identify research patients from withintheir own clinical practices, obtain referrals fromother physicians or recruitment centers, or locatepotential patients through advertising [8], all ofwhich pose serious logistical constraints to recruit- ment and human studies research in general [9-14]. To further protect the rights and welfare of research patients under the Common Rule (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 45CFR Part 46), many institutional review boards (IRBs) have imposed additional restrictions on recruitment due to con-cerns about intrusion and coercion. A prevailingsentiment is that the 'opt-out' strategy commonlyused in the past is intrusive and possibly unethical,since a nonresponse infers that potential patientscan still be contacted regardless of their interest inthe study. Instead, many IRBs now mandate an'opt-in' strategy, whereby potential patients mustactively grant permission to be contacted by the research team about a particular study and a nonresponse prohibits further communication.Like the Privacy Rule, use of the opt-in recruitmentstrategy has been shown to reduce patient enroll-ment in clinical research and increase the potentialfor selection bias [15-17].Researchers outside the United States have encountered similar obstacles to subject recruit- ment. In the United Kingdom, for example, legis-lation in the form of the Data Protection Act 1998and Health and Social Care Act 2001 has imposedstrict regulations regarding the use of identifiable health information for the purpose of human studies research [18-21]. Moreover, because ofsimilar concerns about intrusion and coercion,most ethics committees in the United Kingdomhave also mandated opt-in recruitment methods, despite evidence suggesting that public concern about an opt-out approach is minimal [22]. Besides compromising patient recruitment and potentially introducing threats to study validity, compliance with these new regulatory standards has been shown to increase personnel costs andresource expenditures [9,11,12,21]. Investigators offederally sponsored RCTs are ill-prepared to com-pensate for these increases in light of recent declines in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. Although a flat NIH budget ($29.5 billion)has again been proposed for fiscal year 2009 [23],actual funding will continue to decrease afteradjustment for inflation. Consequently, investiga- tors are placed in the untenable position of trying to optimize patient recruitment without the neces-sary funds to insure success. Insight into cost-effectiveness of different strategies for overcomingthis dilemma would be invaluable. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three different recruitmentstrategies that comply with new regulatory stan-dards within the context of a clinical trial aimed at assessing the impact of shared decision-making on colorectal cancer screening (CRC) adherence. Methods Study objective and design The overall objective of our RCT is to evaluate the impact of a computer-based decision aid on shared decision-making and patient adherence to CRC screening recommendations. Eligible patients areinstructed to arrive one hour before a prearrangedoffice visit with their primary care provider (PCP).After obtaining informed consent and completing a brief pretest, patients are randomized to one of two intervention arms (decision aid plus personalizedrisk assessment tool with feedback or decision aidalone) and a control arm, each of which involves aninteractive computer session. Patients then meet with their providers to discuss screening and iden- tify a preferred screening strategy. Before leavingthe clinic, patients are asked to complete a posttest,598 PC Schroy et al. Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 597-609 http://ctj.sagepub.com at BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from which in part assesses screening intentions, knowl- edge, and satisfaction with the decision-making process. The entire process takes between 30 and60 min to complete. The target sample size was 900patients. Study sites The study commenced in March 2005 at two urban ambulatory care sites. The first, Boston MedicalCenter (BMC), is a private, nonprofit academicmedical center affiliated with the Boston University School of Medicine, which serves a mostly minority patient population (28% White, non-Hispanic).The second, the South Boston Community HealthCenter (SBCHC), is a community health center affiliated with BMC, which serves a mostly White, non-Hispanic patient population. Both institutionsutilize the same electronic medical record(Centricity TM(formerly Logician)). The study proto- col and recruitment process were approved by theBoston University Medical Campus InstitutionalReview Board, which is responsible for overseeinghuman studies research at both participating institutions. Patients The study sample consists of asymptomatic, aver- age-risk patients attending one of the primary careclinics at BMC or SBCHC. Patients are deemed eligible if they are 50-75 years of age, due for CRC screening, and under the care of one the PCPs(physicians or nurse practitioners )who had expressed interest in participating at one of thetarget sites. Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria are excluded: (1) prior CRC screening by any method other than fecal occultblood testing; (2) fecal occult blood testing withinthe past year; (3) high-risk condition (personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps, family history of colorectal cancer or polyps involvingone or more first-degree relatives, or chronicinflammatory bowel disease); (4) lack of fluency in written and spoken English; or (5) comorbidities that preclude CRC screening by any recommendedmethod. Patient identification A CRC screening module was created within the electronic medical record (EMR) used by primary care clinicians at both participating sites. Themodule appears in the 'Impression' window of theEMR, which providers generally review in real-time during the clinic visit to prescribe medications, order diagnostic studies, and arrange follow-up.The module itself contains data entry fields thatdisplay the dates and results of completed screening tests (fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoido- scopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema), which areeither downloaded directly an electronicclinical data repository if performed at BMC begin- ning in 2002 or entered by the PCP. The module also generates a highly visible 'DUE' flag for patientin need of first-time or follow-up screening. Patient recruitment Sequential patient cohorts were allocated to one of three recruitment methods between March 2005 and April 2006: (1) a provider-initiated electronicreferral opt-in ( an investigator-initiated coordinator-mediateddirect contact opt-out ( Call) method. Click method (March through September 2005) Potential patients due for screening were initially identified using the EMR's 'DUE' flag at the time of a clinic visit by their provider. To comply with an opt-in recruitment strategy, the CRC screeningmodule was built to include a check-box reminderfor providers prompting them to briefly describe the study and obtain 'consent to contact' from interested patients; if checked, the patient's nameand medical record number were transmitted elec-tronically to the research team, who would thencontact patients by telephone and invite them to participate after verifying eligibility and providing a more detailed overview of the study. Those whoagree would then formally enroll in person at theirnext scheduled appointment with their PCP. To optimize recruitment, a pretrial seminar was con- ducted with providers to notify them about thestudy and elicit support. Participating providerswere also sent monthly e-mails reminders encoura- ging them to refer eligible patients. Letter method (April through October 2005) Because many potential subjects who expressed int- erest in participating after being recruited throughthe 2-visit Click method did not have scheduled follow-up appointments at the time of recruitmentdue to the use of an open access scheduling system,actual enrollment was severely compromised.Subject recruitment strategies 599 http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 597-609 at BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from To circumvent this problem, the research team was granted approval by the IRB to generate provider- specific lists of patients due for screening with scheduled appointments during the upcoming month. If the treating provider felt that the patient was an appropriate candidate, a standardized refer- ral letter briefly describing the study was prepared by the research team, signed by the provider and mailed to the patient along with an enclosed opt- in return postcard. Upon receipt of the postcard, the research team contacted patients by telephone andinvited them to participate after verifying eligibility and providing an overview of the study. Call method (November 2005 through April 2006) The Letter method also proved to be ineffective due to feasibility issues related to the narrow time interval (1-4 weeks) between patient identification, receipt of the letter, return of an enclosed postcard, and follow-up phone call. To circumvent these issues, approval to use a verbal substitute for thereferral letter was requested and granted by the IRB. As with the letter format, individual providers were given a list of their patients due for screening with scheduled appointments for the upcoming month. If deemed appropriate by the PCP, the research team contacted the patients directly by telephone and explored their interest in participating after verifying eligibility and providing an overview of the study. The telephone script explicitly stated that patients were being called to invite them to participate in an educational research study at the recommendation of their primary care provider. Contacted patients had the opportunity to opt-inor -out early in the interview process. Each patient was called up to five times at varying times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, and weekends); those who could not be contacted were deemed nonenrollees. Beginning in the fall of 2006, an IRB-approved automated patient identification process wasinitiated, whereby provider-specific lists of sched- uled patients due for screening were generated by an independent senior database analyst at the beginning of each month and provided to the research team (BMC site only). This process elimi- nated the need for individual electronic medical record reviews by the research team. As with the Letter and Call methods, the lists were then disseminated to the individual providers for theirreview and approval. Even though this so-called information technology-assisted ( IT)-Call method was identical to the Call method with respect to interactions between the research team and pre-screened eligible patients, we felt compelled to incorporate it as a separate recruitment strategy inour cost analyses only to enhance the general-izability of our findings to research settings with well-integrated EMR systems. Primary and secondary analyses Accrual ratesThe primary outcome was subject accrual rate, defined as the percent of subjects enrolled during the 6-month recruitment period based out of the number of prescreened eligible (i.e., due for screen-ing) patients targeted minus known ineligible sub- jects. Given this definition, targeted subjects whose eligibility is unknown due to nonresponse were included in the denominator of the accrual rate. Pairwise comparisons of accrual rates for the three recruitment methods were tested throughchi-square analysis. Similar analyses were also performed to compare the demographic character- istics of the targeted samples (excluding known ineligibles) and to compare the demographiccharacteristics of patients enrolled through the three recruitment methods, acknowledging that the latter comparison lacks adequate power due to the small number of enrolled patients for the Click and Letter methods. Associations between demo- graphic characteristics and enrollment were exam- ined for the Call method only using multiple logistic regression to detect potential recruitment biases. Significance was defined at the p/C200.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed usingSAS (version 8.2, Cary, North Carolina). Cost To estimate costs, a detailed bottom-up microcost- ing approach was applied to each recruitment method. Personnel costs were determined by firstidentifying the various activities performed by different staff (study coordinators, computer pro- grammer, and database analyst) necessary for eachmethod and then estimating the mean amount of time required for completion of these activities based on a minimum of 10 measurements; mean and high/low cost estimates were then calculated by multiplying the mean and range of time to complete each activity by average hourly staff salaries. The costs of consumable items (mailings, calls) were derived by multiplying per item costs by item number. To extrapolate results, costs weredivided into one-time fixed development costs and variable costs, i.e., costs that directly increase with higher volume. Examples of one-time costs include developing patient or physician contact materials, such as letters, programming, and database costs for600 PC Schroy et al. Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 597-609 http://ctj.sagepub.com at BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from linking electronic medical records with endoscopy reports. Examples of variable costs include themedical record review, phone calls, letters, ormonthly computer reports. Personnel costs related to updating screening data in the EMR, primary care provider time and ancillary costs for develop-ing and maintaining the hospital-based EMR, clin- ical data repository, and endoscopy database were excluded. Relevant cost estimates are provided inthe Table 1. Using beta distributions for individualscontacted and enrolled and normal distributionsfor costs, the extrapolations transformed 6-monthaccruals into constant 1-month event rates and costs and extrapolated accruals for alternative time horizons. Monte Carlo bootstrap samplesinvolving 10,000 simulations were performed with Decision Maker (Physicians of Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA).

During the defined 6-month recruitment periods, 100 potential subjects (i.e.,patients due for CRC screening'') were identified using the Click method, 847 by the Letter method, and 758 by the Call method. After excluding ineligible prescreened patients, accrual rates were higher for the Call method (188 of 531 [35.4%]) than either the Click (12 of 72 [16.7%]; p\u00bc0.002) or Letter (17 of 816 [2.1%]; p<0.001) methods. The actual proportion of potential subjects who were successfully contacted, deemed eligible, and enrolled was relatively high for all three methods(12 of 18 [67%] for the Click method; 17 of 17 [100%] for the Letter method; 188 of 238 [79%] for the Call method), suggesting that direct contact with the patient was the critical determinantof successful recruitment and not the acquisition of more effective recruiting skills by the research team over time.Characteristics of enrolled and nonenrolled patients for each recruitment method Table 2 depicts the baseline characteristics of eligible patients for each recruitment method. Despite the use of a nonrandomized patient allo-cation scheme, there were no significant differencesbetween the three groups with respect to age, race/ ethnicity, sex, marital status, and employment status. There was, however, a difference withrespect to insurance coverage. The target samples were predominantly older (/C21 age 65), non-White, and female with public or private medical insur- ance; a relative minority were married or employed. These demographic characteristics are similar to those of the participating sites, except for therelative predominance of older individuals (datanot shown).

The two groups were similar with respect to age,race/ethnicity, sex, insurance coverage, andemployment status but differed with respect tomarital status. Married patients were significantly less likely to enroll than single patients (unadjusted and adjusted O.R. [95%CI], 0.50 [0.32-0.76], and0.53 [0.34-0.82], respectively). No were observed between enrolled and none- nrolled patients for both the Click and Letter methods, but the relatively small number of enrolled patients for each method precludes mean- ingful statistical analyses (data not shown). Cost versus yield of different recruitment methods Table 5 displays the cost and accrual rates for the different recruitment methods for three alternativetime frames: 6, 12, and 24 months. For the purposeof these analyses, the Call method was subdivided into Call and information technology (IT)-assisted Call (IT-Call) methods to account for the different costs associated with the laborious electronic med- ical record review approach used by the studycoordinators to identify potential subjects com-pared with the more efficient, automated methodemployed by the data analyst. Because of amortiza-tion, strategies with higher one-time costs (Clickand IT-Call methods) have more dramatic reduc- tions in average per-patient costs to screen foreligibility, contact (successfully or unsuccessfully)and enroll when the time period of interestincreases from 6 to 24 months. The other strategieswith relatively low one-time development costshave stable average per-patient costs to screen,contact and enroll, regardless of the time period ofinterest. During the initial 6-month period, themost labor-intensive recruitment strategy, the Letter method, had the highest overall cost ($31,480) yetlowest yield and hence the highest average cost perpatient screened ($20), contacted ($37), andenrolled ($1967). The Click method, on the other hand, had the lowest overall cost ($1423) but onlyTable 2 Comparison of characteristics of targeted samples (enrolled and nonenrolled patients) for each recruitment methoda Characteristic Click 29.9 Hispanic 4.2 6.4 8.3 Sex 0.45 Female 54.2 58.8 55.7Male 45.8 41.2 44.3 42.4Married 31.9 36.5 33.2Other 27.8 27.5 24.5 Insurance 0.02 44.4 40.1 37.7Medicare 33.3 33.6 27.9Medicaid 16.7 17.8 21.9Free care 4.2 7.8 10.2 No coverage 1.4 0.7 2.5 Employment 0.43 Full-time 19.7 19.2 19.9 Part-time 8.5 7.1 9.4 Unemployed 36.6 34.4 38.2 Disabled 9.9 12.6 10.3Retired 23.9 22.3 16.6 Other 1.4 2.6 3.4 aData expressed as percent of each group.bChi-square analysis.Table 3 Comparison of characteristics of enrolled samples for each recruitment methoda Characteristic Click 25.0 58.8 29.3 Hispanic 0.0 5.9 6.9 Other 16.7 0.0 5.9 Sex 0.84 Female 58.3 52.9 60.1 Male 41.7 47.1 39.9 Marital status 0.39 Single 33.3 47.1 50.5Married 33.3 11.8 25.0 Other 33.3 41.2 24.5 Insurance 0.89 Private 33.3 41.2 37.2 Medicare 50.0 41.2 32.5 Medicaid 16.7 11.8 19.7Free care 0.0 5.9 9.6No coverage 0.0 0.0 1.1 Employment 0.10 Full-time 0.0 6.2 19.7Part-time 8.3 0.0 12.2Unemployed 33.3 37.5 33.5 Disabled 8.3 18.7 12.2 Retired 50.0 25.0 14.9Other 0.0 12.5 4.3 aData expressed as percent of each group.bChi-square analysis.604 PC Schroy et al.

The Call method was the second most personnel intensive recruitment strategy and assuch had the second highest overall cost ($29,288);however, because of its superior yield, the averagecost per patient screened ($9), contacted ($39), and enrolled ($156) was only marginally higher than theClick method. Finally, the IT-Call method had the second lowest overall cost ($9548) but lowestaverage cost per patient screened ($0.93), contacted($7), and enrolled ($99), due to a higher absolutealbeit lower proportional yield compared to theClick method. It is noteworthy that the target population for the IT-Call method was comprised of a much higher proportion of patients whohad been unsuccessfully recruited using theCall method in the past mostly due to 'failure to contact,' thus suggesting that differences inpatient mix rather than methodological differenceswere responsible for the lower enrollment rates(data not shown). Typically, clinical trials must recruit a pre-speci- fied number of patients based on power analysis.Table 6 displays the recruitment time and costsassociated with the four alternative strategiesto recruit 100, 300, 500 and our target sample of900 patients, assuming a stable pool of eligiblepatients and a steady rate of enrollment. The Click method always has the lowest cost but always takesthe longest to fulfill targeted patient recruitmentgoals. The Letter method is always the most expen- sive and requires nearly many years as theClick method. The Call method has higher costs than either the Click orIT-Call method (provided electronic health records are available) but takesthe least time to fulfill recruitment. Thus, thehigher recruitment cost may be offset by ashorter time to study completion because of higherproportion enrollment .We estimate that it would take 2.4 years at an overall cost of $138,518 to recruitour target sample of 900 patients by theCall method, 4.6 years at a cost of $56,520 for the IT-Call method, 40.5 years at a cost of $62,419 for the Click method, and 27.9 years at a cost of $1,737,757 for the Letter method.

Discussion The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, as defined by patient accrualrates, and costs associated with three differentrecruitment methods. We found that the investi-gator-initiated direct contact opt-out ( Call) method yields substantially higher accrual rates than either the provider-initiated electronic referral (Click )o r provider-mediated referral letter (Letter ) opt-in methods. We also found that the average cost perenrolled patient associated with the Call method was competitive with the Click method and sub- stantially lower than the Letter method; the Call method was actually the least expensive if com-bined with an automated EMR-based patient iden-tification strategy ( IT-Call). Moreover, as recruitment demand and duration of the studyincreased from 6 to 24 months, the initial upfrontcost investment in IT-Call resulted in substantial long-term savings when compared with Letter or Call. Our findings corroborate those of prior studies demonstrating higher recruitment rates with directinvestigator-mediated opt-out strategies comparedwith provider-mediated opt-in relative success of the Callmethod may be attributable to a number of factors, most notably the ability to deliver a more intense and persona-lized recruitment message, answer questions, anddissuade any fears or concerns. Of the 426 patientscontacted directly, none expressed concerns abouta violation of privacy. Moreover, the refusal rateswere similar for eligible patients contacted eitherafter granting consent to contact by the Click method or contacted directly by investigators bythe Call method (11% vs. 15%, respectively; p\u00bc0.37). Thus, our study provides additional evi- dence that most patients do not perceive the investigator-initiated direct contact approach tobe a violation of privacy or result in a loss ofpersonal autonomy [26-29]. Apart from our findings related to the effective- ness of the different recruitment strategies, our cost-effectiveness analyses provide a critical per-spective on the feasibility of each strategy. TheLetter method remains economically the least effi- cient and suffers from low enrollment, presumably due to both logistical constraints imposed by ouropen access scheduling system and patient factors(e.g., lack of understanding about the study,disinterest, and distrust). While the Click method is comparatively inexpensive per patient enrolled,Table 5 Cost and accrual rate results Number of individuals Average total cost per individual Overall costs (95% CI) prescreened eligible patients called or sent letters, regardless of whether direct contact was made.606 PC Schroy et al. Clinical Trials 2009; 6: 597-609 http://ctj.sagepub.com at BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from accrual relies on PCP activation and would have necessitated an estimated 37.5 years to reach theenrollment target. Efforts to increase PCP activation through monthly e-mail reminders were ineffec- tive. The extent to which incentive-laden entice-ments may have been more successful, however, isunknown. The Call method is clearly the most feasible recruitment strategy, requiring only 2.4years to accrue the enrollment target, at a cost thatcompares favorably with that of the Click method if combined with IT support. Even in the absence of IT support, the Call method is more cost-effective due to substantially higher accrual rates. Another important observation of our study was that the Call method afforded minimal selection bias. Prior studies have clearly demonstrated that both the Privacy Rule and mandatory opt-in recruitment policies not only challenge the feasi- bility of recruiting patients to clinical research, butalso introduce 'consent bias' or 'author-ization bias' that compromises external validity[15-17]. By circumventing these requirements, we found that eligible patients enrolled in our study using the Call method were similar to those who did not enroll, with respect to all characteristicsexamined, except marital status. Although we also found no evidence of selection bias for either the Click orLetter methods, too few patients were enrolled to assess accurately their impact on selec-tion bias. The extent to which each of the three recruit- ment strategies employed in this study complied with current regulatory requirements is of para- mount importance to the overall objectives of thestudy. The Click method was in strict compliance with both the Privacy Rule and the Common Rule, because it utilized treating providers to both iden- tify potential patients from within their ownpractices and obtain a 'consent to contact' via anopt-in approach. Although abandoned primarilybecause of logistical constraints imposed by an open access scheduling system, this approach was largely ineffective as a recruitment strategy, thuscorroborating a prior observation that the use ofPCPs to recruit patients to clinical trials during a routine office visit is feasible but relatively ineffec- tive, time-consuming, and impractical [30]. TheLetter method was also acceptable to the extent that treating providers rather than the research teamcontacted potential subjects and facilitated recruit-ment using an opt-in referral letter process.Although less disruptive and less time-consuming than the Click method, this passive provider- mediated approach was also ineffective. The Call method was the most contentious strategy, requir- ing approval from the IRB to contact potential subjects directly using an opt-out approach. Approval was sought and granted on grounds thatthe phone call served as a verbal substitute for theletter because the treating provider was identified as the referral source in the introductory statement, the risk to loss of privacy was minimal, the benefitsof the study far outweighed the risks, and patientrecruitment using both the Click and Letter meth- ods was sufficiently low to suggest that the researchcould not otherwise be practically conducted. Thedegree to which other IRBs or Privacy Boards wouldact similarly and approve an investigator-initiated direct contact opt-out approach under these cir- cumstances is unknown [31]. Our study has several notable strengths. First, we systematically compared the relative costs andeffectiveness of three different recruitment strate-gies targeting the same patient population. Second, the target population was comprised of a large minority population, thus enhancing the externalTable 6 Time and cost to reach recruitment targets Recruitment target Letter Click Call IT-Call N\u00bc100 Years to reach (95% CI) at BOSTON UNIV on August 11, 2011 ctj.sagepub.com Downloaded from validity of our findings and potentially assisting other researchers attempting to bolster recruitment of this hard to reach group. Third, our study highlights the utility of electronic medical records for facilitating patient identification, recruitment and communication between treating providers and the research team [32]. Our study also has several noteworthy limita- tions. The first relates to the generalizability of our findings to other settings that may vary with respect to the availability of an EMR for identifying eligible patients, the level of motivation by primary care providers to assist in patient identification and/or recruitment, use of an open access system for patient scheduling, personnel salaries and the policies and procedures of other IRBs or Privacy Boards regarding opt-in versus opt-out recruitment strategies. It also remains unclear whether our findings have external validity with respect to other types of clinical trials where the relative risks and benefits of participation may strongly influence patient and provider interest, as well as IRB considerations. The second major limitation relates to our study's nonrandomized design. Although we demonstrate that the majority of baseline characteristics of eligible patients in each of the three groups were similar, it remains possible that the three groups may have differed with respect to unmeasured patient factors. A third limitation relates to use of the telephone to contact directly potential patients. Although our response rate was relatively high (63%), the widespread use of answering machines and caller ID have been shown to compromise participation rates and increase costs in other research settings [33 ]. Lastly, given our study design, it is possible thatdifferential exposure to heightened publicity related to CRC screening during one of the time intervals may have influenced our results. In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence supporting the superior cost-effectiveness of the investigator-initiated direct contact opt-out approach over provider-initiated or provider- mediated opt-in strategies for patient recruitment to clinical trials. Moreover, our study finds little evidence supporting the widespread belief that patients perceive the direct contact opt-out approach to be a violation of privacy or result in a loss of personal autonomy. Future studies are needed to better define the generalizability of our findings to other types of clinical trials targeting distinct patient populations in diverse health care settings. In the interim, however, we encourage other IRBs or Privacy Boards to adopt more lenient policies regarding use of investigator-initiated direct contact opt-in recruitment strategies for low-risk clinical trials where the potential benefitsof the research far exceed the risks of loss of confidentiality.

Family studies of exceptional longevity can potentially identify genetic and other factors contributing to long life and healthy aging. Although such studies seek families that are exceptionally long lived, they also need living members who can provide DNA and phenotype information. On the basis of these considerations, the authors developed a metric to rank families for selection into a family study of longevity. Their measure, the family longevityselection score (FLoSS), is the sum of 2 components: 1) an estimated family longevity score built from birth-, gender-, and nation-specic cohort survival probabilities and 2) a bonus for older living siblings. The authors examined properties of FLoSS-based family rankings by using data from 3 ongoing studies: the New EnglandCentenarian Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and screenees for the Long Life Family Study. FLoSS-basedselection yields families with exceptional longevity, satisfactory sibship sizes and numbers of living siblings, and high ages. Parameters in the FLoSS formula can be tailored for studies of specic populations or age ranges or with different conditions. The rst component of the FLoSS also provides a conceptually sound survival measure tocharacterize exceptional longevity in individuals or families in various types of studies and correlates well with later- observed longevity. aged, 80 and over; family data; longevity; Shannon information Abbreviations: FLoSS, family longevity selection score; FRS, family risk score. Exceptional longevity strongly aggregates in families (1-4). Thus, studies of exceptionally long-lived families have the potential to identify genetic variants and other factors contributing to longevity, particularlyfactors that are too rare to detect in a population-based study (5, 6). Both a family's exceptionality of survival and its number of living siblings contribute to its value for a geneticstudy of longevity. A challenge in selecting families for suchstudies is that the most long-lived individuals may have few or no living siblings to provide DNA and other biologic material. To select families for a study of environ-mental and genetic factors contributing to longevity, we developed the family longevity selection score (FLoSS). The FLoSS combines a measure of the exceptionality ofa family's survival with a bonus for the presence of livingold members; it is computed from information that can be collected relatively easily from an immediate family member. We compare the FLoSS with an alternative scoring method, the family risk score (FRS). The FRS generalizes the family history score (7) to quantitative phenotypes, creating an average score among family members adjusted for thedistribution of the phenotype in the general population (8, 9).We compare the FLoSS and FRS with regard to charac- teristics of sibships that would be selected by choosing the highest scoring sibships according to the following: sibshipsize, numbers of living siblings, mean age, and exceptionality of sibship survival. We compare these characteristics in 2 US populations selected for longevity (the Long Life FamilyStudy and the New England Centenarian Study) and in 1 1555 Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:1555-1562not selected for longevity (the Framingham Heart Study), a geographically based US cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS Metric of estimated survival exceptionality for a family We dene both a family measure of survival exception- ality that requires knowing the age at death of all membersand a method for estimating this measure when all family members have not yet died. We characterize an individual's ''exceptionality of longevity'' at age A via p(A), the probability that a random person in the same birth cohort survives to at least age A. We use/C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0A\u00de\u00de, the information content of the rarity of sur- vival measured by ''Shannon information'' (10), as the basis for an individual's exceptionality score. The increment in this function for each additional year of survival rises with age. For example, the increase in its value for survival pastage 96 years versus 95 years is far greater than the increase for survival past age 71 years versus age 70 years. The probability of survival past age A varies by cohort as specied by year, country of birth, and gender. For example,on the basis of the US Social Security Administration cohort life tables (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as116/ as116LOT.html), the same age can produce very differentexceptionality scores: 2.7 \u00bc-ln(0.065) for a woman aged 95 years born in 1910 versus 4.2 \u00bc-ln(0.015) for a man aged 95 years born in 1900. Specically, an individual'sexceptionality score at age A is -ln(p(A|C)), where p(A|C) is the probability of survival past age A for those born into that person's country-, birth year-, and gender-speciccohort C. Of course, exceptionality of longevity is fully observed only at death. We next wished to measure the family's survival excep- tionality. Note that simply summing the -ln(p) values for individuals cannot be correct, because these are always pos- itive; thus, each additional family member, even one who dies at a young age, would increase the score. Clearly, a family of2, both living at age 95, is more exceptional than a family of 3, with 2 still living at age 95 plus one who died at age 65. This suggests that each person's score should be of the form,-ln(p)/C0k,w h e r e kis chosen so that the expected value of the s c o r ef o rar a n d o m l ys e l e c t e dp e r s o ni s0 .I nt h a tc a s e ,af a m - ily member for whom -ln( p) exceeds kincreases the family's longevity exceptionality, while one who dies younger sub-tracts. The desired value of kis 1 because, for each cohort, the probabilities pin a life table are uniformly distributed on the interval from 0 to 1, and the integral (i.e., mean value)of-ln(p) over this interval is 1. Thus, we choose /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1 to measure each member's survival excep- tionality for including in a family score, as follows: SE f\u00bcX all family members\u00f0/C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1\u00de; in which all A's are ages at death. For a living person of age A, we can calculate A*, an expected age at death calculated from life tables. Specically, A* is a cohort-specic expected age at death, conditional on survival to age A; then, -ln( p(A*|C )) is anestimated measure of the person's exceptionality of survival. Because exceptional longevity is strongly familial (1, 2, 4-6), those with long-lived siblings are likely to livelonger than life-table calculations suggest. (In this sense, /C0ln(p(A*|C )) is a conservative estimate of expected exceptionality in families of interest in longevity studies.)This leads to the following estimated survival exceptionality for a family f, in which each member's contribution increases the family score only if /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00defor dead members or /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0A*jC\u00de\u00defor living members exceeds 1: est\u00f0SE\u00de : Metric incorporating the added value of old living family members The score ''est \u00f0SE\u00def'' can be computed with any mix of living and dead family members. For families with living members, it is a plausible current estimate of SE f, the family's (ultimate) survival exceptionality. When all havedied, it equals SE f. Although est \u00f0SE\u00defshould be useful for many purposes, it may not be ideal for selecting families into a study of familial longevity, because it does not particularly value additional older living siblings, who provide more biologic and phenotypic data. Thus, we add a living siblings' bonus score that satises the following principles: 1. Living family members whose age A is already some- what exceptional, in the sense that /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1i s greater than 0, should add to the family's value for genetic studies on exceptional survival beyond the value already captured in their contribution to est\u00f0SE\u00def. 2. The amount of added value conferred by these living family members should be a function of /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1, where Ais their current age, rather than their expected age at death ( A*), since only survival through age A is certain. 3. Living family members who are still so young that /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1 is negative should neither add to nor subtract from the bonus. This leads us to dene the following living sibling bonus: LBf\u00bcX living family membersmaxf0;\u00bd/C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1/C138g: our family longevity selec- tionscore, or FloSS calculation, consider a sibship with an oldest brother born in 1920 and died (at age 88) in 2008,1556 Sebastiani et al. Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:1555-1562while 2 other siblings remain living at the end of 2008: a brother born in 1921 (aged 87 years) and a sister in 1930 (aged 78 years). The US Social Security Administra-tion cohort life tables indicate that only about 12.2% of the brothers' cohort (males born between 1916 and 1925) lives past 88 and 14.3% lives past 87, while 57.4% of the femalesof the sister's cohort (born between 1926 and 1935) lives past 78. Furthermore, the living brother is expected to achieve age A*\u00bc91, while the sister's A* is 88. The FLoSS is the sum of their 3 scores. Note that /C0ln(0.122) /C01\u00bc 2.104 /C01\u00bc1.104 is the score for the dead sibling, while for each of the 2 living siblings the score is computed as /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0A*jC\u00de\u00de /C0 1\u00femaxf0;/C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de 3.042 and a FLoSS of 3.984. Additional sibships with various survival patterns and high FLoSS scores are described and illus-trated in supplementary material (Web Figure 1). (This information is posted on the Journal 's website (http:// aje.oxfordjournals.org/).) An additional consideration is whether to exclude from scoring those family members who died before some age A 0 and, if so, what age. Factors to consider include the quality of data on deaths in infancy and the survival phenotype of principal interest, for example, survival from birth, survival conditional on reaching maturity, or survival conditional onreaching a specied older age. In the Long Life FamilyStudy, given our focus on exceptional familial survival over the life span, we calculated survival conditional on reaching age 40 (rather than a younger age), on the basis of severalconsiderations. First, in the early 20th century, deaths below age 2 were often not recorded. Furthermore, in our study cohorts, infectious disease epidemics and wars were prom-inent contributors to mortality in infancy, adolescence, and early maturity. Moreover, the role of familial factors in survival below age 40 is unclear (2). Hence, we calculatedp\u00f0AjC\u00dein our analyses as the ''probability of survival to age A, conditional upon survival to age A 0\u00bc40.'' We computed this from population birth cohort life tables, using only thesubjects alive at age 40 as the referent population. We providegender- and US birth cohort-specic scores for those who survived to at least age 40 in the online supplementary ma- terial (Web Table 1; refer to the Journal 's website) and on the Long Life Family Study website (https://longlifefamilystudy. wustl.edu/FLoSS). Regarding the actual or expected ages at death required for individuals to make a positive contribution to this score, we note that /C01/C25ln\u00f00:37\u00de, so that /C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00de\u00de /C0 1 is only greater than 0 when pis smaller than 0.37, so that a positive score is achieved only when longevity exceeds the 63rd percentile for members of the same gender/birth year cohort who survived until at least age 40. In the 1900 birth cohort, for example, this corresponds to 77 years for males and 87for females.Comparing the FLoSS and the FRS A FRS can be generated for quantitative phenotypes, ad- justing for family size and the distribution of the phenotype in the general population (8, 9). When applied to longevityin sibships, the FRS is the average over all siblings in a fam- ily of their individual scores, S, where: Figure 1.

In addition, the FRS scores a family with 2exceptional siblings identically to a family with 4 or 8 sib-lings, each pair of which is just as exceptional as the 2. Characteristics of populations used to compare FLoSS and FRS We calculated these scores in 3 sibship samples. Only the rst 2 are enriched for longevity. Sample 1: 660 sibships from the New England Centenar- ian Study\u2014a nationwide-based sample of centenarians, their siblings, and offspring. In all selected sibships, theproband was aged /C21100 years. In 2005, 49% of all sib- lings were still living, 33% of the sibships contained atleast 1 living member, and the average attained age was 91 years. Sample 2: 1,671 US sibships from the screening pilot phase of the Long Life Family Study\u2014a US-Danishstudy of long-lived sibships and their offspring (https:// longlifefamilystudy.wustl.edu/). Sibships of living pro- bands who were at least 80 years of age were screened inthe US component of the Long Life Family Study. In 2007,58% of all siblings were still living, all sibships contained at least 1 living member (the proband who provided data on the other siblings), and the average age was 83 years. Sample 3: 766 sibships from the Framingham Heart Study (11)\u2014a sample of longitudinally followed subjects and their families. The Framington Heart Study has enrolledsubjects born from 1888 onward; all our sibships had at least 1 sibling born before 1925. In 2004, 13% of all sib- lings were still living, 21% of the sibships contained atleast 1 living member, and the average attained age was 74 years.

We used summary statistics to illustrate differences betweensibships in the lowest 40 percentile groups and in the top 5%, as dened by each score, and Wilcoxon and tstatistics to test for their signicance. Reported Pvalues are 2 sided. RESULTS As shown in Figure 1, the percentile ranking of families screened for the Long Life Family Study based on est \u00f0SE\u00def,the estimated ''survival exceptionality,'' is more strongly correlated with the rankings based on the FLoSS ( r\u00bc 0.98) (Figure 1A) than with FRS ( r\u00bc 0.71) (Figure 1B). As seen in Table 1, the sibships ranked in the top 5% by the FLoSS and FRS have quite different characteristics. Sibships ranked in the top 5% by the FRSaverage between 4 and 7 years older but are far smaller than those ranked in the top 5% by the FLoSS. Note that 79% of the sibships ranked in the top 5% by the FLoSS have morethan 1 living sibling compared with only 3% of the sibshipsranked in the top 5% by the FRS. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the FLoSS and FRS in the sibships of the Framington Heart Study (left), the LongLife Family Study (middle), and the New England Cente- narian Study (right). For comparability, the FLoSS and FRS scores in the Long Life Family Study and the New EnglandCentenarian Study are each standardized to their distribu- tions in the Framington Heart Study, a sample that is not enriched for longevity. In contrast, the New England Cen-tenarian Study recruited families with centenarians, result-ing in a strongly shifted distribution of the standardized FLoSS scores. The FLoSS distribution for the Long Life Family Study screening population is intermediate, becauseit includes families with some evidence of longevity. The standardized FRS score distributions also shift to the right in the Long Life Family Study and New England Centenarian Figure 2.

Indeed, all 3 cohort pairs differ in score distributions (allP<0.001; Wilcoxon test). However, the FLoSS distin- guishes the populations far more sharply. Note that less than 1% of Framington Heart Study sibships have a FLoSS of >7 (standardized FLoSS, >4.95). To focus on unusually long- lived families, the Long Life Family Study enrolled onlyfamilies with a FLoSS of 7 or more. We also examined the degree to which the FLoSS and estimated survival exceptionality score predict actual sur-vival exceptionality (SE f), observed only after all have died. For those 442 sibships of the New England Centenarian Study in which at least 1 sibling was alive in 1995 but allhad died by 2004, we computed the FLoSS using data known in 1995 and the (fully observed) SE fin 2004. The scatterplot in Figure 3 shows the relation between thesibships' rankings based on the 2004 SE f(yaxis) and those based on the FLoSS and on the estimated survival excep- tionality longevity score, est \u00f0SE\u00def, in 1995. The ranking based on the FLoSS and on est \u00f0SE\u00defin 1995 correlates equally strongly with the ranking based on the SE fmeasured a decade later (both r\u00bc0.90). DISCUSSION A sibship's FLoSS is a good predictor of its true (not yet fully known) exceptionality of survival. Thus, it is useful forselecting long-lived families for studies of genetic and non- genetic factors contributing to longevity. In particular, the FLoSS can identify desirable sibships among families beingscreened for genetic epidemiologic studies of exceptional longevity. Sibships with a high FLoSS have high ages of the total sibship and of living siblings, as well as high numbersof total and living members. A high FLoSS can be achieved by the presence of a single individual with extremely long survival (if the other siblingsare not short lived) or by the presence of many long (but notextremely)-lived siblings. The modes of transmission of longevity (if any) associated with these types of patterns may differ. For example, the former might reflect a recessivetrait; the latter, a dominant. The fact that a high FLoSS value captures both of these patterns is one of its strengths, be- cause it does not exclude longevous families who might notbe ascertained by other methods (e.g., setting a single ex- tremely exceptional age for inclusion of individuals or sib- lings). However, the additional potential heterogeneity ofgenetic factors captured in high-FLoSS families impliesa need for attention to potential differences among sub- groups in genetic transmission. We used the FLoSS to score families dened as members of a single sibship. Although it could be used to score multi- generational groups of relatives, gathering complete infor- mation on the parents of old siblings or on widely dispersedgroups of near relatives could be challenging. Furthermore, young people contribute little information regarding ultimate survival. In the Long Life Family Study, we set the minimum FLoSS for a family to be eligible at 7. This threshold was chosen by observing that only 0.2% of the FLoSS sibshipsof the Framington Heart Study meet this threshold, in con-trast to over 30% of the Long Life Family Study screening families and over 40% of families enrolled in the New England Centenarian Study. Thus, families with a FloSS aslarge as 7 are extremely rare but ndable. Calculation of FLoSS scores in families from additional population-based samples can provide further guidance about appropriateselection thresholds. The FLoSS is the sum of est \u00f0SE\u00de fand LB f(the living bonus). Its rst component is a current estimate of a family'sultimate, ''fully observed,'' survival exceptionality, SE f. Al- though the living bonus enables the FLoSS to select families that are more desirable for genetic epidemiologic studies ofexceptional longevity, est \u00f0SE\u00de fmay be a better intrinsic measure of family longevity. As such, est \u00f0SE\u00defmay be par- ticularly useful for examining relations of genotypes and other risk factors to phenotypes of family members and theirfamily's exceptionality of survival, or for nding subsets of populations that are similar with respect to the exception- ality of their families. Although in our comparison theFLoSS and est \u00f0SE\u00de fcorrelated equally well with the ob- served SE f10 years later, this may not apply over longer intervals. Note that, when all family members have died, all3 measures coincide. The FLoSS as used in the Long Life Family Study can be viewed as a member of a class of family scores that combine an estimated exceptionality of survival with a bonus forliving siblings, as in the following: Figure 3. Rankings for survival exceptionality versus family longevity selection score (FLoSS) and estimated survival exceptionality (est(SE)) among 442 New England Centenarian Study sibships with nal survivors' deaths within 10 years after 1995. For each of the 442New England Centenarian Study sibships with at least 1 living memberin 1995 and none in 2004, an open circle relates its percentile rankingbased on observed survival exceptionality in 2004 on the yaxis to its 1995 family longevity selection score percentile ranking on the xaxis. Stars show the same relation for a sibship's percentile ranking based on survival exceptionality in 2004 (on the yaxis) and percentile ranking based on its 1995 estimated survival exceptionality on the xaxis.1560 Sebastiani et al.

For the FLoSS, we chose w\u00bc1,C(a)\u00bcall people in the same birth-year, gender, and national cohort who survived to at least age 40, k\u00bc1, and LBf\u00bcX living family membersmaxf0;\u00bd/C0ln\u00f0p\u00f0AjC\u00f0a\u00de\u00de\u00de /C0 1/C138g: An age threshold other than 40 years could be chosen depending on a study's focus (e.g., age 70 to study factors influencing survival only in advanced age). Choosingw\u00bc1 weights the estimated survival exceptionality and living bonus equally; w\u00bc0 yields est \u00f0SE\u00de f, a measure of family survival exceptiona lity alone. Note that the ex- pected value of est \u00f0SE\u00deffor a ''pseudofamily'' constructed by grouping Nrandomly selected individuals from the US population is N3(1 - k). Choosing k\u00bc1m a k e s est\u00f0SE\u00defneutral to sibship size, because its expected value should be 0 for randomly selected (not particularly long- lived) people. The ''neutrality'' of the FLoSS was vali- dated by the fact that its average in the geography-basedFramingham Heart Study cohort was quite close to 0. Because -ln(0.37) is approximately equal to 1, only ages in the top 37th percentile add to est \u00f0SE\u00de f. More generally, values of ksmaller than 1 favor larger families (because each ''typical'' person's expected score is positive), while choosing klarger than 1 favors smaller ones. If greater exceptionality is sought, a larger cutoff for the FLoSScould be used. We chose w\u00bc1, giving equal weight to the estimated exceptionality score and the ''bonus'' for living older familymembers. This reflected our interest in both survival excep- tionality and the availability of old living study subjects. With this choice, the FLoSS still correlates strongly withest\u00f0SE\u00de fas we wanted. Larger w's will give more weight to the living bonus and reduce the correlation with est \u00f0SE\u00def. In summary, we have introduced and examined the consequences of a conceptually attractive framework forfamily longevity studies. These include 1) a measure of an individual's exceptionality of survival, 2) a feasible way to estimate that exceptionality for those still alive, 3) a size-neutral way to combine individual scores into a family score, 4) a plausible bonus measure for the additional value of already exceptional living family members, and 5) a wayto balance interest in older living relatives and family sur- vival exceptionality in a single score such as the FLoSS. This framework should be useful in many settings. We alsonote that formulas for the FLoSS and est \u00f0SE\u00de fcould beadapted to measure exceptionality of survival until other events besides death. Thus, we could quantify family risk for the onset of conditions (such as stroke or onset ofdiabetes or disability) whose incidence rises with age. We are investigating this idea.

To compare safety climate between diverse U.S. hospitals and Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals, and to explore the factors influencing climate in each setting. Data Sources. Primary data from surveys of hospital personnel; secondary data from the American Hospital Association's 2004 Annual Survey of Hospitals. Study Design. Cross-sectional study of 69 U.S. and 30 VA hospitals. Data Collection. For each sample, hierarchical linear models used safety-climate scores as the dependent variable and respondent and facility characteristics as indepen- dent variables. Regression-based Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition examined differencesin effects of model characteristics on safety climate between the U.S. and VA samples. Principal Findings. The range in safety climate among U.S. and VA hospitals over- lapped substantially. Characteristics of individuals influenced safety climate consistentlyacross settings. Working in southern and urban facilities corresponded with worse safetyclimate among VA employees and better safety climate in the U.S. sample. Decom- position results predicted 1.4 percentage points better safety climate in U.S. than in VA hospitals: /C00.77 attributable to sample-characteristic differences and 2.2 due to differ- ential effects of sample characteristics. Conclusions. Results suggest that safety climate is linked more to efforts of individual hospitals than to participation in a nationally integrated system or measured charac-teristics of workers and facilities. Key Words. Safety culture, safety climate, survey research, hospitals, integrated hospital networks, decomposition Based on mounting evidence that better safety climate is related to lower incidence (Naveh, Katz-Navon, and Stern 2007; Research and Educational Trust DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.00994.x 1563greater reporting (Cohen et al. 2004; Weingart et al. 2004; Gandhi et al. 2005) of adverse events and to increased communication among managers and staff (Hofmann and Morgeson 1999), considerable effort among hospitals is beingfocused on improving safety climate. Along with hospitals' own efforts, several voluntary, collaborative initiatives that could improve safety climate (e.g., Leapfrog Group's patient safety leaps, and Institute for Healthcare Improve- ment's 5 Million Lives campaign) have garnered substantial participation among both public and private hospitals. ''Benchmarking'' of safety-climate survey results through participation in such collaborative initiatives is an effective way for hospitals to target quality improvement efforts. Benchmark- ing enables a hospital to compare its survey results with those of other hos- pitals, thereby facilitating identication of relative strength and weakness. It is being encouraged by numerous organizations. Since 2002, the Joint Com- mission's performance improvement standard (PI.01.01.01) has encouragedhospitals to collect data on staff perceptions of safety risks and improvement opportunities and to compare data with external sources ( Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations 2002). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) established the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture Comparative Database for this purpose in 2006. Its 2009 database included safety-climate results from 622 hospitals (Sorra et al. 2009). Independent investigators engaged in benchmarking safety climate have also identied systematic differences in safety climate within and among hospitals, which provide clues to improving safety climate more generally (Singeret al. 2003; Thomas, Sexton, and and Sutcliffe 2007; Hartmann et al. 2008; Singer et al.

Benchmarking safety-climate survey results across health care systems is difcult due to coordination challenges. Our own effort to measure and benchmark safety climate is unique in that we used essentially the same survey instrument and sampling and ad- ministration procedures at approximately the same time in two discrete pop- ulations of hospitals in the United States: the Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system and a national sample, excluding VA hospitals. This provided a novel opportunity to compare safety climate across two popula- tions encompassing great diversity in both individual hospital characteristics and overall organizational structure, and potentially to identify any hospital features systematically related to safer care. Differences in safety climate between VA and other U.S. hospitals may inherently exist because the VA is a nation ally integrated network, while few U.S. hospitals come from large, integrated systems and none come from nationallyintegrated systems. As a system, the VA enjoys distinct advantages in broadly implementing and enforcing compliance with standardized safety activities. The VA conducts several initiatives with potential to improve safety climate. For example, the VA National Center for Patient Safety was established specically to promote a systems approa ch to preventing and reducing harm to patients and to encourage hospitals to conduct root ca use analyses after safety incidents (http://www.va.gov/ncps/vision.htm l, accessed on August 26, 2008, for NCPS). In this paper, we examine differences in safety climate between 69 diverse U.S. hospitals and 30 VA hospitals using cross-sectional employee surveys.Given potential advantages in promoting strong safety climate in a nationally integrated network, we hypothesized that safety climate among VA hospitals would be stronger than among U.S. hospitals. Differences in safety climate between U.S. and VA samples may arise from multiple sources. First, there may be variation between the two samples in measured characteristics associated with safety climate\u2014 \u2014for instance, one sample may contain more large hospitals than the other. The residual differ- ence in safety climate between the two samples would be attributable to differential effects of the sample characteristics between the two health care systems (e.g., hospital size may impact VA hospitals differently than U.S. hospitals). We performed comparisons of safety climate in these two settingsthat allowed us to discern the relative impact of these potential sources of difference. We hypothesized that variance in observed sample characteris- tics would explain more of the difference in safety climate between U.S. and VA hospitals than would differential effects of sample characteristics on the two groups.Comparing Safety Climate between Two Populations 1565METHODS Data Sources We used the Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations (PSCHO) survey to collect data on employees' perceptions of safety climate. While various instruments exist to measure hospital safety climate (Colla et al. 2005; Flin et al. 2006), the PSCHO instrument is the only one with estab- lished reliability and validity in both U.S. and VA hospital settings (Singer et al. 2007; Hartmann et al. 2008). PSCHO survey items use a Likert scale ranging from ''strongly agree'' to ''strongly disagree,'' with a neutral midpoint. Items reflect 12 dimensions that capture various aspects of safety climate. We divided these dimensions into three categories, based on the extent to which they described hospital (e.g., ''Organizational Resources for Safety''), work-unit (e.g., ''Unit Safety Norms''), and interpersonal (e.g.,''Fear of Blame and Punishment'') contributions to safety climate (Singer et al. 2007). Because of modications resulting from psychometric testing, two slightly different versions of the PSCHO survey were used in this study. In U.S. hospitals we used a 45-item instrument, while in the VA we used a 42- item instrument. The two versions have 41 common items, 39 of which map onto the 12 safety-climate dimensions. Both versions of the PSCHO also contained six close-ended demographic items. Because the development of a strong safety climate necessitates a ho- mogenous focus on preventing safety failures, the PSCHO instrument is scored to highlight responses opposed to safety, which we refer to as ''prob- lematic responses.'' We generated scores for items, dimensions, and safety climate overall. First, we calculated the mean percent problematic response (''PPR'') for a given item across all respondents. We then calculated the mean of all item means in a dimension and the mean of all item means in the survey. A lower mean indicates a better perception of safety climate. This method of scoring identies areas of nonuniformity in safety focus that are of potential concern and that might benet from interventions to improve the safety climate. Data for characteristics of respondents' jobs were obtained from the 2004 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals. Using these data, we determined hospitals' nurse stafng ratios, bed size, teaching status, national census region, and urban or nonurban location (see Table 1). Approval from relevant Institutional Review Boards was granted before conducting the studies.1566 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)Table 1: Respondents' Individual and Facility Characteristics VariablesU.S. (N 513,841) VA (N 54,581) N% N % Individual characteristics Age 12.6No 10,455 82.2 3,778 87.4 Employment in high hazard unit 2,716 22.6 731 17.5No w Major teaching 4,900 35.4 3,155 68.9Minor teaching 3,176 23.0 1,045 22.8 Non-teaching 5,765 Urban z Yes 11,643 84.1 2,198 15.9 129 2.8 stafng ratio Mean (SD) 12.1 (4.2) 9.7 (4.1) Note.

The U.S. hospital sample represented non-VA public and private acute-care hospitals, approximately equally divided among U.S. census regions and size categories. The VA sample represented a balanced geographic distribution of VA hospitals in four performance strata based on AHRQ's Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) (low, medium, high, and other), to minimize selection bias. Details of the sampling strategies have been summarized elsewhere (Hartmann et al. 2008; Singer et al. 2009). Although we did not stratify the U.S. sample based on performance, the sample included 69 hospitals whose PSI rates were similar to those of all U.S. hospitals. Our recruitment strategy, however, dictated that average size and related characteristics would differ from the U.S. average (Singer et al. 2009). In addition, despite recruitment efforts, hospitals from the Midwest were un- derrepresented in our sample compared with the U.S. average. The VA sample included 30 hospitals, i ncluding eight facilities each from the high, medium, and other PSI rate strata, and six from the low stratum. The VA facilities represented a balanced geogra phic distribution within each PSI stratum, with the exception of no low PSI hospitals in the West (Rosen et al. 2008). Administration of Surveys U.S. hospital survey administration took place from July 2006 to May 2007; the VA administration was conducted from December 2005 to May 2006. In both groups we sampled 100 percent of senior managers, dened as depart- ment head or above; 100 percent of active hospital-based physicians; and a random 10 percent of all other employees. Senior managers and physicianswere over-sampled because of their relatively small numbers and their po- tentially low response rates, respectively. For U.S. hospitals, we also sampled 100 percent of employees in three work areas in 12 larger hospitals with relatively high response rates in a 2004 survey administration so as to permit work-area-level analyses while maintaining respondent condentiality. In these hospitals, we over-sampled employees in work areas that in 2004 were least likely to meet our 10-respondent minimum reporting requirement: laboratories (lab), operating rooms (ORs), and intensive care units (ICUs). Budget constraints drove this selection approach. In the VA, to allow for analysis of work areas in which employees conduct work of intrinsically greater hazard, we also sampled 100 percent of employees in certain work areas in 10 randomly selected hospitals.1568 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)T h es p e c i cw o r ka r e a sw e r et h eO R ,p o s t a n e s t h e s i ac a r eu n i t ,I C U ,a n de m e r - gency department. In this paper, we refer to these as ''high hazard units'' (HHUs). The sampling frames in U.S. and VA hospitals consisted of 36,375 and 9,309 personnel, respectively. Both samples excluded individuals who no longer worked at the facility and those who used a survey response postcard to indicate that they did not wish to participate. Analysis of Data Weighting of Data . Two U.S. hospitals were excluded from analysis because AHA data suggested improbably high nurse stafng ratios. One VA hospitalwas dropped because it returned data for physicians only. For the remaining hospitals, we employed weighting techniques to reflect the two sampling frames accurately (Singer et al. 2003; Hartmann et al. 2008). Identical weighting calculations were performed for each sample. First, we determined separate sampling and nonresponse weights. Regarding the latter, for the U.S. hospital sample we calculated a nonresponse weight for each workgroup (senior managers, physicians, and other employees) within each hospital. In VA hospitals, we calculated four nonresponse weights: for senior managers, physicians, HHU employees, and regular staff for each hospital. Then, in both samples, we multiplied the nonresponse and sampling weights and used the resulting ''combined weight'' to calculate a proportional weight thataccounted for hospital size differences. Statistical Analysis . For all analyses, the unit of analysis was the individual. Initially, we compared sample characteristics of respondents in U.S. and VA hospitals. We compared overall mean PPR in each hospital, graphically distinguishing hospitals from the U.S. and VA samples. We assessed internalconsistency reliability for the 12 dimensions of the PSCHO instrument by calculating Cronbach's acoefcients for proposed dimensions for each sample. We compared average PPR among U.S. and VA hospitals for each item and dimension. The dependent variable for all statistical models was PPR for each individual across all 39 PSCHO surv ey items, a summary measure we call ''safety climate overall.'' All models inc luded variables describing individual respondents (i.e., gender, age, length of time at institution, job type, management category, and employment in HHU) and the facilities in which they worked (i.e., geographic region, hospital size, urb an location, and nurse stafng ratio). Teaching status was not included in the models because major teaching status was correlated with large hospital size ( r50.5,po. 0 0 1 )i nb o t hs a m p l e s .Comparing Safety Climate between Two Populations 1569We examined the relationship between PPR and respondent character- istics in the United States and VA by estimating a separate hierarchical linear model (HLM) for each sample. To test the appropriateness of using two-levelHLM to account for nesting of individual s within hospitals, we rst ran random e f f e c t sA N O V A' ' e m p t y ' 'm o d e l st h a t included no independent variables (Snijders and Bosker 1999). Comparison of the two-level models with the linear regressions revealed signicant differenc es at the hospital level in both samples (w 25449 and 21 for U.S. and VA hospitals, respectively; both po.001), indicating that there were meaningful differences in PPR among staff from different hospitals and that two-level random intercept models were preferred. The models did not assume that PPR was uniformly represented within a facility; rather, they allowed for variation within and across facilities at the individual level. We did not use three-level HLMs to account for work-area variance due to limitations of the work-area data. To examine variance in observed sample characteristics between the U.S. and VA hospitals and differential effects of sample characteristics on PPR in the two groups, we conducted a regression-based decomposition approach developed by Oaxaca and Blinder (Blinder 1973; Oaxaca 1973). Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition has been broadly applied in the economics literature and more recently in health services research (Kirby, Taliaferro, and Zuvekas 2006; Shen and Long 2006; Hudson, Miller, and Kirby 2007). We refer to systematic variance between the two samples in characteristics associated with safety climate as the ''sample-characteristics component''because it is explained by observable variation in sample characteristics. We estimated the sample-characteristics component by using the U.S. hospital model estimates as the reference model. The residual difference in PPR between the two samples is called the ''unexplained component'' and includes (a) differential effects of the sample characteristics in the model between the two health care systems, and (b) differences in unobserved factors such as differences in characteristics of patients. Thus, the sample- characteristics component in our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition measures the expected difference in PPR assuming that the same model is applicable to both systems, and the unexplained component measures the extent to which theeffects of observed and unobserved characteristics in the models differ between U.S. and VA hospitals. In other words, the unexplained component indicates how the U.S. and VA samples would differ if the distribution of the sample characteristics were exactly the same. Analyses were conducted using Stata (version 9.2), including the Oaxaca module ( Jann 2008) for the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.1570 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)RESULTS Survey Response Among the 67 U.S. hospitals studied, 13,841 individuals responded to the survey (41 percent). Response rates for individual hospitals ranged from 13 to 100 percent. Response also varied by type of personnel, with 62 percent of senior managers, 20 percent of physicians, and 50 percent of frontline em- ployees responding. For the 29 VA hospitals, we obtained an overall response rate of 50 percent (4,581 respondents). Response rates varied among hospitals (26- 73 percent) and among personnel (69 percent for senior managers, 38 percent physicians, 38 percent HHU personnel, and 60 percent other staff). Comparison of Sample Characteristics All comparisons between the demographic characteristics of U.S. and VA samples revealed statistically signicant differences ( po.001; Table 1). Re- spondents in U.S. hospitals were considerably younger than those in VA hospitals. U.S. hospital personnel also worked less time at their facility and were less likely to be male. They were more likely than VA personnel to work in HHUs and to be nurses and senior managers. In the U.S. sample, respon- dents more often worked in hospitals from the West, categorized as large, and with higher nurse stafng ratios. They were less often in major teaching hos-pitals and urban areas. Safety-Climate Perceptions by Hospital The graph displays the overall PPR and 95 percent condence interval for each of the 96 hospitals in our study, displayed from lowest PPR (best safety climate) to highest (worst safety climate), differentiating between U.S. and VA hospitals. The range in safety climate among U.S. hospitals is larger than among VA hospitals, based on point estimates. In U.S. hospitals PPR varied from 7.7 to 24.5 percent, and in VA hospitals the range was 11.6-23.3 percent. More than twice as many VA hospitals fell in the bottom half of the distri- bution ( n521) than in the top ( n58). The results, however, place individual VA hospitals among both the top 10 and bottom 10 hospitals surveyed, and uncertainty in the point estimates suggests few meaningful differences be- tween U.S. and VA hospitals (Figure 1).Comparing Safety Climate between Two Populations 1571Comparison of Safety-Climate Perceptions Table 2 presents survey results by item and dimension. Cronbach's a's for all dimensions were within an acceptable range (0.6-0.8) except for ''Fear of Shame'' (0.4) and ''Fear of Blame and Punishment'' (0.5). The low reliabilitiesfor the latter two scales reflect the reduced number of common items remain- ing after dropping those items that were not phrased identically in the U.S. and VA surveys.

For 10 of the 12 individual dimensions, mean PPR was lower in U.S. than in VA hospitals. However, a smaller per- centage of VA than U.S. respondents indicated fear of blame or punishment and that they witnessed or participated in unsafe care. Relationship of Safety Climate and Sample Characteristics All respondent characteristics, with the exception of time worked in the hos- pital, related signicantly and in the same direction to safety climate overall in both samples (Table 3a). Being male and a nurse were positively related to PPR (worse safety climate), while age 450, being a senior manager and working in an HHU were negatively correlated with PPR (better safety cli- mate). The magnitude of these correlations, however, differed somewhat by sample. PPR among men was higher than among women by 0.8 and 2.6percentage points in U.S. and VA hospitals, respectively. PPR among senior managers was lower than among nonsenior managers by 4.6 percentage points in U.S. hospitals and by 7.3 percentage points in the VA.Table 2.

VA, Veterans Health Administration.Comparing Safety Climate between Two Populations 1575In contrast, characteristics of the facilities in which respondents worked related to safety climate in considerably different ways in the two samples. For U.S. hospitals, all facility characteristics with the exception of urban location related signicantly to safety climate. For example, larger size was associated with higher PPR while a higher nurse stafng ratio was associated with lower PPR. In the VA, only working in the South and in an urban location were signicantly correlated with safety climate, and in both instances the direction of correlation was opposite that of U.S. hospitals. VA employees working in the South had higher PPR than VA employees in the West. However, em- ployees in Western U.S. hospitals had higher PPR than all other regions. VA employees working in urban hospitals had higher PPR than employees work- ing in nonurban locations; the opposite was true for U.S. hospital employees. Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition of Safety-Climate Results The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis allowed us to quantify the extent to which the predicted difference in PPR between the U.S. and VA hospitalsTable 3a: Association of Individual Mean Percent Problematic Response (PPR) with Individual and Facility Characteristics VariableHierarchical Linear Models Coefcient (SE) U.S. VA Individual characteristics Male 0.843n/C00.37 2.628nn/C00.63 Age450 years /C01.990nn/C00.34 nurse Veterans Health Administration.1576 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)was due to (a) variation in the two systems' distributions of sample charac- teristics (sample characteristics component) and (b) differences in the U.S. and VA model characteristics as expressed by the values of the coefcients(unexplained component). The model calculated the difference between sample characteristics and unexplained components based on the coefcients from the U.S. hospital model for each variable and the difference between the distributions of each characteristic for each sample. That is, ^Y VA/C0^YU:S:\u00bc ^bU:S:\u00f0XVA/C0XU:S:\u00degives the effect of the difference in characteristic Xbetween U.S. and VA hospitals on the predicted PPR, using the U.S. hospital model (i.e., ^bU:S:) as the reference. The net difference in safety climate, based on the predicted means of the U.S. and VA models, was 1.39 higher predicted PPR for the VA (Table 3b). Some of this difference was attributable to observed sample characteristics. For example, male respondents had higher PPR in VA than U.S. hospitals Table 3b: Differences in U.S. and VA Safety Climate, Decomposition Results Mean [95% CI]/(SE) Predicted mean PPR for Non-VA 15.3 [16.1-17.2] VA 16.7 [14.9-15.6] Total difference between U.S. and VA (based on predicted means)1.39nn/C00.33 Difference attributable to variation inw Male 0.108n/C00.048 Age450 years /C00.298nn/C00.054 Time at facility 410 years 0.036 /C00.046 Being nurse /C00.115nn/C00.034 Being senior manager 0.032n/C00.015 Employment in HHU /C00.373nn/C00.05 Region South 0.041n/C00.02 /C00.07 Nurse stafng ratio 0.237nn/C00.07 Difference attributable to variation in sample characteristics /C00.766nn/C00.16 Difference attributable to differences in model coefcients (differential effects of sample characteristics)2.160nn/C00.35 nnpo.01,npo.05. wThese use U.S. model estimates from Table 3a reference.

Because the VA also had more male respondents, the result was a higher predicted PPR for the VA sample\u2014 \u2014on average by 0.108 percentage points (Table 3b). On the other hand, the impact of the VA sample havingmore respondents older than 50 than the U.S. sample was that the VA's predicted PPR for this factor was /C00.298, because this characteristic was associated with lower PPR. The aggregate impact of variation between U.S. and VA hospitals in the distribution of sample characteristics was /C00.766, suggesting that the predicted VA PPR should be 0.77 percentage points lower than that for U.S. hospitals (based on the U.S. hospital sample as the refer- ence). However, the unexplained component accounted for a larger portion of the difference in safety climate between U.S. and VA hospitals than the sample characteristics component. The differential effects of observed characteristics (i.e., differences in model coefcients) plus differences in unobserved char- acteristics predicted average PPR in the VA to be 2.160 percentage pointshigher than in U.S. hospitals. DISCUSSION This study is the rst to compare hospital safety climate between two funda-mentally different sets of hospitals: one a nationally integrated hospital net- work, the other predominantly independent general acute-care hospitals. The study summarizes safety climate in the VA and other U.S. hospitals and factors influencing safety climate in each setting. Results also show how sample characteristics contribute to differences in safety climate between settings. Overall, we found no difference in safety climate between U.S. and VA hospitals on average, based on descriptive statistics. Differences with respectto specic dimensions were signicant, generally favoring U.S. hospitals. However, the range in safety-climate results among U.S. hospitals substan- tially overlapped, suggesting that neither population has achieved superior safety climate. In addition, relative to high reliability organizations, such as naval aviation, which serve as the ''gold standard'' for safety achievement despite hazardous and demanding conditions, safety climate in both U.S. and VA settings was considerably worse (Gaba et al. 2003). This nding does not support our rst hypothesis, that participating in a nationally integrated hos- pital network would be associated with stronger safety climate. It appears thatpotential advantages associated with the system's intense focus on safety im- provement and its ability to implement uniformly its improvement program may have been outweighed by local considerations. While institutional pro-1578 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)grams may facilitate the ability of local managers to improve safety, they may not be targeted closely enough to the actual challenges of the workplace to make a difference alone. We also found that characteristics of individuals influenced safety climate consistently across settings when controlling for other factors. Older age and more seniority corresponded to more positive perceptions of safety climate, while working as a nurse or in an HHU were associated with more negative perceptions. These ndings are consistent with studies showing perceptions of safety climate differ by workgroup and management level (Pronovost et al. 2003; Sexton et al. 2006c; Singer et al. 2008a, 2009). In contrast, facility characteristics influenced safety climate differently in U.S. and VA samples. Working in southern and urban facilities corresponded with higher PPR among VA employees and lower PPR in the U.S. sample. Other studies have found similarly mixed results regarding effects of geographicaland structural characteristics within non-VA hospitals (Baldwin et al. 2004; Coburn et al. 2004; Loux, Payne, and Knott 2005; Longo et al. 2007). Also consistent with prior studies (Aiken et al. 2002; Stone et al. 2007; Weissman et al. 2007), we found that higher nurse stafng ratios were associated with lower PPR in U.S. hospitals. Decomposition analysis examined the influence of (1) variation in the distribution of observed sample characteristics among personnel in an inte- grated network compared with other U.S. hospitals and (2) differential effects of sample characteristics in each group. The overall difference between the sam-ples, that is, the influence of (1) and (2) together, was a 1.4 percentage point higher PPR for the VA. We hypothesized that variations in sample charac- teristics between settings would explain more of this difference in safety climate than would differences in effects of those sample characteristics. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Instead, it was the differential effects of sample characteristics that explained more of the difference in safety climate between U.S. and VA hospitals. The difference based on the distribution of all the VA sample characteristics compared with U.S. characteristics was negative, indi- cating that the VA would be expected to have a 0.77 percentage point lower PPR based on observed sample characteristics alone. The unexplained differ- ence, indicating the differential effect of sample characteristics, was 2.2 per- centage points higher PPR in VA than in U.S. hospitals. This second difference was driven primarily by two factors: region and location, both of which act in opposite directions on PPR in the U.S. and VA models, and by unobserved characteristics. Decomposition of the residual suggests that our model explained just 5.9 percent of the variation in the outcome measure. FutureComparing Safety Climate between Two Populations 1579research should explore additional characteristics of hospitals and factors driv- ing the effects of region and location in order to determine whether some modiable factors may be involved that could provide leverage for change. Our results suggest that characteristics of respondents and their work facilities influence safety-climate scores. Thus, in comparing safety climate among hospitals or over time in hospitals whose respondent characteristics may have changed, it is important to include known characteristics in ana- lyses. Such longitudinal studies would also provide opportunity for research on how the effects of respondent characteristics on PPR change over time. Results should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. This was a cross-sectional study; thus, we cannot make assertions about causality. We cannot explain the mechanisms underlying effects of various factors on safety climate. Nor can we differentiate the effect on safety climate of observed from unobserved characteristics in the unexplained componentof the difference between samples. We cannot rule out nonresponse bias as a factor in our results. The methodology in both settings aimed to maximize response rates while maintaining the voluntary and anonymous nature of the surveys. While the VA sample achieved a response rate that is similar to that of other studies of this type (Asch, Jedrziewski, and Christakis 1997; Jepson et al. 2005), the overall response rate in the U.S. sample was lower. We adjusted for nonresponse and sampling bias through the use of weights in our analysis; however, it is possible that results do not accurately represent the facilities or populations intended. A related issue is the representativeness ofthe hospitals in each sample. We conducted a stratied random sampling strategy in both settings, but since participation was voluntary, sampled fa- cilities may differ from facilities in their respective populations in unantic- ipated ways. As noted, administration dates and recruitment and sampling strategies also differed slightly between U.S. and VA samples. Although recruited on the basis of size and region rather than PSI rates, those rates among the U.S. hospital sample did not differ from those of U.S. hospitals overall. In addition, within the U.S. hospital sample we found no difference when we compared overall mean PPR between over-sampled hospitals and the other hospitals in that sample. Finally, while our models included vari- ables associated with safety climate in the literature, we were limited byvariables available in our datasets. Nevertheless, the methodology employed in our study represents an advance over prior research. In particular, the decomposition analysis pro- vides information about systematic differences in sample characteristics and the effects of specic characteristics on safety climate in different settings. By1580 HSR: Health Services Research 44:5, Part I (October 2009)achieving a more thorough understanding of what is driving apparent differ- ences in safety-climate survey results among hospitals we can proceed more clearly toward developing effective improvement interventions. The results presented suggest that continued efforts are needed to im- prove safety climate in hospitals. While participation in systems can provide some advantages in this regard, the large unexplained component of safety climate from the regression estimates suggests that other factors, such as hos- pitals' emphasis on creativity and innovation and their leaders' abilities to motivate, implement, and sustain improvement, may matter more.

BACKGROUND: Unhealthy alcohol use is prevalent but under-diagnosed in primary care settings. OBJECTIVE: To validate, in primary care, a single-item screening test for unhealthy alcohol use recommendedby the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco- holism (NIAAA). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult English-speaking patients recruited from primary care waiting rooms. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked the single screening question, \"How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day? \", where X is 5 for men and 4 for women, and a response of >1i s considered positive. Unhealthy alcohol use was defined as the presence of an alcohol use disorder, as deter-mined by a standardized diagnostic interview, or risky consumption, as determined using a validated 30-day calendar method. MAIN RESULTS: Of 394 eligible primary care patients, 286 (73%) completed the interview. The single-question screen was 81.8% sensitive (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.5%) and 79.3% specific (95% CI 73.1%to 84.4%) for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use. It was slightly more sensitive (87.9%, 95% CI 72.7% to 95.2%) but was less specific (66.8%, 95% CI 60.8% to72.3%) for the detection of a current alcohol usedisorder. Test characteristics were similar to that of a commonly used three-item screen, and were affected very little by subject demographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The single screening question recom- mended by the NIAAA accurately identified unhealthy alcohol use in this sample of primary care patients.These findings support the use of this brief screen inprimary care. KEY WORDS: alcohol screening test; alcoholics; primary Med 24(7):783 -8 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-0928-6 \u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 INTRODUCTION Unhealthy alcohol use, the spectrum from risky consumption to the alcohol use disorders, alcohol abuse and dependence, isprevalent in the primary care setting and is under-diagnosed 1. Screening and brief intervention by primary care physicians for those with unhealthy alcohol use reduces risky consump- tion2. Because of this, practice guidelines recommend univer- sal screening3. Time is limited, however, and commonly-used alcohol screening instruments are comprised of multiple questions, often do not cover the full spectrum of unhealthyuse, can be time consuming to administer and may require scoring 4,5. Consequently, many patients are not screened6,7. Single-question screening tests for unhealthy alcohol use mayhelp to increase the frequency of screening in primary care. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommends, in its clinician 's guide, one such single- question screen for unhealthy alcohol use 8. The recommended question asks \"How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day? \"(where X is 5 for men and 4 for women, and a response of 1 is considered positive). While similar single-question screens (which used different phrasing, alcohol quantity and time cutoffs) have been validated in various settings, the NIAAA recommended screening test hasnot been validated in the primary care setting 9-12.B e c a u s eo f the wide dissemination of this guide and practice recommen- dation, we attempted to validate this version of the screeningquestion in a sample of primary care patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects Subjects were selected by a research associate who systemat- ically approached patients in the waiting room of a primary care clinic in an urban safety net hospital. Prior to being approached for eligibility screening patients saw no advertise-ment or indication by the research associate as to what the study was about. Patients who were under the age of 18 wereReceived August 17, 2008 Revised January 14, 2009Accepted January 23, 2009Published online February 27, 2009JGIM 783excluded, as were those who, in the judgment of the research associate, would be unable to complete the questionnaire because of limited English, cognitive impairment or acuteillness. People in the waiting room accompanying patients who reported not themselves being patients of the clinic were also excluded. The Institutional Review Board of BostonUniversity Medical Center reviewed and approved all study procedures. Data Collection Interviews were conducted by trained research staff in a private setting and data were recorded anonymously, unac-companied by any unique identifiers. Screening Question. In accordance with the strategy recom- mended in the NIAAA Clinician 's Guide, subjects were first asked a pre-screening question, \"Do you sometimes drink alcoholic beverages? \", and then the single screening question, \"How many times in the past year have you had X or more drinks in a day? \"(where X is 5 for men and 4 for women, and a response of 1 is considered positive). Subjects responding negatively to the pre-screening question were still asked the single screening question. If asked to clarify, the researchassociate provided definitions of a standard drink (12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof spirits). For comparison purposes, the three-item Alcohol Use DisordersIdentification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) was administered following the single-question screen and before the other assessments 13. After this, alcohol consumption and the pres- ence or absence of an alcohol use disorder were assessed using reference standards. Risky Alcohol Consumption Amounts. A validated calendar- based method (the timeline followback) was used for themeasurement of alcohol consumption 14. Using this method, subjects estimated the amount of alcohol consumed on each of the 30 days preceding the interview (summarized in analysesusing the same standard drink definitions that appear above). Subjects were considered to have consumed risky amounts of alcohol if their average weekly alcohol intake over thepreceding 30 days exceeded recommended limits (>14 drinks per week for men and >7 drinks per week for women) or if they reported exceeding recommended daily limits (>4 drinks peroccasion for men and >3 drinks per occasion for women) onany of the 30 days 15. Average weekly alcohol intake was calculated by multiplying by 7 the average number of standard drinks consumed per day during the 30 days. Alcohol Related Problems. Subjects were then asked if they had ever experienced any of a list of problems related to alcohol use, from the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP)16. Subjects were considered to have alcohol related problems if they consumed risky amounts of alcohol and responded positively to any of the 15 SIP questions. Alcohol Use Disorders. The computerized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Substance Abuse Module was used for the assessment of current (12-month) alcohol use disorders (abuse and dependence)17.This structured questionnaire was administered by the research assistant, and subject responses were recorded electronically. The responses were then analyzed, using an algorithm, to yield aDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Subjects with alcohol abuse or dependence as determined by theCIDI and who reported experiencing symptoms within the past 12 months were considered to have a current alcohol use disorder. Unhealthy Alcohol Use. Subjects with unhealthy alcohol use either consumed risky amounts of alcohol (with or without associated alcohol problems), or had a current alcohol use disorder based on (as defined above) the timeline followbackand the CIDI, respectively. STATITICAL ANALYSIS We calculated the sensitivity (proportion of subjects with thecondition of interest who tested positive), specificity (propor-tion of subjects without the condition of interest who testednegative) and likelihood ratios for the single-question screen for the detection of risky alcohol consumption amounts, risky consumption associated with problems, a current alcohol usedisorder, or for unhealthy alcohol use in general (either the consumption of risky amounts or a disorder, the usual target for universal screening). A positive likelihood ratio is deter-mined by dividing the sensitivity by (1 - specificity), while a negative likelihood ratio is (1 - sensitivity) divided by the specificity. The NIAAA clinician 's guide recommends a two- step screening process: subjects are asked if they sometimesdrink alcoholic beverages, and only those who answer affirma- tively are asked the screening question. In the main analysis we determined the test characteristics of this approach. In asensitivity analysis we also determined the test characteristics of the single-question alone, without regard to the response to the pre-screening question. For comparison with the single-question screen, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios of the AUDIT-C for the detection of the same conditions. The AUDIT-C, which consists of three items, eachwith four possible responses, yields a score between 0 and 12. A total of more than three points is considered a positive test 18. We calculated 95% confidence intervals using publishedformulas 19. Statistical analyses were performed using Version 9.1 of the SAS System (copyright SAS Institute Inc.). RESULTS Subject recruitment. Of the 1,781 people approached, 903 (51%) agreed to be screened for study eligibility (Fig. 1). Of these, 509 (56%) were ineligible for the study: 302 (33%) did not speak English, and 207 (23%) were not clinic patients. Of the 394 patients who were eligible, 4 (1%) refused toparticipate and 87 (22%) did not show up for the plannedinterview after the visit with their physician. Of the 303 subjects who arrived and gave consent to participate, 3 (1%) were unable to complete the interview. The data of 14 subjects784 Smith et al.: Single-Question Alcohol Screening Test JGIM(5%) were lost due to an electronic error, leaving 286 subjects whose data were analyzed (73% of those eligible). Subject Characteristics. Of the 286 subjects, 54% were women, and the median age was 49 (range 21 -86) (Table 1). The majority of subjects (63%) identified themselves as black or African-American, with whites (17%) and Hispanics (16%)comprising most of the remainder. Most (78%) had completedhigh school, but only 14% had completed college. Unhealthy alcohol use was reported by 31% of subjects: 6% consumed risky amounts but did not have alcohol-related problems or adisorder; 13% consumed risky amounts and had problems but no current disorder; and 12% had a current alcohol use disorder (2% of subjects reported a past year alcohol usedisorder, but not past month risky consumption). The lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorders (44%) and drug use disorders (47%) was high. Test Characteristics. The single-question screen was 81.8% sensitive (95% CI 72.5% 79.3% specific (95% CI 73.1% to 84.4%) for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use(Table 2). It was slightly more sensitive (87.9%, 95% CI 72.7% to 95.2%) and was less specific (66.8%, 95% CI 60.8% to72.3%) for the detection of a current alcohol use disorder.The longer AUDIT-C screen was slightly less sensitive (73.9%, 95% CI 63.8% to 81.9%) for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use and slightly more specific (82.8%, 95% CI 77.0% to 87.4%)for the detection of an alcohol use disorder, but overall its test characteristics were similar to those of the single-question screen. Subject gender, ethnicity, education and primarylanguage affected point estimates of the sensitivity andspecificity of the single item screen very little, though some groups had small sample sizes and so larger differences could not be excluded (Table 3). In a sensitivity analysis, disregardingthe pre-screening question response resulted in slightly increased sensitivity (87.5%, 95% CI 79.0% to 92.9%), and CI 67.2% to 79.4%) for thedetection of unhealthy alcohol use, when compared to analysis of responses to the single item screening question only when the patient reported sometimes using alcohol. CONCLUSION A single-question screen was sensitive and specific for thedetection of unhealthy alcohol use in a sample of primary carepatients. Its test characteristics were similar to those of a Table 1.

Unhealthy alcohol use is prevalent in primary care, and brief intervention in this setting effectively reduces consump-tion among those without dependence, and improves patientoutcomes 1,2.L a c ko fd e t e c t i o no fu n h e a l t h ya l c o h o lu s e , however, stands as a barrier to such treatment6.T i m e constraints in the primary care setting have been cited as areason for non-adherence to screening and prevention guide- lines in general, and for the under-diagnosis of unhealthy alcohol use specifically (according to one estimate, providingall recommended preventive services to an average primary care panel would require 7.4 hours out of each work day) 24. Among the best validated options for alcohol screening inprimary care settings are the CAGE questionnaire, the AUDIT,and the MAST 25-27. More recently, and therefore with fewer validation studies in general care settings, researchers have tested instruments as short as single items and as long as 80items requiring scoring algorithms and keys for interpreta- tion 10,28. One widely known brief screening tool, the CAGE questionnaire, while accurately identifying more severe un-healthy alcohol use (i.e. dependence), was not developed to detect risky consumption amounts or alcohol problems that are more amenable to brief interventions in primary care 29. The MAST similarly identifies alcohol dependence and is less well validated for detecting risky use and at 25 items (or 10 items for a briefer version) does not present advantages inlength 25. The 10-item AUDIT, although well-validated for detecting risky drinking, is less well known or used by primary care physicians, likely in part because it requires scoring and it is not easily memorized for incorporation into the medicalinterview. The AUDIT and A SSIST may have promise as electronic record systems with decision support become morewidespread (and as evidence for the validity of the ASSIST accumulates). The ASSIST has one other major limitation \u2014it does not directly identify risky consumption amounts. The single-question screen proposed by Williams et al. is notidentical to that recommended by the NIAAA but it too hasproven to be accurate for identifying unhealthy alcohol use among emergency department patients, in primary care, and among respondents to a household survey 9,10,12. In summary, in terms of brevity, ease of scoring, and validity for detecting the conditions of interest in primary care, and therefore, likely greater ease for widespread implementation as recommendedby practice guidelines, the single item recommended by NIAAA appears to have favorable characteristics. The results we report are similar to those from studies using different populations and different formulations of the single-question alcohol screen. This study adds to existing literature by validating the version recommended by the NIAAA in a sample of primary care patients \u2014one of the main populations in which it was intended to be used. This version of the single- question screen was derived from a national household survey on alcohol use, the results of which were reported by Dawson,et al. 15. While they did not report test characteristics, and although the subjects were not primary care patients, analysis of their published results yields a sensitivity of 89.8% and aspecificity of 68.3% for the detection of a current alcohol use disorder, results which were very close to those reported in the current study. In addition to being recommended for wide-spread use by a health authority, the question phrasingnormalizes drinking of large amounts likely increasing honesty in replies, and it directly queries amounts that are defined as risky by national guidelines. The similar single-questionscreen proposed by Williams et al. that used different cut-off values ( 'When was the last time you had more than X drinks in Table 3.

A third formulation of the single-question screen, using the third question of the AUDIT and its multiple response options ( 'How often in the last year have you had 6 or more drinks on one occasion 'with a response other than 'never 'considered a positive screen), had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 83% for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use in a sample of male veteran primary care patients, though the sensitivity was lower in a separate study of femaleveterans (both findings confirmed in subsequent studies of non-veterans) 11,13,20,21. These comparisons suggest that using slightly different cut-offs or changing the phrasing of thequestion affects the test characteristics to only a small degree. In order for a screening test for unhealthy alcohol use to be useful, it must be applicable to the broad range of people seenin primary care. The diversity of our subject sample allowed us to examine the effect of gender, ethnicity, primary language and education on the accuracy of the single-question screen.While variations were seen in the sensitivity and specificity ofthe test across these groups, the differences were small. The single-question screen performed well in an urban, predomi- nately minority population, a population different from thosein which single-question screens had been tested previously. This, taken together with the results of the other studies, conducted in a number of different settings, of the other single-question screens that similarly ask about heavy drinking, lends strong support to their use. Our study has several limitations. Almost half of the patients approached in the primary care waiting room refusedto be screened for eligibility in the study, and approximately one fourth of eligible subjects did not complete the study. A lack of information about those who did not participate raisesthe possibility that those studied were not representative of primary care patients, potentially limiting the generalizability of our results. A higher than expected proportion of subjectsreported substance use disorders, likely reflecting the fact that they were recruited from an urban safety-net hospital located in a community where the prevalence of such problems is high,but potentially also reflecting selection bias. The evaluation of a test in an atypical population can result in spectrum bias if, for instance, the unusual severity of the condition renders itmore or less easily detectable. While the very close approxima-tion of our results to those of this question and similar questions in other settings suggests that such bias, if present, is small, further study of the question 's test characteristics in a more affluent, lower-risk population may be justified. A limitation of the NIAAA recommended question, and, as far as we know, of the other single-question screens, is that theyhave not yet been validated languages other than English. This represents another potential future area of study. Subjects were also assured anonymity, a condition which improves theaccuracy of the reference standard interview but which mayalso serve to over-estimate the accuracy of the screening test itself. This is consistent, however, with the methodology of most other alcohol screening test studies. The single-question screen accurately identified subjects with unhealthy alcohol use. Some patients who screen positive will have severe alcohol use disorders requiring referral tosubstance abuse treatment, while those who consume exces- sive amounts of alcohol but have not experienced severe health or interpersonal problems would benefit from brief interven-tion by the primary care provider. The lack of an efficient way to distinguish these two groups (the NIAAA Clinician 's Guide recommends following up a positive screening test with 13questions about drinking amounts and alcohol problems), is a challenge that must be addressed when implementing screen- ing for unhealthy alcohol use. The AUDIT and ASSIST, inproviding scores, provide a measure of severity. Even thoughthey may be too long for universal screening in many settings, they might be done as brief assessments after a single-item screening question is answered in the affirmative. But thisapproach has not been tested or validated. Vinson et al. found that two follow-up questions (about drinking in hazardous situations and drinking more or for longer than intended)could identify alcohol use disorders among those with a positive response to a single-question screen 30. This approach, if validated, might represent a more efficient solution thanapplying a longer test to all patients. The single-question screen recommended by the NIAAA accurately identified unhealthy alcohol use in this sample ofprimary care patients. The sensitivity and specificity of thissingle question was comparable to that reported for longer instruments in other studies. These findings of validity support the use of this brief screen in primary care asrecommended by NIAAA, which should, in turn, help with the implementation of universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use as recommended by national practice guidelines.

Sobel \u00c6Michael K. Paasche-Orlow \u00c6 Katherine R. Waite \u00c6Sarah S. Rittner \u00c6 Elizabeth A. H. Wilson \u00c6Michael S. Wolf Published online: 8 April 2009 /C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Asthma 1-2-3 is a newly-developed low-liter- acy multimedia education tool designed to promote asthma self-care concepts among African American adults. Anexpert panel ( n=10) informed content development for the tool. The video script and storyboard imagery were shown to 30 African Americans recruited from the Amer-ican Lung Association, whose reactions and comments guided further revisions. The nal version was pilot tested in three diverse community settings in Chicago to deter-mine the efcacy of Asthma 1-2-3 at improving patient understanding of asthma and its symptoms. In all, 130 adults participated in the pilot test. Knowledge scoressignicantly improved from pretest to posttest following presentation of the developed tool for subjects across all literacy levels were the least understood. Individuals with low literacy had less total knowledge score gains comparedto those with marginal and adequate literacy (1.8, 2.6, and3.2 respectively; P=0.002). The multimedia tool signi- cantly improved understanding of asthma. Individuals with limited literacy may require additional instruction, repeatedviewing, or added tangible cues (i.e. supplementary print materials) to support knowledge retention. In general, feedback from the target population was particularlyhelpful in the development of the tool and its initial eval- uation, and should be considered as a necessary step in the creation of other patient education materials. Keywords Asthma /C1Education /C1Knowledge /C1 Multimedia /C1Health literacy Introduction African American men and women in the United States are disproportionately likely to be living with asthma whencompared to other groups [ 1,2]. Several studies have documented this racial disparity, such as Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (CDC) data that has shown that between 1998 and 2006 African Americans suffered from higher rates of asthma than nearly any other popu-lation [ 3]. Suggested causes for this disparity include poor living conditions, presence of known triggers such as dust and environmental pollutants, and inadequate disease self-management [ 1]. Recent studies have found limited 'health literacy'\u2014 one's capacity to obtain, process, and understand healthinformation in order to make appropriate decisions\u2014to be associated with poorer patient understanding of and inadequate self-care for chronic diseases, includingasthma [ 4-7]. In these and other health literacy studies, African American race has been linked to less education and inadequate literacy skills [ 8]. Recent evidence furtherR. M. Sobel ( &)/C1K. R. Waite /C1E. A.

Many presently available asthma education programs target children and young adults through the use of tech- nology such as multimedia education tools [ 12-14]. While this style of intervention has generally been proven effec-tive for this age group, such studies focusing on adults, particularly African Americans, are lacking. We sought to develop and pilot test a novel education tool called Asthma 1-2-3, that incorporates best practices derived from adult literacy and cognitive factors research and is culturallytailored to the African American community [ 15,16]. The goal of the tool is to simplify and standardize asthma education with the aim of assuring that patients have afunctional understanding of the disease and how to prevent and manage symptoms. Partnered with a clinic-based dis- semination strategy, the long-term goal for tools such asAsthma 1-2-3 is to support sustained improvement in health promoting behaviors and aid larger efforts targeting noted disparities between the African American populationand other non-minority populations. In this paper, we (1) review the patient-centered development process of Asthma 1-2-3, and (2) report preliminary evidence of itsefcacy based on pilot testing of the tool among commu- nity-dwelling African American adults with and without asthma. Methods Conceptual Framework Asthma 1-2-3 was developed based on the belief that proper communication of asthma-related concepts is a necessary precondition for maintaining appropriate healthbehaviors [ 17]. Even with information acquisition as a precursor, it is understood that knowledge alone does not always directly link to recommended actions. Asthma 1-2-3 utilizes a 'health literacy perspective', which includes adult learning and education principles as well as cognitive factors 'best practices' to increase comprehension amongpatients, regardless of literacy skills [ 18-23]. Doak et al. [16] provided early guidance through their Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) criteria in an effort to offeran objective means for effectively presenting medical information to patients with limited literacy. Criteria are specic to content, literacy demand, graphics, layout andtypography, learning stimulation/motivation, and the cul- tural appropriateness of materials. Furthermore, our mul- timedia tool utilizes aspects from cognitive factorsresearch, which recommends reducing the cognitive load placed on working memory by minimizing the number ofnew concepts introduced simultaneously, and by avoiding distracting, 'off-message' information [ 18,23-29]. Development of Asthma 1-2-3Asthma 1-2-3 is a multimedia curriculum designed to parsimoniously deliver actionable patient informationpromoting recommended asthma self-care behaviors. It is designed to be versatile, for use either by clinic staff in a primary care setting or by workers and nurses in the healthcare community at-large. The video is not interac- tive, but rather it introduces a limited number of asthmaconcepts at a time to be followed by the clinic staff or a community worker leading a 'teach-to-goal' strategy to reinforce learning. As a research tool there are many pos-sibilities for its use: the internet, clinic kiosks, a link within an electronic medical record for physician administration, or even as a DVD available for patients to take home. Working with an asthma expert panel (N =10; general internist, family practitioner, allergist, pharmacist, health literacy expert, two asthma nurses, and three AfricanAmerican adults living with asthma), content was gener- ated and categorized into three chapters, ranging from 1 /C145 to 5 minute in length each. Agreed upon chapter titleswere: (1) What is Asthma, (2a) Manage Your Asthma: Triggers, (2b) Manage Your Asthma: Medication, and (3) Monitor Your Asthma. Together, these chapters wereviewed as a core curriculum for patients, although addi- tional topics (e.g. Talking with Your Doctor, Your Action Plan) will be developed in the near future. Cognitive Interviews A preliminary video script with sample storyboard imagery was generated by the research team and reviewed by the expert panel. The research team revised each chapter'sscript based on panel feedback, and early video prototypes of the chapters were then developed. African American adult caregivers of children with asthma (N =13) were recruited through the American Lung Association to pro- vide comment on the language used in the video and chapter storyboards. Segments of the prototype video wereshown to each participant, followed by a series of probes to ascertain their functional understanding of the conveyed messages and their perspective on the language, narration,and visual imagery used. Comments were audio-recorded and reviewed by the research team to support specic revisions. All proposed revisions to the video were presented for approval to the expert panel. Once a version was approved by the research team and panel members, a second wave ofcognitive interviews was conducted. Seventeen African Americans recruited from one adult basic education322 J Community Health (2009) 34:321-327 123program course were interviewed individually for approx- imately 20 min after viewing the latest version of Asthma 1-2-3. Once the individual cognitive interviews were complete, a 45 min targeted discussion group was held.The group discussion addressed participants' general feedback of the tool, its effectiveness, and recommended changes. Comments were audio-taped for later transcrip-tion. Following the research teams' consideration of all participants' suggestions, the program went through a nal revision. Pilot TestThe nal version of the introductory chapter of the Asthma 1-2-3 curriculum was pilot tested among 130 AfricanAmerican adults, with and without asthma and with vary- ing literacy skills, in three diverse settings in the Chicago area to ascertain this chapter of the tool's efcacy for basicknowledge dissemination. A single-group, pretest-posttest design was implemented for this initial evaluation. Sample Subjects were African American adults recruited from three unique study sites in the Chicago area; a faith-based organization, an adult basic education center, and a general internal medicine ambulatory care clinic. Recruitment tookplace from August 2007 to January 2008. Participants were ineligible if they met any of the following exclusion cri- teria: (1) blindness or severely impaired vision not cor-rectable with eyeglasses; (2) deafness or hearing problems uncorrectable with a hearing aid; (3) too ill to participate; (4) non-English speaking. Approval for human subjectsresearch was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Northwestern University prior to consenting participants to the study. Measurement A structured interview protocol was developed to assess functional understanding of basic asthma concepts pre- sented in the rst chapter of Asthma 1-2-3. Participantswere questioned regarding their understanding of asthma as a disease, body parts affected, identication of asthma symptoms, recognition of the link between symptoms anddisease control, comprehension of the pathophysiology of asthma symptoms, and perception of the seriousness of the disease. Identical questionnaires were administered bothbefore and after the viewing of Asthma 1-2-3 for use in the pretest/posttest comparison. A total knowledge score was generated based on these assessments, with a range of 0 to12 for possible scores (each distinct concept worth one point). Classifying asthma as a disease, identifying thebody parts affected, and recognizing the link between asthma symptoms and disease control were worth one point each. Comprehension of the pathophysiology of asthma symptoms provided up to three points; one each forswelling, mucus, and airway tightness. Identication of asthma symptoms was worth up to six points, one point per symptom recognized in the video (Table 2). Participant literacy was assessed using the Rapid Esti- mate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), a health word recognition test used most frequently to assess adult health literacy in medical settings [ 30]. Participants were asked to read aloud 66 medical terms. Scores were deter-mined based on the total number of words pronounced correctly, with dictionary pronunciation being the scoring standard. Raw scores were then converted into one of fourreading grade levels: 3rd grade or less (0-18), 4th-6th grade (19-44), 7th-8th grade (45-60), and 9th grade and above (61-66). In health care studies, such as this one,where participants need only to be categorized as low (scores 0-44), marginal (scores 45-60) or adequate (scores 61-66) readers, the information provided by the REALM isgenerally sufcient. The REALM is highly correlated with standardized reading tests and the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) [ 31]. Procedure A total of 239 African American adults were approached between August 2007 and January 2008. In all, 130 par- ticipants were eligible and consented to the study amongthe three study sites ( Once consented, demographicdata was collected and a pretest measure of basic asthma concepts and a health literacy assessment (REALM) were administered. Participants then viewed the rst chapter ofAsthma 1-2-3 using a PC laptop computer equipped with Windows Media Player and an individual headset. After viewing the program, an immediate posttest measure ofunderstanding and recall, with questions identical to those presented in the pretest assessment, was conducted and participants received $10 for their participation. Analysis Plan The mean and standard deviation were calculated for par- ticipant age, and descriptive statistics were determined for all other categorical data. A McNemar's test for categoricalor dichotomous (i.e. correct/incorrect) data, or a paired t-test for continuous data was conducted to examine dif- ferences in knowledge before and after viewing chapter 1of Asthma 1-2-3 (as assessed through pre and posttest scores) and in participant characteristics (age, gender,J Community Health (2009) 34:321-327 323 123education, literacy level, asthma diagnosis). Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association between literacy and posttest knowledge score, while adjusting for pretest score, age, gender, education, andasthma diagnosis (self and/or relative). All statistical analyses were performed using STATA, version 9.0 (Col- lege Station, TX, USA). Results Sample CharacteristicsThe mean age of participants was 50.2 years and 76.2% were female (Table 1). Nearly one-fourth (22.3%) of par- ticipants had been diagnosed with asthma, and 63.8% had family members who suffered from the disease. More than 50% of participants reported having at least some collegeeducation. More than half of participants had limited lit- eracy skills; 26.2% read at or below a 6th grade level (low literacy) and one-third (33.0%) read at a 7th to 8th gradelevel (marginal literacy). Asthma KnowledgeBaseline functional understanding was assessed among participants, and overall comprehension of asthma and itssymptoms was relatively low prior to viewing the video tool (Table 2). Approximately one quarter (26%) of par- ticipants did not perceive asthma to be a disease, and one-third (38%) could not accurately identify the body parts affected. Asthma pathophysiology of what happens to lungs and airways when symptoms occur was the leastunderstood set of concepts. Despite this lack of knowledge among subjects, baseline perceived seriousness of asthmawas relatively high [M =4.5 (SD =0.6) on a 5-point scale]. Participants with low literacy skills were less able to identify body parts affected compared to those with mar-ginal and adequate literacy skills (41.2%, 58.1%, 77.4% respectively; P=0.003). In addition, individuals with low literacy were less able to identify asthma symptoms com- pared to those who had adequate literacy (M =1.2 (SD =1.0) symptoms versus M =2.0 (SD culty (71%) and wheezing (43%) as asthma symptoms. No signicant differences in baseline under-standing were noted by presence or absence of asthma in either participants or their relatives. Intervention Participants' understanding of asthma signicantly improved after watching Asthma 1-2-3. The total knowl- edge score (range 0-12) improved more than 60%, from M=4.2 (SD =1.6) posttest P\\0.001). Although improvement in under- standing of one concept\u2014that asthma symptoms are rela- ted to disease control\u2014did not reach signicance, it didshow a strong trend ( P=0.06, Table 2). Furthermore, while overall understanding from pretest to posttest sig- nicantly improved across all literacy levels, individualswith low literacy had smaller total knowledge gainsTable 1 Demographic information ( N=130) Variable Summary value Age, mean (SD) 50.2 (15.3) Gender (%) Female 76.2 Education (%) \\High school 22.5 High school graduate 22.3 [High school 53.9 Asthma diagnosis (%) Yes 22.3 Family member has asthma (%) Yes 63.8 Literacy level (%) Low ( B6th grade level) 26.2 Marginal (7th-8th grade level) 33.0Adequate ( C9th grade level) 40.1Table 2 1-2-3 intervention (N=130) Variable Pre-test (correct)Post-test (correct)P-value Classify asthma as a disease (%) 74 95 .008 Identify parts of body affected (%) 62 84 \\.001 Name asthma symptoms (%) Itchy/scratchy throat 1 32 \\.001 Tired/worn out 2 28 \\.001 Chest feels tight 10 43 \\.001 Cough 24 65 \\.001 Whistling/wheezing sound 43 49 .229Hard to breathe 72 86 .001 Recognize link between symptoms and disease control (%)80 96 .059 Pathophysiology of asthma symptoms (%) Swelling 5 25 \\.001 Mucus 8 26 \\.001 Airway constriction 35 48 .020 Asthma seriousness, mean (SD) 4.5 (0.6) 4.7 (0.5) .001 Total score, mean (SD) 4.2 (1.6) 6.8 (2.0) \\.001324 J Community Health (2009) 34:321-327 123compared to those with marginal and adequate literacy (1.8, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively; P=0.002). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine crude and adjusted differences in posttest knowledge scores by literacy level while controlling for relevant covariates(Table 3). Both low and marginal literacy remained sig- nicant independent predictors of asthma knowledge post- exposure to Asthma 1-2-3. Differences among mean scoresapproximated nearly 1 point lower ( b-0.8, 95% CI -1.5 to-0.1) for those with marginal and 1.5 points lower ( b-1.5, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.6) for those with low literacy compared to subjects with adequate literacy skills. No signicant associations were noted by age, gender, education, or whether subjects' had an existing asthmadiagnosis. Discussion Asthma 1-2-3 was developed utilizing cognitive principles and health literacy 'best practices' to create a video tool promoting asthma understanding and self-management. This version targets African American adults living withasthma, and community members were included in its development, renement, and pilot testing. This input contributed to the specic tailoring of the tool, increasingits relevance to this population. The preliminary pilot test indicates that the tool signicantly improved subjects' comprehension of the disease, its etiology, and theimportance of self-care vigilance. Relative to baseline knowledge, participants' understanding of almost all con- cepts improved after watching the video. Understandingthe link between asthma symptoms and disease control was not statistically signicant; however, this lack of signi- cance could be explained by the high baseline score for thisconcept, which suggests an already high level of under- standing before viewing the multimedia tool. Notably, scores improved only modestly for recall of asthma symptoms and their etiology. In the tool, the con- tent relating to these two concepts is recited in list form bythe narrator, yet no textual cues are presented. This pre- sentation strategy is supported by cognitive principles of multimedia learning, as detailed by Mayer, which state that information processing may be more difcult when pre- sented with simultaneous yet redundant auditory and visualcontent [ 32]. One of the multimedia guidelines set forth by Mayer allows for the use of text-based cues in close proximity to content-related images when the audiencemay have low prior knowledge. In these two concepts, subjects had only a minimal baseline understanding. While participants across all literacy levels demon- strated signicant improvement in their overall knowledge of asthma after watching Asthma 1-2-3, participants with adequate literacy skills learned the most while those withlow literacy skills gained the least (Table 3). With multi- media, subjects are not able to review content after it is shown, nor can they control the pace of its presentation.For declarative content such as asthma symptoms and disease etiology, participants might have actually per- formed better and achieved deeper encoding of the materialhad they been able to review sections or use virtual 'page- turns' before moving on to new concepts. Video-based education does have many benets, such as facilitating thedemonstration of desired behaviors and explicitly showing pathophysiology. Yet patients, particularly those with lower literacy abilities, may benet from the addition of amore tangible delivery modality, such as a summary card to accompany the video to support learning and retention. Further studies should test a combined video and supple-mental enhanced print approach to best address the broad range of literacy needs. There are several limitations to this study. Both the relatively small sample size and recruitment via targeted community exchanges (adult basic education center, faith- based organization) and one general internal medicineclinic limit the generalizability of our ndings. Further- more, our pilot test outcome utilized immediate recall, but neither retention of acquired asthma knowledge over anextended period nor behavior change were tested. A future study should assess longer-term effectiveness of AsthmaTable 3 Multivariate regression model examining asthma knowledge by literacy level Measure Literacy level Adequate ( n=52) Marginal ( n=46) Low ( n=31) Posttest asthma knowledge score, mean (SD) 7.8 (1.7) 6.6 (1.9) 5.6 (1.8) Crude difference (95% CI) - subject age, gender, education, asthma diagnosis (self and/or relative), and baseline knowledge score bModel t statistics: F (8,118) =8.8,P\\0.001, Health (2009) 34:321-327 325 1231-2-3. Finally, the results presented offer preliminary support and direction for rening the multimedia tool in order to optimize efcacy. The next stage of research should more properly evaluate the tool's efcacy in acontrolled trial design. Many studies have examined the advantages of using video as a medium for chronic condition education [ 13, 33-36]. To our knowledge, Asthma 1-2-3 is one of the rst tools developed according to health literacy and cognitive factors 'best practices' to target asthma education within an African American adult population. Health materials that are specically tailored to the interests and needs of targetpopulations can help initiate patient-provider discussion and increase knowledge and awareness. The digital med- ium itself allows it to be embedded in exam room com-puters linked to an Electronic Medical Record, giving providers an opportunity to initiate use of the tool and document if it has been viewed by a patient. As eachchapter is brief, patients can be educated prior to the cli- nician encounter, priming them for more meaningful dis- cussions. If a medical practice is not yet equipped with thistechnology, the tool can be made easily available to patients in waiting rooms through relatively inexpensive computer-equipped kiosks or portable DVD players. Asthma 1-2-3 has the potential to teach patients about asthma in a relevant, comprehensible, and parsimonious way, especially if paired with an appropriate providerinteraction and perhaps tangible and complimentary print materials for patients with limited literacy. Such an approach can help more easily identify knowledge decitsand/or correct misinformation before and/or during an appointment. The goal for any patient education program like Asthma 1-2-3 should not be a stand-alone intervention.Rather, these tools are best viewed as part of a more comprehensive strategy to conrm patient comprehension of relevant health content, encourage dialogue betweenpatients and their healthcare providers, and achieve uptake of recommended behaviors that will lead to optimal health outcomes across all literacy levels.

Stahre, MPH, Robert D. Brewer, MD, MSPH, Vincent P. Fonseca, MD, MPH, Timothy S. Naimi, MD, MPH Background: Binge drinking (drinking on a single occasion /H113505 drinks for men or /H113504 drinks for women) is a common risk behavior among U.S. adults that is associated with many adverse health and social consequences. However, little is known about binge drinking among active-dutymilitary personnel (ADMP). The objectives of this study were to quantify episodes of bingedrinking, to characterize ADMP who binge-drink, and to examine the relationship betweenbinge drinking and related harms. Methods: The prevalence of binge drinking and related harms was assessed from responses to the2005 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Military Person-nel (n/H1100516,037), an anonymous, self-administered survey. The data were analyzed in 2007after the release of the public-use data. Results: In 2005, a total of 43.2% of ADMP reported past-month binge drinking, resulting in 29.7episodes per person per year. In all, 67.1% of binge episodes were reported by personnelaged 17-25 years (46.7% of ADMP), and 25.1% of these episodes were reported byunderage youth (aged 17-20 years). Heavy drinkers (19.8% of ADMP) were responsible for71.5% of the binge-drinking episodes and had the highest number of annual per-capitaepisodes of binge drinking (112.6 episodes). Compared to nonbinge drinkers, bingedrinkers were more likely to report Conclusions: Binge drinking is common among ADMP and is strongly associated with adverse health andsocial consequences. Effective interventions (e.g., the enforcement and retainment of theminimum legal drinking age) to prevent binge drinking should be implemented across themilitary and in conjunction with military communities to discourage binge drinking. (Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3):208-217) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Excessive alcohol consumption resulted in an aver- age of approximately 79,000 deaths and 2.3 mil- lion years of potential life lost (about 30 years of life lost per death) in the U.S. from 2001 to 2005(https://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/ardi/Homepage.aspx ), mak- ing it the third leading preventable cause of death. 1 Binge drinking, usually dened as the consumption ona single occasion of /H113505 drinks for men or /H113504 drinksfor women, 2,3typically leads to acute impairment; it accounted for more than half of these 79,000 deaths (https://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/ardi/Homepage. aspx). Binge drinking is a common risk factor among U.S. adults, with approximately 1.5 billion episodes of binge drink-ing reported by U.S. adults in 2001 alone. 4Addition- ally, binge drinking is associated with many adversehealth and social consequences, including interper-sonal violence, motor vehicle crashes, sexually transmit-ted diseases, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol syn-drome, lost productivity, and suicidal behavior. 5-13 Various studies have reported that excessive drink- ing and related harms are common among military personnel14-16and that a higher percentage of active- duty military personnel (ADMP) misuse alcohol com- pared to civilian populations, even after controllingfor age and gender. 16-19Studies have also shown that high levels of alcohol use, such as binge drinking, areassociated with a high percentage of noncombat-related hospitalizations and deaths\u2014usually the resultFrom the Alcohol Team, Emerging Investigations and Analytic Meth- ods Branch, Division of Adult and Community Health, NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC(Stahre, Brewer, Naimi), Atlanta, Georgia; and the Texas Depart-ment of State Health Services (Fonseca), Austin, Texas At the time the research was completed, Fonseca was at the Population Health Support Division, Air Force Medical SupportAgency, U.S. Air Force, Brooks City-Base, San Antonio, Texas.

This research is needed be-cause people who binge-drink often do so frequently,increasing the likelihood of alcohol-attributable harms.Data were used from a worldwide, cross-sectional surveyof ADMP to assess the frequency and rate of binge-drinking episodes and the potential relationship be-tween binge drinking and various health and socialconsequences in this population. Methods The Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Military Personnel is an anonymous, self- administered survey of health outcomes and health riskbehaviors among current ADMP stationed in the U.S., over-seas, and onboard ships. The survey is conducted by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) staff every 2-3 years and isthe only population-based health survey involving allbranches of the military. Military personnel are randomlyselected, using a multilevel sampling frame to be representa-tive of the entire active-duty military population. Surveyparticipants from a particular base may be asked to completethe survey as a group at a specic base location, or maycomplete the survey on their own, and then return it to RTI,depending on the nature of their assignment (e.g., overseas).Those who are ineligible to participate include recruits;service academy cadets; personnel who are transferring toanother base during data collection; those who have left themilitary; those who are absent without leave (AWOL); orthose who have an unknown status. Data collection for thepresent survey occurred from April 2005 to August 2005, themost recent year for which survey data were available. Becauseof nonresponse, poststratication adjustments were made bybranch of service, age, and race/ethnicity to maintain therepresentativeness of the sample. Details of the nested sam-pling, purpose, method, and analysis have been publishedelsewhere. 27-29 Based on questions related to alcohol use in the past 30 days, respondents were characterized as either abstainers (noalcohol use in the past 30 days) or current drinkers. Averagedaily alcohol consumption was calculated, using responses toquestions about the frequency of alcohol consumption andthe usual quantity consumed in the last 30 days for beer, wine,and liquor. Heavy drinkers were dened as those consumingan average of /H110222 drinks per day for men or an average of /H110221 drink per day for women. Nonheavy drinking was an averagedaily alcohol consumption level less than that used to deneheavy drinking.Binge drinking was assessed using the following question: During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have 5 or more drinks of beer, wine, or liquor on the same occasion (4 or more if youare a woman)? Binge drinkers were dened as those who reported at least one /H113505//H113504 drinking episode in the last 30 days. Responses to this question were reported categoricallyas once, 2-3 days, 4-10 days, 11-19 days, 20-27 days, and28-30 days. The midpoint of each response range was used tocalculate total binge-drinking episodes, a technique commonlyused when calculating alcohol consumption with frequency- range data. 30Binge-drinking patterns were assumed to be fairly stable in this population, so the number of monthlyepisodes was multiplied by 12 to estimate total annual epi-sodes. The use of this constant also helped to smooth outthe slight month-to-month variation in alcohol consumptionthat occurred during the 5-month sampling period (April-August). Per-capita episodes of binge drinking (episodes perperson per year) were calculated by dividing the total numberof binge episodes per year for a given stratum by the totalweighted number of people in that stratum. To further characterize the public health impact of binge drinking, the prevalence of various health and social conse-quences (e.g., productivity problems, alcohol-impaired driv-ing, and criminal-justice problems) was assessed among re-spondents during the 12 months preceding the survey. Forexample, respondents were asked How many times in the past 12 months did you not get promoted because of your drinking? The prevalence of these consequences was compared betweenbinge drinkers and current drinkers who did not report bingedrinking in the past 30 days. The overall response rate for the 2005 survey was 51.8%, a rate based on the number of completed, usable interviews ofpersonnel who were eligible to participate in the survey.Nonrespondents were people who either did not show up forthe survey session during their scheduled time or did notreturn a completed survey. Fewer than 1% of respondentswere removed from the nal study population because ofmissing information on binge drinking, resulting in a nalsample size of 16,037. To examine the relationship between drinking pattern (binge versus nonbinge) and health and social consequences,summary Mantel-Haenszel ORs were computed, adjusting forpotential confounders (i.e., age group and gender). Allanalyses occurred from May 2007 to August 2007 after therelease of the public-use data les; they were run using SASversion 9.1 and SAS-callable SUDAAN version 9.0.1 softwareto take into account the complex weighting structure of thesurvey. Results Overall Active-Duty Military In 2005, a total of 43.2% of ADMP reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past 30 days. Of theserespondents, 12.1% reported at least one episode ofbinge drinking in the previous month, and 31.1%reported two or more. Extrapolation to 1 year pro-duced an estimate of 30 million episodes of bingedrinking, or 29.7 episodes of binge drinking per active- duty person per year (Table 1).

Overall, youth and young adults aged 17-25 years accounted for 46.7% of all ADMP and 67.1% of allbinge-drinking episodes (approximately 20 million; Ta- ble 1). Correspondingly, yearly per-capita episodes ofbinge drinking were highest in the younger age groupsand declined with increasing age. Young adults aged21-25 years had the highest number of per-capitaepisodes (45.7 per person per year), followed by thoseaged 17-20 years (35.5 per person per year). However,the number of per-capita episodes of binge drinkingremained high for personnel aged 26-34 years (21.5per person per year) and for those aged /H1135035 years (14.2 per person per year). During the study period, men\u2014who accounted for 85.3% of all ADMP\u2014were approximately twice as likelyto engage in binge drinking as women (46.6% vs24.1%), and they reported 93.9% of all binge-drinkingepisodes (Table 1). However, women\u2014most of whomwere of childbearing age (i.e., aged 18-44 years)\u2014hadan estimated 12 episodes per person per year. Whenevaluated by race/ethnicity, whites accounted for69.0% of the total binge-drinking episodes, but Hispan-ics had the highest number of per-capita episodes (34.1per person per year). Junior enlisted and noncommis-sioned ofcers (approximately 74% of all ADMP) hadthe highest prevalence of binge drinking (50.5% and46.6%, respectively), which resulted in more than 86%of all binge-drinking episodes (approximately 26 mil-lion); they had the highest numbers of per-capitaepisodes (39.4 episodes and 32.7 episodes per personper year, respectively) among the various pay gradesand ranks. The prevalence of binge drinking amongpersonnel in the remaining pay grades and ranksranged from 38.3% for junior ofcers the number of per-capita episodesranged from 17.2 per year for junior ofcers to 8.7 peryear for senior ofcers. When evaluated by duty station,the highest prevalence of binge drinking was reportedby those who were stationed overseas (51.1%), and thehighest number of per-capita episodes was estimatedfor those stationed onboard ships (44 per person peryear). When evaluated by type of housing, personnelliving in single, on-base housing had the highest prev-alence of binge drinking (57.4%) and the highestnumber of per-capita episodes (47.8 per person peryear). Of the almost 20% of ADMP who were classied as heavy drinkers based on average daily alcohol con-sumption, 94.6% reported one or more binge-drinkingepisode in the past 30 days, which extrapolates toapproximately 21 million episodes, or 112.6 episodesper person per year (approximately two episodes perweek; Table 1). Because of their high frequency of binge drinking, heavy drinkers accounted for 71.5% ofall binge-drinking episodes in this population in 2005.Compared to nonheavy drinkers, heavy drinkers weremore likely to be in the Army (41%); to be male (78%);aged 21-25 years (49%); anoncommissioned ofcer (53%); stationed in the U.S.(59%); and with a high school education or less (48%;data not shown). Active-Duty Military Who Consumed Alcohol Among the 76% of ADMP who were current drinkers,the prevalence of binge drinking was 56.6% (59.4% formen, 36.7% for women), and the number of per-capitaepisodes of binge drinking was estimated at 38.9 perperson per year (41.8 for men and 18.8 for women;Table 2). The highest prevalence of binge drinking wasamong current drinkers living in single housing(75.4%). More than two thirds of personnel who werejunior enlisted, single, or who had a high schooleducation or less reported binge drinking in the last 30days. By age, the highest number of per-capita episodesof binge drinking was estimated for drinkers aged17-20 years (59.8 per person per year). The prevalenceof binge drinking among male drinkers ranged from78.5% for those aged 17-20 years to 35.0% for thoseaged/H1135035 years. Among female drinkers, the preva- lence ranged from 47.1% for those aged 17-20 years to26.0% for those aged 26-34 years; in fact, the preva-lence of binge drinking among active-duty women aged/H1135035 years (26.2%) was slightly higher than it was forthose aged 26-34 years. Although the prevalence andnumber of per-capita episodes of binge drinking werehigher for men than for women, the subgroups athighest risk for binge drinking (e.g., youth and youngadults, Hispanics, and those with a high school educa-tion or less) were generally similar for both male andfemale drinkers. Health and Social Outcomes Compared with current drinkers who did not binge-drink, binge drinkers were more likely to report notbeing promoted, getting into a ght and hitting some-one, working below their normal level of performance,and drinking and driving (Figure 1). These behaviorsand outcomes were increasingly prevalent with more-frequent binge drinking (Figure 1). In terms of adverseoutcomes or high-risk behaviors that were explicitlyattributed to alcohol consumption, 36.4% of current-drinking ADMP reported at least one outcome orbehavior in the past year (e.g., driving after having hadtoo much to drink; Table 3). Specically, 18.4% of ADMP who drank reported one or more alcohol-attributable problems related to their job performance,28.1% reported injury-related outcomes or risk behav-iors, 2.2% reported problems related to interpersonal March 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3) 211Author's personal copy relationships, and 7.7% reported criminal-justice prob- lems. The prevalence of these outcomes was evenhigher for binge drinkers; more than half (52.2%)reported one or more adverse outcomes or high-riskbehaviors. In fact, even after adjustment for age andgender, binge drinkers were signicantly more likelythan nonbinge drinkers to report 21 of 22 studiedalcohol-related consequences. For example, bingeTable 2.

Discussion This is the rst in-depth study of binge-drinking epi-sodes and alcohol-related problems among ADMP in allbranches of the military. Almost half of all ADMPreported at least one episode of past-month bingedrinking\u2014an estimated 30 million episodes of bingedrinking, or about 30 episodes of binge drinking perperson per year. Especially high numbers of per-capitaepisodes of binge drinking were observed among Ma-rines, male drinkers, youth and young adults, Hispan-ics, junior enlisted and noncommissioned ofcers,those stationed onboard ships, and those living inon-base housing. Approximately two thirds of binge-drinking episodes involved personnel aged 17-25 years,and more than 70% were reported by heavy drinkers,who reported an average of two binge-drinking epi-sodes per person per week. Alcohol-related problemswere reported by more than half of all binge drinkers,and binge drinkers were signicantly more likely alcohol-related harms,including job-performanceproblems, alcohol-impaireddriving, and alcohol-relatedcriminal activity. Studies examining among U.S. adultsestimate the prevalence to beabout 14%, 4while college students report higherprevalence (44%). of binge-drinkingrates among college studentsand the military reflectssome of the similarities be-tween these two indemographic characteristics(e.g., predominance arrangements and environmentalexposures (e.g., access to al-cohol). 29Consistent with this, and in contrast to stud-ies of binge drinking in thecivilian population, 4approx - imately two thirds (67.1%) of the episodes of binge drinking in the military in 2005 involved youth and young adults aged /H1102126 years. However, even among young adults, the age-specicprevalence of binge drinking in the military was higherthan that reported among U.S. adults (e.g., 44.4% foractive-duty members aged 17-20 years vs 26.1% forcomparably aged civilians). 4,32These ndings suggest that interventions directed toward reducing youth ac-cess to alcohol, particularly among those who areunderage and living in on-base housing or stationedonboard ships, could have a substantial impact onreducing binge drinking in the military population. Atthe same time, it is important to recognize that highlevels of binge drinking were also reported by ofcersand senior enlisted personnel. Thus, it is important toreduce binge drinking among all ADMP, includingthose aged /H1135026 years. Although military men accounted for a higher per- centage of the total number of binge-drinking epi-sodes, military women, particularly those aged 17-25years, also had high numbers of per-capita episodes ofbinge drinking\u2014in fact, several times higher than thosereported by similarly aged women in the civilian popu-lation. 4,33This is particularly concerning because al- most all female ADMP are of childbearing age (aged18-44 years). 34In addition, other studies have found that, as in the U.S. civilian population, more than halfof pregnancies in the military are unintended. 35,36 Figure 1.

In addition, high numbers of per-capitaepisodes of binge drinking and total binge drinkingepisodes were reported by ADMP living in single housing,which is frequently occupied by underage personnel (e.g.,military barracks, dormitories, and bachelor quarters).This suggests that important reductions in binge drinkingamong military personnel could be achieved by enforcingthe laws restricting the access of youth to alcohol andenforcing blood alcohol-concentration policies relatedto drinking and driving on military property. The nding that more than 70% of all binge-drinking episodes involved ADMP who were heavy drinkersmeans that approximately one in ve ADMP reportedbinge drinking an average of more than twice per week.This concentration of binge-drinking episodes amongheavy drinkers contrasts with studies of binge-drinkingepisodes in the civilian population, where total epi-sodes were fairly evenly divided between heavy andnonheavy drinkers. 4These ndings suggest that there is a substantial minority (20%) of ADMP who binge-drink frequently and thus put themselves and others atsubstantially increased risk for a wide range of healthand social problems. 31,39,40These ndings further un- derscore the need to combine policy and environmen-tal approaches for reducing binge drinking with clini-cal interventions that are designed to screen ADMP foralcohol misuse (i.e., binge drinking) and to providethose who screen positive with brief counseling, referralto specialized treatment, or both, depending on theseverity of their alcohol problems. 41 This study also highlights the potential impact of binge drinking by ADMP on job performance and forcereadiness. ADMP who reported binge drinking wereconsistently more likely than nonbinge drinkers toreport a wide range of alcohol-attributable problems,including problems with job performance and drinkingand driving, both of which were reported by more thanone quarter of all binge drinkers. Binge drinkers werealso substantially more likely than nonbinge drinkers toreport being drunk while working and being called towork during off-duty hours and reporting to workdrunk. While binge drinking is also known to bestrongly associated with a wide range of health andsocial problems in the civilian population (e.g., inter-personal violence and sexually transmitted disease),this pattern of alcohol consumption poses special risksin the military setting. For example, the performance ofpilots has been shown to be impaired for up to 14 hoursafter drinking at a level sufcient to achieve a bloodalcohol concentration of 0.10 grams per deciliter (g/dL). 42In addition, serious criminal behavior resulting from binge drinking among military personnel canbring widespread media attention that damages theeffectiveness and credibility of the U.S. military as awhole. 43,44Finally, the high levels of binge drinking among ADMP, particularly among those aged /H1134925 years, increase the likelihood of alcohol-related harmsand alcohol-use disorders (e.g., alcoholism) followingmilitary service. 45-47The impact of binge drinking in the military on the future drinking behavior of veteransand their families is important, because 13.3% of U.S.adults report current or past military service (CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, unpublished raw data, 2005 ). Thus, reducing binge drinking amongADMP could have both short- and long-term benetsfor both the military and the general population. Several strengths mark this study, including the large sample size and the ability to assess both alcoholconsumption and alcohol-related outcomes amongADMP. Another strength is the use of standardizedquestions on alcohol use, which are comparable tothose used in other large surveys of risk factors. Thisstudy also has several imitations. First, binge drinkingand related consequences are underreported on sur-veys; thus, the estimates of the prevalence and fre-quency of binge drinking, and of the prevalence ofalcohol-related problems, were likely conservative. 48,49 Second, although the response rate for this survey(51.8%) is similar to that of other large, population-based surveys, 50respondents to this survey may differ from nonrespondents. However, based on the character-istics that were used to weight the survey population (e.g.,branch of service, race/ethnicity), respondents were rep-resentative of ADMP (R. Bray, RTI, personal communica-tion, April 2008). Third, while this study examined severaldifferent types of alcohol-related consequences amongmilitary personnel, the survey did not ask about a numberof important secondhand effects of alcohol use (e.g.,being a victim of vandalism, sexual assault). 51,52 While this study provides new insights into the prob- lem of binge drinking in the military, the problem itselfis not new, and has, in fact, been documented inprevious surveys of the active-duty population goingback more than 20 years. 53Although previous analyses of the current survey have not assessed the frequency orper-capita episodes of binge drinking, the prevalence ofbinge drinking is similar to that found in 2005 and onlyslightly increased (43.2% vs 41.8%) compared to 2002.However, this does not mean that binge drinking is somuch a xture of military life that it is impossible tochange. For example, the military has been quitesuccessful in reducing smoking rates among ADMPusing a comprehensive public health approach that hasincluded smoking-cessation programs and smokingbans. 54,55These interventions were successfully imple- mented even though smoking was historically quitecommon among ADMP. In contrast, most alcoholprograms in the military have tended to focus exclu-sively on screening for and treating alcoholism, even March 2009 Am J Prev Med 2009;36(3) 215Author's personal copy though other studies suggest that only a small minority of ADMP meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol-ism. 56-59Nonetheless, small, base-specic, and commu- nity programs to reduce underage and binge drinkingon military bases have been implemented and appearto be showing promising results. 60,61 In addition to these programs, potentially effective community-based interventions include increasing theprice of alcoholic beverages, particularly on military bases;enforcing and retaining laws prohibiting the sale to oracquisition of alcoholic beverages for underage youth,particularly at alcohol outlets adjacent to military bases;working with communities to limit the density of alcoholoutlets; and discouraging drink specials that promotebinge drinking ( www.thecommunityguide.org). 62,63In addition, bases should offer alcohol-free social eventsand increase the availability of recreational activitiesthat do not involve drinking. Further, because a largepercentage of young service members live on base, it isimportant to establish and enforce rules restricting theuse of alcohol in dormitories, in single housing, andonboard ships. Finally, although the U.S. PreventiveServices Task Force has noted that routine screeningfor binge drinking in primary care and other treatmentsettings is effective in reducing these types of behav-iors 64more research on the effectiveness of these interventions in the military setting is required.

J Gen Intern Med 24(4):538 -9 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-0921-0\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 At a recent meeting of our medical school 's advisory college our Dean of Student Affairs asked 190 first-year students for their definition of professionalism. The majority of these young people, just months out of college, were perhapsunqualified to answer the question, yet enthusiasm over-whelmed inexperience, eager faces glowed with engagement, and willing hands shot up in response. \"It means always doing your best, \"one student yelled, as the Dean scribbled the answer on a white board. \"Being respectful to everyone at all times, \"contributed another. A murmur of approval was heard from the faculty. \"Putting patients 'needs first, \"declared a third, and the congress roiled for the next fifteen minutes, bubbling with mostly redundant yet admirably idealist contributions. For most physicians, \"professionalism, \"an admittedly nebu- lous term, represents not simply the opposite of \"amateurism \" but rather the very best practice of medicine. And the students, though overlooking \"beneficence \"and \"sustained commitment to learning \"in their description, were right in insisting that it is predicated on proper behavior, hard work, and a stringent commitment to one 's patients. Yet several years into practice, it is increasingly clear to me that professionalism is rooted in an intimacy with and a struggle against failure which inevitably makes demands of and weighs on physicians. It is a difficult andcostly proposition, and none of us is spared its toll. As the new student-doctors happily spun their list, optimis- tically anticipating that good intentions foretell a smoothcareer, cheerfully unaware of the difficulties awaiting them,my mind turned to two patients I had recently treated and how my role in their care had enhanced and supplied nuance to my own understanding of professionalism. John, a thoroughly enjoyable bus driver, came to see me after an emergency room visit for pharyngitis. He had been evaluated the night before at a local hospital where his rapid strep test hadbeen negative, and he had been told his problem was \"viral. \"He had been sent home on prednisone and salt water gargles to help reduce his symptoms and told to follow-up with his primary carephysician \u2014for whom I was covering \u2014the next day.I spent very little time with John \u2014much less than I should have \u2014and didn 't closely interrogate his history. I took his temperature which was normal, I quickly palpated his neck and found he had no swelling or lymph node enlargement, and I peered into the back of his throat and saw minimal inflammationwithout pus. John told me he wasn 't feeling much better than he had the night before, but as his symptoms hadn 'tp r o g r e s s e d ,I endorsed the care he had received and told him to call me if hedidn 't start to feel better within a day or two. John 's wife, a medical assistant, called me the next afternoon and told me his throat pain was so severe he couldn 'te v e n swallow a can of Ensure. She brought him back to my office andon second and closer inspection I noted that his voice had changed, he was having difficulties opening his mouth, and his submandibular tissues were tender. I admitted him to thehospital and arranged for immediate intravenous antibiotics, a CTscan of his neck, and a formal otolaryngology consultation, yet despite these interventions John required a neck debridementand placement of a temporary tracheostomy. He went on to a full recovery, but only after a harrowing and perhaps avoidable stay in the intensive care unit. Steve, a 50-year-old nurse for whom I 've cared for several years, had recently complained to me of an acute cough with low-grade fevers. A chest x-ray was negative but his symptoms persisted for several weeks despite trials of cough medicine,anti-histamines, oral and nasal steroids, and finally an antibiotic. After Steve had been coughing for six weeks I asked him to be tested for Bordetella, but several days after his blooddraw, with results still pending, I received a frantic email from his wife. Two days prior, Steve had suddenly appeared \"dusky. \" Upon evaluation in a local emergency room his D-Dimer hadbeen elevated and a CT scan had shown a large centralpulmonary embolus. Steve had been anti-coagulated and admitted to the intensive care unit, and a leg ultrasound had demonstrated a sizeable deep vein thrombosis.

Introduction There is a growing body of evidence supporting the impact of inadequate health literacy on the health of individuals [1]. Inadequate health literacy has been linked to lower use of preventive services [2], delayed care-seeking when symptomatic [3], poor understanding of one's medical condition [4], low adherence to medical instructions [5], poor self-care [6], higher healthcare costs [7]and increased mortality [8,9] . In a recent report, 48% of U.S. adults lack the reading and numeracy skills to fully understand and act on health information [1]. Similarly, substantial portions of European populations have also been shown to have inadequate health literacy, despite the smallnumber of publications related to the impact of inadequate health literacy in European countries [10]. To date, little research has been conducted on the prevalence of inadequate health literacy in other parts of the world, such as Asian countries including Japan. Japan in particular is well-known for having a high standard of educational attainment, including a high proportion that obtain university degrees [11]. Educational attainment, along with race/ethnicity and age, has been shown to be the leading demographic predictors of health literacy in the U.S.[12,13] . Whereas 15% of U.S. adults do not have a high school diploma and 19% completed at least a 4-year university degree [14], only 8% of Japanese adults lack a high school diploma and fully 34% have completed at least a 4-year university degree [15]. Thus, there might be a lower prevalence of inadequate health literacy in Japan, although no research has been conducted to determine the prevalence of inadequate health literacy among Japanese adults. English is a phonographic language in which phonemes, which do not intrinsically represent any particular meaning, are brought together to represent words. On the other hand, Japanese is aPatient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 411-417 ARTICLE INFO Article history: Received 29 August 2008 Received in revised form 21 March 2009 Accepted 26 March 2009 Keywords: Health literacyWellbeingSocioeconomic statusHealth Risk BehaviorChronic illnessesABSTRACT Objective: To determine the prevalence of low health literacy and investigate the relationship between low health literacy and physical and psychological wellbeing in the Japanese general population.Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in a national sample of Japanese adults. Health literacy was measured by self-report using the validated single-item screening question, ''How condent are you lling out forms by yourself?'' Wellbeing was measured with the physical andpsychological domains of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF. Effect sizeswere computed by dividing the mean difference in scores by the standard deviation of the scores of all participants. Results: In 1040 adult enrollees (mean age, 57-year-old; women, were 161 (15.5%; 95% condence interval [CI], 13.3-17.7%) with low health literacy. Individuals with low health literacy reported lower physical wellbeing (60.6 vs. 71.7, p<0.001) and psychological wellbeing (59.7 vs. 68.3, p<0.001) compared with those with adequate health literacy. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health risk behaviors and chronic conditions, these differences were still signicant (physical wellbeing, p<0.001; psychological wellbeing, p<0.001). The effect sizes of the difference of scores were moderate for physical wellbeing ( /C00.55) and also for psychological wellbeing ( /C00.44). Conclusion: The prevalence of self-reported low health literacy in Japanese adults is substantial and it is independently associated with poorer physical and mental wellbeing. Practice implications: Efforts to monitor health literacy and to evaluate causal pathways to poor wellbeing should be encouraged in the Japanese population. /C2232009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A phonographic script primarily represents words as units of sound. A logographic script primarily represents words as visual images [16]. Further, in Japanese, basic characters are often combined to communicate complex ideas. Consequently, most people can easily conceive the ideas close to the correct meaning of written words and sentences without prior knowledge. Historically, the Japanese began adopting written language in the third century A.C.E. with Kanji through the Korean peninsula from China and then originally developed the Hiragana and Katakana in the ninth century. Currently, the Japanese Ministry of Education designates a list of 1006 Kanji ( Kyoiku Kanji or Education Kanji) as the learning objective for all elementary school children. These and an additional 939 Kanji are designated as the learning objective for all junior high school students ( Joyo Kanji or Ordinary Kanji). Logographic and syllabic characteristics of Japanese may be one cause of the high written literacy rate in Japan. In fact, 99.8% of junior high school graduates have mastered the Hiragana and Katakana [15,17] . Due to the linguistic differences between English and Japanese, tools that have been developed in English language to directly measure health literacy cannot be simply translated. While simple, standardized assessment tools for readability and functional health literacy should be developed in Japanese, a recently developed surrogate measure for inadequate health literacy can be employed [18-20] . This one-item screening question was validated in recent studies as a measure of health literacy [18-20] ; areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve for this single question were 0.84 based on the rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine (REALM) [19] and 0.80 for the test of functional health literacy in adults (STOFHLA) [18]. Chew et al. have also shown that additional questions did not signicantly increase the accuracy in detecting inadequate health literacy [19]. Despite accumulating evidence on health issues related to health literacy in the U.S. and European countries [6,21,22] ,a recent study indicated no association between health literacy and health status in ethnic minorities in the U.S. [23]. To determine the association between functional health literacy and physical and mental health status in Latinos and African Americans, Guerra et al conducted a cross-sectional study that used the STOFHLA and SF- 12 in a sample of about 1300 Medicaid and/or Medicare Latino and African American adult patients at community clinics in Philadel- phia and found that health literacy was not signicantly associated with physical or mental health status thus questioning the generalizability to a sample of ethnic minorities of the perceived link between inadequate health literacy and poor health status [23]. Thus, research on the potential link between health literacy and health status is needed for people living outside the U.S. or Europe. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of inadequate health literacy by examining self- reported low health literacy and to investigate the relationship between low health literacy and health status in the Japanese general population. 2. Methods2.1. Study participants The data for this study was collected from responses to a national cross-sectional on-line survey conducted from July 3 to July 8, 2008. No personal identifying information was collected (such as name or address) and institutional review board approval was obtained from the National Institute of Japanese Language. Allareas in Japan were stratied into 10 regions, The number of potential participants was determined within each region from a panel of people registered in the Yahoo JAPAN Co. (Tokyo, Japan), through probability sampling proportionate to age and gender, similar to the national census data of population distributions for 30-90-year-old in 2007. Inclusion criteria were Japanese adults aged 30-year-old or older. Many Japanese of age of 20s go to colleges or other schools of higher education. Thus, for measuring the nal educational attainment in people, we recruited people aged 30 or older. Exclusion criteria were any types of healthcare workers, such asphysicians, nurses, hospital workers, or public health workers. No gifts or payments were given for participating in the survey. 2.2. Data collection The survey gathered anonymous data for demographics and socioeconomics as well as responses to the questionnaire for health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) and health literacy. Demo- graphic data included age, gender, annual income, education and occupation. The cutoff points for annual income of 2, 4, 6 and 8 million Japanese Yen (JY) were used to generate ve income categories ( Note : the average exchange rate to 1 U.S. dollar in July 2008 was about 100 JY). Although poverty benets were provided in 2008 by the government to those with an annual income of less than about 1.5 million JY for a single person and less than about 2 million JY for a couple in 2008 [24], the National Tax Agency regards an income of 2 million JY as the cutoff level for low-wage workers and reports the distribution of income using cutoffs of 2, 4, 6 and 8 million JY. For educational attainment, ve categories were used (did not graduate high school, high school graduate, vocational school, short-term college, and university graduate/Masters/PhD). For occupational status, ve categorical levels were used, including persons working full time, homemaker, those working part time, retired, and those not currently working. Survey items also assessed current and past smoking, current alcohol use, and chronic conditions (cancer, cardiovascular disease, hyperten- sion, diabetes, arthritis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or depression) [22]. The HRQOL was assessed using the physical and psychological wellbeing domains (a total of 13 items) of the shortened Japanese version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF raw scores were trans- formed into scores from 0 to 100 with the lowest score of zero and the highest score of 100. The WHOQOL-BREF transformed domain scores have demonstrated good discriminant validity, content validity, and test-retest reliability [25]. The instrument is considered a valid and reliable measure for assessing HRQOL in different populations [25]. For measuring health literacy, we asked the single item screening question: ''How condent are you lling out forms by optimizing both sensitivity (83%) and specicity (82%) for this single item as compared to the REALM criteria was at the response of ''somewhat'' or less [19]. Thus, we used this single item with this threshold for dichotomizing participants into adequate or low levels of self-reported health literacy. Two additional items for measuring self-reported health literacy were also included in this study for conrming a concurrent validity of the aforementioned item. In these two items, we asked: ''How often do you have problems learning about your medical condition because of difculty understanding written information?'' (''problems learning'') and ''How often do you have someone help you read hospital materials?'' (''help read'')Y. Tokuda et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 411-417 412Author's personal copy with ve Likert responses of ''never'', ''occasionally'', ''sometimes'', ''often'', or ''always''. These items have also shown good validity proles for measuring health literacy in comparison to the STOFHLA and the REALM despite relatively lower accuracy compared to the item of ''condent with forms'' [19,20] . 2.3. Statistical analysis Spearman's correlation coefcients were computed to conrm the concurrent validity of the items for measuring self-reported health literacy. Descriptive statistics for sociodemographic vari- ables and current and past smoking, current alcohol use, and chronic conditions were calculated and presented as counts with proportions for all participants. The differences of proportions in these variables between participants with adequate health literacy and those with low health literacy were estimated using Chi- square test or trend test where appropriate. Differences of the mean scores in the two wellbeing domains between the groups by self-reported health literacy level were estimated with unadjusted linear regression models. Furthermore, adjusted linear regression models for the physical and psycholo- gical wellbeing were constructed, including age, gender, income, education, occupation, smoking status, current alcohol use, chronic conditions, and health literacy. Because of possible over-adjust- ment by including education in a regression model focused on health literacy [22], adjusted models without education were also constructed. Model t of multivariate models was assessed with the adjusted R-square. Since the WHOQOL-BREF does not have the well-dened values for minimal clinically important differences, we used thedistribution-based approach for estimating the effect size. Thus, to examine the clinical signicance of the differences between the groups, we computed effect sizes by dividing the mean difference in scores by the SD for all participants [26]. For interpretation of effect sizes, we followed the recent criteria of <0.3 as small, 0.3-0.8 as moderate and >0.8 as large effect sizes [27-29] . Statistical analyses were using STATA 10.0 TX). Two-tailed p-values <0.05 were considered statistically signi- cant. 3. Results Of 2500 subjects randomly selected from the on-line panel, 1074 participated in the study (a response rate, 43.0%). Among these, data for 1040 persons were available for our analysis and were considered as the nal sample. Table 1 shows socio- demographic characteristics of all participants. The mean age was 57-year-old (range, 30-90) and 52% were women. We found 161 (15.5%; 95% condence interval [CI], 13.3-17.7%) to have self-reported low health literacy in this study, based on the item ''condent with forms'' as the criterion. The three self-reported health literacy items had a signicant and moderate positive correlation. Spearman's correlation coefcients for the item ''condent with to the item ''help read''. Table 1 also presents the distributions of sociodemographic characteristics by self-reported health literacy group (low vs. adequate).

Table 3 presents the results of unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models for physical and psychological wellbeing scores. Self-reported low health literacy was signicantly associated with a lower physical wellbeing in the full-adjusted model (difference, /C09.6). Similarly, self-reported low health literacy was signicantly associated with a lower psychological wellbeing in the full- adjusted model (difference, /C07.5).

Exclusion of education from the models did not signicantly influence the relationships between health literacy and physical or psycholo- gical wellbeing. 4. Discussion and conclusion4.1. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the rst study to explore the prevalence of self-reported low health literacy in Japan. Our results indicate that 15.5% of Japanese adults may have low health literacy. This is a substantial portion of the population and should prompt planning for further epidemiologic studies and possible interventions in Japan. By comparison, while 15.5% is lower than what has been reported in other countries such as the U.S. [1], this gure is higher than a recent national sample of British adults (11.4%) [30], and a primary care population in Canada (9%) [31]. However, since the self reported measure was used in the current study and different measures were used in other countries, it may need to be careful when comparing these gures. In addition, after controlling for age, gender, income, education, occupation, smoking, alcohol use and chronic conditions, Japanese individuals with low health literacy reported signicantly lower physical and psychological wellbeing than those with adequate health literacy. The magnitudes of the differences of wellbeing between the groups were clinically important according to Cohen's criteria for interpreting effect sizes. Based on previous reports using the WHOQOL-BREF, the magnitude of the difference of physical wellbeing was comparable to that of having survived myocardial infarction ( /C011.3) [26], and a diagnosis of lung cancer (/C015) [32]. The magnitude of the difference of psychological wellbeing was a half of that of having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder ( /C015)[33]. Comparison of the regression models with and without education as a covariate showed that both health literacy and education may, to a certain extent, operate in the same causal pathway for health status [22]. Specically, in the model without education as a covariate, the magnitude of the association between health literacy and our health status measures increased by a small margin in comparison to our model with education as a covariate. Though this effect is small, it is likely an indication of over- adjustment [22]. The current ndings, linking low health literacy and poor physical and psychological wellbeing in Japan is consistent with previous studies showing the independent association between low health literacy and poor self-rated health status, including physical and psychological health functioning [21,22,34-36] . Since recent studies also show that inadequate health literacy increases mortality in the U.S. elderly [8,9] , prospective studies examining mortality are also needed in Japan. The lack of signicantdifferences of health behavior and chronic conditions of the study participants by health literacy level was consistent with the prior report [34]. There are several potential causal pathways linking low health literacy to poor physical and psychological wellbeing [22,37] . First, individuals with low health literacy are less likely to access and utilize healthcare services, such as recommended vaccination and cancer screening programs [2,38,39] . Second, low health literacy is related to poor health knowledge, including important knowledge about prevention and chronic diseases [4,40,41] and this lack of knowledge can lead to lower adherence to medical instructions [5,6,42,43] . Third, communication between individuals with low health literacy and health care providers within medical encoun- ters may be ineffective, since physicians often do not communicate at a level that is understood by patients with low health literacy [44]. Similarly, educational materials distributed in clinics and hospitals are mostly difcult to understand for those with low health literacy [45,46] . Fourth, the quality of self-care may be poorer among those with low health literacy at the time of both acute symptomatic episodes and chronic illnesses [47]. Conse- quently, all of these factors could contribute to poor wellbeing among individuals with low health literacy [36]. On the other hand, there are other studies that do not show these relationships, such as a study indicating higher adherence among HIV-infected patients with low health literacy [48]. However, none of these issues, regarding the potential mechanisms that link low health literacy to worse health outcomes have been evaluated in Japan. There are several limitations in our study. First, because our study was based on cross-sectional data, a causal relationship between low health literacy and physical and mental wellbeing cannot be established. Second, we used only the single-item screener to measure self-reported health literacy in study participants. While the test sensitivity, specicity and reliabilityof this item are considered good compared to the STOFHLA and the REALM, which are currently the most commonly used measures of health literacy, the operating characteristics of this screening question have not been evaluated in Japanese. Japanese language versions of the STOFHLA and the REALM cannot be implemented because of the logographical nature of Japanese. Until a new test paradigm is developed and validated for health literacy in Japanese, the eld will need to be initiated with indirect test measures, as we have done. Third, we assessed the presence of chronic conditions, based not on medical records, but on the self- reported questionnaire. However, a high level of agreement has been shown between self-reported survey results of chronic conditions and medical records [49], and there is little association between education and the validity of self-reported chronic conditions [50]. Fourth, while the National Surveys in the U.S. (NAAL) and other countries (IALS) were interviewer-facilitated household surveys, data collection through a web-based survey is likely to under- estimate the prevalence of inadequate health literacy. Indeed, the educational attainment and income of our study participants is relatively higher than that of the general population in Japan (Grade <12 proportions: 5% in our study participants vs. 8% in the general population by the government report) [15]. An adjusted estimate for the prevalence of low health literacy would be increased to about 18%, if our sample had included 8% of people not nishing high school instead of 5% and if all of those had low health literacy (the worst case scenario). The appropriateness of a web- based survey for estimating the prevalence of health literacy may need to be evaluated further to estimate the magnitude of this effect. Fifth, it has recently been shown that literacy influences the validity of Likert scale measures [51]. This work, however, was conducted with non-readers, who were not included in our self-Y. Tokuda et al. / Patient Education and Counseling 75 (2009) 411-417 415Author's personal copy administered survey and were not at all included in the International Adult Literacy Survey, the 1992 U.S. National Adult Literacy Survey, and the 2003 U.S. National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL). Indeed, in the NAAL, 3% of all potential subjects were excluded due to being unable to participate in the survey and this portion is typically excluded from all discussion of the NAAL results. It is unclear what portion of the Japanese population would have been similarly excluded if the current study had been conducted as an in-person survey. Finally, sixth, low literacy might directly affect a person's ability to complete a wellbeing questionnaire. Lower HRQOL in low literacy might have resulted from this group's inability to accurately report their wellbeing compared to those with adequate literacy. This issue could have been overcome by administering the WHOQOL via interview. 4.2. Conclusion In conclusion, this study explores the prevalence of self- reported low health literacy in the general Japanese population for the rst time and provides the rst evidence on the relationship between low health literacy and poor physical and psychological wellbeing in Japan. Though this method has been validated, the estimate we provide is based on a single-item self-report measure for health literacy. Appropriate epidemiological tools for direct measurement of health literacy should be developed in Japanese. In addition, to develop effective public health interventions, future studies are needed to examine how people with low health literacy in Japan recognize and respond to health problems and the health care system. 4.3. Practice implications Japanese clinicians and public health ofcials may need to pay attention to our results which indicate a substantial proportion of self-reported low health literacy among Japanese adults. Although our estimate was based on a single self-report screening item, our Internet-based data collection likely led to an underestimation of this problem. Japanese clinicians and public health ofcials may be able to simplify their patient education materials and improve their communication techniques. In particular, further examina- tion of patient comprehension is warranted. These kinds of changes are likely to help all patients and be particularly benecial to patients with low health literacy.

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Poor and non-white patients are dispropor- tionately infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The objective of this research is to determine sociodemographicpatterns of HCV-related ambulatory care visits over time. Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory MedicalCare Survey-Outpatient (NHAMCS-OPD) for the years 1997-2005 were analyzed in 3-year intervals. Demo- graphic and other variables were compared for each period,and multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine whether the likelihood of a visit being HCV- related (versus non-HCV) was independently associatedwith (1) race and/or (2) Medicaid status over time. The total number of HCV-related ambulatory visits more than doubled from 3,583,585 during the years 1997-1999 to8,027,166 during 2003-2005. During this time, the pro- portion of non-whites and Medicaid recipients presenting for HCV-related visits approximately doubled vs. 2003-2005, HCV-related visits were more than twice as likely to occur among non-white patients vs. white patients (OR =2.49; 95% CI: 1.60- 3.86) and patients on Medicaid (3.49;1.79-6.80). Our results show that HCV-associated ambu- latory care visits are increasing, with a greater proportion of visits occurring among non-white patients and Medicaidrecipients. Keywords Hepatitis C /C1Health disparities /C1 Ambulatory care /C1Health services Introduction More than 3 million Americans are now estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [ 1]. The inci- dence of HCV peaked in the 1980s (prior to blood product screening) and is now relatively low except among certainhigh-risk groups such as injection drug users [ 2,3]A sa consequence, most affected individuals are 40-50 years of age and have likely been infected for decades. Over time,these individuals are at risk for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer, which has prompted concern about a potential surge in HCV-associated morbidity and mortality in the coming years [ 4]. Providing ambulatory care for HCV- infected individuals so that they can be evaluated fortreatment should be of paramount importance. To date, there is little information on the patterns of ambulatory health care usage among HCV-infected per-sons. The prevalence of HCV is disproportionately higher among minorities, illicit drug users, and individuals of low socioeconomic status [ 1]. These are vulnerable populations that may face numerous barriers to adequate health care. Although HCV-related healthcare utilization has been reported to be increasing overall [ 5,6], it is unclear whe- ther these vulnerable groups are receiving care for their HCV. This study was conducted to analyze whether the national pattern of HCV-related ambulatory care visitsJ. I.

Methods Data Sources and Study Design Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey-Outpatient (NHAMCS-OPD) for years 1997-2005 were utilized. These surveys, conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control, capture nationally representative samplesof visits to ambulatory clinics (NAMCS) and hospital- based clinics (NHAMCS-OPD). A detailed description of NAMCS and NHAMCS methodology is available throughthe National Center for Health Statistics [ 7]. In brief, trained interviewers provide materials and instruction to physicians, who then record information on patient visitsduring the reporting period. This study included informa- tion only on adult visits (age 18 years or older). Because of relatively small numbers of HCV-associated visits, wecombined annual survey data in 3-year intervals (1997- 1999, 2000-2002, and 2003-2005). Analysis of this pub- licly available data set was exempted from institutionalreview board review by the University of California, San Francisco. Variables An HCV-related visit was dened as one in which any of the three principal diagnosis elds contained the following International Classication of were examined included age, sex, race (white vs. non-white), and insurance status (private, Medicare, Medicaid, orother). Additional covariates examined were whether or not the visit was conducted with the patient's primary care provider (as determined by the provider), whether the visitalso contained a diagnosis code for complications from HCV dened visit involved prescription of anti-HCV medications (standard and pegylated interferon alpha-2a and 2b, and/or ribavirin). Analyses All analyses took into account the complex survey design using weights, strata, and primary sampling unit designvariables when calculating estimates. Comparisons of the proportion of visits representing certain patient demo- graphics and prescription of anti-HCV therapy for each 3- year interval were compared using a Chi-square test.Multivariable logistic regression was performed to exam- ine whether the likelihood of a visit being HCV-related (versus unrelated to HCV) was independently associatedwith race and Medicaid status, and whether there was an interaction between time and those covariates (i.e., whether the effects of race and Medicaid status varied over time). A P-value threshold of \\0.05 was used for all statistical testing, including tests for interaction. All analyses wereconducted using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN, version 9.0.3 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC). Results Using this data source, it is estimated that national HCV- related ambulatory visits increased from 3,583,585 (95%CI: 12,339,954) during 2003-2005 (Fig. 1). These weighted estimates were based on an absolute number of 276 visits, 468 visits, and 583 visits for the years 1997-1999, 2000-2002, and 2003-2005, respectively (estimates are not stable for fewer than 30visits) [ 7]. HCV-related visits constituted a larger per- centage of total ambulatory visits over time: they comprised 0.17% of total visits in 1997-1999, trend P-value =0.1). Over the time period examined, the proportion of non- whites and Medicaid recipients presenting for HCV-related visits approximately doubled (Table 1). A relatively small number of visits involved a prescription for anti-HCVmedications ( \\10%), and the proportion did not appear to be changing over time. Likewise, a minority of HCV- related visits also involved complications such as cirrhosis 02468101214 2003-05 2000-02 1997-99 Number of visits (millions) Fig. Estimated number of HCV-related ambulatory visits in the U.S.Dig Dis Sci (2009) 54:2694-2698 2695 123and liver cancer, and there was no appreciable change over time. Almost half of all HCV-related visits occurred with the patient's primary care provider . Results from the logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, demonstrated that HCV-related visits were more likely to occur among non-whites and recipients of Med-icaid over time (time-race interaction P-value =0.02; time-Medicaid interaction =0.04). In the most recent years (2003-2005), HCV-related visits were more thantwice as likely to occur among non-white patients, and more than three times as likely to occur among patients on Medicaid (Table 2).Conclusions This study suggests that the number of HCV-related ambulatory care visits in the U.S. is rising, with an increasing percentage of visits occurring among non-white patients and recipients of Medicaid. Additionally, weobserved that only a small percentage ( \\10%) of ambula- tory HCV-related visits involved anti-HCV treatment, and that the proportion of visits involving treatment did notincrease between 1997 and 2005. There are some potential explanations for our nding that an increasing proportion of HCV-related ambulatoryvisits occurred among non-whites and Medicaid recipients. First, this may reflect the positive efforts to screen and bring to care individuals who are infected with HCV.National guidelines for HCV screening do not target any particular race or socioeconomic group [ 8], however, the prevalence of HCV is substantially higher among minori-ties and individuals of low socioeconomic status. Increasing proportions may reflect greater numbers of individuals from these vulnerable groups who becomeaware of their diagnosis and are able to access health care. As the incidence of acute HCV is extremely low (0.3 perTable 1 Characteristics of (67) 0.04 Non-white 567,874 2,400,056 (43) 3,466,357 (45) 0.97 aIncludes self-pay/charity, workers comp, other, unknown and missing bCirrhosis, ascites, esophageal varices or hepatocellular carcinoma cLess than 30 visits, estimate not stable d105 absolute visits missing this information =929,107 weighted visits Table 2 Relative odds for visit being HCV-related (vs. non-HCV) associated with race and Medicaid status* Covariate 2000-2002 2003-2005 White (0.87, 2.34) 2.49 2.80) 3.54 (2.44, 5.14) 3.49 (1.79, 6.80) * Results from the logistic regression were adjusted for age and sex2696 Dig Dis Sci (2009) 54:2694-2698 123100,000) [ 3], it seems unlikely that a differential rate of new infections among non-whites and Medicaid recipients can fully explain our ndings. Another possibility is that a differential rate of HCV-associated complications amongwhites and non-whites compels individuals to seek out care, as some prior research has suggested disparities between whites and blacks in liver disease outcomes [ 9]; however, the relatively small number of visits involving HCV-associated complications observed appears to argue against this being a major driving force behind our ndings. Regardless of cause, our ndings have important public health implications. The ndings support prior research showing an increasing contribution of HCV to national healthcare expenditures [ 5,6], but add to the literature by showing that Medicaid is increasingly shouldering the costs of ambulatory healthcare for HCV. Politicians and policy- makers should be aware of the potential for increasedMedicaid ambulatory care costs due to HCV. Further, if HCV-related complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer (and costly treatments like liver transplant) increasein the future, as some researchers have predicted [ 4], there may be a substantial burden to the public healthcare sys- tem. It is nonetheless interesting to note that in this studythe proportion of HCV-related ambulatory visits that were associated with complications did not increase over the study period. Models predicting HCV-associated burdenhave projected increases in HCV-related morbidity and mortality that peak around 2015 [ 10], so this study may have been conducted too early to detect upward trends incomplications. This study also found that only a small percentage of HCV-related ambulatory care visits ( \\10%) involved pre- scription of anti-HCV medications by the provider. Because the data contain no patient-specic information on treatment history, candidacy, and preferences, we cannotdetermine to what extent this proportion falls short of treatment guidelines. However, the seemingly low per- centage of observed visits that involved treatment appearscongruent with prior research showing substantial contra- indications and barriers to treatment for many HCV-posi- tive patients [ 11,12]. In this study, almost half of the HCV- related visits occurred with a self-identied ''primary care provider.'' If a signicant proportion of HCV care is taking place in the ofces of non-specialist primary care provid-ers, training non-specialist providers to treat HCV may be one strategy to provide greater access to treatment for patients. This study has several important limitations. Because the study is based on a sample of visits, rather than indi- viduals, observations are restricted to the level of healthcare utilization. There was potential for misclassication, in particular not identifying all visits that involved HCV-related care. Because the survey only allowed for three diagnosis codes, patients with HCV who had multiple co- morbidities may have not have had their visit coded to reflect their HCV care. Finally, we had relatively smallabsolute numbers of HCV-related visits and even fewer visits that involved treatment; therefore we were unable to examine patterns of treatment among subgroups, such asnon-whites and Medicaid recipients. In summary, using a nationally representative survey, we found that HCV-related ambulatory care visits are increasing, and that more visits are occurring among non- white and Medicaid patients over time. Since the currentincidence of HCV is low, this may reflect improved efforts to provide care for poor, non-white individuals who are chronically infected with HCV. Policy-makers should beaware that HCV-related ambulatory care visits are increasingly paid through Medicaid insurance, which may place a growing burden on the public health care system inthe future.

This study examined the effect of HCV infection on kidney function over time in women infected with HIV. Study Design: Retrospective observational cohort. Setting & Participants: Study sample included participants from the Women's Interagency HIV Study who were HIV infected and had undergone HCV antibody testing and serum creatinine measurement at measurements the 4-variable Modication of Diet in Renal Diseases (MDRD) Study equation. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the independent effect of HCV seropositivity on eGFR over time, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbid conditions, illicit drug use, measures of HIV disease status, use of medications, and interactions with baseline low eGFR ( /H1102160 mL/min/1.73 m2). Results: Of were found to be HCV seropositive. In 180 women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (eGFR /H1102160 mL/min/1.73 m2), HCV seropositivity was independently associated with a fully adjusted net decrease in eGFR of approximately 5% per year (95% condence interval, 3.2 to 7.2) relative to women who were seronegative. In contrast, HCV infection was not independently associated with a decrease in eGFR in women without low eGFR at baseline (P /H110210.001 for interaction). Limitations: The MDRD Study equation has not been validated as a measure of GFR in persons with HIV or HCV infection. Proteinuria was not included in the study analysis. Because the study is observational, effects of residual confounding cannot be excluded. Conclusions: In HIV-infected women with CKD, coinfection with HCV is associated with a modest, but statistically signicant, decrease in eGFR over time. More careful monitoring of kidney function may be warranted for HIV-infected patients with CKD who are also coinfected with HCV.

Infection with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with various types of glomerulonephritis (in particular, membranopro- liferative glomerulonephritis) in (HIV)-uninfected populations.1 These diseases are difcult to treat and often result in poor outcomes.2Approximately 15% to 30% of HIV-infected individuals are also infected with HCV .3Treatment for HCV infection in HIV- infected individuals is problematic because of treat-ment toxicities and poor response rates.4As a result, patients coinfected with HIV and HCV may be at risk of HCV-related kidney disease. Although research is limited, it appears that coinfection with HCV in HIV-infected popula- tions may confer additional risk for adverse kidney-related outcomes. In the setting of HIV infection, HCV infection has been associated with proteinuria5and risk of developing acute renal failure,6as well as end-stage renal disease From the1Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA;2University of California, San Francisco, CA;3Monte- ore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medi- cine, Bronx;4SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY;5Georgetown University, Washington, DC;6University of Southern Califor- nia, Los Angeles, CA;7CORE Center, Cook County Bureau of Health Services and Rush University, Chicago, IL;8Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; and9Duke University, Raleigh-Durham, NC.

One prior study of HIV-infected women found that creatinine clearance tended to be lower in women coinfected with HCV . However, results were not statistically signicant, perhaps because of a relatively short follow-up.8Precisely how HCV infection impacts on the rate of kidney function decrease over time is important to clinicians and policymakers to anticipate the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in HIV-infected patients. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between HCV infection and kidney function over time, adjusting for potential con- founders. HCV seropositivity was hypothesized to be independently associated with a greater decrease in kidney function over time in HIV- infected women. METHODS Study Participants Women in this study were participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a multicenter prospective cohort study of the natural history, including treatment, of HIV infection. Full details of recruitment and baseline cohort characteristics have been described previously.9,10 The WIHS enrolled women who were either infected with HIV (Western blot conrmed) or at risk of HIV infection between October 1994 and November 1995 and again be- tween October 2001 and September 2002 from 6 clinical consortia in the United States: Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; New York City (Bronx and Brooklyn), NY; San Fran- cisco Bay Area, CA; and Washington, DC. This analysis included HIV-infected WIHS participants who had baseline HCV antibody screening test results and serum creatinine measurement. Participants were evaluated every 6 months by means of physical examination and questionnaires: data from follow-up visits through September 30, 2006, were included in the analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and the institu- tional review boards of participating institutions. Study Variables The outcome of interest was estimated glomerular ltra- tion rate (eGFR), calculated using the 4-variable Modica- Diet in Diseases (MDRD) Study equation (non-isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable).11,12Al- though this equation was not developed in cohorts with HIV infection, it is commonly used in clinical practice and its use has been recommended in CKD screening guidelines for HIV-infected patients.13eGFR was used as a continuous variable and also dichotomized at a threshold of less than 60mL/min/1.73 m2to dene participants with baseline CKD based on low eGFR.14Because the distribution of eGFR was skewed and the MDRD Study equation is less accurate at greater values, the outcome was transformed by using the natural logarithmic transformation (logGFR). This normal- ized distribution and also served to downweight changes in eGFR that occurred in the lower versus upper ranges, which in effect \"deemphasized\" changes in the upper ranges of eGFR, which are less informative. With the outcome natural log transformed, regression coefcient estimates multiplied by 100 are approximately interpretable as percentage of change in average value of the outcome per unit increase in the predictor.15 The predictor of interest was baseline HCV serostatus, which was determined by using HCV antibody testing (Ortho- Clinical Diagnostic, Raritan, NJ). Demographic covariates used in the analysis were age, race (African American versus non-African American), income (annual income /H11349versus /H11350$12,000), and education (high school nongraduate ver- sus graduate). Clinical (not HIV related) covariates included self-reported diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), liver enzyme levels (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase), recent (previous 6 months) illicit drug use, and injection drug use. HIV-related variables included CD4 cell count (cells/ /H9262L, analyzed in units of 100), log- transformed HIV viral load, diagnosis of acquired immuno- deciency syndrome (AIDS), and use of highly active anti- retroviral therapy (HAART). Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) ACE-inhibitor use was based on an open- ended question to participants asking them to describe other non-HIV-related medications and review of pill bottles when patients brought them to study visits (as they were encouraged to do at later visits). Data for all variables, including medications, were collected every 6 months, with the exception of HCV antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen (baseline only). Statistical Analysis Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters at base- line were compared according to HCV serostatus by using t and/H92732tests as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the relative odds of having eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2at baseline according to HCV serostatus, adjusting for other covariates. Linear mixed models with participant-specic random intercepts and slopes were used to estimate the relationship between HCV seropositivity and decrease in logGFR. These models take into account the correlation of outcome by subject and allow for differing numbers of observations across participants arising from missed visits and variable patterns of creatinine measurement. Normality of the residu- als, as well as the linearity of covariate effects on logGFR, were examined by using graphical methods. To account for underlying secular trends in mean logGFR common to all participants, time trends were modeled by using linear, quadratic, and cubic terms. The additional effect of HCVTsui et al 44seropositivity on decrease in logGFR, net of any underlying trend, was modeled by using the interaction of time since study entry with baseline HCV serostatus; exploratory anal- yses showed no substantial departure from linearity in this effect. To determine whether the effect of HCV infection on decrease in logGFR was different in the subset of women with low eGFR (/H1102160 mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline, we tested for a difference in HCV (and other covariate) effects by baseline eGFR status by including interaction terms for all covariates in a model that included only postbaseline logGFR values. Because the interaction with HCV infection was statistically signicant, we subsequently estimated ef- fects of HCV (and all other covariates) on decrease in postbaseline logGFR by using linear mixed models stratied by baseline eGFR less or greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. We evaluated for the signicance for all covariate interac- tions with low baseline eGFR by using a Wald test to test for the equality of slope coefcients. We also performed sensi- tivity analysis of the nal linear mixed models, substituting an interaction between HCV infection and baseline eGFR as a continuous variable. To estimate the independent effect of HCV infection, we adjusted for age, race, poverty, diabetes, hypertension, mea- sured blood pressure, HIV-related factors (AIDS, CD4 cell count, and HIV viral load), hepatitis B surface antigen, use of nephrotoxic medications (as dened previously) and ACE inhibitors, and illicit drug use, updating time-dependent covariates as appropriate. In addition, to fully address con- founding by other influences on decrease in logGFR, we included interactions of time with race, diabetes, hyperten- sion, illicit drug use, poverty, AIDS, and medications (HAART, renal-toxic medications, and ACE inhibitors). For diabetes, hypertension, and AIDS, the time-dependent inter- action term was calculated as time since onset of the condi- tion, whereas for illicit drug and medication use, it was calculated as current duration of use. For women currently free from a given exposure, the corresponding interaction term was set equal to zero. To create summary estimates of individual slopes, we also calculated rates of logGFR de- crease for each participant by using xed and random effects estimated by using the linear mixed model. This method borrows information across participants, efciently shrink- ing slope estimates for those with relatively sparse or noisy logGFR values toward the average slope for other partici- pants with similar covariate values. Stata, version 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), was used for all analyses. P/H110050.05 was considered statistically signicant. RESULTS Of WIHS, 2,702 HCV (Fig 1). Of 2,702 women, 18 (0.7%) were missing baseline serum creatinine measurement and were excluded from the analysis, leaving a nal study population of 2,684 women. Women who were missing HCV serological or baseline serum cre- atinine results (n /H11005107; 3.8% of the original 2,791) were slightly older (mean age, 37 /H110068[SD] versus 35 /H110068 years; P/H110050.008) and more likely to use injection drugs (47% versus 33%; P/H110050.002) and less likely to be on HAART at baseline (8% versus 14%; P/H110050.02). However, there were mean alanine aminotransferase or serum creatinine lev- els or the proportion with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2between women who were and were not excluded for missing data. Of 2,684 women in the nal cohort, 945 (35%) were HCV seropositive. HIV/HCV-coinfected women were more likely to be older, African American, poor, and drug users at baseline and less likely to report being on HAART (Table 1). Of women with eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or greater, those who were HCV seropositive were more likely to have a greater HIV viral load, have had an AIDS-dening illness, and have hypertension. Diabetes was not signicantly more common in women with HCV infection. At baseline, 180 (6.7%) women in the sample had eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.A t baseline, there was a greater prevalence of CKD in women who were HCV seropositive: 9.8% (93 of 945) versus 5% (87 of 1,739; P/H110210.01). Before adjustment, women with HCV infection appeared to be twice as likely to have prevalent CKD based on eGFR (unadjusted odds 1.53 to 2.81; P/H11021 0.001). After the relative odds was attenuated to 1.47 (95% condence Figure 1. Flow chart of study population selection.

Median follow-up was 4.8 years (rst and third quartiles, 3.5 and 11 years) for women without CKD at baseline (based on eGFR) and 4.5 years (rst and third quartiles, 1 and 11) for women with CKD. Median numbers of creati- nine measurements were 9 (rst and third quar- tiles, 4 and 16) for women without baseline CKD and 6 (rst and third quartiles, 2 and 14) for women with CKD. There were no missing fol- low-up creatinine data for 2,429 (91%) womenin the study, 100 (3%) were missing only 1 measurement, and 155 (4%) were missing 2 or more measurements. Linear mixed models al- lowed for differing numbers of observations across participants arising from missed visits. Based on calculation of individual slopes from linear mixed models, the majority of HIV- infected women had either improvement or no change or only mildly decreased eGFR over time regardless of HCV status (Fig 2). However, women who were also HCV seropositive were more likely to experience a decrease in eGFR over time and greater rates of decrease. In combined data, we found that the effect of HCV on net decrease in eGFR differed signi- cantly by baseline eGFR status. Therefore, linear mixed-model analyses were stratied by eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In women with CKD at baseline, HCV seropositivity was statis-Table 1.

This effect was greater than the effect observed for hypertension and slightly less than the effect for diabetes. In contrast, for women with baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or greater, HCV infection did not appear to have a signicant effect on change in eGFR over time. Results from the sensitivity analysis using an interaction term for HCV and eGFR as a continuous variable (as opposed to dichotomous) also were signicant. DISCUSSION In this study of HIV-infected women, HCV seropositivity was associated with a slightly lower eGFR over time in women who had eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2at baseline. In contrast, it did not appear to be associated with a lower eGFR over time in women with baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or greater. The association between HCV seropositivity and decrease in renal function was statistically signicant even after adjusting for demographic factors, illicit drug use, diabetes, hypertension, parameters of HIV disease, and medication use (HAART, neph- rotoxic medications, and ACE inhibitors). This is the rst study to our knowledge to nd an asso- women with CKD.There are several possible explanations for the association between HCV infection and renal function decrease. Renal function decrease could be caused by HCV-induced glomerular disease. Studies support an association between HCV infection and various types of glomerulonephri- tis (particularly membranoproliferative glomeru- lonephritis) and cryoglobulinemia.1,16-20Alterna- tively, HCV infection could be accelerating renal disease associated with HIV , diabetes, and hyper- tension. In non-HIV-infected populations, HCV infection has been associated with a more rapid decrease in renal function in patients with diabe- tes.21Studies have linked HCV infection to ath- diseases in both HIV- and non-HIV-infected populations.22-25It is unlikely that the decrease in renal function could be related to hepatorenal syndrome in the setting of HCV-induced cirrhosis: only 1% of participants reported having cirrhosis during later years of the survey (the question was not asked at baseline). Finally, given the observational nature of the study, it is still possible that the ndings could be caused by residual confounding. Our nding that HCV was associated with eGFR decrease in only women with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2is surprising, but also consistent with the prior literature. A large study of veteran health care users found that HCV seropositivity was associated with increased risk Figure 2. Distribution of rates of estimated glomerular ltration rate (eGFR) decrease by hepatitis C virus (HCV) sta- tus (based on estimated indi- vidual slopes).HCV and Kidney Function Decline in HIV Women 47of developing end-stage renal disease, but was not associated with CKD (dened as eGFR/H1102160 mL/min/1.73 m2).26The investiga - patients with HCV infection who reach CKD may experience a more rapid decrease to end-stage renal disease (and renal re- placement therapy) or death, and therefore fewer numbers are observed to have eGFR in the CKD range at any single point in time. This study ap- pears to support this hypothesis by showing that in HIV-infected women who had low eGFR at base- line, those who were HCV seropositive had signi- cantly greater decreases in eGFR over time com- pared with those who were seronegative. A major limitation of this study is the use of the MDRD Study equation to estimate GFR. This equation has not been independently vali- dated as a measure of GFR in persons with HIV or HCV infection. However, the MDRD Studyequation is incorporated widely into clinical care and has been recommended in guidelines for screening for CKD in HIV-infected popula- tions.13Because our study was based on all HIV-infected women, principal results could be influenced only if the MDRD Study equation were selectively inaccurate in participants with HCV infection, which is possible given the muscle wasting associated with chronic liver disease. A number of studies comparing serum creatinine level with direct GFR measurement in cirrhotic patients have shown that creatinine level may overestimate true creatinine clearance (ie, appear normal in the setting of decreased GFR).27,28This should in theory bias our nd- ings in the opposite direction. Regardless, re- search is needed to determine the accuracy of GFR-estimating equations in the setting of HIV and HCV infection.Table 2.

However, prior research has shown that the ma- jority of HIV-infected individuals with a positive screening HCV antibody test result will have chronic hepatitis C by means of RNA testing,29 and seronegative HCV infection is relatively rare.30We did not adjust for current use of anti-HCV therapy; however, prior analyses of this cohort have shown that relatively few WIHS participants who tested positive for HCV anti- body reported ever receiving treatment for HCV infection.31Ascertainment of non-HIV-related medication use (such as ACE inhibitors) likely was incomplete; however, misclassication should be nondifferential with regard to HCV status. We did not include measures of diabetic control, such as blood glucose or hemoglobin A1clevels, in the analysis; however, diabetes was diagnosed in a relatively small percentage of patients. Finally, a major limitation of our analy- sis is that it did not include proteinuria because data were not routinely collected on our entire sample. Therefore, we cannot make broader infer- ences about the prevalence and incidence of true CKD. In summary, this study found in HIV-infected women with CKD (based on eGFR /H1102160 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) that HCV seropositivity was associated with greater decreases in eGFR over time, and this association was independent of comorbidities, sub- stance abuse, and use of renal-toxic medications. More research is needed to conrm these ndings and explore potential mechanisms underlying this association. Clinicians should be aware that HIV- infected individuals with CKD may warrant more careful monitoring of their renal function over time if they are coinfected with HCV .

This studyprospectively examined young injection drug users (IDU) to determine if behaviors changed after theywere made aware of HCV seroconversion.Methods: We estimated the effects of HCV seroconversion coupled with post-test counseling on risk behaviors (alcohol use, non-injection and injection drug use, lending and sharing injecting equipment,and having sex without a condom) and depression symptoms using conditional logistic regression, ttingodds-ratios for immediately after disclosure and 6 and 12 months later, and adjusting for secular effects.Results: 112 participants met inclusion criteria, i.e. they were documented HCV seronegative at study onset and subsequently seroconverted during the follow-up period, with infection conrmed by HCVRNA testing. HCV seroconversion was independently associated with a decreased of consumingalcohol (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.27-1.00, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81, p= 0.01) immediately after disclosure, however, results were not sustained over time. There were signif- icant ( p< 0.05) declines in the use of alcohol, injection and non-injection drugs, and sharing equipment associated with time that were independent from the effect of seroconversion.Conclusions: Making young IDU aware of their HCV seroconversion may have a modest effect on alcohol and non-injection drug use that is not sustained over time. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The rationale for screening pop- ulations at risk for HCV includes the possibility of altering riskbehaviors that impact disease progression and transmission, butlimited research exist to support this hypothesis ( Chou et al., 2004 ). Some studies suggest healthier alcohol use and injecting prac-tices among individuals who are aware that they are HCV infectedas opposed to those who are unaware ( al., 2002; McCusker, 2001; Nalpas et al., 2001; Tsui et al., 2007 ). However, a study of young IDU that examined drug use behaviors 6 monthsafter disclosure of HCV test results failed to nd any improvement(Ompad et al., 2002 ), and another cross-sectional study failed to nd any association between awareness of HCV status and injecting Corresponding author at: 801 Massachusetts Ave, Rm 2078, Boston, MA +1 Cox et al., 2009 ). No studies have prospectively followed young IDU who HCV seroconvert to examine drug use and sexualbehaviors before and after seroconversion. This study sought to determine whether becoming HCV seropos- itive and receiving post-test counseling is associated with changesin drug use and sexual risk behaviors among young IDU. We exam-ined whether awareness of seroconversion was associated witha reduction in alcohol, drug use, and sharing/lending of inject-ing equipment, and an increase in condom usage. In addition, inorder to address the potential negative psychological consequencesof being diagnosed with HCV, we also analyzed whether notica-tion of seroconversion was associated with subsequent depressedsymptoms. 2. Methods and materials 2.1. Study sample and design This study used observational data from the UFO study, a longitudinal cohort of young injection drug users (<30 years old) in San Francisco who were followedwith quarterly interviews and blood sample collection. Details of its study designand methods have been published previously ( Hahn et al., 2002 ). For this study, we restricted our sample to participants who had a documented HCV seroconversion 0376-8716/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Study partici- pants were recruited from January 2000 to June 2007, followed prospectively untilFebruary 20, 2008. 2.2. Study outcomes Outcome variables included alcohol use, injection drug use, sharing of injecting equipment and lending of syringes, non-injection drug use, and having sex without acondom. In addition, in order to examine the potential negative mental health effectsof being told one was HCV positive, we examined symptoms of depression as mea-sured by the 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Scale ( Melchior et al., 1993; Radloff, 1977 A score of 7 was used to dene signicant depressive symptomatology. All behaviors were assessed for the previousthree months except for alcohol and injection drug use which were assessed for theprevious month. Non-injection drug use was dened as use of cocaine, crack or mar-ijuana (the most commonly used non-injection drugs). Sharing ancillary injectingequipment included any sharing of cookers, cotton, or water and lending syringeswas dened as letting someone else use the participant's used syringe. Alcoholuse was dened as any use (abstinence versus non-abstinence). All outcomes wereassessed from self-reported data collected at interviewer-administered structuredinterviews. 2.3. Study predictors The primary predictor was disclosure of HCV seroconversion, followed by post- test counseling. Quarterly HCV antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) withenzyme immunoassays (EIA) (HCV EIA 2.0, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, orEIA-3, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan NJ), as well as HCV RNA virus using tran-scription mediated amplication HIV-1/HCV Diego, CA) to detect early HCVinfection ( Hahn et al., 2002 ). All screening HCV EIA results were conrmed with HCV RNA testing, and testing was done at study visits by study personnel. Disclosureof HCV seroconversion was documented and participants were provided post-testcounseling. Counseling was provided by UFO Study counselors who were trained andcertied in HIV test disclosure based on client-centered counseling policies of theCalifornia Department of Health Ofce of AIDS. For HCV testing disclosure, all UFOStudy counselors received extensive training on interpretation of HCV test results,HCV natural history, and behaviors that impact disease progression and transmis-sion. Pre- and post-test counseling was based on recommendations from the Centersfor Disease Control ( CDC, 1998 ), and information was provided regarding the need for a) preventing further harm to their liver (i.e. avoid alcohol), b) reducing risksfor transmitting HCV to others (i.e. no lending/sharing of injecting equipment) andc) medical evaluation for liver disease and possible treatment. HIV prevention wasemphasized to prevent co-infection. In addition to counseling to reduce risk of liverdisease, HCV transmission, and co-infection with HIV, participants were offeredvaccination for hepatitis A and B, and offered partner notication assistance. Additional predictors, which were selected a priori included: age at baseline, gender, race, education, number of years of injection drug use, homelessness andincarceration within the previous three months. 2.4. Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics of the sample were assessed using simple tabulations and calculation of means and medians. We estimated the effects of HCV seroconver-sion and disclosure/counseling on risk behaviors and depression using conditionallogistic regression. The rationale for this approach was to avoid confounding bydifferences between seroconverters and other study participants. In this type ofmatched case-control analysis, each participant serves as his/her own control, andbehaviors before and after seroconversion are compared. The effect of HCV serocon-version on the log-odds of each outcome was modeled by a \"jump\" at the noticationvisit, followed by a linear trend across subsequent visits. We then computed the t-ted odds-ratio for the effect of seroconversion at 6 and 12 months later. To controlfor confounding of the effect of HCV seroconversion by other covariates, we adjustedTable 1 Baseline characteristics of the sample of young IDU with HCV seroconversion(n= 112).

We controlled for secular effects (changes over time) by includ-ing time since study entry, using a linear spline if t was improved over a simplelinear trend. Fixed subject-specic covariates (age, sex, race, etc.), which representbetween- rather than within-subject differences, had no influence on the condi-tional parameter estimates. Because of the small sample size, we used restrictivemodel selection criteria, retaining covariates if they had a p-value < 0.15 or their inclusion resulted in a >3% change in the seroconversion effect estimate. We checkedfor departures from linearity of trend in the seroconversion effect across subse-quent post-conversion visits, and for collinearity between predictors. All statisticalanalyses were conducted using Stata version 10.0 (College Station, TX, USA). 3. Results From the 1223 young IDU that were screened, 555 individuals were enrolled and 403 were prospectively followed. Of those 403,112 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in thisstudy, i.e. they were documented HCV seronegative at study onset,subsequently seroconverted during the follow-up period. Partic-ipants who were included in the analysis tended to be slightlyyounger than those who were excluded from the analysis (meana g e2 2( \u00b13) versus 23 ( \u00b13),p-value < 0.01), otherwise there were no signicant differences in any of the other variables examined.Participants included in this study were predominantly Caucasianmales who injected heroin ( Table 1 ). Most participants acknowl- edged using non-injection drugs (87%) and drinking alcohol (78%)at baseline. A substantial percentage of participants reported beingrecently (prior 3 months) homeless (71%) or incarcerated (32%).The median follow-up was 1.8 years (IQR: 1.2-3.3). Among the 11sparticipants there were a total of 757 visits during which risk behav-iors were assessed: 440 visits occurred prior to seroconversion and317 occurred afterwards. The median number of post-seroconversion was 3 (IQR: 2-5).

Tsui et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 105 (2009) 160-163 In our analysis using conditional logistic models, we found that HCV disclosure after seroconversion was independently associatedwith immediate declines in use of alcohol and non-injection drugs(Table 2 ). However, the reductions became smaller over time (trend p-value for alcohol = 0.02, for non-injection drug use = 0.13). In con- trast, while we found little evidence for an immediate decline inlending syringes due to seroconversion, this was the only behaviorthat consistently diminished over time in association with sero-conversion and approached statistical signicance at one year;however, the time trend was not statistically ( p-value = 0.24). HCV seroconversion was not associated with changes in injection druguse, sharing of equipment or condom use, nor was it associatedwith depression. Most behaviors declined over time, independentof the HCV seroconversion effect: we observed statistically signif-icant ( p< 0.05) declines in the use of alcohol, injection as well as non-injection drugs, and sharing of ancillary injecting equipment,independent of the HCV seroconversion effect (data not shown).Our analysis of the correlation of covariates showed that whiletime since study entry was moderately strongly correlated withboth having seroconverted (0.46) and time since seroconversion(0.62), this did not reach the level of collinearity to prevent usfrom examining their effects simultaneously. Finally, adjusting HIVseroconversion (of which there were only 3 known cases) did notsubstantially impact results. 4. Discussion In this study of young IDU, we found that HCV seroconversion was associated with a decreased likelihood of consuming alco-hol and using non-injection drugs immediately after disclosure ofresults and post-test counseling. However, improvements in behav-iors were not sustained at 6 months and 12 months. There was nostatistically signicant change in injection drug use and injectingbehaviors after seroconversion and post-test counseling, thoughthere was a non-signicant trend toward decreased lending ofsyringes. Finally, there was no indication that depression symptomswere increased after becoming aware of their HCV infected status. The nding that injection drug use and injecting behaviors were not signicantly affected by HCV seroconversion and post-counseling is similar to a prior study of young IDU in Baltimorethat looked at behaviors 6 months after HCV testing and found thatthose who had tested positive had no change in injecting behav-iors ( Ompad et al., 2002 ). Our study, in contrast, did show mild improvements in reported alcohol use immediately after becom-ing aware of HCV seroconversion, though these improvements werenot sustained at 6 months. These results suggest that screening andproviding post-test counseling for HCV in young IDU is insufcientfor changing long-term behaviors. Evidence from the HIV preven-tion literature supports the supposition that testing and educationalone are insufcient to change behaviors ( Calsyn et al., 1992 ), and that more targeted behavioral interventions are needed to generatesustained reductions in high-risk behaviors in IDU. There were limitations to this study. It is important to note that the data were collected as part of a study whose primary goal wasto detect and assess rates and correlates HCV seroconversion, andwas not designed to study the impact of HCV screening and post-test counseling on behaviors. However, in lieu of a randomizedcontrolled study of HCV screening in IDU which has never beenconducted, this type of secondary data analysis can provide someinsights. The relatively modest sample size and follow-up time werelimitations to the study power. Furthermore, the moderately strongcorrelations of time since study entry with seroconversion as well astime since seroconversion did reduce power to assess these effects,so that our negative nding must be interpreted with caution. Ourstudy was based on self-reported behaviors, and therefore mayreflect socially desirable responses rather than actual behaviors, inparticular since study personnel who assessed risk behaviors also disclosed test results and provided counseling. In summary, this observational study of young IDU found mod- est improvements in reported alcohol and non-injection drug useimmediately after disclosure of HCV seroconversion and receipt ofpost-test counseling, however, those improvements were not sus-tained over time. On the other hand, we found no evidence thatpatients became more depressed after learning that they had newlyacquired HCV. While these results do not demonstrate that HCVtesting and counseling have a major influence on risk behaviors onindividuals who seroconvert, they do lend some evidence againstsubstantial harm. More studies are needed to identify and imple-ment effective interventions to reduce high-risk behaviors in youngIDU who become HCV infected.

Gillick, MD, Yuchiao Chang, PhD, and Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, MD, MA, MPH Introduction: When patients are unable to make important end-of-life decisions, doctors ask surrogatedecision makers to provide insight into patients' pref-erences. Unfortunately, multiple studies have shownthat surrogates' knowledge of patient preferences ispoor. We hypothesized that a video decision tool would improve concordance between patients and their surrogates for end-of-life preferences. Objective: To compare the concordance of ences among elderly patients and their surrogates lis- tening to only a verbal description of advanceddementia or viewing a video decision support toolof the disease after hearing the verbal description. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial of a convenience sample of community-dwelling elderly subjects ( $65 years) and their surrogates, and was conducted at 2 geriatric clinics afliated with 2 aca-demic medical centers in Boston. The study was con-ducted between September 1, 2007, and May 30,2008. Random assignment of patient and surrogate dyads was to either a verbal narrative or a video deci- sion support tool after the verbal narrative. Endpoints were goals of care chosen by the patient andpredicted goals of care by the surrogate. Goals ofcare included life-prolonging care (CPR, mechanicalventilation), limited care (hospitalization, antibiotics,but not CPR), and comfort care (only treatment torelieve symptoms). The primary outcome measurewas the concordance rate of preferences betweenpatients and their surrogates. Results: A total of 14 pairs of patients and their surro- gates were randomized to verbal narrative (n 56) or video after verbal narrative (n 58). Among the 6 patients receiving only the verbal narrative, 3 (50%) preferred comfort care, 1 (17%) chose limited care,and 2 (33%) desired life-prolonging care. Amongthe surrogates for these patients, only 2 correctlychose what their loved one would want if in a stateof advanced dementia, yielding a concordance rate of 33%. Among the 8 patients receiving the video decision support tool, all 8 chose comfort care.Among the surrogates for these patients, all 8 cor-rectly chose what their loved one would want if ina state of advanced dementia, yielding a concordancerate of 100%. Conclusion: Patients and surrogates viewing a video decision support tool for advanced dementia are more likely to concur about the patient's end-of-lifepreferences than when solely listening to a verbaldescription of the disease. (J Am Med Dir Assoc 2009; 10: 575-580) When patients are unable to make important end-of-life decisions, doctors ask surrogate decision makers to provide in-sight into patients' preferences. 1-3Surrogates, who are often family members, are often instructed to use an idealized hier-archy of standards to guide decision making: patients' knownwishes, substituted judgments, and patients' best interests. 4 Unfortunately, many surrogates do not know the wishes ofthe people they are supposed to represent. The substituted judgment standard attempts to have surro- gates imagine and predict what the patient would havewanted. 4A large number of clinical research studies have convincingly concluded that surrogates are often inaccuratein predicting the medical preferences of patients when offeredwritten or verbal hypothetical health states. 5-10The over- whelming conclusion of these studies is that surrogates areGeneral Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA (A.E.V., Y.C.); John D.

Theories abound regardingwhy surrogates inaccurately predict patient preferences,including the role of family dynamics; the relative ease ofovertreatment, also known as the ''status quo bias''; andpersonal psychological stress regarding the burden of end-of-life decision making. 11-13 One overlooked reason of why surrogates incorrectly pre- dict patient preferences may be a lack of comprehensionabout hypothetical health states and likely treatmentoutcomes. Central to the process of predicting patient prefer-ences is the surrogate's understanding of the underlyinghealth state. Empirical studies often communicate informa-tion about future health states to both patients and surrogateswith written or spoken words, and both parties must be will-ing to imagine often difcult and uncomfortable scenarios. Video is a powerful and underused medium that can better communicate hypothetical health states 14-16and may assist patients and surrogates in discussions of preferences.The medium of video engages and allows both patients andsurrogates to envision future health states in a manner notcaptured with verbal communication. We hypothesized thatvideo may enable patients and surrogates to better visualizeand imagine a future health state, which would lead to more accurate surrogate predictions that were more concor- dant with patient preferences. As part of a larger study on the use of video decision aids, we conducted a small randomized controlled trial of dyadsof patients and designated surrogates to examine whethera video of a person with advanced dementia would lead surro-gates and patients to have concordant responses to questionsabout end-of-life care. We hypothesized that patients and sur- rogates viewing a video decision-support tool for advanced dementia would be more likely to concur about the patient'send-of-life preferences than when solely listening to a verbaldescription of the disease. METHODS Participants The protocol was approved by the institutional review board for both institutions and all subjects provided informed consent. This study was part of a larger study evaluating theuse of video decision-support tools in advance care plan-ning. 17Elderly patients participating in the larger study whose surrogates were present during the clinic visit wereasked to participate in the present study. Patients and theirsurrogates were recruited from a convenience sample at 2urban geriatric clinics afliated with 2 teaching hospitals in the greater Boston area. Recruitment occurred between Sep- tember 1, 2007, and May 30, 2008. All scheduled English-speaking patients 65 years or older who presented to the clinicwith their designated surrogate were given a flier by the clinicstaff outlining the study. At the end of the clinic visit,patients and surrogates were asked by clinic staff if theywere interested in participating in the study. If they indicatedinterest, the patient was brought to a private room alone and was initially interviewed for eligibility based on a ShortPortable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) 18score of greater than or equal to 7 (scores \\7 indicate moderate or severe cognitive impairment) and the ability to provide informed consent. After the patient completed the interview,the surrogate, who was not present during the patient's inter-view, was then brought into the private room and completedthe interview separately. Inclusion criteria for the surrogatewere ability to provide informed consent and being the patient's designated surrogate. Study Design and Randomization After obtaining informed consent from both the patient and the surrogate, all patient-surrogate dyads were random- ized into 1 of 2 decision-making modalities: (1) listening toa verbal narrative describing advanced dementia (controlgroup); or (2) listening to a verbal narrative followed by view-ing a 2-minute video decision-support tool visually depicting a patient with advanced dementia (intervention group). Ran- domization was based on a computer-generated randomiza-tion scheme, and followed the randomization order of thelarger study from which this subgroup was taken. Individualassignments were concealed in numbered envelopes untilthe pair was randomized. All data were collected in a quietroom in the clinic area by a trained member of the researchteam (A.E.V.) who followed a structured script. The patient and surrogate were interviewed separately and were unaware of each other's answers to the survey. For both randomization groups, the interviewer read aloud a description of advanced dementia based on the FunctionalAssessment Staging (FAST) 19stage 7a. The FAST criteria include 7 stages of dementia (1-7), with the later stagesdepicting more advanced disease. Stage 7 is further brokendown into 6 substages (7a-7f). Stage 7a is generally consid- ered the threshold for advanced dementia, and the threshold for advanced dementia used in our previous studies. 14-16 Advanced dementia was described as an incurable illness ofthe brain caused by many years of Alzheimer's disease or a se-ries of strokes; its salient features are the inability to commu-nicate understandably with others, inability to walk withoutassistance, and inability to feed oneself (see Appendix 1 ). Patients randomized to the intervention group viewed the video decision support tool on a portable computer after lis-tening to the same verbal narrative. The 2-minute video de-picts the principal features of advanced dementia as describedin the narrative. The video presents an 80-year-old female pa-tient with advanced dementia together with her 2 daughtersin the nursing home setting. The patient fails to respond totheir attempts at conversation (inability to communicate).The patient is next shown being pushed in a wheelchair (inability to ambulate). Last, the patient is hand-fed pureed food (inability to feed oneself). Consent to lm the patientwith advanced dementia and to use the video for researchpurposes was obtained from the patient's designated healthcare proxy before lming. The development of the video followed a systematic approach, 20starting with a review of the dementia literature. We then used a panel of physicians with an iterative process of comments to review the design, content, and structure of 576 Volandes et al JAMDA - October 2009the video intervention. This panel included 5 geriatricians and 5 neurologists, all of whom specialize in the care ofpatients with dementia. The video was lmed without the use of prompts or stage di- rections to convey a candid realism in the style known as cin-ema verite. 21All lming and editing were done by the principal investigator (A.E.V.) following previously published lmingcriteria. 22(The video is available at: www.ACPdecisions.com .) Data Collection and Other Variables The interviewer was not blinded to randomization group. Each patient was interviewed before and after receiving theverbal narrative alone or the narrative plus the video deci-sion-support tool using structured questionnaires. The baselinestructured interview (15 minutes) included the following com-ponents: demographic data and knowledge about advanced de-mentia. Sociodemographic data included age, race, gender, educational status, and marital status. Race was self-reported. Having a previous relationship with someone with advanceddementia was also obtained. Knowledge of advanced dementiawas assessed using 5 true/false questions that asked patients andtheir surrogates whether advanced dementia is curable and ifpatients with advanced dementia are able to communicatewith others, recognize family members, ambulate, and feedthemselves. Thus, knowledge scores ranged from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better knowledge. Immediately after receiving the verbal narrative alone or narrative plus video, a second structured in-person interview (15 minutes) was conducted that included the following com-ponents: knowledge of advanced dementia and preferencesfor goals of care; and for the intervention group, comfort usingthe video decision-support tool. The knowledge questionswere identical to those asked in the baseline interview. Each surrogate, who was not present during the interview with the patient and was unaware of the patient's answers,was asked an identical set of questions with the sole exceptionthat each surrogate was asked to predict the preferences forthe goals of care for their loved one using the substituted judg-ment criterion. Preferences for goals of care were presented as 3 options: life-prolonging care, limited care, and comfort care (see Appendix 1 ). Examples of the kinds of care implied by each goal were verbally described to participants. The rst op- tion, life-prolonging care, was described as aiming to prolonglife at any cost. It translates into all potentially indicatedmedical care that is available in a modern-day hospital,including cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatment inthe intensive care unit. The second option, limited care,was described as aiming to maintain physical functioning. It is consistent with treatments such as hospitalization, intrave- nous fluids, and antibiotics, but not with attempted cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR) and treatment in the intensivecare unit (ICU). The third option, comfort care, wasdescribed as aiming to maximize comfort and to relievepain. Treatments are focused on the relief of symptoms. It iscompatible with oxygen and analgesics but not withintravenous (IV) therapies and hospitalization unless neces- sary to provide comfort. The aim is to relieve pain and tobe kept as pain-free as possible. Comfort care does not include CPR, respirators, ICU care, and generally would not includeIV therapy or hospitalization. Following these explanations,patients were asked their preferences in the event they devel-oped advanced dementia. Surrogates were asked to predictwhich preference their loved ones would pick. For those patients and surrogates randomized to the video intervention group, a 4-point Likert scale was used to assess perceived value of the video by asking them whether they had a better understanding of the disease after viewing thevideo, if they were comfortable watching the video, and ifthey would recommend the video to others. These questionswere asked at the end of the oral survey. The survey is avail-able on request. Statistical Analysis Patient-surrogate dyads were analyzed based on the deci- sion-making modality to which they were randomized. The primary outcome measure for patients was their preferencesfor care if in a state of advanced dementia categorized as 3 op-tions (life-prolonging, limited, or comfort). The primary out-come measure for surrogates was the preferences they felttheir loved one would choose based on the substituted judg- ment criterion. Additional outcomes included change in knowledge scores for both patients and subjects before com-pared with after receiving the verbal narrative or video. All subject characteristics and outcomes were described us- ing proportions for categorical variables and means (SD) forcontinuous variables. Concordance rates for patient-surro-gate dyads were the proportions of surrogates who chose thesame preference as their loved one over the total number of dyads in the randomization group. Chi-square tests were used to compare the concordance rate and 2 sample ttests were used to compare change in knowledge scores from beforeto after the intervention between the 2 randomization groups.All reported Pvalues are 2-sided, with P\\.05 considered as statistically signicant. Data were analyzed using SAS soft-ware, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). RESULTSParticipant Flow A total of 14 consecutive pairs of eligible patient-surrogate dyads were approached to participate in the study, all of whom agreed to be interviewed and were eligible to partici-pate. Six patients were randomized to the control group,and 8 patients were randomized to the video-interventiongroup. Baseline characteristics of the patients and surrogatesare shown in Table 1 . Of the 14 designated surrogates, 7 were spouses of the patients, 5 were children of the patients,1 was a sibling, and 1 was a friend. None had a previous rela- tionship with someone with advanced dementia. Although the power to detect differences was small, there were no sig-nicant differences in either patients or surrogates in age,gender, or education. Outcomes Among the 6 patients receiving only the verbal narrative, 3 (50%) preferred comfort care, 1 (17%) chose limited care, ORIGINAL STUDIES Volandes et al 577and 2 (33%) desired life-prolonging care ( Figure 1). Among the 6 surrogates receiving only the verbal narrative, only 2 predicted correctly what their loved one would want if ina state of advanced dementia, yielding a concordance rateof 33% ( Figure 1). Of the 4 surrogates misjudged the pref- erences of the patients, 3 surrogates chose less aggressive carecompared with their loved ones. Among the 8 patients receiving the video decision-support tool after the verbal narrative, all 8 chose comfort care.Among the 8 surrogates receiving the video decision-supporttool as well, all 8 predicted correctly what their loved onewould want if in a state of advanced dementia, yielding a con-cordance rate of 100% ( P5.015 compared with the verbal narrative-alone group). K n o w l e d g es c o r e si n c r e a s e df o rp a t i e n t si nb o t hg r o u p sp o s t intervention; however, the changes were higher in the narrativeplus video group compared with those in the narrative-alonegroup (2.1 /C61.6 versus 0.3 /C61.6, respectively; P5.068). The change in knowledge scores was also higher for surrogates inthe narrative plus video group compared with those in the nar-rative-alone group (2.5 /C61.4 versus 2.0 /C61.3, respectively; P5.50). The video decision-support tool was very well accepted by pa- tients and surrogates in the intervention group: 15 of 16 (94%)patients and surrogates found the video ''very helpful'' and would ''denitely'' or ''probably'' recommend the videoto others. There were no adverse events in either group.DISCUSSION Patients and surrogates viewing a video decision-support tool for advanced dementia are more likely to concur about the patient's end-of-life preferences than when listening to a verbal description of the disease. Moreover, viewing thevideo decision-support tool was associated with a trendtoward more knowledge of advanced dementia among bothpatients and their surrogates. The fact that participants' deci-sions with the video were more informed is consistent withprior research of ours that has also exhibited better knowl-edge, better certainty, and better stability of preferences for patients' end-of-life preferences after viewing a video deci- sion-support tool. 14,17 In the current project, surrogates' decisions were more likely to be concordant with patients' preferences. However,it is possible that our ndings should be viewed in a differentway. The instances of discordance between surrogates andpatients all occurred among people who did not see the videoand most were instances in which the patient wanted more aggressive medical care than suggested by the surrogates. As such, it is possible that our ndings should be viewed primar-ily as a tool that improved decisions by patients and then,only as a consequence, similarly improved the rate of concor-dance between patients and surrogates. Our study has several important limitations. First, the researcher surveying the patient-surrogate dyads was notblinded to the randomization assignment. This could have introduced bias into our ndings. Prior randomized studies of interventions aimed at improving end-of-life decisionTable 1.

Patient and surrogate preferences by randomization group. 578 Volandes et al JAMDA - October 2009making have seldom been blinded because limiting the num- ber of interviewers eases the burden of addressing difcult andoften painful subject matter. 23-25We attempted to reduce the influence of this potential bias by using structured interviewsand outcome measures. Second, video clips can be manipu-lated to favor a particular perspective. Although our carefullycrafted video followed published lming criteria on usingvideo in end-of-life discussions, 22there may have been poten- tial bias in the evaluation of the decision-support tool. Itwould be fruitful to study other video clips of similar patients.Third, the sample size was very small and did not permit anal-yses to evaluate the role of factors such as gender and race,which would have permitted relevant analyses to evaluate po-tential bias in the tool. Fourth, we asked subjects for theirpreferences in the context of a research study. The nextstep would be to investigate whether surrogates would cor- rectly predict preferences in real time. Fifth, we asked subjects the same questions before and after the intervention. A morerigorous method of testing changes in knowledge and prefer-ences would have been to use parallel forms of the questionsto avoid biasing the results. Finally, our sample was drawnfrom the metro Boston area and did not include large minor-ity groups such as African Americans, Latinos, and AsianAmericans. Including surrogates in the decision-making process has been an important yet complex advancement in modernmedical care. To secure the delivery of high-quality end-of-life care that is concordant with patients' preferences, surro-gates must be informed regarding their decision making.As has been shown in previous studies, using the substitutedcriterion is a complex task for surrogates, asking them toimagine what are often unimaginable health states for layper- sons. Patient education using video decision-support tools can improve surrogate comprehension of disease states suchas advanced dementia that are difcult to envision solelywith words. Future work with surrogates may extend the useof video decision-support tools to other disease states suchas advanced cancer. This study provides evidence that videodecision-support tools enhance patients' and surrogates' deci-sion making by ensuring that it is both more informed and concordant with subjects' wishes at the end of life.

ORIGINAL STUDIES Volandes et al 579Appendix 1 Narrative Describing Advanced Dementia ''I am going to describe to you an illness called advanced dementia, like advanced Alzheimer's dementia, that you may or may not be familiar with. Advanced dementia is anincurable disease of the brain in which one is not able to com-municate with others. People with advanced dementia arenot able to move around or walk, get out of bed indepen-dently, eat by oneself, or communicate understandably withothers. People with advanced dementia often have difculty chewing or swallowing, and require assistance with feeding oneself. Advanced dementia is an incurable disease andmost commonly occurs after many years of Alzheimer's dis-ease or as the result of strokes. People are not able to answerany questions or tell you about themselves.'' Narrative describing the goals of care ''I am going to ask you a question about your preferences for medical care if you had a disease called advanced dementia. I will ask you what you prefer. You have 3 choices for medicalcare if you had this condition. I will rst review these 3choices with you. The 3 choices for medical care that Iwant you to think about for advanced dementia are Life-Pro-longing Care, Limited Care, and Comfort Care. Life-Prolonging Care The goal of this category of care is to prolong life. There are no limits to care. This choice includes everything a modernhospital has to offer to maintain your life. Such procedures include: cardio-pulmonary resuscitation or CPR in whicha doctor pushes on your chest when the heart stops and willoften use electricity to shock the heart. Being placed ona breathing machine, also known as life support, in whicha tube is placed down your throat into the lungs. And othermedical procedures performed in the intensive care unit or ICU. The goal is to prolong life. Limited Care The goal of this category is to maintain physical and men- tal functions. Care will depend on your physical and mental functioning. Such care includes intravenous (IV) therapieslike antibiotics and hospitalization. But does not includecardiopulmonary resuscitation/CPR and intensive care unit/ ICU care. The goal is to maintain physical and mental functioning. Comfort Care The goal of this category is to maximize comfort. Only measures that comfort or relieve pain are performed. The aim is to relieve pain and to be kept as pain-free as possible.Comfort Care does not include cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion/CPR, respirators, intensive care unit/ICU care, and gen- erally would not include intravenous (IV) therapy orhospitalization. The goal is maximizing comfort and relievingpain. 580 Volandes et al JAMDA - October 2009RESEARCH Video decision support tool for advance care planning in dementia: randomised controlled trial Angelo E Volandes, instructor,1Michael professor,5Areej El-Jawahri, research fellow,1Susan L Mitchell, associate professor6 ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate the effect of a video decision support tool on the preferences for future medical care in older people if they develop advanced dementia, and the stability of those preferences after six weeks. Design Randomised controlled trial conducted between 1 September 2007 and 30 May 2008. Setting Four primary care clinics (two geriatric and two adult medicine) affiliated with three academic medical centres in Boston. Participants Convenience sample of 200 older people ( 65 years) living in the community with previously scheduled appointments at one of the clinics. Mean age was 75 and 58% were women. Intervention Verbal narrative alone (n =106) or with a video decision support tool (n =94). Main outcome measures Preferred goal of care: life prolonging care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation), limited care (admission to hospital, antibiotics, but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation), or comfort care (treatment only to relieve symptoms). Preferences after six weeks. The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of participants in each group who preferred comfort care. Results Among participants receiving the verbal narrative alone, 68 (64%) chose comfort care, 20 (19%) chose limited care, 15 (14%) chose life prolonging care, and three (3%) were uncertain. In the video group, 81 (86%) chose comfort care, eight (9%) chose limited care, four (4%) chose life prolonging care, and one (1%) was uncertain ( 2=13.0, df =3, P=0.003). Among all participants the factors associated with a greater likelihood of opting for comfort care were being a college graduate or higher, good or better health status, greater health literacy, white race, and randomisation to the video arm. In multivariable analysis, participants in the video group were more likely to prefer comfort care than those in the verbal group (adjusted odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 8.6). Participants were re- interviewed after six weeks. Among the 94/106 (89%) participants re-interviewed in the verbal group, 27 (29%) changed their preferences ( =0.35). Among the 84/94 (89%) participants re-interviewed in group, five(6%) changed their preferences ( =0.79) (P<0.001 for difference). Conclusion Older people who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced dementia after hearing a verbal description of the condition are more likely to opt for comfort as their goal of care compared with those who solely listen to a verbal description. They also have more stable preferences over time. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00704886. INTRODUCTION Respecting patients 'preferences for treatment is a key component of high quality end of life care.1-4Tradition- ally, physicians help patients to engage in advance care planning for future health states by describing hypothetical situations such as advanced dementia and by exploring possible goals of care.56This tradi- tional approach is limited because it is challenging to realistically envision hypothetical future disease states such as dementia from verbal descriptions,7descrip- tions are inconsistent among providers,8-15and the degree to which patients understand verbal descrip- tions of complex medical conditions depends on their level of health literacy. Visual images can improve communication of com- plex health information16-19and inform decision mak- ing at the end of life.20-22In our previous investigations, a video decision support tool for advanced dementia seemed to improve communication and decision mak- ing for patients by helping them to visualise future health states.20-22However, there were significant shortcomings to these studies: they were conducted in healthy middle aged patients; they used a before and after study design that did not allow comparison of the video to the standard advance care planning approach of a verbal narrative; they did not measure knowledge of the disease to test whether understanding of the disease improved; and they did not follow patients 'preferences over time. To address these shortcomings, we conducted a ran- domised controlled trial of the video decision support tool among a diverse group of older patients to study the video with a higher level of rigour.

A secondary, exploratoryhypothesis was that the goals of care would be pre-dicted by health literacy. Advanced dementia is an excellent model on which to test the hypothesis that visualising a hypothetical health state improves decision making. Advanced dementia is an ultimately fatal, progressive, neurological disease inwhich the median survival after the onset of symptoms isthree to six years. 2324Patients with advanced dementia are at high risk of developing multiple yet predictable medical problems over the course of their illness, includ- ing aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and difficultyin swallowing. By virtue of their cognitive impairment,patients will seldom be able to participate in decisionsabout their care at the time problems develop. Healthy patients or patients in the early stages of dementia can, however, influence the treatment they will receive byexploring their goals of care with their physician. Thisentails deciding whether they would want specific inter- ventions, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intra- venous antibiotics, or admission to hospital. Thisrandomised controlled trial examined whether a videoof a patient with advanced dementia could shape thechoices made by people about the kind of care they w o u l dw a n ti nt h ef u t u r e . METHODS Participants Participants were recruited from a convenience sample of patients cared for at four primary care clinics locatedat three teaching hospitals in the greater Boston area.These comprised an urban geriatric clinic, a suburban geriatric clinic, an urban adult primary care clinic, and a suburban adult primary care clinic. Recruitment occurred between 1 September 2007 and 30 May 2008. Clinic staff gave all scheduled English speaking patients aged 65 or over a leaflet outlining the study after patients registered for their clinic visit, which was scheduled as part of their usual care. At the endof the visit, clinic staff asked patients if they were inter- ested in participating in the study. If patients indicated interest, the research team initially interviewed them for eligibility. Eligibility criteria included ability to communicate in English, ability to provide informed consent, and absence of moderate or severe cognitive impairment based on a short portable mental status questionnaire (SPMSQ) score of 7 (scores <7 indicate moderate or severe cognitive impairment). 25 Study design and randomisation After we obtained informed consent, all patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomised into one of two groups: listening to a verbal narrative describing advanced dementia (control group) or listening to the same verbal narrative followed by watching a two min- ute video depicting a patient with advanced dementia (intervention group). We used simple randomisation based on a computer generated scheme. Individual assignments were concealed in numbered envelopes,half of which were made available to each interviewer. One randomisation list was generated for all four clinics. At the end of the trial, the randomisation order of participants was checked against the computer generated list. A trained member of the research team followed a structured script to collect data in a quiet room in the clinic area. For both groups, the interviewer read aloud the ver- bal narrative describing advanced dementia (see appendix on bmj.com). This description was based on the functional assessment staging (FAST) stage 7a. 26The FAST criteria include seven stages of demen- tia, with the later stages depicting more advanced dis- ease. Stage 7 is further broken down into six substages (7a-7f). Stage 7a is generally considered the threshold for advanced dementia. The narrative states that advanced dementia is an incurable illness of the brain caused by many years of Alzheimer 's disease or a ser- ies of strokes. Its salient features are the inability to communicate understandably with others, inability to walk without assistance, and inability to feed oneself. Participants randomised to the intervention group viewed the video decision support tool on a portable computer after listening to the same verbal narrative. The two minute video depicts the principal features of advanced dementia as described in the narrative. The video presents an 80 year old female patient with advanced dementia together with her two daughters in the nursing home setting(www.bmj.com/video/care_preferences_dementia.dtl; also available at www.ACPdecisions.com). The patient fails to respond to their attempts at conversation (inability to communicate).

Lastly, the patient is fed pureed food (inability to feed oneself). Before filming we obtained consent from her designated healthcare proxy to film the patient and to use the video for research purposes. The development of the video followed a systematic approach,27starting with a review of the literature on dementia and advance care planning. We then used a panel of physicians with an iterative process of com- ments to review the design, content, and structure of the video intervention. This panel included five geria- tricians and five neurologists, all of whom specialise inthe care of patients with dementia. The video was filmed without the use of prompts or stage directions to convey a candid realism. 28The prin- cipal investigator (AEV) did all filming and editing, following previously published filming criteria.29The video is accompanied by the same narration that wasused in the verbal description arm of the study. Data collection and other variables At all four study sites, two members of the researchteam (AEV and AEJ), who were not blinded to the randomisation group, used structured questionnaires to interview participants before and after they listenedto the verbal narrative alone or listened to the narrative and watched the video. At the baseline structured inter- view (15 minutes) we collected demographic data and data on health status and knowledge about advanced dementia. Sociodemographic data included age, race (self reported), sex, educational status, and marital sta- tus. Health status was self rated on a Likert scale as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Participants were also asked if they had had a diagnosis of dementiaand whether they had known a person with advanced dementia. We assessed knowledge of advanced dementia with five true/false questions that asked whether advanced dementia is curable and if patients with advanced dementia are able to communicate with others, recognise family members, ambulate, and feed themselves. Knowledge scores therefore ranged from 0-5, with higher scores indicating better knowledge. Participants underwent a second structured inter- view (15 minutes) immediately after the intervention. This included knowledge of advanced dementia, pre- ferences for goals of care, health literacy, and, for the video group, comfort with the video decision support tool. The knowledge questions were identical to those asked in the baseline interview. There were three options for preferences for goals of care: life prolonging care, limited care, and comfort care (see appendix on bmj.com). Researchers verbally described examples of the kinds of care implied by each goal. The first option, life prolonging care, was described as aiming to prolong life at any cost. It trans- lates into all potentially indicated medical care that is available in a modern hospital, including cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and treatment in the intensive care unit. The second option, limited care, was described as aiming to maintain physical functioning. It includes treatments such as admission to hospital,intravenous fluids, and antibiotics but not attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatment in theintensive care unit. The third option, comfort care, was described as aiming to maximise comfort and to relieve pain. Only measures that provide comfort areperformed. It is compatible with oxygen and analge- sics but not with intravenous treatments and admission to hospital unless necessary to provide comfort. Afterthese explanations, participants were asked about their preferences for care if they developed advanced dementia. Participants who were unable to select alevel of care were considered \"uncertain. \" We assessed health literacy using the rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine tool (REALM). 30This is a Table 1 |Characteristics of older people living in the community randomised to verbal description and videodecision support groups.

It is a validated test of word pronunciationand has been shown to correlate well with tests thatevaluate a range of literacy skills. 30As others have done, we defined three categories for health literacy based on the REALM scores: 6th grade and below(up to age 11; score 0-45); 7-8th grade (ages 12-13;45-60); and 9th grade and above (age 14 and over; 61-66). 31 32 For those participants randomised to the video inter- vention group, we used a four point Likert scale toassess the perceived value of the video by asking parti- cipants whether they had a better understanding of the disease after viewing the video, if they were comforta-ble watching the video, if they would recommend thevideo to others, and whether they thought videoswould be helpful for eliciting preferences for care inother diseases like cancer. One interviewer (AEV) contacted participants by telephone six weeks after the initial interview to deter- mine again what their preferences would be if they hadadvanced dementia in exactly the same manner as theinitial interview. We chose a follow-up period of sixweeks to ensure that an adequate amount of timeelapsed from exposure to the intervention and to assesswhether the video had an enduring effect. Statistical analysis Our analyses were based on the decision making groupto which participants were randomised. The primaryoutcome measure was preferences for care if they developed advanced dementia categorised as four options (life prolonging, limited, comfort, or uncer-tain). Additional outcomes included change in knowl-edge scores before and after the intervention and thestability of preferences after six weeks.All characteristics of participants and outcomes were described by using proportions for categorical vari-ables and means (SD) for continuous variables. Weused 2tests to compare preferences for care (life prolonging, limited, comfort, or uncertain) between the two groups. Two sample ttests compared change in knowledge scores before and after the intervention between thetwo groups. We used statistics to summarise the sta- bility of preferences six weeks after the clinic interviewfor each group and compared the proportions whochanged preferences with Pearson 2exact test between the two groups. The measure for the primary outcome analysis was the unadjusted difference in proportions of partici- pants preferring comfort care between the two study groups. We conducted secondary analyses to identifyfactors associated with a preference for comfort careamong all participants. Bivariate analyses determinedthe association between individual characteristics ofparticipants (age, sex, race, education, marital status,health status, personal history of dementia, previous relationship with a person with advanced dementia, health literacy, and randomisation group) and apreference for comfort care with Fisher 's exact test. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were usedto identify factors independently associated withpreferences for comfort care. Factors significant at0.10 in the bivariate analyses were entered into a step- wise algorithm, retaining factors in the model that were significant at the 0.05 level. We used the varianceinflation factor to diagnose colinearity among potentialpredictors. All reported P values are two sided, with P<0.05 con- sidered as significant.

With a targetof 100 patients in each group, the power of the study was estimated to be >90%. Data were analysed with SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS Participant flow We approached 225 consecutive and potentially eligi-ble patients, of whom 205 (92%) agreed to be inter-viewed. Patients who declined did not differ significantly from the recruited participants in terms of age, sex, or race. The most common reason givenfor not participating was lack of time. Of the 205recruited for the study, five were disqualified because their mental status questionnaire score was <7, result- ing in a total of 200 study participants. Of these, 106were randomised to the control group and 94 to the video intervention group (fig 1). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics. Despite the randomisationprocess there were some baseline differences in the two groups, including diagnosis of dementia and pre- vious relationship with someone with dementia,. Outcomes Among the 106 participants receiving only the verbalnarrative, 68 (64%) chose comfort care, 20 (19%) chose limited care, 15 (14%) chose life prolonging care, and three (3%) were uncertain of their preferences. Amongthe 94 who also saw the video, 81 (86%) chose comfort care, eight (9%) chose limited care, four (4%) chose life prolonging care, and one (1%) was uncertain of her preferences ( 2=13.0, df =3; P=0.003).

Mean knowledge scores (range 0-5) were signifi- cantly higher in the video group than in the controlgroup (4.5 (SD 1.0) v3.8 (SD 1.3), respectively; P<0.001). The mean increase in knowledge scores for the video group was 2.4 (2.1 to 2.7) and 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9)for the control group, which was significant (P<0.001). Table 2 shows the unadjusted differences in propor- tions of participants and odds ratios preferring comfort care for each of the characteristics. The factors asso-ciated with a greater likelihood of preferring comfortcare among all participants were being a college grad- uate or higher, good or better health status, greater health literacy, white race, and randomisation to thevideo group. The first four factors were highly corre- lated: those with higher degree of education were more likely to have better health status, greater health lit-eracy, and more likely to be white; those with better health status were more likely to have greater health literacy and were more likely to be white; and thosewith greater health literacy were more likely to bewhite (all with P<0.05). The variance inflation factors, however, were all less than 2.5 when we tested these four factors in the regression model, which indicatedweak evidence of multicollinearity. After inclusion of these variables in a multivariable logistic regression model, participants randomised to the interventiongroup had a greater likelihood of opting for comfort care (adjusted odds ratio 3.9, 1.8 to 8.6). Other factors independently associated with opting for comfort careincluded a health literacy level of greater than 9thgrade (4.1, 1.6 to 10.8) and white race (2.9, 1.3 to 6.6) (table 2). Six weeks after the initial clinic visit, we attempted to contact each participant by telephone. Among the 94(89%) in the control group who could be contacted, 27 (29%) changed their preferences; the statistic for pre- ference stability was 0.35 (0.15 to 0.54) (fig 2). Amongthe 84 (89%) participants contacted in the video group, five (6%) changed their preferences; the statistic for preference stability was 0.79 (0.62 to 0.98). After sixweeks, the proportion of participants changing prefer- ences was lower in the video group (P<0.001). The video decision support tool was highly accepta- ble to participants: 83 of 94 (88%) found the video\"very helpful \"or\"somewhat helpful \"; \"recommend the video to others; and 78 (83%) thought that using videos for other dis- eases (such as cancer) would be \"very helpful \"or \"somewhat helpful. \"There were no adverse events in either group. DISCUSSION Principal findings When presented with the possibility of developingadvanced dementia, older patients living in the com- munity are more likely to choose comfort as the pri- mary goal of care after viewing a video of a patient with the disease and listening to a verbal description rather than just hearing a verbal description of advanced dementia. Moreover, viewing the video improved knowledge of advanced dementia andenhanced stability of preferences for treatment over time compared with hearing only the verbal narrative. Finally, health literacy seems to be associated with end of life preferences among older patients. Comparison with other studies To the best of our knowledge, this study represents thefirst randomised controlled trial in a group of older patients of a video decision support tool for decision making at the end of life. In our previous before and after investigation of the advanced dementia videoconducted in healthy middle aged participants, the video promoted preferences for comfort care, but it was not a randomised trial, was conducted with a younger healthy cohort, and did not follow the stability of preferences over time. 20Our current study extends this earlier work by showing the efficacy of the video in a randomised controlled trial among older patients.Moreover, the participants in the video group were more likely to have improved knowledge after the video and stable preferences over time. The stability of preferences is a critical consideration in evaluating preferences at the end of life 33-40and suggests a more accurate reflection of patients 'values and wishes. Strengths and limitations Our study has several important limitations and numerous strengths. Firstly, the research staff collect- ing data at baseline and at the immediate and six week follow-up interviews were not blinded to randomisa- tion, which could have introduced bias into our find-ings. Previous randomised studies of interventions aimed at improving end of life decision making, how- ever, have seldom been blinded because limiting the number of interviewers eases the burden on partici- pants of addressing difficult and often painful subjectmatter. 8-10Furthermore, participants might disclose whether they viewed the video or not. We attemptedWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC Advance care planning is a complex process involving communication of future health states such as advanced dementia Visual images might be helpful to improve decision making and communication of complex information regarding what type of medical care patients would want at the end of life WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Video images of advanced dementia improved knowledge for patients choosing the type ofmedical care they would like if they developed advanced dementia Patients who viewed a video decision support tool of advanced dementia after hearing a verbal description were more likely to choose a comfort oriented approach compared with patients solely listening to a verbal narrative of the disease Patients using the video decision support tool had more stable preferences for end of life care over time Video decision support tools might be most useful for patients with low health literacyRESEARCH page 6 of 8 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.comto reduce the influence of this potential bias by using structured interviews and outcome measures. Sec- ondly, despite randomisation there were some base- line differences between the two groups. This can be expected in a relatively small sample. Thirdly, videos can be manipulated to favour a particular perspective. Our study used one video of a white woman with dementia. We did not assess responses of participantsto videos of people of different sex and race. Fourthly, we asked participants for their preferences in the con- text of a research study. The next step would be to investigate whether patients and physicians would document their preferences in the medical record or complete an advance directive. 41Finally, our sample was primarily white and African-American and drawn from primary care clinics in teaching hospitals in metropolitan Boston. Thus, our findings might not be generalisable to other minority groups (such as Lati- nos and Asian-Americans). Policy implications and future research Previous uses of video decision support tools have pri- marily focused on helping patients to make treatment or screening decisions.42Our use of video redirects attention to the underlying health state by clarifying the nature of the condition about which patients are expected to make decisions. Our use of video portrays the illness to add a sense of verisimilitude that might belacking in verbal descriptions. Moreover, these images might offer a more objective and straightforward approach to describe complex medical conditions, which is particularly pertinent to patients with low health literacy. In the US such patients are more likely to be elderly and African-American 31and are among the most vulnerable populations in our healthcare sys- tem. As the video led to better knowledge of advanced dementia, our study supports the claim made by others that pictorial or visual methods improve decision mak- ing processes.16-22 Previous studies have suggested that non-white peo- ple receive and opt for more aggressive end of life care.43-49The reason for this observation is not well elucidated but might be, in part, because of variation in the quality of counselling they receive and their understanding of that counselling. As we have shown elsewhere,22our study lends additional support to the notion that health literacy potentially mediates the role of race in end of life decision making, and video deci- sion support tools offer an approach to circumvent thisdisparity. Future work is needed to explore this finding as health literacy was highly correlated with other vari- ables and our study lacked adequate power to conduct detailed analyses of mediation. The next step in using videos is to explore other dis- eases and the goals of care with video portrayals. We suspect that numerous other diseases and inter- ventions, such as advanced cancer and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, would also be more accurately conveyed to patients through a visual med- ium than solely by verbal descriptions. As we have shown here and elsewhere, 29criteria regarding thenecessary content and editing of each video portrayal must be carefully considered before clinical applica- tion of these videos. Active debate exists surrounding the development of decision support technologies, especially whenhighly subjective content (patients 'narratives and tes- timonials) and non-traditional media (video) are used. 50 51While important steps have been taken to develop objective criteria for the development andfield testing of decision support tools, 52 53more research is needed particularly as they apply to the use of video. Including patients in the decision making process has been an important yet complex advance in modernmedical care. To secure the delivery of high quality end of life care, patients must be informed regarding their decision making. Education of patients usingvideo decision support tools can improve their com-prehension of disease states such as advanced demen-tia that are difficult to envision solely with words. Future work could extend the use of video decision support tools to other disease states such as advancedcancer and the goals of care. We have shown that videodecision support tools enhance elderly patients 'deci- sion making by ensuring that it is both more informedand consistent over time.

BACKGROUND: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately frommedical care. Hence, coordination of medical care andsubstance use treatment is important to preserve patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and MMT documen-tation are missing in medical records and characteriz- ing potential medication-methadone interactions. METHODS: Among patients from a methadone clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical center, we reviewed electronic medi-cal records for documentation of methadone, opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interac- tions. The proportions of medical records without opioiddependence methadone documentation were esti-mated and potential medication-methadone interac- were identified. RESULTS: Among the study subjects (n=84), opioid dependence documentation was missing from the med- in 30% (95% CI, 20% -41%) and documentation was missing from either the last prima- ry care note or the last hospital discharge summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the studysubjects had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more poten- tially interacting medications. CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving MMT and medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in the medical record occurs forthe majority, but is missing in a substantial number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medica- tions that potentially interact with methadone. Thisstudy highlights opportunities for improved coordina- tion between and MMT.KEY WORDS: methadone; medication interactions; patient safety; care Intern Med 24(9):1007 -11 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-1043-4 \u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 INTRODUCTION Both the Institute of Medicine and the Joint Commission have focused attention on the role that medication discrepancies and errors play in adverse events and decreased quality of care.1,2For hospital, ambulatory, and behavioral healthcare, a Joint Commission goal is to \"accurately and completely reconcile medications across the continuum of care. \"The Institute of Medicine specifically called the improvement ofcommunication between medical and substance use treatment providers fundamental to improving the quality of healthcare for patients with mental and substance-use conditions. 3 Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for approximately 260,000 opioid-dependent patients in the United States is restricted to federal- and state-regulated clinics.4Typically, MMT clinics are in locations that are separate from generalmedical care with increased confidentiality protections re- quired for substance use related health information, 5,6which can be a barrier to the coordination of care. MMT is a chronic therapy for opioid dependence, a chronic relapsing disease that often requires lifelong treatment.7 Common co-occurring conditions among opioid-dependent patients receiving MMT, that also require chronic pharmaco- therapy include HIV infection,8mood disorders,9-11chronic pain,12osteoporosis,13and diabetes.14-16Many medications for these conditions interact with methadone in potentiallyimportant ways, including prolongation of the QT interval resulting in increased risk of torsade de pointes, 17-21increased or decreased metabolism of methadone or the interactingmedication by the cytochrome P450 enzyme benzodiazepines. 22-24 Thus, medication-methadone interactions potentially contrib- ute to clinically significant adverse events, including cardiac arrhythmias, overdoses, decreased cognitive function, opioid withdrawal symptoms, and relapses to illicit opioid use. Ideally,when patients on MMT engage in outpatient or inpatient medical care, their treating physicians are aware of the MMTReceived December 12, 2008 Revised May 11, 2009Accepted June 4, 2009 Published online July 4, 2009 1007and document methadone on the medication list in addition to opioid dependence on the medical problem list. In this study of MMT patients receiving medical care, our objectives were to 1) quantify the documentation of opioid dependence in the medical record, 2) quantify the documenta- tion of MMT in the medical record, and 3) describe the possibledrug interactions that could arise from the use of methadone with other prescribed medications. METHODS Study Design and Population We reviewed electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients from the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) MMT program who received their primary medical care at Boston MedicalCenter (BMC), an affiliated, but separate, medical center. Entry criteria included the following: 1) enrollment in methadone treatment on or before July 2, 2007; 2) a signed release ofinformation permitting 2-way communication between the MMT program and primary care physician; 3) a primary care physician based at BMC; and 4) at least 1 primary careprogress note or 1 discharge summary in the BMC EMRbetween September 1, 2002, and July 2, 2007, and during the period of MMT. This study was approved by the institu- tional review board of Boston University Medical Campus. Data Collection and Measures Methadone dose and \"take home \"dose information were collected from the MMT EMR for the date immediately preceding the medical center inpatient admission or primarycare visit. \"Take home \"doses refer to unobserved methadone dosing, a privilege given only to patients who have at least 90 days of abstinence from illicit drug use. To assess whether oursample was similar to the MMT program population, weobtained information on age, gender, race/ethnicity, metha- done dose, and number of days on methadone as of July 2, 2007, from the MMT EMR for all patients. From the medical center EMR, we determined insurance status as public (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), private, or no insurance. To gauge the burden of comorbidity, we searchedthe active problem list, which is edited and maintained by treating providers, for chronic conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS), typically treated with medications that potentially interactwith methadone, and substance-related conditions (e.g., alco-hol dependence). To quantify both MMT and opioid-dependence diagnosis documentation, the most recent discharge summary andprimary care note in the medical center EMR between September 1, 2002, and July 2, 2007, were read and searched by one of the authors (DF). Missing documentation of MMT wasdefined as no listing of methadone as a medication in either the primary care progress note or the discharge summary. Sub- jects without any combination of \"heroin, opioid, or opiate \"and \"use, abuse, or dependence \"in the discharge summary, primary care note, or the problem list were categorized as not having documentation of opioid dependence. Both the problemlist and the medication lists were cumulative, based onprevious treatment episodes, and editable by each provider. To describe possible methadone-drug interactions, 8 medi- cation interaction categories were pre-specified prior to review-ing records and included: 1) may decrease methadone effects (e.g., efavirenz, phenytoin); 2) may increase methadone effects (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine); 3) has altered metabolism withmethadone zidovudine); (e.g., clona- zepam); 5) other opioids (e.g., oxycodone); and 3 categories of QT interval prolonging medications; 6) risk (generally acceptedrisk of causing torsade de pointes); 7) possible risk (associated with torsade de pointes and/or QT prolongation but lack substantial evidence); and 8) conditional risk (weakly associ-ated with torsade de pointes and/or QT prolongation). The first 3 categories were determined based on a published review of methadone-medication interactions. 22We created categories for benzodiazepines and other opioids because ofthe risks of oversedation when combined with methadone. We adopted the 3 categories of QT prolonging medications at www. qtdrugs.org to identify medications that increase the risk of torsade de pointes. www.qtdrugs.org is a website funded by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Analysis Descriptive statistics were obtained for all subject character- istics to describe the study sample. We determined theproportions with lack of opioid dependence and MMT docu- mentation and the exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for these proportions. All analyses were performed using SASsoftware version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS Among the 350 patients enrolled in MMT on July 2, 2007, 157(45%) had no release of information signed for communication with a primary care physician and 86 (25%) had an existing release of information but not for BMC. Among the 107patients with an existing release of information with a BMCprimary care physician, 84 had at least 1 inpatient or primary care visit before July 2, 2007, and during the period of MMT and comprised the study sample. (Fig. 1) Characteristics of the study sample (n=84) were mean age of 43.4 years; mean methadone dose of 85 mg; mean MMT of 4.4 years; 56% women; and 50% white, 30%African-American, and 20% Hispanic (Table 1). These char- acteristics were similar to the summary statistics available for Figure 1 . Study sample selection of methadone maintenance treatment patients engaged in medical care.

Documentation of opioid dependence diagnosis was missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) of subjects. (Table 2) Documentation of MMT was missing from either the last discharge summary or last primary care note in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%) of subjects. Among the 82 (98%) subjects with a primary care note, documentation of MMTwas missing in 7% (95% CI, 3% -15%). Among 41 (49%) subjects with a discharge summary, documentation of MMT was missing in 10% (95% CI, 3% -23%). Among 39 subjects with both a discharge summary and primary care note, documentation of MMT was missing from both notes for 1 subject or 3% (95% CI, 0.1%-13%).At least 1 potential methadone interaction was identified in 58 (69%) of subjects; 16 (19%) of subjects had 3 or more such medications with potential interactions. (Figure 2) The fre- quency of specific interaction types ranged from 9 (11%) for \"may decrease methadone effects \"to 33 (39%) for potentially QT-interval prolonging effect (Figure 3). For medications within the QT-prolonging subcategories, there were 13 (15%) subjects in the \"possible risk \"category and 20 (24%) in the \"conditional risk \"category. No subjects were on any medication, other than methadone, in the \"risk \"category. Among the 9 subjects who had MMT documentation missing from either note, 7 (78%) had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone. Notably, 5 (56%)subjects were on other opioids, the most common interaction category among these subjects. DISCUSSION This study highlights two aspects in which care coordinationbetween medical and substance use treatment providers could impact patient safety. First, even when consent for communica-tion between substance-use treatment providers and medicalproviders exists, medical providers do not always document that a patient has opioid dependence or that a patient is receiving MMT. Second, most patients engaged in medical care and MMTare on 1 or more medications that potentially interact with methadone and may lead to adverse events, such as overseda- tion, overdose, opioid withdrawal, or cardiac dysrythmias. This study sample likely represented a \"best case \"for thorough documentation, because we selected methadone clinic subjects with known primary care physicians at amedical center with comprehensive services, a standardized EMR, and an historical affiliation with the methadone clinic. The coordination problems identified in this study likely loomlarger among patients receiving both MMT and primarymedical care from unaffiliated providers. Limited communica- tion between separate systems of medical care and MMT was previously documented in a Spanish study in which 89.5% ofprimary care physicians received no information from the methadone clinic about their patients. 25 Patients receiving methadone for opioid dependence and engaged in primary medical care have substantial medical comorbidity.8-16Thus, it is not surprising that a substantial number of subjects in this study were on medications forTable 1.

Distribution of the number of potentially harmful medi- cation interactions with methadone Opioid Dependence and MMT Documentation JGIMdepression, anxiety, HIV infection, hypertension, or pain. Not only do many of these medications potentially interact with methadone, but multiple interacting medications are common. While none of the identified interacting medications are contra-indicated in conjunction with methadone, prescribers should be aware when patients are taking medications that interact, so they can monitor and manage potential interactions. Among the 9 subjects with methadone missing from a medical note, \"other opioids \"was the most common category. For patients with pain and opioid dependence, it may be appropriate to betreated with both methadone and other opioids, yet it is criticalthat both treatments are coordinated to avoid overdose. While not a focus of our study, the recruitment of eligible subjects points to an additional challenge to care coordination;written consent for communication between medical and substance use treatment providers is commonly not present. Because of federally mandated privacy protections, 5,6the first step of care coordination between substance abuse treatment and medical providers is obtaining a signed release of infor- mation. In our study, almost half of methadone clinic patientsdid not have a signed release of information permitting communication with their primary care physician. The reasons for this are many: no primary care physician, difficulty forclinic staff to obtain releases because of separation of pro-grams, and stigma among MMT patients with resulting reticence to allow communication with medical providers. This study 's strengths include examination of the EMRs from clinical substance-use treatment and the medical caresystem to describe the burden of potential methadone-medi- cation interactions and missing documentation between meth- adone and medical care providers that has not previously received critical attention. This study was limited by its retrospective design and limited number of subjects. Yet, we used electronic medical records and a data collection methodology that was systematicand the subjects examined were similar to patients in the entire clinic. The generalizability of our findings is limited by focusing on patients from one methadone clinic receivingmedical care at an affiliated medical center. We recognize thatit is possible that physicians were aware of their patients receiving MMT or being opioid dependent, but did not docu- ment it. While methadone is routinely administered duringinpatient treatment at the medical center if the treatment team is aware the patient is enrolled in MMT, we did not have access to inpatient pharmacy records to confirm this. We did notevaluate whether medication reconciliation has taken place at the MMT site. However, as a consequence of this study, the methadone clinic did refine its medication reconciliationprocedures to regularly document prescribed medications. Lastly, the retrospective design precluded measurement of adverse events from methadone-medication interactions. This study demonstrates opportunities to improve commu- nication, care coordination, and patient safety among patients receiving medical and substance-use treatment. Patients in MMT frequently require multiple medications and these ofteninteract with methadone and potentially lead to adverse Figure 3 . Medications Hence, communication and coordination among sub- stance-use treatment and medical providers has room for improvement so as to mitigate and manage the potentialadverse effects of methadone and interacting medications.

What information do primary care | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 885nature publishing group articles intervention and Prevention Introduct I on Evidence-based best practice guidelines for informed consent in weight loss surgery (WLS) have been previously described (1). Previous recommendations focused on understanding vs. dis- closure, appropriate content, teaching and learning, and pro- moting realistic expectations (1). The 2004 task group found no studies on informed consent and WLS. Recommendations were based on three review articles, standard practice at six WLS centers in Massachusetts, and the consensus of the expert panel (1). No studies on WLS and informed consent have been published since that time. Recommendations are, therefore, based on related articles identified through our search strategy. This report adds recommendations to those in the 2005 guide-lines, and describes the supporting evidence. To make sound medical decisions, patients must not only receive adequate and appropriate information, but also under - stand it (2). Poor comprehension of the risks, benefits, and consequences of surgery can contribute to unrealistic expecta-tions, suboptimal decision making, and potential litigation (3). The previous report cited a need for studies that assess the effect of different forms of education on patient understanding (1). This update draws on the evolving literature on patient safety and WLS outcomes to make recommendations on informed consent content. It also reviews the literature on patient comprehension in informed consent, including studies on health literacy and on clinical areas (e.g., cardiac surgery) that might apply to WLS. Methods and Procedures We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane database for articles on bari- atric or elective surgery and informed consent, comprehension, health literacy, and patient education published between April 2004 and May 2007. We also conducted searches on bariatric surgery and outcomes, risk, patient safety management, and effectiveness. In addition, we reviewed WLS guidelines and other potentially relevant articles recom-mended by the expert panel or cited in the initial articles we identified.Best Practice Updates for Informed Consent and Patient Education in Weight Loss Surgery Christina C. Wee1, Janey S. Pratt2, Robert Fanelli3,4, Patricia Q. Samour5, Linda S. Trainor6 and Michael K. Paasche-Orlow7 To update evidence-based best practice guidelines for obtaining informed consent from weight loss surgery (WLS) patients, with an emphasis on appropriate content and communications approaches that might enhance patient understanding of the information, we performed a systematic search of English-language literature published between April 2004 and May 2007 in MEDLINE and the Cochrane database. Keywords included WLS and informed consent, comprehension, health literacy, and patient education; and WLS and outcomes, risk, patient safety management, and effectiveness. Recommendations are based on the most current literature and the consensus of the expert panel; they were graded according to systems used in established evidence-based models. We identified over 120 titles, 38 of which were reviewed in detail. Evidence suggests that WLS outcomes, including long-term rates of relapse, vary by procedure. For some weight loss surgeries, long-term outcomes may not be known. Risks also vary by patient and provider characteristics. Informed consent should incorporate realistic projections of the short- and long-term risks, benefits, and consequences of surgery, as well as alternatives to WLS. For consent to be informed, the education process should continue until the patient demonstrates comprehension of all relevant material and concepts. Confirmation of comprehension can protect patients engaged in the process of consent for WLS. Future research should focus on the outcomes and consequences of WLS, and different approaches that facilitate patient understanding of, and decision making about, WLS.

The focus of the recom- mendations and the process used to develop them are reported else- where (4). results c ontent Risks/complications. WLS centers are ethically obligated to pro- vide patients with adequate information on the risks, benefits, consequences, and alternatives to treatment (2). A recent sys- tematic review of randomized controlled trials and observa- tional studies suggests that risks of mortality and complications associated with WLS vary depending on the type of procedure (5). Several observational studies also indicate that risks vary depending on patient characteristics, e.g., older adults, men, and those with greater comorbidity have higher risks of mor - tality and complications (6-10). Risks can vary by as much as 20-fold across patient popula- tions (6). Moreover, risks are higher in unselected and more generalizable populations (5,6,8) than in studies of selected patients seen primarily at tertiary surgical centers. The same applies to participants in studies where follow-up rates were low (5). One small single-site study found that patients who do not follow-up after surgery had poorer outcomes (10). Emerging evidence suggests that health provider characteris- tics, e.g., surgeon training, and hospital and surgeon volume of specific WLS procedures performed, may correlate with actual risk (11-13). recommendations Provide realistic risk estimates that take into account patient factors (category C) and relevant institutional and health provider characteristics that might affect risk (e.g., experience and outcomes for specific WLS proce- dures) (category B). Discuss short- and long-term risks and complications, and the potential for unknown or unforeseeable long-term risks (category D). Benefits/effectiveness. Obesity is associated with premature mor - tality and other adverse health consequences, some of which are improved or reversed with weight loss (14). Controlled trials and observational studies demonstrate that WLS produces signifi- cant and sustained weight loss compared with alternative forms of treatment (5,15). In addition, two recent observational stud-ies found that mortality rates of severely obese patients who had WLS were lower than those of severely obese patients who did not (16,17). Both studies were limited, however, by inadequate con-trol for baseline BMI, illness burden, and potential selection bias. Studies document substantial weight loss and health benefits from WLS at 1 year; longer-term studies suggest that some, but not all, of the short-term weight loss and medical benefits are sustained over time (18). Magnitude and sustainability of weight loss and benefits vary by type of WLS procedure and patient characteristics (5,18). One recent nonrandomized con- trolled study found that of 1,703 Swedish subjects enrolled for at least 10 years, 74% of gastric bypass and 35% of gastric banding patients, sustained at least a 20% weight loss; how- ever, 9 and 25%, respectively sustained <5% weight loss (18). A small study of patients planning to undergo WLS found that expectations of weight loss from the surgery far exceeded even the best estimates in the literature (19). recommendations Provide patients with realistic estimates of short- and long- term weight loss, including the potential for weight regain and modest benefits (category B). Inform them if long-term data (>5 years) are unavailable (category D). Advise patients on the long-term health benefits of weight loss produced by WLS (category B). Make them aware that not all preexisting medical and psychosocial consequences of obesity, including eating disorders, will improve with WLS (category C). Give realistic estimates for health outcomes if patients decline surgical treatment (categories B and C), and advise them of known factors and interventions that might opti- mize benefits (category D). Consider patient expectations, the value placed on differ - ent outcomes, and the risks each candidate is willing to accept; address unrealistic expectations or other miscon-ceptions patients might have (category C). Consequences. In addition to risks and benefits, WLS is asso- ciated with physiological changes that may have an adverse impact on patient quality of life; these include gastrointestinal side-effects, nutritional deficiencies, and excess skin (20). recommendation Advise patients on required behavioral and dietary changes and other reasonable and foreseeable consequences of WLS that could affect health or quality of life in a substan- tive way, e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms, cosmetic effects, nutritional restrictions (category D). alternative treatments WLS is currently the most effective treatment for moderate to severe obesity, patients, but patients vary in the value they place on weight loss and the risks and tradeoffs they are willing to make to lose weight (19,21). Risks, benefits, and tradeoffs vary among different WLS procedures and nonsurgical treat- ments (5,15,18,22). recommendations Advise patients about alternative WLS procedures and nonsurgical treatment options (e.g., medical and behav- ioral) (category C). Inform them about alternatives even if they are not avail- able through the consenting health provider or institution (category C).obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 | MAY 2009 887articles intervention and Prevention comprehension of informed consent The NIH has defined health literacy as the degree to which indi- viduals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropri- ate health decisions (23). Over 90 million American adults have inadequate health literacy skills (24). The prevalence of limited literacy is higher in older adults, in racial or ethnic minorities, and in those with limited education and chronic diseases (25). The association between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented. Seminal reports about the problem of health literacy have been issued by the Institute of Medicine (24), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (26), the American Medical Association (27), and the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (28). However, no studies have examined the relation between limited literacy and the WLS informed consent process. Several lessons can still be drawn from related areas of research: limited literacy is a barrier to patient comprehension in the process of informed consent (29); clinicians are not able to discern which of their patients have limited literacy; and patients frequently fail to disclose that information due to con-cerns about shame (30-32). In addition, patients with limited literacy are less likely to ask questions than those with higher literacy skills (33). Data show that screening patients for limited literacy skills is neither beneficial nor necessary. Conversely, confirmation of comprehension promotes understanding regardless of health lit- eracy level, and has been promoted as a patient safety measure (34). Simplification of informed consent materials and the use of multiple channels of communication can also be useful (35-37). In particular, care is needed with the presentation of numerical concepts; many people lack basic quantitative literacy skills (38). A recent study found that 66% of participants (174 of 264) were not able to answer a question relating to the odds of get- ting \"heads\" from flipping a coin (39). Moreover, clinicians are frequently unaware of the extent to which they commu- nicate with jargon or use concepts that patients do not com-prehend (40,41). In addition to consent forms and supporting brochures, websites, videos, and other materials and decision aids (35), patient participation in developing informed con- sent information can be helpful (42). A teach-to-goal educa-tional approach, in which patient comprehension is evaluated and education continued until the patient exhibits mastery of the content, can help people with limited literacy (29). recommendations Evaluate each patient's comprehension of the risks, bene- fits, consequences, and alternatives to WLS (category C). Confirm comprehension to protect patients engaged in the informed consent process (category C). dIscuss I on The demographics of WLS patients are changing; older patients and those with greater comorbidity are now undergoing sur - gery. As a result of these changes, historic estimates of risks and benefits extrapolated from earlier studies of WLS may not apply to the current WLS population. The disproportion- ate prevalence of obesity in many racial and minority groups requires modifications to how the informed consent process is conducted and communicated; low health literacy is more prevalent in ethnic and racial minorities, and can be a barrier to adequate informed consent (24,25). Our report is limited because of a lack of high-quality studies, particularly long-term, randomized trials on the risks, benefits, and consequences of various surgical and nonsurgical weight loss treatments. There are also few high-quality long-term observa-tional studies on WLS outcomes in diverse populations. Future research is needed to better identify factors that affect WLS sur - gery outcomes in the long- and short-term so that patients can be cited appropriate and individualized outcomes information. WLS is a rapidly evolving field. New surgical techniques are being developed and evaluated. The current report addresses the process of informed consent for routine WLS. We have not presented recommendations for experimental procedures. These require an informed consent process that adheres to federal regulations for the protection of human subjects. We did not address informed consent in the pediatric population either. Data on the risks, benefits, consequences, and alterna- tives to WLS differ from those on adult populations, and are more limited. Informed consent in the pediatric/adolescent arena requires the assent of the patient and informed consent of the patient's parents (43). This subject is covered in more detail in the Pediatric/Adolescent Task Group report (44). Our recommendations to ensure patient comprehension of informed consent materials are largely based on relevant research in other clinical areas. Future studies should examine whether these approaches will be effective in the WLS arena, and their potential impact on patient satisfaction and WLS outcomes. WLS is a high-risk procedure in a demographically diverse and clinically complex population. Rather than serve as a mere legal hurdle, informed consent should provide patients with easily understood and complete information needed to authorize the proposed surgery (2). Future research should focus on important gaps in knowledge on the outcomes and consequences of WLS, and different approaches to facilitate patient understanding of, and decision making about, WLS. suPP le M entar Y M ater I al To review task group appendices, go to www.mass.gov/dph and search \"Weight Loss Surgery.\" acknowledg M ents We thank Frank Hu for advice in manuscript preparation, Leslie Kirle for administrative support, and Rita Buckley for research and editorial services.

BACKGROUND: Pay-for-performance is proliferating, yet its impact on key stakeholders remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The Society of General Internal Medicine systematically evaluated ethical issues raised by per- formance-based physician compensation. RESULTS: We conclude that current arrangements are based on fundamentally acceptable ethical principles,but are guided by an incomplete understanding of health-care quality. Furthermore, their implementation without evidence of safety and efficacy is ethicallyprecarious because of potential risks to stakeholders, especially vulnerable patients. CONCLUSION: We propose four major strategies to tran- sition from risky pay-for-performance systems to ethicalperformance-based physician compensation and high quality care. These include implementing safeguards within current pay-for-performance systems, reaching consensusregarding the obligations of key stakeholders in improving health-care quality, developing valid and comprehensive measures of health-care qualit y, and utilizing a cautious evaluative approach in creating the next generation of compensation systems that reward genuine quality. KEY WORDS: ethics; health policy; pay-for-performance; quality improvement; Med 24(7):854 -9 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-0947-3 \u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 Pay-for-performance systems seek to improve health-care quality by providing bonus dollars to physicians, practice groups, or hospitals whose patients achieve certain healthgoals.1These arrangements are proliferating, yet their impact on key stakeholders remains uncertain.2-7The Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM), through its Ethics Commit- tee, systematically evaluated ethical issues raised by perfor- mance-based physician compensation. Investigations includedliterature review, in-depth interviews with key informants,focus groups among SGIM members, open forums at national SGIM meetings, and discussions among SGIM committees and leadership. A comprehensive report of the Ethics Committee 's findings and recommendations is available at http://www. sgim.org/index.cfm?pageId=806 . 8 This position paper begins by examining the fundamental principles of pay-for-performance and setting forth our organi- zation 's definition of health-care quality. Based on this explora- tion, we present our conclusions regarding the manner ofimplementation of pay-for-performance and its potential effectson key stakeholders. We propose four major strategies for moving toward more ethical and effective performance-based physician compensation, emphasizing the need to implementimmediate safeguards to protect vulnerable populations. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE; UNDERSTANDING HEALTH-CARE QUALITY The fundamental principles of pay-for-performance include rewarding quality health care and aligning physicians 'finan- cial incentives with the best interests of patients.9Although this inherent appeal to physician self-interest might be in tension with professional ideals of altruism and benefi-cence, 10-13the principles that inform pay-for-performance are not inherently unethical. It seems just, for example, to financially reward physicians who demonstrate outstandinglevels of patient-centered and evidence-based care. Nevertheless, systems intending to improve medical care must be guided by evidence and a precise definition of health-care quality to ensure that they are effective, valid, and fair. We define health-care quality in a manner that prioritizes patient-JGIM Received July 26, 2008 Revised December 23, 2008 Accepted January 26, 2009 Published online March 18, 2009 854centered care14while recognizing the importance of popula- tion-level health improvement:15 Health-care quality is the degree to which physiciansand health-care institutions fulfill their care obligations to individual patients and the degree to which patients,physicians, and health-care institutions enable these obligations to be fulfilled justly across the population. 16 This understanding of healt h-care quality informs our criticisms of current pay-for-performance arrangements and provides a roadmap to high quality care and ethical perfor- mance-based physician compensation. Potential Ethical Problems in the Implementation of Pay-for-Performance In light of these principles, we see the following potential ethical problems in the implementation of pay-for-performancesystems. 1.Lack of proven safety and benefit for patients: Studies of performance-based physician compensation have gener- ally shown scant evidence of quality improvement. 2-7 Implementation without proof of safety and effectiveness is ethically problematic. It is unclear, for instance, why a new drug to be used by several dozen individuals requires proof of safety and efficacy, while policy changes affecting millions donot. From an ethical perspective, pay-for-performance is a potentially risky experiment in health-care delivery. 17Fur- ther, current pay-for-performance systems generally lackkey safeguards against readily anticipated adverse effects 1 (discussed below), and we are concerned that negativeoutcomes may already be unfolding. 2.Inadequate definitions of quality: Although commentators have proposed many definitions of health-care quality, 18-27 none are universally accept ed, and they provide little guidance regarding accountability or how quality can be val-idly measured. Furthermore, current pay-for-performance arrangements are guided by a highly incomplete under- standing of quality that does not resemble any published orwell-reasoned definition. This understanding typically equates quality with the achievement of non-individualized, pre-determined health goals for broad populations and failsto consider contributions from stakeholders other than physician entities 1(such as health plans) that also have partial responsibility for ensuring quality. This approach hasseverely limited our ability to capture the myriad ofelements comprising quality care, let alone the most complex but essential feature of a praxis like medicine \u2014 the exercise of correct judgment \u2014which is only readily assessed by peers. 28 3.Inadequate measures of quality: Because they are based on inadequate definitions, existing pay-for-performancemeasures lack validity and comprehensiveness in asses- sing health-care quality. Measures typically cover only isolated and readily quantifiable aspects of physicianclinical performance and fail to assess crucial realms suchas judgment, compassion, and communication skills. Quantifying health-care quality is notoriously difficult, and basing payment incentives upon inadequate measures anddefinitions of quality will make consequences difficult to control. Unfortunately, this approach is often used to make judgments about individual practitioners when variability incase mix and patient preferences precludes making valid judgments. For example, in a patient with difficult-to-control diabetes, a decline in hemoglobin A 1C from 10.0 to 8.0 might be a remarkable achievement and more validly represent high quality care than a decline from 7.3 to 6.9 in another patient. 4.Misallocating the locus of accountability for quality improve- ment: Many pay-for-performance measures hold physi- cians accountable for aspects of quality beyond theircontrol, such as health-care delivery problems, lack of incentives for coordinated care, and even social determi- nants of health. Some may hold physicians accountablefor the care of patients with whom they have not had a continuous relationship. 5.Potential for adverse effects on patients and vulnerable populations: Performance targets used today may have detrimental effects on quality. For example, it may seem reasonable to require that diabetic patients achievehemoglobin A 1C levels below 7.0. In patients with previous hypoglycemic episodes, however, this target might be life-threatening. Or, consider a patient with a hemoglobin A 1C of 7.5 who frequently skips preventive visits but happens to present with back pain. If bonuses are provided for reducing glucose levels,a physician might prefer to discuss diabetes control rather than ruling out life-threatening causes of back pain. Such \"treating the measure \"might worsen outcomes. Pre-determined population-centered measures might also induce physicians to avoid patients who are less likely to meet targets. Such patients are often society 's most vulnerable members \u2014those with multiple chronic conditions, the poor, the educationally disadvantaged, those with limited English proficiency, and members of racial minority groups. Because physicians serving disadvantaged patients might receive lower compensation, less well-off practices would be left with fewer resources to improve care. This could create a vicious cycle of worsening quality for the most vulnerable patients. Poorly designed pay-for-performance systems could there- fore limit access to care for vulnerable populations, worsen health-care quality, and erode patient trust. 29-38 6.Potential for adverse effects on physicians: In systems using a limited set of population-level measures, physician profes-sionalism and morale could decline. Some clinicians might \"treat the measure \"or select the \"best \"patients to enhance income. Others might provide optimal care despite reducedincome, but grow frustrated. Pay-for-performance is also likely to increase the complexity of the reimbursement system, and metrics might be used against physicians forlegal, credentialing, or recertification purposes. Such changes would decrease physician job satisfaction, with detrimental effects on patient care and the attractiveness ofmedicine (especially primary care) as a profession. 7.Potential for adverse effects on society: The potential detrimental effects above would have broader implicationsfor society. A decreasing supply of primary care physicianswould exacerbate problems in access and quality. Truly valid and comprehensive measurements might require overly burdensome or expensive systems, and could make855 Wharam et al.: Quality Care and Ethical Pay-for-Performance JGIMthe marginal value of performance-based compensation negligible. Deteriorating value could also result if physi- cians drive up expenses by ordering unnecessary tests orreferrals to specialists. 36 Ultimately, insurers could face a backlash by patients and physicians against an effort that might be viewed cynically as another cost-containment attempt, offered disingenuously asquality improvement. 8.Lack of structured monitoring for adverse outcomes: A substantial literature advocates structured oversight of any risky intervention not meant to directly benefit individuals. 39-53Although pay-for-performance is intended to improve patient care, some would argue that it is primarily a population-centered cost control measure with unclear effectiveness and a substantial risk-benefitratio for certain populations. 33We believe the risks from pay-for-performance outlined above are serious enough and have a high enough probability of occurring toengender an ethical obligation for structured monitoring of key outcomes (discussed below). POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SGIM supports evidence-based, ethical, and comprehensive efforts to improve health-care quality and physician compensa-tion. While carefully designed pay-for-performance systems could be a component of such an approach, current iterations fail to reach acceptable ethical standards for the reasons above.We therefore advocate the following four major strategies toachieve high quality health care and ethical performance-based physician compensation (Tables 1,2,3). Current Pay-for-Performance Systems should Rapidly Adopt Safeguards to Protect Vulnerable Populations Until researchers develop valid and comprehensive quality measures, pay-for-performance systems must prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations and minimize readily an- ticipated adverse consequences (Table 3). Pay-for-performance leaders should institute the following safeguards to achievethese aims: 1.Balance current population-level measurements with the best available measures of quality from the patient per-spective . The non-patient-centered nature of current pay- for-performance systems could be partially remedied by appropriate measures. For example, the Consumer Assess- ment of Healthcare Providers 54places a strong emphasis on measuring how well health-care providers communicate with patients. A growing body of research55,56could inform the development of valid measures in the outpatient setting. 2.Reduce or stabilize the percentage of physicians 'salaries at stake . Policy makers should limit bonus amounts to reduce temptations to \"game \"the system, especially in arrangements that do not adjust for case mix. Current levels of approximately 5% of physicians 'salaries seem reasonable in systems that adjust for case mix, while lowerlevels would be appropriate for those that do not. 3.Provide adequate off-setting compensation to physicians serving vulnerable patients. For example, the 2006 Mas- sachusetts health-care reform legislation included provi- sions to base Medicaid hospital rate increases on quality improvement, including the reduction of health-care dis- Table 1.

Researchers and policy makers should use a cautious evaluative approach to long-term development of compensation systems that reward quality Table 3. Recommended Safeguards to Protect Vulnerable Populations and Prevent Unintended Consequences Within Current Pay-for-Performance Systems 1. Balance current population-level measurements with the best available measures of quality from the patient perspective 2. Reduce or stabilize the percentage of physicians 'salaries at stake (except as in point 3 below) 3. Provide adequate off-setting compensation for physicians serving vulnerable patients 4. Population-level measures should: a. Be evidence-based and clearly linked to valued patient outcomesb. Assess domains clearly within the influence of the physician or physician group, especially for complex patients c. Assess quality at the level of large physician practices rather than individual physicians d. Assess improvement toward goals in addition to achievement of cut-points 5. If systems utilize population-level outcomes measures, they should: a. Explicitly assess patient complexity and vulnerabilityb. Carefully adjust for case-mix based on relevant patient factorsc. Carefully adjust for the manner in which responsibility for patient outcomes is shared between physicians, patients, health plans, and other health-care institutions 6. Initiate monitoring before and after implementing the above changes. Monitoring should assess: a. Patient satisfaction, access, continuity, and coordination of care; effects on vulnerable patients as a particularly important focus b. Physician satisfaction and professionalism, administrative burden, effects on the patient-physician relationship c. Effects on disparities between physician practices serving vulnerable and non-vulnerable populations d. Payer satisfaction and value for health-care expenditures856 Wharam et al.: Quality Care and Ethical Pay-for-Performance JGIMparities.57If such provisions are designed meticulously and fairly,58financial incentives could encourage and reward physicians for serving patients with low levels ofexpendable income, complex medical conditions, non- adherence to recommended treatments, or limited health literacy. 4.Recommendations regarding population-level measures. Pre-determined population-level measures of quality must be instituted carefully because they are inherently non-patient-centered. Because such measures are pervasive inmodern pay-for-performance systems, we recommend several strategies to maximize the protection of vulnerable patients: 4.a. Utilize population-level measures that are evidence- based and clearly linked to valued patient outcomes . For example, pneumonia and influenza immuniza- tions have been proven to prevent potentially debil- itating illnesses while having minimal adverseeffects. Other commonly utilized measures may fail to reach these standards; hemoglobin A1C targets are based on evidence from randomized controltrials, but the applicability to individual patients onreal-life physician panels is often unclear. 35,59 4.b. Population-level measures should assess domains clearly within the influence of the physician orphysician group, especially for complex patients. Basic process measures, such as vaccination rates and the frequency of diabetic eye exams, are imper-fect measures of quality, but are more within the influence of physicians and practice groups than outcomes measures. Process measures seem lesslikely than outcomes measures to cause avoidanceof vulnerable patients and physician frustration. 4.c. Measures should assess quality at the level of large physician practices rather than individual physicians . Experts skilled in statistical analysis should deter- mine minimum patient population sizes for each measure to provide optimal data and avoid statisti-cal error. Only practice groups with sufficient num- bers of patients should initially be measured. 4.d. Measures should assess improvement toward goals in addition to achievement of cut-points . This could apply to both process and outcomes measures. For example, physician groups could be rewarded bothfor achieving vaccination rates at a pre-determinedlevel as well as for annual improvements toward the target. 5.Recommendations regarding p opulation-level outcomes measures. Population-level outcomes measures are meth- odologically complex, and the validity of current measures is uncertain. This will likely preclude their use in an ethically defensible manner in the short-term unlessprovisions that maximize validity are closely followed, including: 5.a. Explicitly assess patient complexity and vulnerability . This would require integrating patient survey data and medical record data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities.5.b. Carefully adjust for case-mix based on relevant patient factors. For example, it would be inappropriate to reduce systolic blood pressurelevelsbelow 140 mmHgin an 85-year-old diabetic patient with co- morbidities taking three antihypertensive medica- tions. Proper case-mix adjustment might allow thispatient 's physician to prioritize other care, while a lack of adjustment could induce either dangerous efforts to lower blood pressure or substantialphysician frustration. 5.c. Carefully adjust for the manner in which responsibil- ity for patient outcomes is shared between physi- cians, patients, health plans, and other health-careinstitutions . For example, consider two physicians who must eventually prescribe three hypoglycemic medications to similar diabetic patients whoseinitial hemoglobin A1C levels were 9.5. The first patient has generous health insurance, enabling him to purchase all three medications and lower hishemoglobin A1C to 6.5. The second patient must pay the full cost of medications, and she can only afford two. She only lowers her hemoglobin A1C to7.5. A proper system would adjust for healthinsurance status. 6.Pay-for-performance leaders should initiate monitoring before and after implementing the above changes . Moni- toring should assess important patient outcomes not often included in pay-for performance studies, such as satisfac- tion, access, continuity, and coordination of care. Effectson vulnerable patients should be a particularly important focus. Studies should also assess physician satisfaction and professionalism, administrative burden, effects onthe patient-physician relationship, and the impact on disparities between physician practices serving more vulnerable and less vulnerable populations. Monitoringshould examine payer satisfaction and value for health-care expenditures. Key Stakeholders should Develop Consensus Regarding their Responsibilities in Improving Health Care Quality A crucial first step in achieving ethically defensible health-care quality improvement will be for key stakeholders to developconsensus regarding their shared and unique obligations to individual patients and patient populations. For example, to improve blood glucose control among diabetic patients, physi-cians must recommend evidence-based, patient-centered management strategies, practice groups must provide access to testing facilities, health insurers must facilitate receipt ofaffordable medications and testing, and patients must adhere to therapeutic plans. Bringing health insurers, patients, employers, and physi- cians to the table would highlight opportunities to improvecoordination and continuity of care; new paradigms for quality improvement that integrate assessment at the individual physician level and institution level could emerge.857 Wharam et al.: Quality Care and Ethical Pay-for-Performance JGIMResearchers and Policy Makers should Develop Valid and Comprehensive Quality Measuresfor Use in the Next Generation of Compensation Systems that Reward Genuine Quality A long-term strategy for quality improvement will be guided by a framework of accountability in which physicians, practicegroups, health plans, and public payers are measured based on how well they fulfill well-defined obligations to individual patients and populations. For example, measures of physician quality should assess multiple domains, such as accessibility, adherence to evi- dence-based but patient-centered care, and communicationskills. Appropriate measures would account for individualized patient-physician goals, be based on the best available evi- dence, and minimize administrative burden and expense. Measures of health-care institution quality (e.g., physician groups, hospitals, and public and private payers) should assess domains such as how well these groups foster team-work, facilitate achievement of patient goals, strengthen thedoctor-patient relationship, and improve access, coordination, and continuity of care for individual patients. Equally important will be development of valid population- level health-care quality measures. In addition to measuring how well physicians and health-care institutions fulfill obliga- tions to individual patients, comprehensive quality measureswould assess the degree to which patients, physicians, and health-care institutions maximize health-care resources avail- able to the population, distribute them fairly, 60and fulfill their obligations justly. Measures should be developed under strict principles of transparency. For example, all persons involved in creating new measures should, at minimum, be required to statepotential conflicts of interest. Researchers and Policy Makers Should Use a Cautious Evaluative Approach to Long-Term Development of Compensation Systems that Reward Quality After developing evidence-based measures of physician, health- care institution, and population-level quality, policy makers should implement carefully planned, small-scale pilot programs that reward physician and health-care institution quality.Benefits and adverse effects should be monitored. Those entitiesimplementing innovations in payment and quality improvement should take the lead in funding these studies. Even with results from well-designed studies, judgments about the ethics of pay-for-performance will remain challeng- ing. One approach might be to give preferential consideration to outcomes among vulnerable patients. We base our suggestion to begin with pilot programs upon an ethical principle of precaution. However, efforts should be scaled up if benefits prove sufficient, health disparities arereduced and adverse outcomes are minimized. THE ROLE OF SGIM In order to aid in the above processes, SGIM is committed tohaving general internists participate in articulating the qual-ity-related obligations that physicians and health-care institu- tions have to patients and the population. SGIM encourages its members to take the following actions: (1) help developmeasures of physician, health-care institution, and popula- tion-level health-care quality, (2) evaluate pay-for-performance measures and programs, and (3) participate in the ongoingmonitoring of effects of pay-for-performance on vulnerable populations and physicians. SGIM will continue to develop collaborative alliances with other key national organizations toensure fair, valid, and comprehensive measures and topromote ethical compensation reform. CONCLUSIONS Performance-based physician compensation, if carefully guidedby a comprehensive understanding of health-care quality and evidence-based evaluations, might improve patient care, narrow health disparities, and promote fair physician compensationwhile increasing health-care value. If research and monitoringdetermine that improved payment systems can benefit patients, physicians, and payers while minimizing risks, they could be ethical arrangements. However, until such data are available,widespread expansion of untested pay-for-performance systems poses substantive ethical issues associated with potential harm to patients, clinicians, and organizations.

Wilper, MD, MPH, Stefe Woolhandler, MD, MPH, J. Wesley Boyd, MD, PhD, Karen E. Lasser, MD, MPH, Danny McCormick, MD, MPH, David H. Bor, MD, and David U. Himmelstein, MD The prison population of the United States has quadrupled in the past 25 years, and the country now incarcerates more people percapita than any other nation. Worldwide, im-prisonment per 100000 ranges from 30 inIndia to 75 in Norway, 1 19 in China, 148 in theUnited Kingdom, 628 in Russia, and 750 in theUnited States. 1 Currently, nearly 2.3 million US inmates (about 1% of US adults) must rely on their jailers for health care.2Although prisoners have a constitutional right to health carethrough the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of''cruel and unusual'' punishment, 3periodic s c a n d a l s ,a sw e l la sp r e v i o u ss t u d i e s ,i n d i c a t ethat prisoners' access to health care and thequality of that care are often decient. 4,5Indeed, citing deplorable conditions in California's prison system, a federal judge recently removedprison health care from the state's control. 6 However, there is little nationally representativedata on the health and health care of America'sprisoners. Inmates have high rates of chronic medical conditions, especially viral infections. In addi- tion, substance abuse and mental illness are common among inmates. 7,8We are not aware of any study analyzing the prevalence of com-mon chronic conditions or of access to medicaland psychiatric care among the incarceratedpopulation as a whole. Therefore, we sought todetermine the prevalence of select chronic dis-eases, access to health services, and pre- and postincarceration psychiatric treatment among the US inmate population. METHODS We analyzed data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal CorrectionalFacilities (SISFCF) and the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ). The US Census Bureau conducted these surveys for the Bu-reau of Justice Statistics. Participation in thesurveys was voluntary, and prisoners' answers were anonymous and condential. Data Sources The 2004 SISFCF consisted of in-person surveys of state and federal prisoners designed to provide nationally representative data on prison inmates. Between October 2003 andMay 2004, inmates provided demographic,criminal justice, and health information to in-terviewers. The 2002 SILJ employed a virtu-ally identical methodology and questionnaire. The surveys employed a 2-stage sample de- sign,selecting prisonsin therst stage and inmates in the second stage. The Census Bureau prese- lected the 21 largest state prisons for inclusion inthe survey. Remaining sta te prisons were strati- ed by census region; those with larger inmatepopulations were more likely to be included in thesurvey. Of 1585 state prisons, 301 were selectedfor participation in the SISFCF, of which 287participated. Two prisons refused to participate, and 12 were deemed ''out of scope'': 2 were jails,1was under federal jurisdiction, 4 had closed, and 5 no longer housed inmates of the gender forwhich the facility was originally chosen. Of16152randomly selected inmates, 14499 completedinterviews. The total response rate was 89.1%. Three federal prisons were preselected. The remaining federal prisons were stratied by security level; those with larger inmatepopulations were more likely to be included inthe survey. Of 148 eligible federal prisons, 40were selected and 39 participated in the survey(1 prison refused to participate). A computerthat was supplied with a list of all inmatesselected inmates from within a facility using arandom start point and a predetermined skipinterval. Of 4253 randomly selected federalinmates, 3686 completed interviews. The totalresponse rate was 84.6%. 9 The Census Bureau conducted the SILJ from January to April 2002 using a similar 2-stagesample design. Researchers conducting the SILJpreselected 234 jails for inclusion to ensurethat facilities with large numbers of men,Objectives. We analyzed the prevalence of chronic illnesses, including mental illness, and access to health care among US inmates. Methods. We used the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities to analyze disease prevalence and clinical measures of access to health care for inmates. Results. Among inmates in federal prisons, state prisons, and local jails, 38.5% (SE=2.2%), 42.8% (SE=1.1%), and 38.7% (SE=0.7%), respectively, suffered a chronic medical condition. Among inmates with a mental condition ever treated with a psychiatric medication, only 25.5% (SE=7.5%) of federal, 29.6% (SE=2.8%)of state, and 38.5% (SE=1.5%) of local jail inmates were taking a psychiatric medication at the time of arrest, whereas 69.1% (SE=4.8%), 68.6% (SE=1.9%), and 45.5% (SE=1.6%) were on a psychiatric medication after admission. Conclusions. Many inmates with a serious chronic physical illness fail to receive care while incarcerated. Among inmates with mental illness, most were off their treatments at the time of arrest. Improvements are needed both incorrectional health care and in community mental health services that might prevent crime and incarceration.

American Journal of Public Health |April 2009, Vol 99, No. 4women, or juveniles had a higher probability of selection than would jails with smaller numbers of these individual groups. The remaining fa-cilities were stratied by inmate population,and facilities housing larger inmate populationswere more likely to be included in the survey.Of 3365 jails, 465, including those that werepreselected, were systematically selected, and417 participated in the survey; 39 refused toparticipate, and 9 had closed or housed no inmates. From within each institution, inter- viewers selected inmates using a predeter-mined random start and sample selection rate.Of 7750 randomly selected jail inmates, 6982completed interviews. The total response ratewas 84.1%. 10For all 3 surveys, the Census Bureau provided weights that adjusted for non-response and sample design in order to yield national estimates. For both the SISFCF and the SILJ, inmates answered questions about symptoms or medi-cal diagnoses received prior to incarceration,including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, paralysis, prior or current malignancy(breast, cervical, colon, leukemia, lung, ovarian,prostate, testicular, uterine, or other [''other'' was not included in the local jail survey]), stroke or brain injury, angina, arrhythmia, ar-teriosclerosis, prior myocardial infarction, orother heart problem (coronary, also reported on persistentproblems with kidneys, asthma, cirrhosis, hep-atitis, arthritis, or sexually transmitted diseases.Surveyors did not use health records to con- rm diagnoses. Inmates were queried about serious injuries they had sustained since being incarceratedthat were caused by an accident or a physicalor sexual assault. We dened ''serious injuries''as those resulting from knife or gunshotwounds and those causing broken bones, in-ternal injuries, or loss of consciousness. Inmates also answered questions about their health care since incarceration. Such care in-cluded tuberculosis skin test and treatment of apositive test, receipt of prescription medicationsbefore and after admission, blood tests (other-wise unspecied), and visits to a doctor, nurse,or other health care worker for a persistenthealth problem. The SISFCF and SILJ assessed self-reported mental illnesses, including any prior diagnosisof depressive disorder, bipolar disorder,schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or panic disorder, personality disorder, or other mental condition. Inmatesanswered questions about medications forpsychiatric illness at any point in the past, in theyear prior to admission, at the time of arrest,and since incarceration. Inmates also reportedmental health counseling at any time in thepast, in the year prior to admission, at the time of arrest, or following admission. We determined the self-reported prevalence of common chronic conditions that routinelyrequire ongoing medical treatment, includingdiabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior myocar-dial infarction, persistent kidney problems,persistent asthma, cirrhosis, and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we created another category dening inmates as having ''any chronic con- dition'' if they reported any condition likelyrequiring follow-up medical attention, even ifnot identied as causing a persistent problemby the inmate. In this category, we included aprior diagnosis of 1 or more of the following:diabetes mellitus, hypertension, HIV/AIDS,paralysis, prior malignancy (excluding skin cancers), prior stroke or brain injury, angina, arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarc-tion, other heart problems (coronary, congen-ital, rheumatic), persistent kidney problems,current problems with asthma, and persistentproblems with cirrhosis, persistent hepatitis,and arthritis. The SISFCF included a questionabout ''other'' types of cancer, a question not included in the SILJ. ''Other cancer'' adds only 9160 and 704 individuals to state and federal''chronic'' indicators, respectively. We did notinclude pregnancy or sexually transmitted dis-eases other than HIV/AIDS in our denition of''any chronic condition.'' We compared the crude and age-adjusted prevalence of selected chronic conditions among inmates with the prevalence of such conditions among a nationally representativesample of the noninstitutionalized US popula-tion from the 2003-2004 National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 11 The 2003-2004 NHANES included questions regarding a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,hypertension, myocardial infarction, and persis- tent asthma that were nearly identical to those of the inmate surveys, and staff for the 2003-2004 NHANES tested participants aged18 to 49years for HIV. We included comparisons ofboth crude and age-adjusted prevalences of these chronic conditions among inmates and the nonincarcerated population. Because most standard access to care mea- sures, such as having a usual source of care oravoiding needed care because of costs, aremeaningless in incarceration settings, we de-veloped 5 clinically based access to care mea-sures: 1.Access to medical examinations. To assess this measure, we created a marker for inmateswith a persistent medical problem routinelyrequiring medical assessment. For this indi-cator, we rst combined inmates reportingpregnancy at the time of admission withthose reporting a persistent problem with diabetes mellitus, the heart or kidneys, hy- pertension, cancer, stroke or brain injury,paralysis, cirrhosis, arthritis, asthma, hepati-tis, or a sexually transmitted disease. (Un-fortunately, the surveys did not specicallyassess access to care for inmates with HIV.)We then determined whether medical per-sonnel had examined inmates for their per- sistent conditions at any time since incar- ceration. 2.Access to pharmacotherapy. To assess this measure, we rst determined the number ofinmates who had a condition routinelytreated with pharmacotherapy (hyperten-sion, diabetes mellitus, stroke or brain in-jury, persistent arthritis, asthma, cirrhosis, or HIV/AIDS) and had been taking a prescrip- tion medication at the time of admission. Wethen determined whether these prisonerscontinued taking that medication followingincarceration. Surveyors did not collectmedication names or query inmates aboutnew medications begun during incarceration. 3.Access to prescription medication. To further assess access to prescription medication, we determined the number of inmates who hadreceived any prescription drug for any in-dication prior to incarceration. We thendetermined the proportion of such inmateswho did not receive that medication fol-lowing incarceration. 4.Access to laboratory tests. To assess this measure, we dened prisoners as needing routine laboratory monitoring if they had1 of the following conditions: diabetesmellitus, persistent hypertension, kidneyRESEARCH AND PRACTICE April 2009, Vol 99, No. 4 |American Journal of Public Health Wilper et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |667problems, cirrhosis, prior myocardial in- farction, or HIV/AIDS. We then determined whether these prisoners had undergoneat least 1 blood test of any kind sinceincarceration. 5.Adequacy of acute care. To assess this mea- sure, we analyzed data from inmates with aserious injury (knife or gunshot wounds,broken bones, internal injuries, being knocked unconscious, or sexual assault). We then determined whether these prisonersreceived any medical examination for theirinjuries. Finally, we focused on receipt of mental health care. For inmates reporting any priordiagnosis of a mental condition, we determined the proportion ever receiving a medication for that condition. Next, we determined the pro-portion of this population taking medication atthe time of arrest and since incarceration. Wealso determined the proportion of inmates withany history of a mental condition who had everreceived counseling, who had received coun-seling in the year prior to admission, and who had received counseling since incarceration. Finally, we repeated all mental health analysesusing only those inmates with a prior diagnosisof bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Statistical Analysis We used SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to analyze bivariate relationships. We used SUDAAN version 9.0.3 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)to estimate variance via restricted-access SILJdesign variables. For the SISFCF, we calculatedvariance using the generalized variance esti-mates available with the survey documenta-tion. We applied sample weights supplied bythe Bureau of Justice Statistics to account for nonresponse and survey design and to yield national estimates. We performed direct agestandardization via published techniques. 12 RESULTS Based on our analysis, US federal prisons held 129196 inmates and state prisons 1225680 in 2004. In 2002, local jails held 631241 inmates. The overwhelming majorityof inmates were male, were younger than 35years, and were disproportionately Black orHispanic. About 200000 (10%) were military veterans. The majority were parents of minor children at the time of incarceration or at thetime of the survey. Nonresponse to individual items was un- common. Among federal inmates, 2.1% weremissing data on prescription medications atadmission and 2.8% on prior diagnosis ofPTSD; 6.0% were missing data for HIV testing and 15.8% for duration of incarceration. No data were provided for sexual assault or gun-shot wounds in federal prisons. Among stateinmates, 1.2% were missing data on prescrip-tion medications at admission and 1.7% onprior diagnosis of PTSD; 4.0% were missingdata regarding HIV testing and 6.3% for du-ration of incarceration. Among jail inmates, 0.5% were missing data on the duration of incarceration and 2.2% on prior diagnosis ofPTSD; 5.2% were missing data on HIV testing.Chronic Medical Problems Chronic conditions were common among inmates; 49702 federal inmates (38.5% [SE=2.2%]), 5241 and jail inmates(38.7% [SE=0.7%]) had at least 1 chronicmedical condition (Table 1). Inmates had rates of diabetes, hypertension, prior myocardial infarction, and persistentasthma comparable to those of the US nonin-stitutionalized, nonelderly population. How- ever, following age standardization to the 2000 US census, the prevalence of these conditionsappeared to be higher for inmates than for thegeneral population, except for prior myocardialinfarction among jail inmates (Table 2; see alsothe appendix to Table 1, available as a supple-ment to the online version of this article athttp://www.ajph.org).

Median duration of incarceration in months (interquartile range) was as follows: for federal inmates, 29 (12-61); for state inmates, 27 (9-67); for jail inmates, 2 (0-4). aDened as being a parent at time of survey or during incarceration. bDened as having a prior diagnosis of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, personality disorder, or other mental health condition. cA chronic condition was dened as afrmative response when asked about the following: HIV/AIDS; prior malignancy (excluding skin cancers) including breast, cervical, colon, leukemia, lung, ovarian, prostate, testicular, uterine, and other (''other'' not included in the jail injury; 668 |Research and Practice |Peer Reviewed |Wilper et al. American Journal of Public Health |April 2009, Vol 99, No. 4including 1023 federal inmates (1.0% [SE=3.1%]), 151 15 state inmates (1.6%[SE=1.6%]), and 4245 local jail inmates (1.2% [SE=0.2%]); this prevalence was double that of the noninstitutionalized 2003-2004NHANES population. These percentages didnot substantially change when only inmatesaged 18-49 years (the age group that under-went HIV testing in the NHANES sample) wereincluded. Access to Medical Services Among inmates with a persistent medical problem, 13.9% of federal inmates, 20.1%of state inmates, and 68.4% of local jailinmates had received no medical examinationsince incarceration. More than 1 in 5 inmateswere taking a prescription medication forsome reason when they entered prison or jail; of these, 7232 federal inmates (26.3%), 80971 state inmates (28.9%), and inmates medi-cation following incarcer ation. Prior to incar- ceration, slightly more than 1 in 7 inmateswere taking a prescription medication for anactive medical problem routinely requiringmedication (as dened in the Methods tion). local jail inmates (36.5%[SE=1.7%]) stopped the medication following incarceration. Only a small portion of prison inmates (3.9% [SE=6.5%] of federal and 6.4% [SE=3.2%] of state inmates) with an active medical problemfor which laboratory monitoring is routinelyindicated had not undergone at least 1 bloodtest since incarceration. However, most localjail inmates with such a condition (60.1%[SE=1.8%]) had not undergone a blood test. Following serious injury, 650 federal in- mates (7.7%), 12997 state inmates (12.0%), and 3183 local jail inmates (24.7%) were notseen by medical personnel (Table 3). Mental Health Mental health problems were ubiquitous: 191 17 federal inmates (14.8% [SE=2.6%]),312768 state inmates (25.5% [SE=1.3%]), and 157634 local jail inmates (25.0% [SE=0.7%]) had at least 1 previously diag- nosed mental condition (Table 1); most of them had taken medications at some point prior to incarceration. However, a much smaller pro- portion of inmates with a mental health diag- nosis were taking psychiatric medication at the time of their arrest: 25.5% (SE=7.5%) of federal, 29.6% (SE=2.8%) of state, and38.5% (SE=1.5%) of local jail inmates. Among inmates with a previously diagnosed mentalcondition who had been treated with a psy- chiatric medication in the past, ofstate, and 45.5% (SE=1.6%) of local jail in-mates had taken a medication for a mentalcondition since incarceration. A similar patternwas apparent for prearrest and postincarcera-tion counseling (Table 4). Among prison inmates with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who had ever been treated with psychiatric medication, the proportion on treatment was approximately 1 in 3 at the timeof arrest and nearly 2 in 3 during incarceration(see appendix to Table 2, available as a sup-plement to the online version of this article athttp://www.ajph.org). Among jail inmates withschizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the patternof low treatment rates at arrest and high treatment rates following incarceration was also present, although less pronounced than inthe prison population. DISCUSSION Mass incarceration as part of the war on drugs has created a burgeoning inmate popu- lation in the United States. Earlier studies of inmates have been based on extrapolationsfrom noninstitutionalized Americans, singleinstitutions, or data from either federal or stateprisons alone or jail systems alone. Our studyadds to the existing literature by analyzing alarge, nationally representative sample of theentire US inmate population. More than 800000 inmates report having 1 or more chronic medical condition, and their access tomedical care appears to be poor, particularly injails. Our data also demonstrate that prisons areholding and treating many mentally ill peoplewho were off treatment at the time of arrest. Our age-standardized prevalence estimates for rates of hypertension and diabetes were higher than estimates from earlier population- based projection models (18.3% and 4.8%,respectively). 13Although the rates of asthma in our study were similar to the rates in the earlierstudy (8.5%), 13our gures include only those with active asthma, whereas the earlier estimatesincluded any prior diagnosis. Furthermore, theearlier projections were based on models that used data from NHANES III that included labo- ratory testing (diabetes) and physical examina-tion (hypertension) as part of diagnostic criteria;TABLE 2\u2014Age-Standardized Prevalence of Select Chronic Conditions Among Adult Federal and State Prisoners, Jail Inmates, and the Noninstitutionalized US Population: SISFCF , 2004, SIL J, 2002, 2003-2004 % (SE)State Inmates, % (SE)Jail Inmates, % (SE)US Population,a % (SE) Diabetes mellitus 11.1 (3.6) 10.1 (2.0) 8.1 (1.7) 6.5 (0.5) Hypertension 29.5 (2.9) 30.8 (1.5) 27.9 (2.1) 25.6 (1.0) Prior myocardial infarction 4.5 (4.5) 5.7 (2.8) 2.1 (0.4) 3.0 (0.3) Persistent kidney problems 6.3 (4.0) 4.5 (1.7) 4.1 (0.8) ...

SISFCF = Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities; SIL J = Survey of Inmates in Local Jails; NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Prevalence was standardized to the 2000 US population 18 years and older by direct age standardization. Inmates younger than 18 years represented 0% of federal inmates, less than 1% of state inmates, and 4.8% of jail inmates. aThe 2003-2004 NHANES did not include questions regarding persistent kidney problems, cirrhosis, and hepatitis. bFor HIV, only populations aged 18-49 years are included to allow comparison with NHANES data, which was derived from laboratory data.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE April 2009, Vol 99, No. 4 |American Journal of Public Health Wilper et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |669including these measurements as part of the diagnostic criteria among inmates would haveincreased our prevalence estimates. 13 Improved management of chronic condi- tions in prisons and jails may have importantimplications for community health and in re- ducing health care disparities, because the vast majority of inmates are eventually released.Approximately 12 million inmates are releasedannually (William J. Sabol, PhD, chief, Correc-tions Statistics, Bureau of Justice Statistics, oralcommunication, April 2008). This high turno-ver of a population with elevated rates oftreatable conditions offers a substantial public health opportunity. Indeed, in response to a congressional request, the National Commis-sion on Correctional Health Care issued anextensive report in 2002 titled The Health Status of Soon-To-Be-Released Inmates 8;a l - though it included recommendations of specicstrategies to improve inmates' health, nocongressional action has ensued (R. Scott Chavez, PhD, MPA, vice president, National Commissionon Correctional Health Care, oral communica-tion, July 2008). Nonetheless, minimizing in-mates' physical and mental disability is animportant step in reintegrating them into family and employment roles. The prevalence of HIV in prisons is higher than in the noninstitutionalized population,although it is declining. 14,15A high incidence of blood-borne illnesses among inmates has alsobeen documented. 16,17Limited privacy in prison may make prisoners reluctant to comply withtreatment of HIV, and sexual coercion and bartering may facilitate transmission. Similarly, untreated bleeding injuries (as documented inour data) pose an obvious transmission risk.Hence, poorly managed HIV may lead prisonsto function as ''ampliers'' of this and otherinfectious illnesses and add to the burden ofuntreated and advanced disease borne byinmates, families, and communities following inmates' release. We estimate that nearly 500000 inmates have a previously diagnosed mental condition.Moreover, Bureau of Justice Statistics estimatesthat include undiagnosed symptoms of mentalhealth problems (such as hallucinations) sug-gest that the number of inmates with a psychi-atric illness may be even higher. 18The rates of mental illness among inmates are thought to be higher than among the US population as a whole.Although we did not directly compare rates ofmental illness among inmates and the general USpopulation, our estimates were derived directlyfrom inmates, as opposed to a representativesampling of unincarcerated Americans. 13 Sadly, in the United States, many inmates do not receive psychiatric treatment at the time of arrest, even those with schizophrenia orbipolar disorder. However, the low rate oftreatment of inmates prior to arrest could beviewed as hopeful news, implying that greateraccess to outpatient mental health care mightreduce the staggering toll of crime and incar-ceration. 19 As with indicators for access to medical care, access to psychiatric care appears to beworse in jails than in prisons. The jump inrates of psychiatric treatment during incarcer-ation may reflect limited access to psychiatrictreatment among those with mental disordersprior to incarceration, and prisons' new socie-tal role as asylums following the mass closures of inpatient mental health facilities in the 1980s (the largest mental institutions in theUnited States are urban jails 7); conversely, psychiatric medications may be overprescribedin prisons. Furthermore, the use of psychiatricmedication is measured differently than that ofother prescription drugs. The increase in coun-seling from prearrest to incarceration supports the notion that a genuine improvement in the availability of psychiatric care occurs duringincarceration. Vast improvements in inmate health care are possible. Salutary reforms could include de-creasing incarceration rates; making healthcare systems in prison nonprot and autono-mous from prison authorities; increasing com- municable disease education, prevention, and treatment 20-22; making condoms available23; improving care for chronic conditions; providingtargeted cancer screening 24;i n c r e a s i n gt h eTABLE 3\u2014Access to Medical Care for Inmates of Federal Prisons, State Prisons, and Local Jails: SISFCF , 2004, and SILJ, 2002 ConditionFederal Inmates, No. or % (SE)State Inmates, No. or % (SE)Jail Inmates, No. or % (SE) Persistent medical problema Inmates with problem 43 059 465 682 214 812 Inmates with problem not examined by medical personnel 13.9 (4.5) 20.1 (2.1) 68.4 (1.1) Active medical problem requiring prescription medicationb Inmates on prescription medication at time of incarceration 18 728 181 994 90 283 Inmates not continued on same medication during incarceration 20.9 (6.7) 24.3 (3.3) 36.5 (1.7) Prescription drug use Inmates on prescription drugs at time of incarceration 27 522 280 036 141 133Inmates not continued on medication during incarceration 26.3 (4.9) 28.9 (2.6) 41.8 (1.4) Active medical problem routinely requiring blood test c Inmates with problem 23 467 240 960 106 539 Inmates with problem but with no blood tests since admissiond3.9 (6.5) 6.4 (3.2) 60.1 (1.8) Serious injurye Inmates with serious injury, no. 8 431 107 989 12 887Inmates not examined following serious injury, % (SE) 7.7 (10.6) 12.0 (4.6) 24.7 (3.9) Note.

Wewere unable to validate inmates' responses;however, the anonymous and condential na-ture of the survey should have maximizedinmates' candor. It is possible that some in-mates who reported taking prescription medi- cations that were discontinued at the time of incarceration had actually been switched to atherapeutic equivalent but did not recognize itas such or had a condition that no longerwarranted treatment at admission. Further-more, among those with chronic conditions, noassessment of medications begun followingincarceration was possible. Although our mea- sures of access to care among inmates have not been validated, we believe that they havesufcient face validity to support a presumption that health care in prisons and jails is far from adequate. Unfortunately, we have no informa-tion on the quality of pharmacological andother medical care. Hence, our data refer onlyto the most minimal standards of care (i.e.,any medical evaluation, any testing, or anytreatment). Conclusions Providing inmates with health care is polit- ically unpopular. Indeed, former SurgeonGeneral Richard H. Carmona stated that theBush administration had blocked the release ofthe Surgeon General's Report, Call to Action on Corrections in Community Health , for fear that the report would increase government spend- ing on inmates. 28However, the constitutional, public health, and human rights imperatives ofi m p r o v i n gh e a l t hc a r ei np r i s o n sa n dj a i l sa r eclear. j About the Authors At the time of this study, Andrew P.

American Journal of Public Health |April 2009, Vol 99, No. 4Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults Andrew P. Wilper, MD, MPH, Stefe Woolhandler, MD, MPH, Karen E. Lasser, MD, MPH, Danny McCormick, MD, MPH, David H. Bor, MD, and David U. Himmelstein, MD The United States stands alone among indus- trialized nations in not providing health cov-erage to all of its citizens. Currently, 46 million Americans lack health coverage. 1Despite re- peated attempts to expa nd health insurance, uninsurance remains commonplace among USadults. Health insurance facilitates access to health care services and helps protect against the high costs of catastrophic illness.Relative to the uninsured, insured Ameri-cans are more likely to obtain recommendedscreening and care for chronic conditions 2 and are less likely to suffer undiagnosed chronicconditions 3or to receive substandard medical care.4 Numerous investigators have found an as- sociation between uninsurance and death.5-14 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimated that 18314 Americans aged between 25 and 64years die annually because of lack of health insurance, comparable to deaths because of diabetes, stroke, or homicide in 2001 amongpersons aged 25 to 64 years. 4The IOM estimate was largely based on a single study by Frankset al. 5H o w e v e r ,t h e s ed a t aa r en o wm o r et h a n 20 years old; both medical therapeutics andthe demography of the uninsured have changedin the interim. We analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III collected data ona representative sample of Americans, withvital status follow-up through 2000. Our ob-jective was to evaluate the relationship be-tween uninsurance and death. METHODS The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted NHANES III between 1988 and 1994. The survey combined aninterview, physical examination, and labora-tory testing. NHANES III employed a complexsampling design to establish national esti-mates of disease prevalence among thenoninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States. 15Staff performed interviews in English and Spanish. The NHANES III Linked Mortality File matched NHANES III records to the NationalDeath Index (NDI). The NCHS's linkage, whichuses a probabilistic matching strategy throughDecember 31, 2000, is described elsewhere. 16 The NCHS perturbed the le to prevent reiden-tication of survey participants. Vital status wasnot altered in this process. The publicly released data yield survival analysis results virtually identical to the restricted-use NHANES IIILinked Mortality File. 17 In designing our analysis, we hewed closely to Franks'5methodology to facilitate interpreta- tion of time trends. We analyzed data for in-dividuals who reported no public source ofhealth insurance at the time of the NHANES III interview. First, we excluded those aged older than 64 years, as virtually all are eligible forMedicare. Of the 33994 individuals participat-ing, 14798 were aged between 17 and 64 yearsat the time of the interview. In keeping withearlier analyses, 5-7,13we also excluded noneld- erly Medicare recipients and persons covered byMedicaid and the Department of VeteransAffairs/Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services military insurance(n=2023), as a substantial proportion of those individuals had poor health status as a prerequi- site for coverage. Of the 12775 participantsnot covered by government insurance, we ex-cluded 663 (5.2%) who lacked information onhealth insurance. We excluded 974 of theremaining 121 12 who were covered by privateinsurance or uninsured at the time of the in-terview because of failure to complete the in- terview and physical examination. Of the remaining 1 1138, we included only the 9005with complete baseline data from both the in-terview and physical examination in our nalanalysis (Figure 1). Among those with completei n s u r a n c ed a t a ,t h o s ew i t hc o m p l e t ei n t e r v i e wand examination data were both less likely to beuninsured (16.4% vs 21.6%; P< .001) and less likely to die (3.0% vs 4.5%; P< .001). NHANES III staff interviewed respondents in their homes regarding demographics (in-cluding health insurance). Participantsresponded to questions about race, ethnicity,income, and household size. The sample designpermits estimation for 3 racial/ethnic groups:non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, andObjectives. A 1993 study found a 25% higher risk of death among uninsured compared with privately insured adults. We analyzed the relationship betweenuninsurance and death with more recent data. Methods. We conducted a survival analysis with data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We analyzed participants aged 17 to64 years to determine whether uninsurance at the time of interview predicteddeath. Results. Among all participants, 3.1% (95% condence interval [CI]=2.5%, 3.7%) died. The hazard ratio for mortality among the uninsured compared withthe insured, with adjustment for age and gender only, was 1.80 (95% CI=1.44, 2.26). After additional adjustment for race/ethnicity, income, education, self- and physician-rated health status, body mass index, leisure exercise, smoking, andregular alcohol use, the uninsured were more likely to die (hazard ratio=1.40; 95% CI=1.06, 1.84) than those with insurance. Conclusions. Uninsurance is associated with mortality. The strength of that association appears similar to that from a study that evaluated data from the mid-1980s, despite changes in medical therapeutics and the demography of the uninsured since that time.

The NCHS created a vari- able that combined family income and thepoverty threshold during the year of interview (the poverty income ratio), allowing income to be standardized for family size and com-pared across the 6 years of data collection. 18 NHANES III interviewers also collected data on education, employment, tobacco use,alcohol use, and leisure exercise. We ana-lyzed education dichotomously, comparingthose with 12 years or more education to those with less than 12 years. We consideredrespondents to be unemployed if they were looking for work, laid off, or unemployed. Allothers, including the employed, students, homemakers, and retirees were considered ''not unemployed.'' We considered smokersin 3 categories: current smokers, formersmokers (those who had smoked more than200 cigarettes in their lifetime), and non-smokers. We labeled those drinking more than6 alcoholic beverages per week as regulardrinkers. We analyzed exercise in 2 groups: those achieving greater than or equal to 100metabolic equivalents (METs) per month, ver- sus those achieving less than 100 METs per month. 19,20 NHANES III measured participants' self- perceived health in 5 categories: excellent, verygood, good, fair, and poor. We combined thelast 2 groups because of small numbers.NHANES physicians performed physical ex-aminations on all participants and provided an impression of overall health status rated as excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. 21We combined the nal 2 groups because of smallnumbers. We analyzed body mass index (BMI;weight in kilograms divided by height in meterssquared) in 4 categories: less than 18.5; 18.5 to25; more than 25 to less than 30; and 30 andhigher. NHANES III oversampled several groups, including Black persons, Mexican Americans,the very young (aged 2 months to 5 years), andthose aged older than 65 years. To account forthis and other design variables we used theSUDAAN (version 9.1.3, Research TriangleInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) SUR-VIVAL procedure and SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) PROC SURVEYFREQ to perform all analyses. We (as did Frankset al. 5) employed unweighted survival analyses and controlled for the variables used in deter-mining the sampling weights (age, gender, andrace/ethnicity) because of the inefciency ofweighted regression analyses. 22 We analyzed the relation between insurance, demographics, baseline health status variables, and mortality by using c2tests. We then used a Cox proportional hazards survival analysiscontrolling only for age and gender to determineif lack of health insurance predicted mortality.We repeated the analysis of the relationship ofinsurance to mortality after forcing all covariatesin the model. In this Cox proportional hazards analysis, we controlled for gender, age, race/ ethnicity (4 categories), income (poverty incomeratio), education, current unemployment,smoking status (3 categories), regular alcoholuse, self-rated health (4 categories), physician-rated health (4 categories), and BMI (4 cate-gories). We tested for signicant interactionsbetween these variables and health insurance status (i.e., P<.05). We handled tied failure times by using the Efron method. We performed multiple sensitivity analy- ses to analyze the robustness of our results. Note.

FIGURE 1\u2014Study population and exclusions.RESEARCH AND PRACTICE 2290 |Research and Practice |Peer Reviewed |Wilper et al. American Journal of Public Health |December 2009, Vol 99, No. 12We developed a propensity score model and controlled for the variables in our previous models (with the exception of health insur-ance status), as well as marital status;household size; census region; number ofovernight visits in hospital in past 12months; number of vis its to a physician in past 12 months; limitations in workor activities; job or housework changes or job cessation because of a disability or health problem; and number of self-reportedchronic diseases, including emphysema,prior nonskin malignancy, stroke, congestiveheart failure, hypertension, diabetes, orhypercholesterolemia. Next, we includedthe propensity score in the multivariablemodel with the indicator for insurance sta- tus. In addition, we tested for the effect of including those covered by Medicaid byusing our original Cox model and the pro-pensity score adjusted analysis. In a subsidi-ary analysis, we excluded employmentand self- and physician-rated health, asthese covariates may be a result of limitedaccess to health care because of uninsur- ance. To facilitate interpretation of our hazard ratio, we rst replicated the calculation in theIOM report to estimate the number of USadults who die annually because of lack ofhealth insurance. This approach applies theoverall hazard ratio to 9-year age strata andsums these gures to arrive at an annual number of deaths attributable to lack of health insurance. We then recalculated this gure byusing the slightly different approach utilizedby the Urban Institute, which does not agestratify when calculating total mortality. Webelieve this approach to be more accuratethan that used to produce the IOM estimate, asit calculates mortality from the entire age range that the hazard ratio was calculated from, as opposed to calculating mortality over10-year age strata. 23 RESULTS We display baseline characteristics of the sample in Table 1; 9004 individuals contrib- uted 80657 person-years of Of these, 16.2%(95% condence interval [CI]=14.1%, 18.2%)were uninsured at the time of interview.TABLE 1\u2014Insurance and Mortality Among Nonelderly US Adults Aged 17 to 64 Years: NHANES III (1986-1994) With Follow-Up Through 2000 Characteristic No. (weighted %) % Uninsured (SE) % Died (SE) Vital status as of December 31, 2000 Alive 8653 (96.9) 16.2 (1.0) 0Deceased 351 (3.1) 17.2 (2.8) 100 Insurance status a Privately insured 6655 (83.8) 0 3.0 (0.3) Uninsured 2350 (16.2) 100 3.3 (0.6) Gender Female 4695 (50.2) 15.1 (1.1) 2.6 (0.3)Male 4311 (49.8) 17.3 (1.3) 3.5 (0.4) Age, y 17-24 1750 (17.1) 28.5 (2.5) 0.7 (0.2)25-34 2338 (27.1) 19.7 (1.5) 1.4 (0.4)35-44 2177 (26.2) 11.6 (1.2) 1.7 (0.3) 45-54 1529 (16.8) 10.8 (1.4) 5.1 (0.9) 55-64 1344 (12.7) 8.9 (1.4) 10.7 (1.1) Race/ethnicity Non-Hispanic White 3484 (78.1) 12.3 (0.8) 3.1 (0.4)Non-Hispanic Black 2567 (9.9) 22.6 (2.1) 4.1 (0.5)Mexican American 2598 (5.1) 45.5 (1.9) 3.1 (0.4)Other 355 (6.9) 29.5 (7.3) 0.9 (0.4) Education, y < 12 2917 (19.6) 37.4 (3.0) 4.1 (0.5) 12 6087 (80.4) 11.0 (0.7) 2.8 (0.3) Employment Unemployed b511 (4.0) 49.8 (3.9) 5.3 (1.3) All others 8493 (96.0) 14.8 (0.9) 3.0 (0.3) Poverty income (9.2) 56.2 (2.7) 4.3 (0.9)> 1-3 4171 (39.7) 22.1 (1.7) 3.0 (0.3) > 3 3155 (51.2) 4.4 (0.5) 3.0 (0.4) Smoking status Current smoker 2465 (29.1) 22.8 (1.8) 4.6 (0.5)Former smoker d1794 (22.3) 10.4 (1.1) 4.2 (0.7) Nonsmoker 4745 (48.6) 14.9 (1.1) 1.7 (0.3) Drinking status, alcoholic drinks/wk < 6 7193 (78.3) 15.3 (1.1) 4.3 (0.7)6 1811 (21.7) 19.6 (1.5) 2.8 (0.4) Exercise, METs/mo 100 3475 (42.0) 13.7 (1.1) 2.9 (0.4) < 100 5529 (58.0) 18.0 (1.1) 3.2 (0.4) Self-rated health Excellent 9.3 (1.3) 2.0 (34.9) 1.4 (1.9) 3.3 (0.4)Fair or poor 1542 (9.9) 33.6 (2.5) 10.8 (1.2) ContinuedRESEARCH AND PRACTICE December 2009, Vol 99, No. 12 |American Journal of Public Health Wilper et al. |Peer Reviewed |Research and Practice |2291Uninsurance was associated with younger age, minority race/ethnicity, unemployment, smoking, exercise (less than 100 METs permonth), self-rated health, and lower levels ofeducation and income ( P<.001 for all com- parisons). Regular alcohol use and physician-rated health were also associated with higherrates of uninsurance ( P<.05 for both com- parisons). By the end of follow-up in 2000, 351 in- dividuals, or 3.1% (95% ofthe sample, race/ P=.008), ( P=.02), smoking ( worse status (P<.001), and worse physician-rated health status ( P<.001). In the model adjusted only for age and gender, lack of health insurance was signi-cantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio[HR]=1.80; 95% CI=1.44, 2.26). In subse-quent models adjusted for gender, age, race/ ethnicity, poverty income ratio, education, unemployment, smoking, regular alcohol use,self-rated health, physician-rated health, andBMI, lack of health insurance signicantlyincreased the risk of mortality (HR=1.40;95% CI=1.06,1.84; Table 2). We detected nosignicant interactions between lack of healthinsurance and any other variables. Our sen- sitivity analyses yielded substantially similar estimates. Replicating the methods of the IOM panel with updated census data 24,25and this hazard ratio, we calculated 27424 deaths amongAmericans aged 25 to 64 years in 2000associated with lack of health insurance. Apply-ing this hazard ratio to census data from 2005 26and including all persons aged 18 to 64 years yields an estimated 35327 deaths annu-ally among the nonelderly associated with lackof health insurance. When we repeated thisapproach without age stratication, (thought byinvestigators at the Urban Institute to be anoverly conservative approach) 23we calculated approximately 44789 deaths among Americans aged 18 to 64 years in 2005 associated with lack of health insurance. DISCUSSION The uninsured are more likely to die than are the privately insured. We used a nationallyrepresentative data set to update the oft-cited study by Franks et al. and demonstrate the persistence of increased mortality attributableto uninsurance. Our ndings are in accordwith earlier research showing that lack ofhealth insurance increases the likelihood ofdeath in select illnesses and populations. 5-7,13 Our estimate for annual deaths attributable touninsurance among working-age Americans is more than 140% larger than the IOM's earlier gure.23 By using methodologies similar to those used in the 1993 study, we found that being un-insured is associated with a similar hazard formortality (1.40 for our study vs 1.25 for the1993 study). Although the NHANES I studymethodology and population were similar to those used in NHANES III, differences exist. The population analyzed in the original studywas older on average than were participants inour sample (22.8% vs 55.6% aged 34 years oryounger). The maximum length of follow-upwas less (16 years vs 12 years), and the earlieranalysis was limited to White and Black per-sons, whereas the present study also includes Mexican Americans. The relative youthfulness and shorter follow-up in our study population would beexpected to reduce our power to detect anelevated risk of death. In addition, if gainingMedicare reduces the effect of uninsuranceon mortality, then the younger age andshorter length of follow-up in our study might strengthen the association between uninsurance and mortality compared withthe earlier study. It is less clear how thedifferences in the racial and ethnic make-upof our study population would affect ourability to detect difference in risk of death.In fact, the increased likelihood of uninsur-ance among Mexican Americans who were nonetheless no more likely to die than non- Hispanic Whites might also be expected toreduce our power compared with the earlierstudy. The original analysis conrmed vital status by review of decedents' death certicates.The NCHS had developed a probabilisticmatching strategy to establish vital status. A subsample underwent death certicate review and verication; 98.7% were found to becorrectly classied following this review. 16 Again, it is not clear how any misclassicationwould bias our results. Moreover, Congressextended Medicare coverage in 1972 to 2nonelderly groups: the long-term disabled andthose with end-stage renal disease. 27So, al- though both studies excluded Medicare enroll- ees, only ours entirely excluded disabled non-elderly adults who are at particularly high risk ofdeath.TABLE 1\u2014 Continued Physician-rated health on examination Excellent 4627 (54.2) 16.8 (1.2) 1.8 (0.3)Very good 2179 (24.4) 13.3 (1.2) 2.6 (0.5)Good 1858 (18.4) 17.2 (1.4) 4.9 (0.7)Fair or poor 340 (3.0) 21.7 (4.8) 19.0 (2.6) Measured BMI < 18.5 205 (2.7) 19.8 (4.0) 4.0 (1.4) 18.5-25 (46.8) 16.4 (1.2) 14.9 (1.2) 3.3 (0.7)30 2182 (20.0) 17.2 (1.8) 4.3 (0.8) Notes.

American Journal of Public Health |December 2009, Vol 99, No. 12The mechanisms by which health insurance affects mortality have been extensively studied.Indeed, the IOM issued an extensive reportsummarizing this evidence. 29The IOM identi- ed 3 mechanisms by which insurance improveshealth: getting care when needed, having aregular source of care, and continuity of cover- age. The uninsured are more likely to go without needed care than the insured. For instance,Lurie et al. demonstrated that among a medi-cally indigent population in California, loss ofgovernment-sponsored insurance was associ-ated with decreased use of physician servicesand worsening control of hypertension. 28,29 The uninsured are also more likely to visit theemergency department 30and be admitted to the hospital31for ''ambulatory care sensitive conditions,'' suggesting th at preventable illnesses are a consequence of uninsurance. The chronically ill uninsured are also less likely to have a usual source of medical care,32 decreasing their likelihood of receiving preven- tative and primary care. Discontinuity of insur- ance is also harmful; those intermittently un-insured are more likely to die than the insured. 13 All of these factors likely play a role in the decline in health among middle-aged unin-sured persons detected by Baker et al. 33,34This trend appears to reverse at age 65, when themajority gains access to Medicare coverage. 35 Other studies suggest that extending healthinsurance not only improves health, but also may be cost effective.36 Limitations Our study has several limitations. NHANES III assessed health insurance ata single point in time and did not validateself-reported insurance status. We were un-able to measure the effect of gaining or losing coverage after the interview. Point-in-time uninsurance is associated with subsequentuninsurance. 6Intermittent insurance coverage is common and accelerates the decline in healthamong middle-aged persons. 33Among the near- elderly, point-in-time uninsurance was associ-ated with signicant decline in overall healthrelative to those with private insurance. 13Earlier population-based surveys that did validate in- surance status found that between 7% and 1 1%of those initially recorded as being uninsuredwere misclassied. 13If present, such misclassi- cation might dilute the true effect of uninsur-ance in our sample. We excluded 29.5% of thesample because of missing data. These individ-uals were more likely to be uninsured and to die, which might also bias our estimate toward the null. We have no information about duration of insurance coverage from this survey. Further,we have no data regarding cost sharing(out-of-pocket expenses) among the insured;cost sharing worsened blood pressure controlamong the poor in the RAND Health Insur- ance Experiment, and was associated with decreased use of essential medications, andincreased rates of emergency department useand adverse events in a random sample ofelderly and poor Canadians. 37,38 Unmeasured characteristics (i.e., that indi- viduals who place less value on health es-chew both health insurance and healthy behaviors) might offer an alternative expla- nation for our ndings. However, our analy-sis controlled for tobacco and alcohol use,along with obesity and exercise habits. Inaddition, research has found that more than90% of nonelderly adults without insurancecite cost or lack of employer-sponsored cov-erage as reasons for being uninsured, whereas only 1% percent report ''not need- ing'' insurance. 39In fact, the variables included in our main survival analysis may inappropri-ately diminish the relationship betweenTABLE 2\u2014Adjusted Hazards for Mortality Among US Adults Aged 17 to 64 Years: NHANES III, 1988-2000 CharacteristicHazards Ratio (95% 1.00 Uninsured 1.40 (1.06, 1.84) Ageb1.06 (1.05, 1.07) Gender Female (Ref) 1.00Male 1.37 (1.13, 1.68) Race/ethnicity Non-Hispanic White (Ref) 1.00 Non-Hispanic Black 1.32 (0.98, 1.79) American 0.88 0.46 (0.24, METs/mo 100 100 1.05 (0.80, 1.38) Smoking status Nonsmoker (Ref) 1.00 Current smoker 2.02 (1.43, 2.85) Former smoker c1.42 (1.09, 1.85) Drinking status, alcoholic drinks/wk< 6 (Ref) 1.006 1.38 (0.99, 1.92) Education, y 12 (Ref) 1.00 < 12 0.98 (0.75, 1.27) Employment Not unemployed d(Ref) 1.00 Unemployed 1.40 0.67 1.09)Good 1.27 (0.84, 1.90) Fair or poor 2.26 (1.40, 3.64) Physician-rated health Excellent (Ref) 1.00Very good 0.99 1.52)Fair or 1.15) Poverty income ratioe1.03 (0.95, 1.12) Notes.

For example, poor physi- cian-rated health, poor self-rated health, and unemployment may result from medically pre-ventable conditions. Indeed, earlier analysessuggest that the true effect of uninsurance islikely larger than that measured in multivariatemodels. 13,40In addition, Hadley found that accounting for endogeneity bias by using aninstrumental variable increases the protective effect of health insurance on mortality. 40 Conclusions Lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44789 deaths per year in theUnited States, more than those caused bykidney disease (n=42868). 41The increased risk of death attributable to uninsurance suggests that alternative measures of access to medical care for the uninsured, such ascommunity health centers, do not provide theprotection of private health insurance. De-spite widespread acknowledgment thatenacting universal coverage would be lifesaving, doing so remains politically thorny.Now that health reform is again on the political agenda, health professionals have the opportunity to advocate universal cover-age. j About the Authors At the time of this research, all authors were with the Department of Medicine at Cambridge Health Alliance,afliated with Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA.

Less frequent INR monitor-ing may be feasible in stable patients. Wesought to identify patients with stable INRs(dened as having INR values exclusivelywithin the INR range) and pa-tients (dened as at least one INR outsidethe INR range) in a retrospective, longitudi-nal cohort study. Occurrences of thrombo-embolism, bleeding, and death were com-pared between groups. Multivariate logisticregression models were used to identifyindependent predictors of con-trol. There were 2504 stable 3569 com-parator patients. The combined rates ofbleeding and thromboembolism were signi-cantly lower in stable patients. Independentpredictors of stable INR control were ageolder than 70 years and the absence ofcomorbid heart failure and diabetes. Stablepatients were signicantly less likely to havetarget INR of 3.0 or higher or chronic dis-eases. We hypothesize that many patientsdemonstrating stable INR control could besafely treated with INR recall intervals greaterthan the traditional 4 weeks. (Blood. 2009; 114:952-956) Introduction Warfarin is effective for the primary and secondary prevention of both arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders. Its variabledose response and narrow therapeutic index mandate periodic monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR). 1Target INR ranges of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5 have been recommended for most indications because INR values in these ranges are associated with the best combination of thrombosis reduction and bleeding avoidance.1Although multiple studies have addressed the optimum target intensity of anticoagulation, few studies have addressed the optimal testing frequency. Current guidelines suggest a time interval not exceeding 4 weeks between INR determinations.1,2 However, this recommendation is not evidence based, having evolved instead from regional differences in routine clinicalpractice and expert opinion. 3 More frequent INR testing has been suggested as a means to increase time in the therapeutic range, especially among patients who self-monitor warfarin using point-of-care technology.1,4,5 Although more frequent testing may increase the proportion of time within the therapeutic INR range in some patients, it is notlikely to benet those patients who demonstrate long-term INRstability as demonstrated by minimal INR deviation and longitudi-nal warfarin dose stability. Hypothetically, less frequent INRmonitoring may be possible for such patients. Supporting evidencecomes from the United Kingdom where anticoagulation providers routinely allow INR recall intervals in stable patients up to 90 days. 6Recent evidence suggests that longer INR recall intervals may also be associated with improved INR control,7,8which has inturn been associated with reduced risk for anticoagulation therapy- related adverse events.9,10 Our objectives were to identify a subgroup of patients with very stable (ie, all INR values in the therapeutic range) INR control, to compare the risk of anticoagulation therapy-related adverse events in such patients to the corresponding risk in patients without exclusively therapeutic INR control, and to describe patientcharacteristics associated with long-term INR stability. Methods Study design and setting The study was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), an integrated health care delivery system that provides services to more than 480 000 members in theDenver-Boulder metropolitan area. Anticoagulation services at KPCO areprovided by a centralized Clinical Pharmacy Anticoagulation Service (CPAS). 9Working collaboratively with the referring physician and using standardized dosing algorithms,11CPAS clinical pharmacists initiate, adjust, and rell anticoagulant medications and order relevant laboratory tests. Dosing algorithms used during the study specied a maximum INR recall interval of 6 weeks. Integrated, electronic medical, pharmacy, and laboratory records system and CPAS database (Dawn-AC; 4S Systems Ltd)were used to identify patients, treatments, and outcomes for this study.Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the KPCO Institutional Review Board.

Stable patients were dened as having all INR values within the strictly dened therapeutic reference interval for the rst identiable continuous6-month period (ie, 100% INR control). Comparator patients were thosewho did not have any continuous 6-month period where all INR values werewithin the therapeutic range. To ensure a minimal standard for compliancewith ongoing INR monitoring, both stable and comparator patients had tohave at least one INR determination every 8 weeks during the respectiveobservation periods. The process for dening the study cohorts is depictedin Figure 1. Data collection Variables collected for analysis included the primary warfarin indication (atrial brillation, venous thromboembolism, heart valve disorder, other),age at start of the observation period, sex, INR target, duration of warfarintherapy, and INR values. Patient-specic factors that could influence therisk for anticoagulant-related complications were also recorded: diabetesmellitus, hypertension, heart failure, prior venous thrombosis, hemorrhageor stroke, cancer, and estrogen therapy. Risk factors were consideredpresent when a coded assessment for a given factor was identied in the 180 days prior to the start of the observation period. Estrogen therapy was dened as a prescription for a systemic estrogen-containing product soldwithin 90 days prior to the start of the observation period. A validatedmeasure of patient acuity, the chronic disease score (CDS), was calculatedfor each patient using ambulatory prescription drug data from the observa-tion period. 12Chronic disease scores can range from 0 to 35, with increasing scores indicating an increasing burden of chronic diseases under treatment. Use of the CDS allows for the accounting of each patient's risk of mortality and future health care use.12,13 The rst occurrence of anticoagulant-related complications (thromboem- bolism, bleeding, and death) was determined as previously described.14 Briefly, specic complications requiring admission to the emergencydepartment or hospital were sought using ICD-9 discharge diagnostic codes(available upon request) within KPCO electronic administrative databases.All events were subsequently conrmed through independent review of thepatient's electronic medical record by 2 investigators. Events were scoredusing a modied Naranjo scale to quantify the relationship of the adverseevent with warfarin therapy. 15A third reviewer was employed to resolve disagreements. Thromboembolic complications were dened as any deep vein thrombo- sis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemicattack, systemic embolism, or heart valve thrombosis. Bleeding complica-tions intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinalhemorrhage, hematoma, hemoptysis, epistaxis, and hematuria. All bleeding episodes resulting in admission to the emergency department or hospital were included regardless of severity. Fatal events were assessed for directrelationship to bleeding or thromboembolism using the medical recordand/or a death certicate.Statistical analysis Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 statistical software. Patient characteristics were reported as means and standard deviations for interval-level variables (eg, age, warfarin dose, length of warfarin therapy) variables (eg, sex, target INR, occurrence ofanticoagulation therapy-related complications). Associations between cat-egoric variables were assessed using the chi-square test and continuousvariables were compared using the independent samples ttest or Wilcoxon rank sum test (depending on the distribution of the data). Patient character-istics and risk factors were entered into multivariate logistic regressionmodels to identify variables that independently predict INR stability. Thealpha was set at .05. Results Records from 7686 patients were screened; of these, 6073 patients had a period where an INR was measured every 8 weeks for at least6 months. The stable group was composed of 2504 patients withINR values within the desired reference interval on all determina-tions and the comparator group of 3569 patients with at least oneINR outside the desired reference interval (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of stable patients and comparators are presented in Table 1. Stable group patients were older than comparator group patients and more likely to have had a target INRof 2.5 and to have been receiving warfarin for atrial brillation, butless likely to have had a target INR of 3.0 or higher, to have beenreceiving warfarin for heart valve replacement, to have comorbiddiabetes, heart failure, or prior venous thrombosis, or to beAll CPAS patients with 1 INR during 5-year study period (n=7,686)Patients lacking at least one INR in 8-week intervals for 6 or 12 months excluded (n=1,613) INRs exclusively in range AND at least one INR during consecutive 8- week intervals (n=2,504)INRs NOT exclusively in range AND at least one INR during consecutive 8-week intervals (n=3,569)Comparator group Stable group Figure 1.

The mean chronic disease score was also lower in stable group patients. Differences induration of warfarin therapy between groups prior to inclusion in the study were not statistically signicant. The mean proportion of INR values in the therapeutic range for the comparator group was46.9% (standard deviation [SD] /H1100522.0). The stable group had a lower mean number of INRs measured per patient, 6.7 (SD /H110051.3) during the observation period compared with 10.7 (SD /H110054.5) per patient for comparators ( P/H11021.001). Rates of anticoagulation therapy-related adverse events (throm- boembolism, bleeding, and death) are summarized in Table 2.Compared with stable group patients, the rate of overall mortalitywas higher in the comparator group ( P/H11021.01); however, the difference in anticoagulation therapy-related mortality rate was not statistically signicant. The rate of anticoagulation-related bleed-ing complications was higher in the comparator group comparedwith their stable counterparts ( P/H11021.05). Compared with stable group patients, the combined complication rates of bleeding orthromboembolism occurred at a higher rate in the comparatorgroup ( P/H11021.001). Patients in the comparator group were more likely than the stable group to require coadministration of heparinor low-molecular-weight heparin ( P/H11021.001). Table characteristics predictive of stable status. Signicant predictors of stable group status were age olderthan 70 (odds ratio [OR] /H110051.54; 95% condence interval /H110051.87; CI, 1.3-2.67), heart failure (OR concurrent estrogen therapy (OR /H110051.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60). Stable patients were signicantly less likely to have a target INR of 3.0 or higher (OR /H110050.48; 95% CI, 0.38-0.61) and increasing chronic disease scores (OR /H110050.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98). Discussion In this large retrospective cohort study, we identied 2504 patients with very stable long-term INR control. We identied that age olderthan 70 years and the absence of comorbid diabetes or heart failure independently predicted this INR stability. Patients with a target INR of 3.0 or higher and those with a greater burden of chronicdiseases were less likely to have such long-term INR stability. Onaverage, the proportion of comparator patients' INRs in range was 46.9%, whereas 100% therapeutic. The seemingly suboptimal INR control reflectsthe absence of these very stable patients from the comparatorgroup. The time in therapeutic range for all patients managed byCPAS is typically about 64%. 9Although other investigations haveexamined predictors of very poor INR control,16-19to our knowl - edge this study is the rst to assemble a large cohort of anticoagu- lated patients and carefully evaluate them for predictors of INR stability. Our ndings are important as patients with long-term stable INR control may be adequately treated with less frequent INR monitoring, perhaps as infrequently as every 8 weeks. Extendingthe INR recall interval in such patients is likely to reduce costs andincrease convenience (and therefore perhaps adherence) withoutimpacting the risk for bleeding or thrombosis. The most surprising observation in our analysis was that age older than 70 years predicted long-term INR stability. This observation is somewhat counterintuitive and should be conrmedin additional studies. This nding argues against innate INRvariability associated with advancing age. The possibility thatyounger patients were more likely to have been receiving warfarinfor heart valve indications was explored posthoc by comparing theproportion of patients 70 years or older in both groups on warfarinfor this indication. In the stable group, 5.0% had a heart valveindication compared with 7.5% in the comparator group ( P/H11005.09). An interaction term for age and warfarin indication was tested inthe predictive model but was not signicant. Our results are likely to be valid. The data set used to complete this study is robust and has been used previously in health recordsand data extraction research. 9,14The large number of patientsTable 2.

Real-world patients with a variety of indications forwarfarin and therapeutic INR targets were included. Clinical eventswere comprehensively collected and described, and INR determina-tions were performed by a single laboratory and systematicallycaptured in an integrated electronic medical record. All clinical events were independently assessed for causality by 2 expert reviewers. The long-term stable cohort was carefully establishedusing a denition for stability (ie, 100% of INR values within thestrict INR range) more rigorous than that used by most anticoagula-tion providers in routine practice. For example, had INR resultswithin 0.2 of the upper and lower limits of the specied INR rangequalied as \"in-range\" (as is common clinical practice in NorthAmerica), the number of patients with long-term INR stabilitywould have been substantially larger. 20Most patients observed in our study had been on warfarin therapy for several years. Although differences were not statistically signicant between groups, indi-viduals with long-term stability tended to have been on warfarinlonger than comparator patients. Potential adherence and survivorbiases were minimized by the fact that both groups observed in ourstudy could appropriately be termed \"prevalent\" warfarin users. This study does have important limitations. It is retrospective and relies upon extraction of data from administrative databases and medical records. Not all variables likely to enter into clinicaldecision making were collected. The observational study designalso precludes denitive establishment of cause and effect relation-ships between study variables and outcomes. Retrospective data-base analysis is particularly prone to missing clinical events if careis delivered outside participating institutions. However, given thatKPCO patients are either seen within an afliated hospital or thecosts of care are billed to KPCO when care is provided atnonafliated hospitals, it is likely that the vast majority of clinicallyimportant events were captured. As patients are provided withcomprehensive care by our anticoagulation service, we are con-dent that all pertinent laboratory values were captured. Our studywas conducted within an integrated health care delivery systemwith a specialized anticoagulation service using standardizedwarfarin dosing protocols and, thus, the observed results may notdirectly translate to other health care settings. We would like to have estimated the actual proportion of anticoagulated patients within KPCO with exclusively therapeutic INR control. As not all patients managed by CPAS met initial eligibility criteria, this was not possible. However, of 7686 anti-coagulated patients with at least one measured INR during the5-year study period, we were able to identify 2504 patients (33%)who had at least 6 months of INR values within their desiredtherapeutic range. Other researchers have reported that approxi- mately 37% of patients with atrial brillation managed in commu-nity settings are within the therapeutic INR range 75% or more ofthe time. 7Irrespective of the actual proportion, our data suggest that a substantial number of patients would be adequately treated with INR recall intervals in excess of 4 weeks. More frequent INR monitoring would of course be necessary in the presence of newcomorbidities or new medications affecting the INR. In conclusion, our work supports the hypothesis that a subgroup of anticoagulated patients with therapeutically stable INR values over 6 months can be identied. In general, these patients will tend to be older, with a target INR less than 3.0, and without signicantchronic disease burden. Patients with such stable INR controlexperience signicantly fewer anticoagulation therapy-related com-plications. We agree with others who have suggested that INRrecall intervals should be individually tailored based on recent INRcontrol rather than being xed at minimum frequency such as4 weeks. 7We acknowledge that our ndings need to be validated in future prospective evaluations. Specically, we suggest a prospec- tive randomized study that will enroll chronically anticoagulated patients and, after a period of INR stability, gradually increase theinterval between INR determinations up to 8 weeks and possibly aslong as 12 weeks in patients with stable INR values and baselinecharacteristics predictive of long-term INR stability.

Kressin, PhD Abstract Objective: To assess the sensitivity of a newly developed brief measure of oral health-related quality of life (OQOL). Methods: Self-assessed oral health and OQOL were measured in three groups of patients who had presented for either prophylaxis(n=32), endodontic care ( n=15), or for a denture ( n=16) in a dental school setting before and after treatment. Main outcome measures included the single-item self-report of oral health (OH-1) and the 6- and 12-item versions of a new OQOLinstrument. General linear modeling was used to compute means of self-reportedoral health by treatment group. Results: Of the 63 patients who completed the baseline questionnaire, 44 (70 percent) returned questionnaires after treatment. Thesample averaged 43 /H1100615 years, 48 percent male and 55 percent with some college education. Ethnic representation included 35 percent White, 33 percent Black, and32 percent other - mostly Latino. The mean self-reported number of teeth was 20.6.In terms of sensitivity, signicant differences were observed between the treatmentgroups on the items assessing being upset ( P<0.05), feeling depressed ( P<0.05), and uncomfortable about the appearance of teeth or dentures ( P<0.05). However, magnitude of change, as measured by an effect size, was characterized as minimalto small in the recall and endodontic groups and borderline moderate in the denturegroup. Conclusion: The measure was sensitive to differences within groups, with a small to borderline magnitude of change. Key Words: oral health ,quality of life ,sensitivity ,dental treatment ,outcome measures Introduction Oral health-related quality of life (OQOL) represents the self-perceived impact of oral conditionson daily functioning and well-being.These functions include physical,psychological, and social function-ing; performance of self-care; per-ceived health and symptomology;and the presence of pain or distress(1). Combined with clinical and otherindices, these measures of oral healthstatus help provide a more compre-hensive assessment of an individual'soverall health.Over the past several decades several OQOL instruments havebeen developed and have under-gone considerable testing, establish-ing their validity and reliability (2).These instruments have been usedto describe the impact of disease onpatient's daily functioning (3); andas outcome measures to evaluatethe effectiveness of interventions(4). Less attention has been paid tothe use of these instruments tomeasure the magnitude and extentof longitudinal change. Only a fewpopulation-based studies haveexaminedchanges in OQOL as a result of dental intervention, andmuch of this research has focusedon the replacement of teeth usingconventional or implantable pros-thesis (5-8), temporomandibularjoint dysfunction (9), or to evaluatedental care programs (10). Failure toconsider a broader range of inter-ventions is an important gap in ourknowledge base given the increasedrecognition of the importance ofthese instruments for quantifying thetreatment benet in clinical trials orinvestigating the impact of illnessover time (11). If OQOL instrumentsare to be of value in assessing out-comes from clinical interventions,then their ability to describe themagnitude and extent of changemust be determined (12). Further-more, establishing the sensitivity ofOQOL instruments would assistinvestigators in selecting the mostappropriate measure and assisthealth professionals to interpret themeaning of changes in scoresderived from the instrument. The present study of dental school patients examines the impactof treatment of dental conditions onpatients' quality of life. These dataprovide us the opportunity to assessthe sensitivity to change of a newlydeveloped brief measure of qualityof life. This new measure, consistingof 6- and 12-item scales, is com-prised of items from three existingOQOL measures: the Oral Health Send correspondence and reprint requests to Wanda G.

Both the 6- and 12-item scalesof this new measure have demon-strated sound psychometric pro-perties including excellent validity,reliability, internal consistency, andlimited floor and ceiling effects (16).Both the 6- and 12-item scales canbe used in the clinical setting as anoutcome measure. However, theobserved differences in internal con-sistency reliability suggest that the6-item scale is appropriate for use incomparing groups of patients whilethe 12-item scale is appropriate foruse in assessing outcomes amongindividual patients (16). The present work using this new 6- and 12-item measure was devel-oped based on a conceptual modelof health and quality of life proposedby Patrick and Erickson (17) andapplied to oral health by Gift andAtchison (18,19). This model con-tains ve health-related quality of lifeconcepts including a) opportunity;b) perceptions; three functionalstates: physical, social, and psycho-logical functioning; d) impairments;and e) survival. Opportunity reflectsthe impact that oral health has onone's ability to function in social andwork roles. Perceptions include self-rating of oral health as well as satis-faction with this self-rating andperceived need for treatment. Physi-cal functioning of the teeth and oralcavity includes activity restrictionssuch as a patient's ability to eat,chew, speak, or sleep without dis-comfort. Social functioning includesthe impact of oral health on socialroles such as speaking, smiling,eating in public, and being able tomeet one's obligations such as workand family responsibilities. Psy-chological functioning includes apatient's satisfaction with the esthet-ics of their dentition, comfort withinterpersonal relations as well asworry, concern, embarrassmentabout, or lack of condence becauseof problems with teeth or gums.Impairments include self-reportedsymptoms or other indication of dis-comfort or pain. Finally, survival can be measured by tooth loss or mortal-ity, e.g., from oral cancer. Our aim was to assess the sensi- tivity to change of this new measureas a consequence of dental inter-ventions on three groups of dentalpatients: denture replacement, endo-dontic, and patients on recall with noapparent disease. These groups wereselected based on the rationale thatpatients with more severe conditions(endodontic and denture replace-ment) would have a greater level ofchange in their oral health status, andthat OQOL indicators should bemore sensitive to the impact of theseconditions. We expected little changein the self-reported oral health statusof the recall group. Baseline andfollow-up oral quality of life scoreswere evaluated using both the 6- and12-item OQOL scales (summaryscores and individual items in each),as well as a global assessment ofOQOL. Materials and Methods Design. We used a repeated measure design to examine theeffects of dental treatment onpatient-assessed outcomes of dentalcare in three groups of patients(recall, endodontic, or denture) in adental school setting. This design ischaracterized by having more thanone measurement of at least onevariable for each subject. We com-pared baseline (immediately beforetreatment) and follow-up (3 monthsafter treatment) quality of life scores.The study protocol receivedapproval from the InstitutionalReview Board at Boston University.Consent to participate was obtainedaccording to Institutional ReviewBoard requirements. Setting and Participants. Par- ticipants were a convenience sampleof adults aged /H1135018 years seeking treatment in the dental clinics atBoston University Goldman Schoolof Dental Medicine, Boston, Massa-chusetts, between June 2002 andMay 2004. Three categories ofpatients were recruited: thosecoming to the general dentistryclinics for \"recall\" visits for checkupsand prophylaxis (RECALL group), those presenting to the endodonticclinic in pain (ENDO group), andpatients presenting to the prosth-odontic clinic for removable den-tures (DENTURE group). Patientswere excluded if they were less than18 years of age or if they had adiagnosis other than those speciedearlier. Research staff recruited sub-jects in the waiting areas of the threeclinics from Monday through Fridaybetween 9 AMand 5 PM. All treat- ments were provided by undergradu-ate dental students under supervisionby staff from the General DentistryDepartment at Boston UniversityGoldman School of Dental Medicine. Data Collection. At prearranged times, research staff visited eachclinic (general dentistry, endodontic,prosthodontic) and attempted torecruit subjects in the clinic waitingareas. Of the 122 subjects app-roached (RECALL =51, ENDO = 39, DENTURE =32), 43 (RECALL = 14, ENDO =17, The reasons provided for declining wereinconvenience no time (n=14), or no reason given ( n=9). Five recall patients were under theage of 18 years and were excluded.Four DENTURE patients presented tothe clinic for reasons other thanthe insertion of a removable prosthe-sis, and seven of the endodonticpatients were not undergoing emer-gency =16) Subjects in the recall and endo- dontic groups were asked to com-plete the baseline questionnaire attheir initial dental visit. Patients inthe denture group were asked tocomplete the baseline questionnaireimmediately prior to the insertion ofthe removable prosthesis. All patientswere asked to complete the instru-ment again 3 months later and returnit by mail in the stamped addressedenvelope provided. We attempted toreach all patients by phone as areminder to send in the second ques-tionnaire. We sent a second copy ofJournal of Public Health Dentistry 96the questionnaire to subjects not returning their questionnaire withinthe designated time period. OQOL Measures. OQOL (16) was measured using the 6- and12-item scales developed from itemsin the OHQOL, the GOHAI, and theOHIP. For details of development,please see the original article (16).Briefly, the 64 items from the com-bined three quality of life surveyswere administered along with a clini-cal oral examination to two veteransstudy samples ( of role function,distress, and worry), impairment,and perceptions. Each of the 64 items from the three OQOL instruments was inde-pendently categorized into one ofthe theoretical domains by theauthors. An iterative series of multi-trait scaling analysis was conductedto examine the t of the items to thehypothesized domains (20). Theseanalyses examine item-level char-acteristics including internal con-sistency, of item-scalecorrelations, discriminant valid-ity. The results provide informationabout scale distribution characteris-tics, reliability of scale scores, andcorrelations among hypothesizedscales. The conceptual model was altered to include ve dimensions:physical function, impairment/disease, and three dimensions ofpsychosocial function: role function,distress, and worry. Five scales tocorrespond with the said dimen-sions, a separate denture subscale (3items), and a summary scale com-prised of all items were created. Forward stepwise regression was conducted to develop a short-formversion of the measure. For eachscale, the total scale score was usedas the dependent variable, with datafrom the two veteran samples. Itemsthat explained either 80 percent ofthe variance or the rst ve items,whichever was greater, were selectedresulting in ve scales, each with veitems. All of the scales had excellentinternal consistency reliability, ranging from 0.78 to 0.92. The ve scales and three denture items were then administered to asample of dental patients ( n=113). Using multitrait analysis, the numberof items was reduced further byeliminating items contributing leastto each scale's internal consistencyreliability and retaining whichconceptually best represented thesubscale. One 12-item alpha =0.90) and a second 6-item measure (Cronbach'salpha =0.80) were developed. The association of the 6- and 12-item measures with clinicalindices was examined using the clini-cal data from the two sets of veter-ans. Both scales were signicantlycorrelated overall with number ofteeth ( and decay ( r=0.09 and 0.14), 0.20), and root caries ( r=0.14 and (14). The associations detectedbetween the 6- and 12-item scalesand clinical indices are similar tothose of other published ndings(21,22). The 12-item measure contains 3-item subscales for three scales: dis-tress, worry and social function(role), and single items assessingdimensions titled physical function,denture, and pain. The 6-itemmeasure includes single items assess-ing distress, worry, social function,physical function, denture, and painas listed (see Table 1 for the scales). We also included a separate single item that is not part of the 6- and12-item scales. This 5-point globalself-report of oral health (OH-1) hasbeen used in prior studies and asks,\"How would you describe the healthof your teeth and gums? Would yousay it is excellent, very good, good,fair or poor?\" Responses are scoredfrom 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Scoring. Some items (GOHAI 10 and OHQOL B31) were reversed sothat a higher score consistently indi-cated worse oral quality of life.GOHAI 10 score of 3 becomes a 1,score of 2 remains a 2, score of 1becomes a 3; and OHQOL B31 scoreof 5 becomes a 1, score of 4 becomes a 2, score of 3 remains a 3, score of2 becomes a 4, and score of 1becomes a 5. All item scores were then con- verted to a scale of 0-100. Itemsscored on a 0-4 scale (all OHIPitems) were converted to a scale of0-100 by having 0 =0, 1=25, 2 =50, 3=75, and 4 =100. The item initially scored on a 1-3 scale (GOHAI 10)was converted as follows after theitem was reversed: 1 =0, 2=50, and 3=100. scale (OHQOL B31 and OH-1) were con-verted to by having1=0, 2 =25, 3 =50, 4 =75, and 5 = 100. Final scores for each scale (6- and 12-item) and subscales (distress,worry, and social function) werecreated by computing the mean ofthe responses to items representedby each scale. Analysis. A combination of bivariable and multivariable statisti-cal methods was used for this analy-sis. We measured differences inmean age by group using differences betweengroups. Demographic thatdiffered between groups wereadjusted for in the analy-sis. scores werecomputed and compared usingANOVA. Duncan's multiple rangetest was used to control the Type Ierror rate. We used general linearmodeling to examine between-groupeffects in OQOL scores, meanchange scores were reported as leastsquares means after adjusting forbaseline OQOL score and covariatessuch as age and gender. Changescores were derived for individualitems and total scores by subtractingposttreatment scores from baselinescores. Positive scores indicated animprovement and negative scoresindicated deterioration followingtreatment. The magnitude of changewas assessed as an effect size, calcu-lated by dividing the mean of changescores by the standard deviation (SD)of the related baseline score (23).Assessment of Dental Treatment Outcomes 97All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Corporation,Cary, NC, USA). We used P< 0.05 as a cutoff for statisticalsignicance. Results Characteristics of Participants. At baseline, 63 subjects participated,32 in the recall group, 15 in theendodontic group, and 16 inthe denture group. The sociodemo-graphic characteristics (see Table 2)of the baseline sample demonstratethe expected association of age withtreatment group; denture patientstended to be older whereas the recallgroup tended to be younger ( P= 0.0002) and more highly educated(P=0.003). The mean number of teeth by self-report was 26 in therecall group, 23 in the endodonticgroup, and 7.0 in the denture group.Approximately 31 percent of thedenture group were completelyedentulous. Of the participants who com- pleted the baseline questionnaire, 44(70 percent) returned questionnairesafter treatment. This sample aver-aged 45 \u00b1 15.8 (SD) years, 49 percentmale and 48 percent with somecollege education. Ethnic representa-tion included 30 percent White, 38percent Black, and 32 percent other.There were no differences on any ofthese dimensions between thosewho remained in the study and thosewho did not. Overall, the age, gender, race, and educational statusof the sample remained constantover the period of the study(Table 2). No information wascollected on those declining par-ticipation in the study. Baseline Quality of Life Scores. There were no signicant differencesbetween the three groups in terms oftheir summary OQOL or subscalescores at baseline. Details of thesummary and individual 6- and12-item baseline scores for eachgroup are shown in Table 3.

Thedenture group expressed less worrythan the endodontic or recall groups. Follow-up Quality of Life Scores. There were no signicant differences between the three groupsin terms of their follow-up, OH-1scale, or subscale scores (Table 4).However, there were differences items assessing between the endodontic groupand the denture group ( P=0.05) and for the item assessing beingdepressed between the denturegroup and the recall group ( P= 0.05). Signicant differences werealso noted between the recall ( P=0.03) and the endodontic group and denture group(P=0.03) for the item assess- ing being uncomfortable with theappearance of the teeth or dentures. Magnitude of Change in Quality of Life Scores FollowingDental Intervention. The effect sizes describe the magnitude ofchange, and these effect sizes variedby group. Cohen (23) dened effectsizes as small =0.2, moderate =0.5, and large =0.8. Using Cohen's crite- ria, effect sizes were characterized asminimal to small in the recall andendodontic groups, and borderlinemoderate in the the denture and recallgroups ( P=0.03) the items assessing feeling depressed andfeeling uncomfortable about theappearance of the teeth, mouth,or dentures (Table 5). Discussion We examined whether a newly developed brief measure of OQOL issensitive to changes in oral healthstatus as a consequence of dentalinterventions. We hypothesized thatpatients receiving a removableprosthesis or endodontic care wouldshow greater improvement in OQOLover period than patientsreceiving a in OQOL fol-lowing dental treatment.

Subjects in both therecall and endodontic groups re-ported improvements which wereonly minimal to small. Spilker (11) described health status measures as being discrimina-tive, predictive, and evaluative. Dis-criminative instruments are used tomeasure differences between sub-jects at a point in time when no \"goldstandard\" is available, and these dif-ferences can be interpreted as trivial,small, moderate, or large. The aim ofpredictive instruments is to classifyindividuals relative to a predened\"gold standard.\" Evaluative instru-ments are used to measure longitu-dinal change within, and between,samples. A major goal of using evalu-ative instruments is to better under- stand how dental conditions andsubsequent interventions impactquality of life, and use of evaluativeinstruments is essential to planninghealth care at the individual andsocietal level (17). A major property of an evaluative instrument is its sensitivity to changeover time. Locker (24) describes fourmethods currently used to measurechange. The rst method is tocompare baseline and follow-upmeasurements. Although this methodis simple, it masks within subjectchange so that positive and negativechanges cancel each other out. Thesecond approach is by the use ofchange scores; obtained by subtract-ing post-intervention scores frompre-intervention scores. The thirdapproach involves the use of globaltransition scores reflecting the patients' overall assessment of howtheir oral health has changed overthe time period in question. The nalapproach is the use of global transi-tion scales derived from a series ofglobal transition statements appliedto different dimensions of health.None of these methods is universallyaccepted. Our approach involved theuse of change scores and standard-ized effect sizes to assess the magni-tude of change. In this method themean change is divided by the SD ofthe baseline score. Thus, the magni-tude of change of individual items ofthe 6- and 12-item scales in responseto dental intervention in this samplecould be characterized as minimal tosmall in the recall and endodonticgroups and borderline moderate inthe denture group.Table 3 Baseline Scale Scores and Items by Group In the past 3 months, how often have you experienced the following difculties because of problems with your teeth, mouth, or dentures?RECALL\u00a7 (n=32)ENDO\u0081 (n=15)DENTURE (n=16) Summary scales Mean (SD) OH-1 55 (27.4) 58 (32.3) 53 (32.7)6-item scale 42 (9.6) 41 (12.6) 45 (13.5)12-item scale 32 (14.3) 39 (17.1) 34 (19.4) Subscales Distress 26 (24.8) 45 (35.9) 26 (33.8)Worry 48 (15.5) 57 (18.4) 47 (21.9)Social functioning 10 (17.5) 16 (23.9) 12 (22.8) Individual items Have you been upset? 32 (29.9) 55 (45.5) 35 (45.1)Have you found it difcult to relax?* 27 (28.6) 45 (36.8) 25 (36.5)Have you felt depressed? 17 (24.9) 35 (38.7) 14 (30.2)Do you feel nervous or self-conscious?* 69 (32.9) 63 (29.6) 80 (31.6)Have you been worried about dental problems? 44 (30.2) AB60 (38.7)A28 (38.8)B Have you felt uncomfortable about the appearance of your teeth? 32 (36.0) 47 (39.9) 34 (39.6)Have you avoided going out?* \u00b6 15 (25.2) 23 (33.3) 14 (27.3) Have you been totally unable to function? \u00b6 4 (11.1) 10 (18.4) 6 (25) Have you had trouble getting along with others? \u00b6 12 (22.8) 13 (24.7) 12 (18.5) How much pain or distress do you have?* 24 (26.5) A63 (35.1)B22 (27.5)A Have you had uncomfortable dentures?* 38 (20.9) 25 (43.3) 35 (28.0)Have you had to avoid eating some foods?* 27 (33.2) 36 (42.4) 41 (35.2) Values with same superscripts are not signicantly different ( P>0.05 using Duncan's Items on 6-item scale.Subscales: Distress.

In a studyto examine the effects of tooth lossand denture-wearing on quality oflife, Jones (25) found that the 6- and12-item scales differentiated betweendentition/denture groupings and thatthe item assessing avoidance ofcertain foods discriminated wellbetween dentition groups. A limita-tion of that study was that it wasconducted exclusively in maleveterans. An important limitation of this present study is the small samplesize. However, one of the strengthsof this study is the diverse sample interms of age, gender, and ethnicbackground, and the fact that thesame patients were analyzed beforeand after treatment. The response rate to this study of 70 percent wasacceptable and indicated the feasibil-ity of employing a short-form self-completed outcome measure in adental school setting. Although theage composition, gender, and ethnicrepresentation of subjects who didand did not remain in the study werevirtually the same, potential biasbecause of loss of some participantsin the study must be consideredwhen interpreting the ndings. These results were also limited by floor effects (indicates best possiblescores) and ceiling effects (indicatesworst possible scores); hence, theresults of magnitude of changes(effect sizes) following treatmentneed to be interpreted with cautionas changes cannot be reliably esti-mated for individuals with extremescores.A nal consideration is the limi- tations in the use of regressionanalyses in the development ofshort-form measures of OQOL mea-sures as underlying assumptions ofregression analyses are violated bythese types of data. Locker andAllen (26) argue that the method ofdeveloping a short-form instrumentis not as important as its contentand that the items in the question-naire and its measurement proper-ties need to be appropriate to itspurpose, the population to which itis applied, and the context in whichit is being used. The results from this study further support the use of these scales as abrief measure of OQOL in dentalschool clinical settings. Further re-search using this new instrument isneeded in larger samples and differ-ent settings.Table 4 Adjusted Follow-Up Item and Scale Means by Group (Adjusted for Age, Gender, and Baseline Score) In the past 3 months, how often have you experienced the following difculties because of problems with your teeth, mouth, or dentures?RECALL\u00a7 (n=22)ENDO\u0081 (n=12)DENTURE (n=10) Summary scales Mean (SD) OH-1 57 (26.8) 56 (30.3) 53 (32.0)6-item scale 41 (18.7) 44 (17.0) 43 (12.5)12-item scale 32 (14.6) 34 (18.5) 34 (17.0) Subscales Distress 27 (22.0) 31 (35.4) 26 (18.3)Worry 48 (15.6) 50 (18.8) 47 (18.0)Social functioning 12 (17.0) 14 (26.2) 18 (25.3) Individual items Have you been upset? 30 AB(24.5) 40B(32.3) 20A(30.2) Have you found depressed?
