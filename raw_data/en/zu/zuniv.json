Artigo express their [opinions]and [thoughts]about different topics. [Monitoring]and analyzing the sentiments of people is essential for [governments]and [business] [organizations]to better understand people's [feelings]and [thoughts]. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been one of the most trending topics on [social media]over the last two years. Consequently, one of the preventative [measures]to control and prevent the spread of the [virus]was [vaccination]. A [dataset]was formed by collecting tweets from Twitter for over a month from November 13th to December 31st, 2021. After data cleaning, the tweets were assigned a positive, negative, or neutral label using a [natural language processing](NLP) [sentiment analysis]tool. This study aims to analyze people's [public opinion]towards the [vaccination]process against COVID-19. To fulfil this [goal], an ensemble model based on [deep learning](LSTM-2BiGRU) is proposed that combines long [short-term memory](LSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The performance of the proposed model is compared to five traditional [machine learning]models, two [deep learning]models in addition to [state]-of-the- [art]models. By comparing the results of the models used in this study, the results reveal that the proposed model outperforms all the machine and [deep learning]models employed in this [work]with a 92.46% accuracy score. This study also shows that the number of tweets that involve neutral, positive, and negative indicate that the number of people [carrying]neutral sentiments towards COVID-19 [immunization]through [vaccines]is the highest among others. \u00a9 2023, International Journal of Advanced [Computer] [Science]and Applications.
