Weisbard* How are we as a society to respond to the injuries that inevitably accompany our quest for medical progress? Economists, lawyers, and public policy analysts are too often prone to see such questions as inviting a purely technical inquiry, to be solved by recourse to alleg\u00ad edly value-free economic theory, cost-benefit analysis, or legal prece\u00ad dent. A recent volume2 on biomedical innovation suggests the possibility of an alternative form of inquiry, drawing not only on law and economics, but on history and philosophy, cultural analysis and sociology of professions, the history and philosophy of science and medicine, and the careful assessment of politics and political institu\u00ad tions, to improve our understanding of the social meaning and signifi\u00ad cance of medical innovations and the injuries that trail in their wake. The question\u2014indeed, the challenge\u2014is whether we can employ the fruits of such multidisciplinary inquiry to develop a better informed and more sensible public policy to govern medical innovation and the treatment of its victims. I am not convinced that the programmatic recommendations for 1 Adapted from Weisbard, Responding to Biomedical Innovation: A Beginning Synthesis and Modest Proposal, in Medical Innovation and Bad Outcomes: Legal, Social, and Ethical Responses, at 251 (M.

The dominant motifs of these discussions are such fixtures of conventional policy analysis as eco\u00ad nomic efficiency and minimization of administrative costs and bur\u00ad dens. There is no apparent willingness to entertain the possibility that injuries associated with medical innovations might be somehow spe\u00ad cial, demanding a rethinking of society's obligations to those injured. The perspective seems to differ little from that of the English court which announced in 1788: \"It is better that an individual should sus\u00ad tain an injury than that the public should suffer an inconvenience.\"5 This essay proceeds from quite different premises. Taking seri\u00ad ously the contributions of the humanistic disciplines, it attempts a be\u00ad ginning synthesis of the social meaning of injuries associated with medical innovation and explores the implications of that synthesis for the formulation of public policy. The analysis challenges the moral and social values implicit in conventional legal and economic think\u00ad ing, particularly that associated with the law and economics school of thought. The essay concludes by proposing an alternative nonfault framework for compensation for certain medical injuries. While only the outline of this approach can be offered here, the proposal is set forth in the hope of stimulating further debate on how social and phil\u00ad osophical analysis can contribute to better law and public policy. The Social Context of Medical Innovation Stephen Toulmin has aptly characterized contemporary Ameri\u00ad can society as \"deliberately modernizing\" and \"progressive\" in its pursuit of technological innovation.6 While the pace of technological progress has, if anything, markedly accelerated since World War II, recent decades have also brought increased awareness of and concern for the risks entailed in our commitment to a technological way of life. We have come to see ourselves not only as the world's pioneers 3 Epstein, Legal Liability for Medical Innovation, 8 Cardozo L. Rev. 1139 (1987) (re\u00ad printed substantially from Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 163). 4 See, e.g., Danzon, Liability and Insurance for Medical Maloccurrences: Are Innova\u00ad tions Different?, in Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 219. 5 Russell v. The Men Dwelling in the County of Devon, 100 Eng. Rep. 359, 362 (1788). 6 Toulmin, Technological Progress and Social Policy: The Broader Significance of Medi\u00ad cal Mishaps, in Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 21. His elegant essay provides a powerful and much-needed reminder that sound analysis of potential societal responses\u2014including legal ones\u2014to the problem of injuries associated with technological innovation must be rooted in a careful assessment of the social and historical context in which the problem arises. 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1163 in technological innovation, but also as \"a nation of guinea pigs.\"7 Demands for action have rapidly followed expressions of concern. These demands were met in the 1960's and 1970's with new and ever\u00ad more expansive governmental regulatory efforts to control risks and prevent technological catastrophes. While political attitudes toward governmental regulation have since shifted course, the past decade has also witnessed widely publicized private litigation seeking com\u00ad pensation through the tort system when technological risks have re\u00ad sulted in massive injuries (and sometimes even when they have not, as at Three Mile Island). Occupational and environmental hazards in particular have been prolific sources of massive litigation in recent years. Such names as Love Canal, Three Mile Island, Agent Orange, asbestosis, and, still more recently, Bhopal and the space-shuttle Challenger have domi\u00ad nated the headlines and created powerful new images associated with our collective commitment to technology. We have become rather more skeptical in our attitudes toward both the corporate and the governmental purveyors of progress who have unleashed these terrors of modem life. We have sought perpetrators to blame and to hold accountable for the fearsome human and economic tolls imposed by these hazards. The tort system, through its well-established norms of negligence and more recently evolving concepts of strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities and defective products, has supplied a serviceable, if imperfect, legal means for identifying the responsible parties and for seeking redress from them. In so doing, it has pro\u00ad vided a mechanism for making certain \"risky technologies\" more fully bear their true social costs by imposing financial liability for the injuries caused, often in the absence of clear proof of fault or negli\u00ad gence in their traditional legal sense.8 Toulmin's remarks about technological innovation certainly ex\u00ad tend to and encompass medical research and, more broadly, innova\u00ad tive medical practices.9 Yet, in some ways medical progress is quite special, and perhaps unique, in the response it evokes from this soci\u00ad ety. American society is almost certainly more uniformly supportive and enthusiastic, and far less ambivalent, about technological innova\u00ad tions in medicine than in other spheres of economic activity. The rea\u00ad sons for this require fuller scholarly exploration in the directions 7 M. Shapo, A Nation of Guinea Pigs: The Unknown Risks of Chemical Technology (1979). 8 These costs may be reflected industrywide in higher charges for insurance or self-insur\u00ad ance and then passed on as some combination of lower returns to investors, lower wages for workers, and higher prices for consumers. 9 Toulmin, supra note 6. 1164 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 suggested by Toulmin,1 0 but some preliminary speculations may be in order here. Enthusiasm for medical innovation may be rooted in a pervasive, if not fully conscious, quest for immortality and denial of the inevita\u00ad bility of death. This enthusiasm is stoked by the sometimes over\u00ad stated public relations efforts on behalf of organized medicine and biomedical research, coupled with the often uncritical boosterism prevalent within some sectors of the popular communications me\u00ad dia. 1 1 Perhaps the organization of the medical profession\u2014the histor\u00ad ical (but rapidly changing) lack of for-profit corporate manifestations of Modem Medicine, Inc.\u2014helps to diffuse and defuse the anxieties generated by periodic reports of medical innovations gone awry. In\u00ad deed, the seeming exceptions\u2014the medical cases that have most dra\u00ad matically generated adverse public response, such as diethylstilbestrol (\"DES\") and the Daikon Shield\u2014may prove the rule, insofar as they represent medical products merchandised by for-profit corporations, rather than the sorts of innovative practice that arise in individual practioner-patient encounters. If so, the increasing concentration and corporatization of what is now termed the \"health care industry\" may well have its impact on the climate of public support for medical innovation.1 2 The basis for our society's enthusiasm about medical innovation might also be sought at a quite different, less instrumental, and per\u00ad haps more poetic level. Baruch Blumberg's evocative account of the Daedalus effect1 3 captures a particular image of the scientific and technological enterprise\u2014its insatiable quest for knowledge and un\u00ad derstanding as well as its sometimes unpredictable potential for in\u00ad creasing our power to influence, for good or ill, the natural world. Yet it also provides a moving description of certain aspects of the human spirit that we as a society have come to value most.

Who Cares?, 20 Clearinghouse Rev. 433, 433 (1986) (\"for-profit hospitals have a McDonald's approach to health care, viewing a hospital as no more than a money\u00ad making franchise\"). 1 3 Blumberg, The Scientific Process and the Development of Medical Innovation: The Daedalus Effect, in Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 35. Blumberg uses the term \"Daeda\u00ad lus effect\" to describe the learning processes involved in medical research and innovation. Like the inventor, Daedalus, of Greek mythology, scientists find: \"The more we know, the more we know about what we do not know, and the unknown must in turn be understood.\" Blumberg & Fox, The Daedalus Effect: Changes in Ethical Questions Relating to Hepatitis B Virus, 102 Annals Internal Med. 390, 390 (Mar. 1985). 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1165 Blumberg has indeed succeeded in providing a plausible secular ac\u00ad count of the ethos, and perhaps the telos, of our technological civiliza\u00ad tion, this consonance between scientific and broader secular values offers a powerful intrinsic and expressive justification for medical in\u00ad novation, quite apart from the more utilitarian considerations usually adduced on its behalf. One cannot reflect on the awe inspired by or\u00ad gan transplants, man's creation of a functioning artificial heart, or the development of novel means of human reproduction\u2014whatever their practical import or potentially troubling social consequences\u2014with\u00ad out concluding that Blumberg has captured something very important. These distinctive features of medical innovations, provide an es\u00ad sential social, historical, and cultural context for understanding ex\u00ad isting legal doctrines governing liability for medical injuries and for evaluating the prospects for future legal or institutional reforms. The law's own evolution has reflected changing societal perceptions, val\u00ad ues, and mores at least as much as it has been influenced by prescrip\u00ad tive economic theories or mechanical doctrinal analysis. Social and conceptual analysis, both of attitudes toward technological innovation in general and of those factors which differentiate medical innovations in particular, constitutes an important tool for assessing the possibili\u00ad ties and limits of legal and institutional change and the shape of those political compromises likely to prove necessary in transforming social or philosophical ideals into practical realities. The Regulatory and Moral Frameworks If we are prepared to conclude, on both instrumental and intrin\u00ad sic grounds, that medical innovation should and will go forward in American society, we must recognize the existence of the risks, and indeed the costs in human injuries and suffering, entailed in that com\u00ad mitment. One partial response to that inescapable fact seeks to mini\u00ad mize the costs of accidents by curtailing unjustifiably risky innovative activities. The imposition of various legal controls exemplifies that strategy. There is, of course, a long-running debate over which meth\u00ad ods of control are best, pitting adherents of direct intervention through governmental regulations against those who favor the less di\u00ad rect controls and incentives associated with the potential for tort lia\u00ad bility. That great debate cannot be resolved here, if indeed so theological a dispute is subject to resolution at all. Suffice it to say that neither approach seems likely to prevail exclusively, even in this era of deregulation. Nor could either approach do away with the problem of technological injuries without simultaneously closing 1166 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 down virtually all innovative activity. That outcome seems neither desirable nor plausible. What remains is the painful question of how we are to look after persons unwittingly injured as an unavoidable by-product of our quest for progress. Are those persons regretfully, yet firmly, to be left by the wayside as \"progress marches on\"? Or can and should we as a society find some way to share with them, in more than a theoretical sense, the collective benefits that accrue to the rest of us from our societal commitment to innovation\u2014the very commitment to which they were sacrificed? My approach is animated by two convictions: first, that it is right that we tax ourselves to provide for those from whose sacrifice we derive benefits;1 4 and second, that a prudent and enduring societal commitment to desirable innovative activity cannot be built on a foundation of bodies broken by our technological failures and then left in neglect. If we are to foster an environment conducive to continuing inno\u00ad vation in a just and honest society, two steps seem to me to be critical: first, an enhanced commitment to acquiring the data necessary to doc\u00ad ument and clarify the social costs, as well as the benefits, of our quest for technological progress; and second, the maintenance of public confidence in, and support for, the technological enterprise by treating its victims in a way that is, and is perceived as being, just and benevolent. With respect to medical innovations specifically, the first step en\u00ad compasses careful review and assessment of new medical technologies prior to their widespread and probably irreversible diffusion into rou\u00ad tine use. Numerous commentators have noted the very high propor\u00ad tion of currently accepted medical techniques that have never been adequately validated. They have stressed the difficulty, once the tech\u00ad nology has spread into common use, of finding ethically acceptable ways to subject those techniques to proper scientific tests of safety, of efficacy, and, in the current environment, of cost-effectiveness or cost- benefit as well. My own judgment is that we would do well to adopt a much more expansive system of postmarketing surveillance and eval\u00ad uation of drugs, medical devices, and innovative procedures. The adoption of such a system might, in fact, justify some adjustments to the Food and Drug Administration's current initial review process, 14 I do not mean to suggest that our obligations can necessarily be satisfied exclusively through the payment of money. But in a society like our own, money is the measure of most, if not all, things, including redress for physical injury. Those who would deny the provision of financial compensation to the injured should bear the burden of justifying an alternative approach. 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNO VA TION: A RESPONSE 1167 with its widely decried regulatory delays, by establishing a system more capable of identifying and following up on potential side effects, including those with long latency periods, that might not adequately be recognized initially. The nonfault mechanism for compensation that I will discuss later would, as one of its important secondary ef\u00ad fects, provide a useful vehicle for generating and keeping track of such data. The second step invokes the social analysis developed previously. On that analysis, continuing public support for medical innovation ultimately will, and probably should, depend upon the creation and fostering of a shared sense that we are, indeed, coventurers on a promising yet risky voyage of discovery, and that we are mutually committed both to sharing the benefits equitably and to spreading the losses associated with injuries to individual victims. Means as well as ends are significant to making this symbolism work: to be effective, the process should reflect a helping and communal rather than a mean and adversarial spirit. It is precisely this communal element that I find most lacking in much of the relevant law and economics literature. In a society as stable and wealthy as our own, we need not resort to lifeboat ethics; there is no compelling need to jettison the injured. It is fundamentally a question of will, and of political, moral, and intellectual leadership, for our society to commit itself to realizing more fully those aspects of human sympathy, connectedness, and as\u00ad pirations for community that have long been enshrined in both our religious traditions and our secular ideals. Those claiming such lead\u00ad ership\u2014including scholars and intellectuals\u2014cannot responsibly ig\u00ad nore difficult issues of equity and fairness, or consider questions of distribution of benefits and burdens irrelevant, in a quest for a theoret\u00ad ically optimal assignment of liability for accidents. Considerations of equity and fairness are central to the task of law in a democratic soci\u00ad ety. They should play a far greater role in shaping both our moral analysis and our public policy. These concerns are especially compelling in the context of medi\u00ad cal innovation specifically, and medical care more generally. Health and illness involve many fundamental human values and elicit pre\u00ad cisely the core connections of family, community, and therapeutic al\u00ad liance previously highlighted. Medical care thus provides a unique setting and opportunity for establishing and reinforcing these ties as a model for broader application throughout the society. The point can be made negatively as well. We are all aware of the malignant growth of a new adversarial ethic within our system of medical care. Concerned with the rising tide of malpractice litigation, 1168 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 many physicians increasingly view their patients as potential adversa\u00ad ries.1 5 Some act accordingly, striving to minimize their potential lia\u00ad bility, not necessarily in the fashion contemplated by proponents of improved quality of care. While the extent of the phenomenon is diffi\u00ad cult to document or quantify, this concern with liability is believed to result in a variety of defensive practices engaged in principally \"for the record\" rather than for the well-being of the patient. Such prac\u00ad tices impose unwarranted additional risks on the patient, as well as adding significantly to the cost of medical care.1 6 We would do well to reexamine any legal doctrine that encourages such practices. In my view, we should move far more rapidly to explore alterna\u00ad tive legal models that would reinforce, rather than undermine, those venerable medical traditions encouraging physicians to act as patient advocates rather than as potential adversaries of the patient. No legal regime is likely to eliminate all instances of gross incompetence or recklessness in medicine or in any other sphere of human conduct. In such cases, serious misconduct by the physician will and should con\u00ad tinue to play some role in any plausible system of legal responsibility. But this need can be accommodated without necessarily retaining those elements of the present negligence/malpractice system that are threatening the very foundations of the physician-patient relationship. To be sure, creating an alternative to the present system will en\u00ad tail formidable administrative burdens and, most likely, economic costs; these must be carefully assessed and weighed in any ultimate calculus regarding significant legal reforms. Yet, just as considera\u00ad tions of economic efficiency and administrative practicability should not be left out of that calculus, neither should the harder-to-quantify social and moral concerns. Too often such concerns are omitted from the analysis, perhaps because acknowledging their presence would make uncomfortably explicit the necessity for controversial value choices. But such choices cannot be escaped, although some appar\u00ad ently believe that they can be obscured behind a facade of seeming scientific objectivity. How, then, should we approach the questions of whether and how to provide compensation to victims of our quest for medical pro\u00ad gress? The essay by Richard Epstein1 7 focuses primarily, indeed al\u00ad 15 See, e.g., 1975 Wis. Laws ch. 37, \u00a7 l(e)(\"The rising number of [medical malpractice] suits and claims is forcing both individual and institutional health care providers to practice defensively, to the detriment of the health care provider and the patient.\"). 16 \"(HJealth care providers are often required, for their own protection, to employ exten\u00ad sive diagnostic procedures for their patients, thereby increasing the cost of patient care.\" Id. \u00a7 1(f)- 17 Epstein, INNOVA TION: A RESPONSE 1169 most entirely, on remedies afforded by the existing tort system, with particular reference to theories of negligence and strict liability. But such theories sidestep the central issue\u2014 that the risk of injury is in\u00ad herent in medical innovation, even when the innovative practice is conducted most carefully, with full attention to available knowledge, appropriate technique, and proper involvement of patients in the in\u00ad formed consent process. Injuries can and do occur without negli\u00ad gence, without apparent defect. If we nonetheless are convinced, after careful reflection on some shared vision of a just and progressive soci\u00ad ety, that compensation should be provided when the inherent risks of the innovative enterprise miscarry, then we can fairly (indeed, tauto\u00ad logically) conclude that the theories of recovery embodied in the ex\u00ad isting tort law fail to conform to these considered moral beliefs. Thus, they may constitute morally as well as practically inadequate vehicles for providing such compensation. The next section of this essay ex\u00ad plores how we and our system of tort law have come to this impasse. The Irreconcilable Claims of Compensation and Tort Doctrine The Legal Setting Tort law, rather like classical drama, is characterized by certain fundamental unities, by confrontations in direct and relatively un\u00ad mediated fashion between a victim and a tortfeasor in the setting of an isolated moral drama. Within that drama, the victim must demon\u00ad strate how the tortfeasor's actions caused his or her injury and why the costs associated with that injury should be shifted from the victim to the person who caused the injury. Although the fundamental structure of this drama has remained relatively fixed, the legal principles that have been applied within it have evolved significantly over time. While historians continue to de\u00ad bate the particularities of given incidents, few would dispute that changes in legal doctrine have both influenced and reflected broader economic, political, and ideological tendencies, including changing social values and constructions of reality, within given societies. In England, the classic articulation of principles of strict liability arose in a dispute pitting a member of the emerging industrial sector against the entrenched interests of the landholding aristocracy. Attempts to explain the result in terms of the social and class backgrounds of the judges have been persuasively challenged; but the weaker claim, that the result is consonant with, and perhaps best explained by, more 1170 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 widespread English social values, retains its power.1 8 In the United States, the evolution of the industrial system and the rise of the railroad in the mid- to late-nineteenth century pro\u00ad foundly influenced the law's commitment to negligence principles, generally favoring the emerging capitalist class and fostering the na\u00ad tion's realization of its \"Manifest Destiny.\" Once the nation's infra\u00ad structure was established and some of the destructive social con\u00ad sequences of this course became increasingly visible (in the form of industrial and other accidents), and as political alignments began to shift, significant countertrends in the law emerged. This development was perhaps most evident in the early part of the twentieth century, as successive state legislatures enacted statu\u00ad tory compensation programs for injured workers. These programs abandoned fault as the predicate for employer liability and abrogated what were termed the \"unholy trinity\" of tort defenses\u2014notably, most instances of contributory negligence and assumption-of-risk, as well as the fellow-servant rule\u2014which had previously posed formida\u00ad ble obstacles to recoveries by injured workers. In more recent decades, principles of strict liability have come to predominate over negligence for abnormally dangerous activities, and especially for defective products. The defenses of contributory negli\u00ad gence and assumption-of-risk have been substantially narrowed or eliminated. Indeed, much has changed, probably far too much for those who saw in the fabric of prior tort doctrine an economically, socially, or morally optimal interweaving of certain traditional legal goals and concerns. As that fabric has been rent by legal develop\u00ad ments over the past century, particularly those in recent decades, it has become increasingly difficult to identify, let alone to preserve, the integrity of traditional tort doctrine. The point is hardly a new one. As torts scholar John Fleming argued in a celebrated article a quarter-century ago: In certain periods of the past, particularly during the nineteenth century, these apprehensions were accorded the fullest recognition in the interest of an acquisitive society bent on expansion and in\u00ad clined to make light of the incidental cost to human and material assets. The subordination of the individual's security was deemed a necessary toll for achieving the more valuable goal of rapid in\u00ad dustrial development and exploitation of the seemingly inexhaust\u00ad ible store of available resources. If injuries went without redress, it 18 Rylands v. Fletcher, 3 L.R.-E. & I. App. 330 (1868). See C. Morris & C.R. Morris, Jr., Morris on Torts 232-33 (2d ed. 1980); Bohlen, The Rule in Rylands v.

Rev. 266 (1942). 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNO VA TION: A RESPONSE 1171 was but the victim's admission fee to participation in the larger benefits secured by advancing civilization . . . . But with the pas\u00ad sage of time, these social postulates have undergone a drastic revi\u00ad sion. The individualistic fault dogma is being eroded by the mid\u00ad twentieth century quest for social security, the welfare state replac\u00ad ing an outmoded order where man was expected and encouraged to fend for himself. Enhanced social consciousness has today led to the broad acceptance of the view that society can no longer af\u00ad ford to turn its back on the hapless victims of disaster or accident, leaving us only with the practical task of devising the economically least burdensome methods for redressing or mitigating their misfortune.1 9 The Epstein Proposal Richard Epstein's analysis of the duty to warn of risks associated with biomedical innovations, and his urging that medical profession\u00ad als and manufacturers of health care products be substantially insu\u00ad lated from potential liability so long as they recite government- approved warnings to patients and product users, must be evaluated against this background. As I understand Epstein's proposal,2 0 formal disclosure-of-risk statements would be reviewed and approved, or perhaps drafted in the first instance, by the government and recited to all potential patients, with appropriate written documentation. This process would create a legal safe harbor for medical innovations in the event of bad outcomes for particular patients. The responsibilities of the medical team would apparently be satisfied, virtually in their entirety, by compliance with this duty to warn. Expressed somewhat differently, the patient would be considered to have assumed the risk of the medical innovation and would therefore be disqualified, as a matter of law, from pursuing compensation through the legal system. The proposal is certainly a logical and coherent one, and it may seem particularly compelling to those not acquainted with the infa\u00ad mous history of the assumption-of-risk defense and the evolution of objections to it over the decades. As already noted, this defense played a prominent\u2014perhaps preeminent\u2014role in defeating the tort claims of injured workers against their employers (including employ\u00ad ers who negligently maintained unsafe working conditions) in the nineteenth century. The revulsion it aroused helped to stimulate suc\u00ad cessful efforts to oust common law tort principles from the workplace 19 Fleming, The Passing of Polemis, 39 Can. B. Rev. 489, 505-06 (1961). 20 Epstein, supra note 3. 1172 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 in favor of a nonfault-based system of workers' compensation. In other settings as well, the scope of the assumption-of-risk doctrine has been eroded steadily over succeeding decades. In recent years, most courts have discarded the doctrine almost entirely. What remains via\u00ad ble as a defense\u2014at least in the negligence setting\u2014are those unrea\u00ad sonable volitional decisions properly regarded as contributory or comparative negligence. Those decisions bear little resemblance to decisions by patients to follow their doctors' advice regarding innova\u00ad tive therapies. The legal system has thus moved firmly and consist\u00ad ently over many decades to reject precisely that doctrine which Epstein seeks to rehabilitate in modern guise. The rejection rests on a widely shared and well-founded perception that the assumption-of- risk defense is readily susceptible to being\u2014and often has been\u2014in\u00ad voked unfairly and unrealistically to deny the socially mandated com\u00ad pensatory goals of the tort system. Any broad reassertion of the defense must bear the heavy burden of responding to these arguments from history and policy. The role of the duty to warn, and correspondingly of a narrower conception of express assumption-of-risk following adequate warn\u00ad ings, has evolved somewhat differently in the context of product-re\u00ad lated injuries, in which principles of strict liability rather than negligence have come to predominate. In limited circumstances, pri\u00ad marily those in which product defects cannot reasonably be prevented without destroying the utility of the product, courts have permitted manufacturers to satisfy their legal duties by providing adequate warnings to consumers. It would, however, be a considerable over\u00ad simplification to suggest\u2014as Epstein's proposal seems to do\u2014 that risk disclosure does or should serve in all instances as a full and com\u00ad plete substitute for making products adequately safe in the first in\u00ad stance. The implicit suggestion that medical innovators should be insulated from tort liability for defective innovations (and perhaps even for negligence in choosing to go forward with unduly risky inno\u00ad vations) solely on the basis of a government-certified warning simply cannot be reconciled with the thrust of recent developments in tort law. Such developments are amply supported by legal and policy jus\u00ad tifications set forth in detail in numerous judicial opinions and schol\u00ad arly treatises. And one cannot help noting in passing the endearing trust in governmental omnipotence inherent in the proposal's reliance on the government-authored or -approved disclosure statements, a trust not always associated with either the law and economics move\u00ad ment or with lawyers or economists making their intellectual home at the University of Chicago. Even unreconstructed New Dealers might 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNO VA TION: A RESPONSE 1173 have some difficulty mustering such enthusiasm following the swine flu experience.2 1 Finally, it is worth drawing an explicit comparison between the conceptions of risk disclosure and assumption-of-risk set forth by Ep\u00ad stein and the evolving doctrine of informed consent as applied to med\u00ad ical treatment and research. The legal doctrine of informed consent has developed in response to powerful social and judicial perceptions of unequal knowledge and power in the physician-patient and investi\u00ad gator-subject relationships. The doctrine is intended as a source of enhanced protection for the patient-subject's well-being and auton\u00ad omy and is properly understood as a necessary, but not sufficient, con\u00ad dition for therapeutic or research interventions. The informed consent of the patient will not necessarily excuse a negligent treat\u00ad ment recommendation by the physician. Nor, in the research setting, will the subject's informed consent legally justify the conduct of re\u00ad search properly rejected by an institutional review board on scientific or risk-benefit grounds. Respect for autonomy is indeed an important value, but it is not the only value in medical or research settings. Fur\u00ad ther, there are numerous reasons for concern about the adequacy of existing informed consent processes, particularly in the context of medical innovations. Epstein's proposal would do little to allay these general concerns and would transform informed consent from an ad\u00ad ded layer of protection for patients' interests into a weapon to be used against them in the event of injury.2 2 To justify this step on the 21 President Ford's well-meaning public health initiative turned into a public policy fiasco following the occurrence of several widely reported deaths and numerous instances of paralysis attributed to vaccine-induced Guillain-Barre Syndrome. This risk was not disclosed in the informed consent document prepared, reviewed and approved by the federal government. The swine flu program spawned massive litigation against the federal government, which assumed certain liabilities pursuant to the National Swine Flu Immunization Program of 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-380, 90 Stat. 1113. See also N.Y. Times, Dec. 31, 1976, at A8, col. 6, for a description of the immediate rush of claims brought against the federal government for damages resulting from the vaccination. The federal government's failure to establish a satisfactory mechanism for resolving claims outside the tort law system may well have contributed to the litigative aspects of this policy fiasco. For a scholarly account of this fascinating saga, see R. Neustadt & H. Fineberg, The Epidemic That Never Was: Policy-Making & the Swine Flu Affair (1983). See generally Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States, Compensation for Vaccine-Related Injuries: A Technical Memorandum (Nov. 1980) (establishing a compen\u00ad sation program is desirable, but there are many problems that Congress must confront in de\u00ad veloping such a program); A Review of Selected Federal Vaccine and Immunization Policies (Sept. 1979) (making various findings concerning vaccines' risks to users and posing policy options geared to ameliorate those risks). 22 It must, of course, be recognized that under some extraordinary conditions, recourse even to dangerous and relatively untried innovations may be urgently desired by both physi\u00ad cian and fully informed patient. The requirement of compensation for known risks may im\u00ad pose unsustainable costs on the process and perhaps go beyond any social consensus favoring its provision. The implantation of artificial hearts in desperately ill, imminently dying patients 1174 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 ground that the patient, rather than the physician, or researcher, or manufacturer, is somehow better situated to make the scientific risk- benefit calculations regarding use of the product or innovation is to turn the behavioral assumptions underlying informed consent on their heads with no logical or empirical support whatever.2 3 may provide an example, although hardly one free of controversy in its own right. In such highly unusual circumstances, there may be a more persuasive, although still troubling, case for relying on concepts of risk disclosure, informed consent, and the assumption of certain risks of uncompensated bad outcomes. That case, however, must be balanced against the seri\u00ad ous concern that this approach would unduly promote the premature application of untested technologies to desperate patients. Even then, one would need to engage in a far more searching process of disclosure and consent than has characterized even some of the most highly publicized innovations in recent medical history. One might usefully contrast the distressingly limited nature of the informed consent process in Christiaan Barnard's early heart transplants or in Denton Cooley's implan\u00ad tation of an artificial heart in Haskell Karp with the far more extensive, although still imper\u00ad fect, educational process developed for Barney Clark at the University of Utah. For documentation and masterful analyses of the failings of informed consent in the early heart cases, see R. Fox & J. Swazey, The Courage to Fail: A Social View of Organ Transplants and Dialysis 135-97 (2d rev. ed. 1978); J. Katz, The Silent World of Doctor and Patient (1984). See also Annas, Consent to the Artifical Heart: The Lion and the Crocodiles, 13 Hastings Center Report 20 (1983). Whether such extraordinary cases are sufficiently frequent or compelling to justify the elaboration of a different set of compensation rules and procedures, or to incur the administra\u00ad tive costs and burdens of resolving problematic issues of classification, is a difficult problem, defying armchair empiricism. Perhaps within this quite limited sphere, Epstein's proclivity for contractual solutions might find its most persuasive application. 23 Epstein defends his reliance on the assumption-of-risk defense by asserting that \"the defense is required by the principle of individual autonomy\" and that what he identifies as \"the weakness of the defense,\" namely, the risk of imperfect information, can be corrected by gov\u00ad ernment-approved warnings. Epstein, supra note 3, at 1146 n.10. I disagree on both counts. To be sure, the assumption-of-risk defense bears some relationship to powerful principles of individual autonomy and personal responsibilty for one's own actions. But it does not fol\u00ad low that the defense is \"required\" by these principles. As a society, we have long distinguished our legal responses to some exercises of autonomy\u2014for example, decisions by explorers and adventurers to scale mountain peaks, parachute from tall structures, or encounter obvious risks of amusement park rides\u2014from certain other important life choices, most notably deci\u00ad sions by workers to encounter known risks of hazardous lines of employment. We have also marked an important distinction in permitting individuals to embark upon dangerous courses of action while constraining their ability to relinquish certain protections provided by law. The workplace example is again instructive: We respect the freedom of individuals to choose a hazardous line of work (and to contract for \"risk premiums\" increasing their remuneration) but do not generally permit employers and employees to \"contract out\" of socially mandated compensation programs in the event these risks eventuate in injuries. Thus, even when we believe fairness ex ante has been approximated, we retain a social interest in the fairness of outcomes ex post. Further, there is little reason to believe that this felt social commitment would be abro\u00ad gated by improved warnings. One may fairly doubt whether the erection of large signs read\u00ad ing, \"Abandon hope all ye who enter here,\" over the entrance gates of factories\u2014or hospitals and clinics\u2014would or should serve to immunize those who cause injuries from potential liabil\u00ad ity. The argument that informed participation in contemporary civilization necessarily consti\u00ad tutes an assumption of all the risks inherent in modem life simply does not extend so far. Thus, contrary to Epstein's suggestion, the risk of imperfect information has not been the 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1175 This theoretical analysis is perhaps best illustrated by discussion of an actual case, and a case mentioned by Epstein provides as good an example as any. Reyes v . Wyeth Laboratories2 4 involved a lawsuit on behalf of a young girl who developed polio after having been given the oral polio vaccine. While a good deal of expert testimony sug\u00ad gested that the girl had contracted a wild strain of polio, one unre\u00ad lated to the vaccine, the girl's physician testified otherwise. The physician's testimony apparently was convincing to the jury, which found for the plaintiff and awarded substantial damages against the manufacturer of the vaccine. The verdict was predicated on a failure- to-warn theory, not on allegations that the vaccine was negligently manufactured. The verdict favoring recovery was upheld by the ap\u00ad pellate court in an opinion by Judge John Minor Wisdom. sole, or necessarily even the primary, weakness of the assumption-of-risk defense. The troub\u00ad ling issues have not concerned whether the isolated (even if fully informed) individual autono\u00ad mously accepts the terms of a proffered bargain; they have involved the substantive terms of that bargain, how those terms are set, and the context in which the decision is made. While the multifarious settings in which these questions have arisen have proved recalcitrant to any overarching theoretical formulation, the courts have been alert to disparities in power and bargaining position, the possibilities of overreaching and abuse by the stronger party, the de\u00ad pendency of the weaker party, and the nature and importance of the interests at stake. Here, as elsewhere, the law has proceeded case by case, reflecting societal perceptions and values. The question for us is where to place the situation of endangered patients along these several axes. The persons we are talking about here\u2014patients confronting difficult choices about inno\u00ad vative therapies\u2014often face limited, unpleasant, and sometimes dismal alternatives and must make choices under constraints imposed by their disease and limits of available knowledge and technology. It does not follow that their decisions are necessarily involuntary or coerced or lacking in autonomy, or that these individuals should not be able to choose. But one may well ask how their exercise of autonomy compares to the idealized image of adventurers deciding whether to assault a dangerous mountain. The real issue is how the choices put to them are most justly framed. In such circumstances, society may well wish to say, \"the decision whether to accept the risks of physical injury is and must be your own, but the decision whether any injury must go uncompensated need not be implicated in your decision and is properly a matter for social choice.\" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\"NASA\") might well have been able to recruit astronauts interested in a one-way trip to the moon, or willing, as a condition of employment, to sign away any claims for injury or death in the event of an accident. Such a practice may well save the government money, and it would respect the autonomy of the participants. I suspect most of us would not endorse such an arrangement, viewing it as un\u00ad necessary and incompatible with our social ideals. Just as we would be reluctant to ask such an unnecessary sacrifice from an astronaut, so we might conclude, for the reasons discussed here, that it would be a poor idea to demand such a sacrifice from participants in innovative medical activities. Or we might not. But that is the question for decision. Ritual incantations of individual autonomy and the principle of assumption of risk beg that question, they do not answer it. (This paragraph was written prior to the space shuttle Challenger disaster and its sequelae. The willingness of NASA to reach private settlements with several of the astronauts' families, despite formidable legal obstacles facing the claimants, would seem to support the analysis here.) 2\" 498 F.2d 1264 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 419 U.S. 1096 (1974). 1176 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 Judge Wisdom's decision has been the subject of much scholarly commentary,2 5 and I am not surprised that Epstein, as the editor of a renowned torts casebook, takes the legal doctrine of the case seri\u00ad ously. That is entirely appropriate: The Reyes case and others that have followed it have transformed the legal environment in which vaccines are manufactured and distributed. The doctrine deserves to be taken seriously, and I agree with Epstein's conclusion that, for bet\u00ad ter or worse, the legal principles enunciated in Judge Wisdom's opin\u00ad ion mark a departure from prior tort law.2 6 What I find more remarkable, however, is what is left out of Epstein's discussion; namely, some account of our societal response, as reflected through the legal system, to the plight of a young girl afflicted with polio. Per\u00ad haps Judge Wisdom's novel legal analysis was prompted by his own human response to the failure of conventional legal doctrine to pro\u00ad vide an adequate remedy. On this view of the case, the central issue was not the theoretical \"economics of information transfer,\" but the very real plight of the individual in need and the lack of other mecha\u00ad nisms to help her. Two passages in the opinion support this reading. First, there is an explicit judicial recognition that other, arguably more appropriate, responses are unavailable: It can also be argued, of course, that since all society benefits from universal immunization against infectious disease, the loss should be borne by the local, state or federal government. Unless the doc\u00ad trine of sovereign immunity is significantly altered, however, such a loss distribution scheme does not appear to be likely.2 7 Second, Judge Wisdom sets forth an explicit, although hardly un- controversial, view of the appropriate role of courts and judge-made common law in such circumstances: \"Until Americans have a comprehensive scheme of social insur\u00ad ance, courts must resolve by a balancing process the head-on colli\u00ad sion between the need for adequate recovery and viable enterprises.\" .. .[A] strong argument can be advanced that the loss 25 See R. Epstein, Modern Products Liability Law 100, 107-10 (1980) (warning should not be required and even if warning was required, it would be difficult to formulate the standard for adequate warning); Franklin & Mais, Tort Law and Mass Immunization Programs: Les\u00ad sons from the Polio and Flu Episodes, 65 Calif. L. Rev. 754, 761 (1977) (The Reyes court failed to consider: (1) if other vaccines were available; (2) that the plaintiff's child was vaccinated during a polio outbreak; and (3) if an alternative vaccine had been available, the warning still may not have caused plaintiff to choose an alternative vaccine.); Twerski, Weinstein, Donaher & Piehler, The Use and Abuse of Warning in Products Liability\u2014Design Defect Litigation Comes of Age, 61 Cornell L. Rev. 494, 519 (1976) (\"The . . .

But that, I believe, would miss the point. Whatever academic commentators think of Judge Wisdom's modifica\u00ad tion of prior tort doctrine, other judges have followed and, indeed, extended his lead.2 9 The entire episode exemplifies the transformation of modem tort law from a system that often seemed designed to man\u00ad ufacture obstacles to recovery by injured victims toward a system in\u00ad creasingly determined to provide compensation to the injured and to spread the losses associated with the risks of our technological way of life. The modem system represents, at the least, a different balancing of the multiple objectives of a tort law system. This new primacy of the compensaton objective and the downgrading in salience of tradi\u00ad tional concepts of fault reflect changing perceptions by both the legal profession and the society at large. In the modem period, \"[p]ublic convenience does not outweigh individual compensation.\"3 0 Implications If this analysis is correct, then repeated calls for a return to the true faith, to the integrity of traditional tort doctrine, are simply out of step with evolving social norms favoring more expansive compensa\u00ad tion. Efforts to yoke the two together within the tort framework are doomed to incoherence. That is not to say that tort law should be abandoned in favor of an all-purpose nonfault compensation system, or even to assert that 28 Id. at 1294 (quoting Helene Curtis Indus, v. Pruitt, 385 F.2d 841, 862 (5th Cir. 1967), cert, denied, 391 U.S. 913 (1968)). 29 See Petty v. United States, 740 F.2d 1428 (8th Cir. 1984). The court presumed that if the plaintiff receiving the swine flu vaccine had been adequately warned, he would have acted to minimize his risk. Correspondingly, the court \"imposed [a duty to warn] on the manufacturer and in a mass-immunization context, where there is no learned intermediary, the duty ex\u00ad tended] to the ultimate recipient of the vaccine.\" Id. at 1440. See also Givens v. Lederle, 556 F.2d 1341, 1345 (5th Cir. 1977) (jury could conclude that the manufacturer's warning that there was a one in a 3 million chance of contracting polio from the vaccine was inadequate because this statement of risk leaves the \"distinct impression\" that there is no risk at all); Dalke v. Upjohn Co., 555 F.2d 245, 247-48 (9th Cir. 1977) (physician's affidavit that he proba\u00ad bly would have chosen a different drug if the manufacturer provided a more stringent warning constituted sufficient evidence for the plaintiff to reach the jury in an action against the manufacturer). 3\u00b0 Muskopf v.

(1961) (emphasis added). 1178 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 Judge Wisdom's resolution of the Reyes case represents the socially ideal resolution of the problem of vaccine injuries. I do not believe that Judge Wisdom's imposition of liability on the vaccine manufac\u00ad turer for failure to meet a nearly impossible to satisfy duty to warn achieves any such ideal, either with respect to vaccine injuries specifi\u00ad cally, or to injuries associated with medical innovations more gener\u00ad ally (nor, I suspect, does Judge Wisdom). At a doctrinal level, I consider this legal innovation to be questionable, at least as a perma\u00ad nent fixture. But I am also inclined to see additional layers of mean\u00ad ing in Judge Wisdom's approach. His decision gives powerful voice to evolving societal attitudes toward the compensation objective. Still more significantly, it prods other potential actors in this drama\u2014such as health officials, legislators, pharmaceutical companies, and repre\u00ad sentatives of the insurance industry\u2014to take the problem of vaccine injuries more seriously, thereby spurring development of alternative, and probably preferable, means of providing compensation.3 1 Indeed, many commentators with diverse ideological perspectives now seem to agree on the desirability and practicality of a nonfault mechanism for compensating vaccine injuries;3 2 and Congress has recently en\u00ad acted such legislation.3 3 One may doubt whether this congruence could or would have been achieved in the absence of Judge Wisdom's departure from conventional wisdom in Reyes. Similarly, other re\u00ad cent doctrinal innovations in tort law may best be understood as tem\u00ad porary, but nonetheless necessary, prods to rethink conventional modes of dealing with compensation for accidental injuries, particu\u00ad larly those associated with technological innovations.3 4 31 Some pharmaceutical companies have responded to the expanded potential for tort lia\u00ad bility by withdrawing from the manufacture of one or more vaccines. The resulting threat to the availability of vaccines has served to place the compensation issue high on the agenda of public health and other government officials and undoubtedly contributed to the adoption of an alternative statutory compensation scheme. See infra note 33. While the path is perhaps more circuitous than might have been anticipated at the time of Judge Wisdom's decision, the destination is the same. 32 See, e.g., Note, The Necessary Complement to Mandatory Immunizations: A National Vaccination Compensation Program, 8 Cardozo L. Rev. 137 (1986). 33 National Childhood Vaccine-Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, \u00a7 311. The newly enacted legislation is not the panacea that it might appear to be. Although the Act cleared Congress on Oct. 18, 1986, and was signed into law by the President on Nov. 14, 1986, the \"compensation system will not take effect until Congress devises a funding mechanism.\" Cong. Q. Weekly Rep., at 2920 (Nov. 15, 1986). Further implementation has not, to date, been forthcoming. 34 Epstein appears to misapprehend the point of my argument here, and some response may help to clarify the nature, and limits, of our disagreement. Epstein, supra note 3, at 1151 n.21. My point is expressly not that the substantive rule of law announced by Judge Wisdom in Reyes and followed in subsequent cases constitutes the ideal permanent resolution to the prob- 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1179 lem of vaccine injuries. Indeed, I am inclined to agree with Epstein's observation that, under this approach, \"the theory of improper warnings becomes an elaborate, expensive, and erratic pretext for compensation for bad outcomes alone.\" Id. at 1150. My difference with Epstein concerns what should flow from that observation. Epstein bemoans the bias of the \"modem common law . . . intensifed by the discretion left to juries, toward finding all warnings inade\u00ad quate when judged by the standard of hindsight,\" id., but he never seems to consider just why judges, juries, and indeed the \"modem common law\" might be drawn to this result, or whether they might be trying to tell us something worth hearing. In particular, they may be reflecting a social judgment that in such circumstances \"bad outcomes alone\" ought to be compensated, although perhaps not at exorbitant levels. In the absence of a simple, honest, and straightfor\u00ad ward program designed to provide such compensation outside the tort system, the use of \"pre\u00ad texts\" within that system may be about the best common law can provide. The genius of Judge Wisdom's resolution is that it does more than that; it shifts the bur\u00ad den of seeking a sensible legislative resolution away from isolated and largely powerless injured plaintiffs (and trial lawyers who may have their own reasons for resisting an administrative compensation program) to potential defendants\u2014pharmaceutical companies and the insurance industry\u2014who are far better situated to place the matter high on the legislative agenda. My defense of Judge Wisdom's approach thus rests not only on its provision of an imperfect, second-best remedy for individual plaintiffs, but on an appreciation of its dynamic potential to stimulate additional desirable changes in the law. I quite agree with Epstein that if Epstein's separate arguments against the creation of a nonfault compensation system for injuries associ\u00ad ated with medical innovations are heeded (and applied to the vaccine context), and if pharma\u00ad ceutical companies respond to a continuation of the existing legal regime by withdrawing from the vaccine market, injurious social consequences will follow. That, for me, is an argument in favor of a nonfault compensation system, and not an argument against Judge Wisdom's at\u00ad tempt to prod government policymakers toward resolving these issues. It is perhaps worth noting in passing, with respect to the withdrawal of some pharmaceu\u00ad tical manufacturers and insurers from the vaccine market, that Epstein's interesting analysis of the economic basis for this phenomenon is no less speculative than an alternative hypothesis. That hypothesis would view these highly publicized actions as carefully considered elements of a longer-term political strategy designed to frighten and intimidate policymakers, physicians, and the public into reshaping the governing legal regime into a configuration limiting potential liability and precluding injured victims from seeking even such redress as is now erratically available. Recent events suggest that such a strategy, if it exists, has found a receptive environ\u00ad ment in the current political climate. Finally, Epstein's comments regarding the so-called \"we-they\" dimension of the vaccine- injury problem once again obscure the distinction between ex ante and ex post analysis. Judged after the fact, it is simply not true that, in the absence of compensation, \"reducing the overall level of illness leaves everyone better off.\" Id. at 1151 n.18. Those few who would not have developed the disease and who take the vaccine, suffer a vaccine injury, and are not compensated, are not better off after the fact. The critical issue is not, as Epstein suggests, the individual' s choice \"between a 10% chance of the natural disease and a 0.1% chance of vac\u00ad cine injury.\" Id. Rather, it is the social choice with respect to our responsibilities toward that unfortunate 0.1%: Should we as a society, who benefit after the fact from this and other medi\u00ad cal innovations, share some small portion of the value of our real benefits with those who might have benefited, but who in fact suffered real injuries? Further, if the test is minimization of avoidable injuries and illness, as Epstein seems to suggest, a public health program coupled with an adequate nonfault compensation mechanism would most likely secure greater public participation and accompanying public health benefits (although probably at greater budgetary cost) than the legal regime advocated by Epstein, which rests on the asserted desirability of putting worried parents to an unnecessary choice between foregoing an apparently beneficial vaccine or accepting risks not only of serious possible injury to their children, but of social abandonment all in the name of \"respecting their autonomy.\" 1180 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 Contrast with this analysis Epstein's (or Danzon's3 5 ) alternative approach based on the theory of \"ex ante consent and assumption of risk\" or of \"the optimal economics of information transfer.\" Does it not strain credulity to believe that an educational informed consent campaign would, or should, discourage large numbers of children, or their parents, from participating in immunization programs\u2014particu\u00ad larly when participation is publicly mandated or legally required for entry into schools? In such cases, to deny compensation for known risks of immunization on grounds of assumption of risk is to push beyond legal fiction into the realm of collective fantasy. The relevant question is whether we are prepared to assume and spread the costs of socially desirable activites\u2014public health immunization programs specifically, or medical innovations more generally\u2014or whether we instead insist upon visiting not only the unavoidable physical injuries, but their financial consequences as well, on random victims who have done nothing worse than to follow the advice of their physicians and their government\u2014and then to add insult to injury by blaming them for doing so. That is, I fear, what the alternative approach comes down to. It is an approach we must reject, even if that rejection is not economically \"optimal.\" Toward a Modest Proposal Most analysts of the tort system believe that it does, and should, serve important social purposes in addition to providing compensa\u00ad tion to injured victims; some argue that these other goals should predominate. The system should provide, inter alia, appropriate in\u00ad centives for safety (what Dean Calabresi has called the \"maximum reduction of the sum of accident costs and the costs of avoiding acci\u00ad dents that can be accomplished in a just way\"3 6 ), a means for social expression of the priority of safety goals, and a vehicle for holding morally and financially accountable those who engage in unaccept\u00ad ably risky and antisocial conduct. These goals are important, but under modem conditions they are increasingly at war with emerging social attitudes favoring compensation. Any single system aimed at pursuing all these goals simultaneously is likely to become intolerably complex, convoluted, and chaotic. In the view of many, that is an apt characterization of the current state of tort law. Perhaps the time has come to ask some fundamental questions and to contemplate proposals for systemic reform of the tort-law sys- 35 See Danzon, supra note 4. 36 G. Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents: A Legal and Economic Analysis 31 (1970). 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1181 tern?7 Such proposals may offer the last, best hope of meeting simul\u00ad taneously our felt obligations to provide compensation to injured victims in accordance with current social values and to afford a con\u00ad text within which the other important purposes of tort law can be pursued effectively and with intellectual and practical coherence. Such proposals may also offer greater promise of successfully address\u00ad ing the special characteristics of maloccurrences associated with med\u00ad ical innovations than the more traditional tort theories discussed by Epstein. What I want to suggest is that the integrity of tort doctrine will remain endangered so long as we fail to provide some adequate alter\u00ad native means, consistent with evolving norms of basic decency and human dignity, for meeting the needs of seriously injured persons thought to deserve redress. If we remain wedded to the classical uni\u00ad ties of tort litigation, particularly to the nexus by which the victim's ability to recover compensation is directly tied to the court's ability and willingness to assess the tortfeasor for those costs, then the felt imperative for providing for victims is unlikely to be reconciled ade\u00ad quately with the other goals of the tort system. If there is to be a reconciliation, it must be founded on a new and different mix of com\u00ad pensatory and regulatory policies, a mix not governed by the funda\u00ad mental unities of traditional tort litigation. The framework I propose as a basis for further exploration and debate would entail the creation of a special compensation fund which would utilize separate processes to achieve the compensatory and reg\u00ad ulatory objectives of the program. The fund might be private, quasi\u00ad public, or governmental in character, and might be limited to narrow categories of risks or integrated into a more comprehensive, society\u00ad wide program of social insurance. Compensation awards would be provided to individual victims, in the first instance, according to nonfault principles. Recoveries would be less than those provided to successful litigants in tort actions, perhaps approximating those now * 37 Important earlier studies raising such questions and advancing proposals for reform in\u00ad clude G.

A number of intrigu\u00ad ing critiques of the tort law system and proposals for alternatives have been set forth. See Symposium: Alternative Compensation Schemes and Tort Theory, 73 Calif. L. Rev. 548 (1985), especially Sugerman, Doing Away With Tort Law, id. at 555; The Conference on Catastrophic Personal Injuries, 13 J. Legal Stud. 415 (1984).

Claims would be processed within an administrative struc\u00ad ture similar to those that handle first-person health and disability insurance or governmental social insurance claims. Ideally, this rela\u00ad tively efficient and inexpensive administrative structure would permit claims to be handled expeditiously and benefits to be paid out speed\u00ad ily, maximizing the rehabilitative potential of the claimant and re\u00ad turning that individual to customary activities quickly and without the need for lengthy litigation prior to receipt of basic compensation. In its broad outline, the compensatory aspect of this approach bears a close relationship to the Accident Compensation Act3 8 now in effect in New Zealand. How would the compensation fund be financed? That is a criti\u00ad cal matter for social choice. Most simply, the system could be funded out of general revenues. That approach would not, however, best pro\u00ad mote the regulatory objectives of the system, and it is not the choice I would endorse. A second possibility, which would retain many of the more positive aspects of current tort law, would be to subrogate the compensation fund to the tort claims of the accident victims, thus permitting the fund, rather than the victim, to proceed against the tortfeasor. The fact that the victim had already been compensated would be known to both court and jury, thus ameliorating any problems of excessive jury sympathy for the plight of the victim in the trial of the case. This approach would substantially reduce or elimi\u00ad nate the system's dependence on contingent-fee arrangements and would do much to promote the orderly trial or settlement of most claims. The system could thus promote many of the worthy goals of the tort system in a far more coherent fashion than is currently possi\u00ad ble, and it might even serve to restore something of the integrity of traditional tort doctrine. To be sure, the compensation fund would most likely not recover its full costs, in which event additional meth\u00ad ods would be required to cover the shortfall. To this end, or as an alternative approach to funding the entire system, a mechanism could be devised to secure complete or partial funding on a class, rather than an individual case, basis. A mandatory surcharge might be imposed on designated innovative pro\u00ad cedures, perhaps in the form of required first-party private insurance, perhaps as a required contribution to a government fund. The surcharge would fall initially on the patient but might be covered through other health insurance plans or subsidized with public funds in those instances in which the government wishes to promote the 38 2 N.Z. Stat. 1409 (1975). 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNO VA TION: A RESPONSE 1183 particular innovation. Alternatively, to reduce administrative costs and burdens, taxes might be levied directly on those conducting inno\u00ad vative activities, to be recovered through higher prices for medical products and services. Still another possibility would be for the com\u00ad pensation fund to pursue a new form of quasi-tort action against classes of activities that create risks of injury. At least in theory, such approaches to funding the compensation system could be calibrated to provide suitable incentives for safety. There would be no need to show a close causal nexus to injuries in particular cases. What is fundamental is that the system would disen\u00ad gage the provision of compensation to injured persons from the mech\u00ad anisms for charging the costs of those injuries to those whom society decides to hold financially responsible. In addition to providing compensation on a more just basis, such a system could provide an important institutional mechanism for ac\u00ad cumulating data on risks associated with medical and other techno\u00ad logical innovations. Further, the system could be structured to permit additional (punitive or quasi-punitive) damages to be collected, either through the compensation fund or perhaps by individual plain\u00ad tiffs, in cases in which society wishes to impose a penalty upon grossly improper behavior on the part of the tortfeasor. In moving to this sort of system, society would have to face a number of fundamental questions that are largely finessed in a tort system characterized by the classical unities. To illustrate, one might compare the status of claims for compensation, none involving allega\u00ad tions of unprofessional conduct, that might be advanced by three young women with adenocarcinoma: (1) a DES daughter whose claim is advanced following publication of studies documenting the relation\u00ad ship of DES exposure to that disease, (2) a DES daughter whose claim is being considered prior to the proof of the connection, and (3) a woman whose mother did not take DES and whose disease cannot be explained by any known or suspected linkage to human agency. Is it clear that any one of these women should have a greater claim to assistance, judged on its intrinsic nature? Should the fact of injury as opposed to illness, or of known human agency, as opposed to fate, justify differential treatment? Or might we instead believe that the fact of adenocarcinoma, and the need it generates, should be the only, or at least the principal, test of eligibility for assistance? That is, do we ultimately wish to compensate for harms, or only for wrongs? I cannot fully address these questions here, but I suggest that adoption of the proposed approach would make it more difficult to avoid these and other questions growing out of core issues of causation, legal lia\u00ad 1184 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 bility, and moral responsibility. We would do well to begin to con\u00ad sider these questions. First, with respect to causation, it seems most unlikely that the world is so organized as to assist us in identifying single, deterministic \"causes\" of many of the injuries and illnesses with which we are con\u00ad cerned. Existing science\u2014and perhaps the very nature of reality\u2014 may correspond poorly with the law's traditional requirements for proof of causation in such situations. But that realization may well foster a fruitful if unaccustomed inquiry: Why need we be concerned with causation in that narrow sense? To the degree that our concern is to identify those products and activities, and combinations of them, that increase the probability of future injury to the population at large or to specified subpopulations, statistical methodologies that do not focus on causation in an individual case may be perfectly appropriate to our needs. The backward-looking tasks of assessing liability and providing compensation require individualized causal determinations in the traditional tort system, but they need not do so in the proposed alternative system. We could simply decide to provide compensation from a central fund based on the fact of injury. Liability would be assessed in relation to overall statistical patterns of contribution to increased risk over a class of cases, without the need for complex and expensive individualized determinations. This capacity might be es\u00ad pecially relevant for classes of injury associated with multifactorial causation or synergistic effects. While the results would likely be rough-and-ready rather than finely honed, they would be no more im\u00ad precise than many traditional or emerging techniques in the law, which have rarely functioned at the level of conventional norms of scientific certainty.3 9 The traditional focus on individualized cause in tort law is, in many current contexts, expensive, uncertain, and un\u00ad necessary to our larger objectives. It has become dysfunctional and should, in at least some contexts, be changed or abandoned. Second, with respect to legal liability, the tort system has already abandoned, in a great many contexts, even the pretense that ultimate liability rests on the outcome of a close moral inquiry into the fault of the actor. In such fields as products liability and abnormally danger\u00ad ous activities, and indeed in many instances of vicarious liability, strict liability is imposed in accordance with a variety of social objec\u00ad tives that may bear little or no relationship to fault as traditionally conceived. Even in those areas in which negligence principles con\u00ad tinue to hold sway, it is increasingly clear that the real party in inter\u00ad 39 Thus, the law is more inclined to utilize formulae such as \"more likely than not\" than to test hypotheses for significance at the 5% level. 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION: A RESPONSE 1185 est in much tort litigation is the insurance company, not the named defendant. The moral relevance of the connection between the in\u00ad sured's fault and the insurance company's obligation to pay is obscure at best. The costs of liability only rarely reflect the degree of moral culpability.4 0 What is perhaps most troubling about this phenomenon is that, as the law has moved away from traditional conceptions of fault as the true basis for tort liability, lawyers have not always made clear to the broader public the growing distinction between legal liability and moral responsibility. The public may be too quick to conclude that persons found legally liable are necessarily also morally blameworthy. This observation may be especially relevant to the current medical malpractice situation, in which juries often seem to stretch norms of appropriate professional conduct in order to facilitate compensation of needy plaintiffs. While understandable, such decisions are likely to be accompanied by unjustified stigmatization of the professional repu\u00ad tation and competence of the defendant and to reinforce the adver\u00ad sarial aspects of the physician-patient relationship. Perhaps an alternative approach would promote a healthier relationship\u2014 one that enlisted the physician as patient advocate and did not, even nom\u00ad inally, require assertions of malpractice as a predicate for recovery. Third, with respect to moral responsibility, it is undoubtedly true that tort litigation, despite its increasing attention to compensation and incentive objectives, retains a dimension of primitive justice or vengeance. This punitive element has a powerful hold, which tran\u00ad scends our own culture, time, and place.4 1 I suspect that efforts to divest the system of this residual moral element would be unavailing, as well as, perhaps, ill-advised. That said, it does not follow that its current scope is necessarily optimal. I would be inclined to retain a place for fault\u2014more properly, for some concept of aggravated fault\u2014but only with respect to clear deviations from socially man\u00ad dated standards of behavior, not for what are today close jury ques\u00ad tions on whether basic compensation is to be provided.4 2 While such 40 Experience-rated policies and the emergence of self-insurance may limit the scope of this conclusion in a few settings. 41 Gray, The Role of Causation in Several Legal Systems, in Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 185. 42 Cf. Fleming, The Collateral Source Rule and Loss Allocation in Tort Law, 54 Calif. L. Rev. 1478 (1966). Reserving tort liability only for tortfeasors guilty of serious misconduct and leaving all other claims to be absorbed by society, Fleming states: If deterrence. . . has any continuing appeal as a justification for tort liability, it will be confined to situations where it can realistically perform an admonitory function, namely, only against defendants guilty of serious misconduct. Somewhat paradox\u00ad 1186 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 an approach is not plausible today, it might become more so if basic compensation were provided in an assured, alternative fashion. On Idealism and Practical Politics Assuming the merits of my \"modest proposal,\" is there any rea\u00ad son to believe that such an approach might be susceptible to legisla\u00ad tive adoption? If so, in what form? I have argued that a number of considerations, some of them unique to the domain of medical inno\u00ad vations, justify the exploration, and perhaps the creation, of an alter\u00ad native system of compensation for victims of medical innovation\u2014 what has sometimes been termed a \"tailored\" or \"categorical\" com\u00ad pensation system. Detailed efforts to structure an analogous scheme for the narrower domain of research injuries are documented in a three-volume report by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Re\u00ad search.4 3 Commentators representing diverse ideological starting points have coalesced in finding moral and economic policy justifica\u00ad tions for nonfault compensation programs for vaccine injuries and, perhaps to a lesser degree, for injuries associated with so-called \"non- therapeutic\" research. While the constellation of forces favoring the substitution of a tailored compensation system for tort liability in the vaccine field has finally proved sufficient to win enactment,4 4 I am dubious that medi\u00ad cal research, and nonvaccine medical innovations more generally, are politically promising candidates for legislative action. The magnitude of the problem is not sufficient, the intellectual and practical problems of implementation too formidable, the community of supporters too fragmented, and the political and budgetary environments too hostile to entertain much optimism.4 5 The problem of injuries associated with medical innovations bears a close relationship, however, to two other areas of current so\u00ad ically, tort law would shrink, at least in this respect, to its original starting-point as an adjunct of the criminal law in sanctioning immoral conduct. Id. at 1548 (footnote omitted). 43 President' s Comm'n for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Compensating for Research Injuries: A Report on the Ethical and Legal Implications of Programs to Redress Injuries Caused by Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1982). 44 See supra note 33. 45 For an elegant and penetrating analysis of the realpolitik of compensation, see Zimring, Some Social Bases of Compensation Schemes, in Medical Innovation, supra note 1, at 241. While in substantial agreement with much of Zimring's outlook, I am considerably less hope\u00ad ful that the current patchwork of public and private provisions now in effect in the United States will eventually mesh into an effective\u2014or minimally rational\u2014social safety net. 1987] BIOMEDICAL INNO VA TION: A RESPONSE 1187 cial concern in which the likelihood of systemic reform appears con\u00ad siderably more promising. First, as the medical malpractice system continues its steady descent toward intellectual incoherence4 6 and practical collapse, and as Band-Aid modifications are demonstrated to be inefficacious in curing the system's underlying ills, the antagonists may come to see the wisdom of a basic rethinking of the system's needs and objectives, and may possess the political strength to prompt legislative action. On a second front\u2014the emerging field of techno\u00ad logical torts associated with the multifarious hazards of workplace and environment\u2014the size, cost, and complexity of existing tort liti\u00ad gation, in conjunction with efforts by corporate defendants to seek shelter under provisions of the bankruptcy laws, may yet lead to scan\u00ad dalous breakdowns and public demands for major institutional re\u00ad forms. If systemic reform should occur in either of these contexts, injuries associated with medical innovations might well be brought along as stepchildren into a new legal structure. A tailored compen\u00ad sation plan addressed generally to medical injuries or to technological torts is perhaps less likely to resolve ideally the niceties unique to medical innovations, but it is considerably more likely to win legisla\u00ad tive enactment. As the political pendulum swings back, one might also contem\u00ad plate a broader set of changes in social welfare legislation. Such changes would provide more adequately for income substitution and health care and rehabilitative costs for those wholly or partially dis\u00ad abled, without regard to the occasions creating such need. This sys\u00ad tem could supplement the system of tort or compensation law\u2014 or, indeed, substitute for it, at least in its compensatory function. New Zealand's decision to limit its innovative nonfault-based compensa\u00ad tion system4 7 to injuries caused by accident and to exclude from cov\u00ad erage certain other misfortunes of life (specifically including illness) can only be understood in the context of that nation's social welfare system. That system provides far more comprehensive and generous coverage for illness than the patchwork of social insurance provisions now applicable in the United States. While I would applaud movement toward a more comprehensive system of social entitlements in this country, both on its intrinsic merit and as a preferable substitute for or supplement to the compen\u00ad satory function of the tort system, this more comprehensive system 46 See Note, Orderlies in the Court? A Proposal for the Proper Designation of Medical Malpractice Claims, 8 Cardozo L. Rev. 287 (1986) (surveying states' medical malpractice leg\u00ad islation and irreconcilable N.Z. Stat. 1409 (1975). 1188 CARDOZO LAW R E V IE W [Vol. 8:1161 would do little, in itself, to promote other important goals of tort law\u2014either in providing appropriate incentives for safety or in meting out justice to blameworthy tortfeasors. While there is ample room for skepticism as to how well existing tort law satisfies these goals, they remain appropriate goals for some instrument of social policy. A fully articulated nonfault model\u2014one developed with far greater specificity than possible within the compass of this essay\u2014would nec\u00ad essarily have to address those difficult issues in some detail. Conclusion Tort law has a long and venerable history. It has served the needs of our society, for better or worse, for many generations. But tort principles arose in a world very different from our own in mate\u00ad rial circumstances, scientific understanding, pace of change, and so\u00ad cial ideals. Tort law is a tool of human society, not its master. If we are to face the moral, social, and economic demands presented by bio\u00ad medical innovation, as well as other innovative and risky activities, we should not allow our imaginations to be bound by past solutions. Law, like medicine, is capable of innovation. To be sure, legal innova\u00ad tions, like scientific ones, may be subject to their own Daedalus ef\u00ad fect.4 8 The suggestions set forth here carry their own risks of unintended consequences. Yet they do so in the service of a moral vision that offers greater inspiration than the competing vision of the law and economics scholars. If this vision is not yet capable of being realized, it is perhaps still useful as a reminder of, and stimulus to, our higher aspirations as compassionate individuals and as a caring com\u00ad munity. Intellectual leaders might well consider the enduring social costs of abandoning those aspirations. 48 See Blumberg, supra note 13.
