Description Traditional from TIER\u00ae Natural Stone is a classic stone panel that offers a rugged yet tailored look. The Traditional Range consists of three-panel components: Flats, Corners, and Starter Strips. Starter Strips are used as the first course at the base, followed by Flat panels. Starter Strips are also used as the first course above window and door openings. The unique panel shape and design found in the Traditional Range eliminates any horizontal joints, creating a much more seamless final look for your project.
