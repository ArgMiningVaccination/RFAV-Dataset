Jennifer Manley Master of Science (2007) Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Toronto ABSTRACT Introduction: Methods exist for minimizing pain during routine immunization. The frequency of utilization of interventions by mothers has not been investigated. Objectives: To assess mothers' practices and opinions regarding analgesia in preventing pain associated with childhood immunization, and predictable factors. Methods: Prospective interviewer-administered questionnaire asked 200 mothers questions about their practices and opinions regarding use of analgesia for immunization pain. Results: Seventy-five percent and 68% of mothers reported not to use analgesia prior to or after immunization, respectively. Fifty percent and 81% of mothers reported that analgesia should be used prior to and after immunization, respectively. Mothers' use of analgesia before and after immunization was predicted by doctors providing information [(OR=28.3, 95 % CI 9.3, 86.0) and (OR=6.3, 95 % CI 2.5, 16.1) respectively]. Conclusion: Mothers agreed that analgesia should be used for immunization pain; however, most did not utilize this option. Strategies to increase flow of information are suggested. il ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Anna Taddio, for providing me with the opportunity to think independently and expand my mind.

Patient Participation Summary 62 viii CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1: Statement of the Problem Until about 15 years ago infants commonly underwent painful procedures without the provision of analgesics.' Although pain in infants and children has become more widely recognized it is still generally under treated. The rationale for this is based on the supposed notion that infants are unable to perceive and remember pain, and that there are no long term consequences of pain.' As well, traditional methods of opioid use for management of moderate to severe of pain with analgesics have been scrutinized due to concern for toxicity and respiratory depression.\" Furthermore, pain is often justified as necessary in order to achieve a greater goal.\" Data suggests that the nociceptive system is intact at birth and infants do experience pain.' Additionally, it has been demonstrated that infants who experienced pain during the neonatal period may have an altered pain response later in infancy. Furthermore, painful childhood experiences can lead to \"needle phobia\", an intense fear of needles triggering immediate anxiety and occurring in about 10% of adults in the US. This fear usually begins in childhood and may result in avoidance of medical care later in life.\" Thus, it is clear that long term consequences to experiencing pain during infancy and childhood exist. Routine immunizations are one of the most commonly performed painful procedures endured by infants and children.\u00b0 Furthermore; immunizations are performed repeatedly throughout infancy and childhood. Over the past several years the safety and efficacy of local anaesthetics during routine immunizations has been demonstrated.' \u00b0'\u00b0 However, recent data suggests that topical analgesics are underutilized for needle poke pain during routine immunizations.\" This is despite information which has shown that parents are willing to pay to make immunizations less painful in their children.' 1.2: Purpose of the Thesis Immunizations are painful and can cause anxiety in children leading to needle phobias. Since safe and effective strategies exist for management of pain during this routine procedure, it is important to ensure that such interventions are being used in clinical practice. Thus, it is essential to identify what the current practices and opinions are concerning pain management during routine immunizations. To date, no study has been published regarding this topic. The present work aimed to examine mothers' practices and opinions regarding analgesic use for management of pain during routine immunizations in their children and factors that predict facilitation or hindrance of analgesic use during routine immunizations. It is hoped that the results from this thesis can help aid the implementation of analgesic use during immunizations. 1.3: Outline of the Thesis This thesis will describe a study conducted to examine mothers' practices and attitudes regarding analgesic use for management of pain during routine immunization in their youngest child. A literature review will provide a rationale for the investigation of pain management strategies for immunizations. The thesis will then detail the methodology and study procedures used. The results of the study are then summarized and discussed. Lastly, conclusions for clinical implementation strategies are presented. 1.4: Review of the Literature The following literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for publications from their inception to February 2007. Section 1.4.7: Management of Immunization Pain: Pharmacological Management of Pain During Immunization was systematically reviewed with combinations of the following terms: child, adverse reactions, vaccination, immunization, diphtheria tetanus-toxoid, whole pertussis, pneumococcal polysaccharide. All searches were restricted to articles published in the English language. Further relevant articles from the bibliographies of published works were obtained. 1.4.1: Pain Theories Definition of Pain The Task Force on Taxonomy of the International Association of Pain defines pain as 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'? They further state that pain is subjective and that experiences early in life teach one the application of the word.'? This definition is problematic for newborn, older infants and small children. Firstly, infants and children lack the verbal communication necessary to fulfill the subjective nature of this definition. Secondly, this population may be deficient in the prior experience necessary to fulfill this criterion. Anand and Craig propose a new definition of pain so that it describes pain as an inherent quality of life that protects the organism against damage from the external environment.' This new definition proposes that behavioural responses are in fact forms of self- report, so that treatment of pain is based on recognizing its presence. While some agree with this definition, confirming a more generally applicable definition of pain,'* others have challenged it, stating that the definition of pain is semantic and what infants show is pain behaviour.'> Regardless, they do agree that infants are capable of perceiving pain and demonstrating a 'pain behaviour' as a response.' Nociception Nociception is the term commonly used to refer to the perception of pain. The mechanisms of pain perception are said to be the same in infants, children and adults. Pain perception occurs when tissue damage elicits the signalling of a pain pathway. Chemical mediators of pain, such as histamine, serotonin, potassium ions, bradykinin and prostaglandins, are released by damaged cells and activate free nerve endings in the skin called nociceptors. These free nerve endings transmit a pain impulse to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where modulation of pain signals occurs, and to the sensory area of the cortex, where they become conscious sensations. Pain signals can travel at different speeds depending on which nociceptors are involved. There are two types of nociceptors, A-delta fibers and C fibers.'\u00ae A-delta fibers are large, myelinated and fast conducting (5-25 m/s). Characterized by sharp and localized pain, A-delta fibers are activated in response to mechanical or thermal stimuli. Dull, aching, burning sensations produced by mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli are carried by C fibers which are small, unmyelinated and slow conducting (<2 m/s).'' The limbic system and hypothalamus also receive pain signals. These areas induce the emotional stress and physical reactions of sweating, vomiting and nausea associated with pain.'\" Development of the Nociceptive System All of the components necessary for infants to anatomically and functionally process painful stimuli are present even before full gestational age (36-40 weeks).'\u00b0 Density of nociceptive fibers in neonatal skin of full-term infants is at least equal to that of an adult.'\u00ae Central to the transmission of pain signals, the neurotransmitters associated with nociception appear early in embryonic life. At 8-10 weeks gestation opioid peptides appear before their receptors, and by 19 weeks they can be localized in the brain.'\u00ae By mid gestation opioid receptors can be found in the brainstem and spinal cord regions associated with pain.'\u00ae By the 20\" week gestation sensory neurons are found in all cutaneous and mucous surfaces.'* Synaptic connections linking cortical neurons and thalamic neurons are established between 22 and 26 weeks.'*\u00ae By the 30\" week of gestation the dorsal horn cells are organized and the nerve tracts associated with pain transmission in the spinal cord are myelinated.'\u00ae Myelination, the process of the glial cells wrapping around and insulating the axons, is important in the speed of neural transmission. The nociceptive system is quite flexible. There is interplay between the afferent neurons and the descending pathway of the spinal cord. This interplay modulates pain and can either dampen or intensify the pain response. Studies using neonatal rats showed that the descending pathway of the spinal cord is not functional until days 10-12 of life. 9 It has been suggested that the inhibitory neurons of the descending pathways are immature at birth in human infants and that they may be hypersensitive to pain.\" Thus, the evidence suggests that the nociceptive system is present at birth for infants to sense and react to painful stimuli, perhaps with a heightened sensitivity compared to the adult nociceptive system. 1.4.2: Responses to Pain and Measurement Pain Behaviours Infants' and children's responses to acute pain may include body movements, changes in facial expression and cry patterns. Assessing pain via these markers provides a way of inferring that an infant or child is in pain. However, there are difficulties associated with assessment of pain behaviours. For example, behaviours can be rated differently by different health care professionals, behavioural responses can change over time, and there is a question of whether or not a child's pain-related behaviour is a valid index of their pain. Therefore much research has focused on identifying behaviours that are primarily associated with children experiencing pain.\"' Facial expression and cry are the most widely used behaviour responses and have been validated in many reports as markers of pain.\"\" These different behaviours are discussed below. Body Movements Motor responses have been studied mainly as an added descriptor for measurement of pain in infants and children as they are less likely to be specific.\" Craig et al have demonstrated that children of different ages react differently to painful stimuli.\" Older children tend to orientate towards painful body sites, and protect and touch their limbs more compared to younger infants. Younger infants tend to display more torso rigidity compared to older infants.\" Furthermore, infants undergoing painful procedures such as heel lance have been shown to demonstrate a reflex. withdrawal response.\"? Facial Expressions Facial expression is often used to evaluate pain in infants and young children who are unable to verbalize their pain experience. Facial expressions have demonstrated more specificity as responses towards painful stimuli and form the basis for many of the tools used to assess pain in infants and children.\"**> Ekman and Oster were the first to distinguish between expressions of pain and expressions of sadness in children.2\u00b0 Soon after, Izard developed the Maximally Discriminative Facial Movement Coding System which separated the face into 3 separate regions: the mouth region, the eyes and nose region and the forehead and brow region.~\" The pain expressions brow bulge, eyes squeezed shut and naso-labial furrow have been demonstrated as those facial actions most specific to pain.\"* The Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) was developed by Grunau and Craig and is comprised of the following actions: brow bulge, eye squeeze, naso-labial furrow, open lips, vertical stretched mouth, horizontal stretched mouth, lip purse, taut tongue, chin quiver and tongue protrusion.' In studies using the NFCS, it has been noted that brow bulge, eye squeeze, naso-labial furrow and open mouth are most consistently associated with an infant's expression during painful events.* 8 A disadvantage to using facial expressions for measurement of pain is that infants' expressions may reflect their initial reactions to a relatively short-duration noxious stimulus and therefore may indicate only the presence of acute pain. I Cry patterns Crying signals that an infant or child is distressed. Cry is often included in pain assessment tools. Intensity, duration, frequency and pitch of crying have been studied as indices of pain. A pain cry is either a sudden onset of loud crying without preliminary moaning, or an initial long cry followed by an extended period of breath-holding. Pain cries usually settle into a rhythm that is indistinguishable from other cries.\" Short latency and long duration of first cry is a signal of pain. Bellieni et al found that the pitch of the first cry, the loudness of crying and duration of crying were factors in the differentiation of expression of level of pain.\"\" Infants undergoing heel pricks received either multisensorial stimulation consisting of massage, scent, sweet taste, and human voice (SS) or oral sugar or sucking, or oral sugar plus sucking. Those with higher pain scores demonstrated a different pattern of cry compared to those with lower pain scores. Specifically, high pain scores were associated with a first cry at a high pitch, followed by repeated similar cries, separated by very short, quieter intervals, with a sound level sustained close to its maximum.\" Physiological Responses to Pain Pain induces physiological responses which are often used in the clinical setting, in children of all ages to monitor pain. Specifically, pain can induce changes in heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate. Heel lancing and circumcision performed in pre-term and full-term neonates have elicited these cardiovascular responses, namely increased heart rate and blood pressure.*\" *! Respiratory effects during the painful portion of heel lance and circumcision include decreased oxygen saturation levels, transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen and respiratory rate and increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide.*! Furthermore, an increase in stress hormones and sweating of the hands and feet have been observed.*! Lastly, increases in intracranial pressure have been observed in infants undergoing intubation.*! Pain Measurement Pain is measured using self-report, or by observational means. Self report is the gold standard for assessing paediatric pain **, thus several self-report scales have been developed including visual analogue scales, color scales, and face scales.*? Furthermore, tools for measuring pain can be one-dimensional (for example heart rate) or multidimensional (for example the Premature Infant Pain Profile, a measure which includes heart rate, oxygen saturation, facial grimacing, sleep/awake state and gestational age) and have been validated and widely used. The reader is referred to two reviews for further information, one by Stevens et al.*\" and the other by Abu-Saad et al.*\u00b0 1.4.3: Barriers to the Treatment of Pain in Infants and Children In the past, lack of pain management was mainly attributed to the belief that children do not feel pain like adults, and even if they do there is no untoward consequence. A survey of 374 American physicians and nurses indicates that this belief has changed. In that survey, 59% of physicians and 64% of nurses thought that infants can feel an equal amount of pain as adults.*\u00b0 Furthermore, both physicians and nurses thought that pharmacological treatments should be employed more often then what was typical in current practice.*\u00b0 An additional barrier to the treatment of pain includes the belief that pain cannot be measured accurately; however, pain can be assessed via behavioural observations, physiological markers and children's self report. It is agreed that children from the age of 10 5 years are able to communicate their pain reliably.\" Another barrier includes the fear of using opioids that can lead to respiratory depression and addiction, yet, it has been shown that the risk of respiratory depression is not greater in infants compared to adults.\" Although pain is recognized in infants and children and there are currently safe and effective ways to manage it, pain is still under treated. In a study by Johnston and colleagues, Canadian neonatal intensive care units were surveyed for their use of analgesics for procedural pain over a one week period.\u00b0' It was found that of the 2134 procedure performed, medication specific to manage pain from the procedure was administered only 17 times.*' In another survey by Harrison et al., 6% of 105 neonatal units reported to use pain assessment scores on a regular basis and 15% had a pain policy.>\u00ae Twenty-three percent of the 105 units reported to use sweet-tasting solutions for pain reduction; however, those units used sweet-tasting solutions infrequently.** Another recent survey showed similar trends for underutilization of adequate analgesia in the neonatal population.*\" Lago et al. surveyed 90 NICUs and found that 19% used pain assessment scores and 25% had guidelines for acute pain management. Lidocaine- prilocaine was used by 34% of the NICUs for venipuncture. Only 1% reported use of pharmacological interventions for injections.*\" This trend for underutilization of analgesia was also demonstrated by Fernandez et al. in infants undergoing surgery in 30 NICU units across Canada.*? While analgesic use for management of postoperative pain associated with cardiac and major surgery was found to be frequent, analgesic use for pain associated with minor surgery was underutilized. Specifically, local anaesthesia was used always for chest tube placement in 16% of the NICUs, and for lumbar puncture in 12%,\" 11 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that discrepancies exist between health care professionals' perceived utilization of analgesia for pain and documented use of analgesia for pain in the paediatric population. In a study by Probst et al., 123 hospitals were surveyed regarding their emergency department's pain assessment and treatment strategies and 933 charts were retrospectively reviewed of children aged 0 to 15 years being treated for extremity fracture in those 123 hospitals.*! Use of pain assessment scales were reported by 92% of facilities, however, chart reviews revealed use in 59% of patients. The survey suggested that analgesia would be offered to 50% of patients, yet the chart reviewed revealed that 40% of patients received analgesia for pain associated with their extremity fracture, suggesting underutilization of analgesia for an injury in which pain treatment is important.\"! Walco and colleagues state that the personal beliefs and values of healthcare workers regarding the meaning of pain in the development of a child (i.e., pain builds character) should not stand in the way of treatment of pain.' 1.4.4: Consequences of Untreated Pain Procedural pain is often under treated in infants and children. The literature demonstrates that there are both short-term and long-term consequences to experiencing pain. The evidence discussed in the following two sections substantiated the importance for implementing strategies for treatment of procedural pain. Short-term Consequences of Untreated Procedural Pain Pain is mediated by the nociceptive system and can be altered by experience. It has been suggested that exposure to repeated painful stimuli can condition infants to anticipate pain and react more vigorously to painful stimuli. In a study by Taddio et al., 12 infants of diabetic mothers who had repeated heel lances within the first 24-36 hours of life, displayed increased pain behaviours during skin cleansing and venipuncture during the standard PKU test compared to infants born to non-diabetic mothers.*\" The increased pain response during skin cleansing suggested that the infants learned to anticipate pain by the pairing of cleansing of the skin with a painful procedure. Furthermore, the infants of diabetic mothers showed increased pain behaviours during the venipuncture compared to control group infants, suggesting that the infants became hypersensitive to the procedure, despite the fact that the site used for venipuncture had not been previously used for blood sampling.\" It has also been demonstrated that preterm infants who are often exposed to repeated painful procedures in the NICU have been shown to display pain behaviours to non-noxious stimuli such as handling and physical examination.!\u00ae Repeated heel lancing has also demonstrated that infants can develop hypersensitivity, as evidenced by a decrease in the threshold for the flexion withdrawal reflex in the lanced foot compared to the intact foot.' Fitzgerald and colleagues have further confirmed that the lowering of the threshold in the damaged area can be reversed by the application a topical anaesthetic cream (lidocaine-prilocaine).\" Along with behavioural changes, there are stress related changes associated with untreated pain in infants. Hormones are released in response to stress and result in hyperglycaemia, mobilization of fat and protein, and increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Although this stress response is useful for survival it can be fatal in very low birth weight infants where physiological stability is crucial. Changes in oxygen saturation and cerebral blood flow have been shown following invasive procedures such as heel lancing, feeding tube insertion and endotracheal suctioning.\" 13 Long-term Consequences of Untreated Procedural Pain Research has described potential long term consequences to untreated pain experienced in early infancy. In a study by Johnston and Stevens, 4 week old infants born at 28 weeks gestation had increased cardiovascular responses and decreased behavioural responses compared to infants born at 32 weeks gestation.** The number of painful procedures the infants underwent was correlated with these differences in pain responses. More specifically cumulative repetitive procedures over a 4 week period altered responses to subsequent painful procedures.\"\u00b0 Furthermore, a study by Taddio and colleagues demonstrated that male infants being vaccinated at 4-6 months had increased pain response if they were circumcised at birth compared to uncircumcised infants.' Those who received lidocaine-prilocaine cream during their circumcision had intermediate responses. Thus, the results of this study suggest that pain experienced in infancy can alter pain responses later in infancy and that pre-medication to minimize the pain experienced in infancy may be beneficial in attenuating this effect. Grunau and colleagues have completed studies describing parental reports of preterm infants having altered pain perceptions and increased tendency to somatize into physical symptoms during later infancy and childhood.\" Full term infants born with brachial plexus (the arrangement of nerve fibres running from the spine though the neck, into the armpit region and into the arm) injury as a result of a stressful birth, have been shown to display chronic pain behaviours of self mutilation including excessive mouthing and biting.' These chronic pain behaviours are associated with surgical interventions, such that infants undergoing surgery were more 14 likely to display self injurious behaviour approximately 8 months after surgery compared to those infants who did not undergo surgery.'' However, other studies have failed to demonstrate similar results perhaps due to small sample size. ** In a study by Weisman et al., it was demonstrated that younger children aged 3 \u2014 7 years whose pain is inadequately treated during initial painful procedures (bone marrow aspiration and/or lumbar puncture) later showed reduced effectiveness to subsequent analgesic treatment for the same painful procedure.\" Older children aged 8 \u2014 18 years did not demonstrate the same lack of effectiveness when pain was adequately treated for subsequent procedures. This finding demonstrates that younger children are likely to anticipate painful experiences and are less likely to be influenced by discussion compared to older children who can cognitively understand that the medication given to them will alleviate pain previously experienced.\" As previously mentioned, painful childhood experiences can lead to needle phobia and result in avoidance of seeking medical care later in life. Furthermore, it has been shown that there are consequences of pain during routine immunization in childhood. Immunization is often a child's first introduction to the health care system. When a child experiences pain during immunization they can become anxious and can be at risk of dropping out of the immunization program.\"? It is clear that there are short term and long term consequences to untreated pain in infancy and childhood. Clearly, pain needs to be treated as to avoid these negative outcomes. 15 1.4.5: Parental Perceptions of Pain in Children Research conducted in the area of parental perceptions of pain in their own children has shown that parents tend to believe that minor childhood injuries play a beneficial role in the development of young children.*! Specifically, parents view minor injury as character building and believe that children learn from injury experience. Furthermore, there is a trend for parents to support the idea that injuries strengthen or toughen up their child.' It is concerning that these beliefs may result in parents not taking steps to minimize potentially harmful situations in their children. Although it can be seen as beneficial for children to learn to avoid certain situations as a result of an injury, the same could happen with painful medical procedures that have a positive outcome (for example immunizations). Eliciting a learning response from a negative experience may not always be a positive lesson, especially if it leads to avoidance of medical care.\" It has been demonstrated that parents have both valid and misleading perceptions regarding pain in their children following day surgery.\" In a study by Kankkunen et al., parents of 1 to 6 year old children often expressed beliefs that adults are responsible for >? However, parents also said post-operative pain decreases alleviating children's pain. every day, and that pain is always a part of surgery. Furthermore, some parents believe that children do not feel as much pain as adults. When compared to mothers, fathers more often thought that their children, specifically boys, should learn to tolerate pain and should cope by themselves. An interesting finding by Kankkunen et al. was that parents believed that their young children forget their pain after a few days compared to older children.\" 16 When it comes to the pharmacological treatment of pain, it has been demonstrated that parents are hesitant to use medication for pain management and that they believe it should be used as a last resort, even though most parents agree that medications such as acetaminophen are safe for children.~* In a study by Maimon and colleagues parents were interviewed about analgesic use in their child (age ranged from 5 months to 18 years) before arriving to the emergency department for acute limb injury.\" Only 28% of parents attempted to reduce their child's pain with an analgesic. Younger children in this study received significantly less analgesia than older children. Furthermore, the reason parents often reported for not using analgesia was that they did not want to mask their child's symptoms. Additionally, another study demonstrated that mothers with more positive attitudes towards medication are more likely to medicate for minor childhood pains.\" However, although mothers said they would medicate for headache and earache pains, they were less likely to treat pain associated with minor injuries and muscle or limb pain. 1.4.6: Immunization Vaccines are antigenic preparations designed to stimulate the body's immune system to generate a response that will protect the individual from the disease by the pathogen in question. Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health initiatives in history.\u00b0\u00b0 Over 100 years ago infectious diseases were the major cause of death worldwide. Today, over 2 million deaths are prevented worldwide and in Canada specifically, infectious disease account for less than 5% of all deaths.~\u00b0 It is clear that immunizations are significant in protecting children against diseases that can cause harm, disability and even death. Thus, it is important to ensure 17 that children are being vaccinated in order to reduce chance of illness, disability and mortality not only in themselves but in others as well. 1.4.7: Management of Immunization Pain Canadian infants and children are receiving more immunizations than ever before. The growing number of recommended immunogenic vaccines for infants and children has been labelled the \"pin cushion\" phenomenon.*' The Ontario provincial guidelines for immunizations recommends infants and children receive up to 17 injections within the first 18 months of life.*\u00ae As previously stated immunizations are painful and can cause anxiety in children leading to missed vaccinations.\u00b0' Humphrey et al. demonstrated that over 80% of pre- school age children and over 50% of primary school age children have a fear of needle procedures.\" If interventions are not employed to reduce distress and pain, then children can become more anxious with each procedure.*' It has been shown that parents will defer immunizations to reduce their child's pain and anxiety from multiple, sequential injections at the same visit. Deferring immunization can lead to children being behind the recommended immunization schedule. There are many ways to minimize pain and distress associated with immunization and it has been demonstrated that parents are willing to pay money to reduce or avoid pain and anxiety associated with immunization pain.' Reducing pain during immunization could make the process much easier and less anxiety provoking. Pharmacological Management of Pain During Immunization in Children The following section will systematically review the literature that substantiates the safety and efficacy of pharmacological interventions for pain management during 18 immunizations. Topical anaesthetics and sucrose, which are indicated for management of needle poke pain during immunization, are discussed first, and then systemic analgesics, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which can be used post-injection for pain, are described second. Topical Local Anaesthetics Efficacy and Safety of Lidocaine-Prilocaine Cream (EMLA\u00ae) EMLA\u00ae 5% cream contains the two local anaesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine, and is used to diminish pain for cutaneous procedures in children and adults. It is an amide-type local anaesthetic. Lidocaine-prilocaine works through inhibiting the conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the membrane's permeability to sodium ions, resulting in failure of a propagated action potential. Application of 1 to 2 grams is applied under an occlusive dressing for 60 minutes to provide anaesthesia.\" Lidocaine-prilocaine is generally well tolerated, adverse events in children and adults are limited; transient blanching and redness being the most commonly reported skin reactions.\" There is some hesitation for use of lidocaine-prilocaine in neonates (infants under one month of age) due to risk of methemoglobinemia. Prilocaine metabolites can oxidize haemoglobin, and infants are at greater risk of this toxicity due to a deficiency in the enzyme which reduces methaemoglobin, NADH cytochrome b5 reductase. Methemoglobinemia results in a bluish discoloration in the skin of the extremities caused by lack of oxygen. Methylene blue can reverse the effects of methemoglobinemia. In Canada, the majority of childrens' first immunization experience occurs at 2 months of age (a very small proportion of infants are immunized for Hepatitis B at birth), thus methemoglobinemia is not a great 19 concern. The safety and efficacy of lidocaine-prilocaine for use during different vaccines has been demonstrated in several studies summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial the safety and efficacy of lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream during measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination was investigated. In this study, Halperin et al. applied 1 gram of lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream or placebo for 60 to 180 minutes in 160 infants 12 months of age.! Pain scores were assigned using the Modified Behavioural Pain Scale (MBPS) (a validated pain assessment tool which measures facial action, cry and body movements) and cry duration by a research assistant blinded to the study procedures and treatment allocation. Measles, mumps and rubella antibodies were measured to test the effect of lidocaine-prilocaine on the antibody response. Local and systemic reactions associated with lidocaine-prilocaine and the MMR vaccine were recorded 15 minutes after immunization. Parents were contacted within 72 hours following immunization for collection of any other adverse reactions. Infants in the lidocaine-prilocaine group had significantly lower pain scores after immunization compared to the placebo group. However, crying did not differ between groups. Infants in the lidocaine-prilocaine group experienced more pallor at the site of application compared to the placebo group. Infants in the placebo group experienced more irritability within the first 15 minutes following immunization compared to the lidocaine-prilocaine group. All other rates of adverse reactions associated with lidocaine-prilocaine and the MMR vaccine (erythema, tenderness, swelling, fever > 38.3\u00b0C, irritability within 24 hrs post immunization, feeding, and sleepiness) did not differ between groups. Furthermore, geometric mean antibody levels of MMR did not differ between lidocaine-prilocaine and placebo groups: measles 20 antibody titers in excess of 120 reciprocal dilution (89.7% and 91.1%), mumps antibody levels in excess of 231 EU/mL (88.3% vs. 94.9%) and rubella antibody levels in excess of 8 IU/mL (92.3% vs. 93.7%). Lidocaine-prilocaine has also been shown to safe and effective for diphtheria- tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus-Haemophilus study, Halperin et al. investigated lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream against placebo in 109 infants for all three doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib and Hep B, and an additional 56 infants receiving their third dose at 6 months of age.\" One gram of lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream was applied for 60 to 180 minutes prior to immunization. Pain scores were assigned using the MBPS by a research assistant blinded to the study procedures and treatment allocation. Antibodies were measured and local and systemic reactions associated with lidocaine-prilocaine and the DTaP-IPV-Hib and Hep B vaccines (pallor, erythema, edema, tenderness, fever, irritability, decreased feeding, and sleepiness) were recorded at 15 minutes and up 72 hours following immunization. At 6 months of age, infants in the lidocaine-prilocaine group had lower pain scores than infants in the placebo group. Similar effects were seen in infants aged 2 and 4 months; however results were not statistically significant, perhaps due to small sample size. Rates of skin pallor in infants up to 4 months of age, and erythema in infants 6 months of age were higher in the lidocaine-prilocaine group compared to the placebo group. There were no differences between groups in rates of any other adverse reactions. Furthermore, lidocaine-prilocaine did not adversely affect the antibody response to the vaccine antigens in newborn to 6 month old infants. Greater than 95% of all participants 21 (lidocaine-prilocaine and placebo) achieved protective titers against diphtheria \u00a9 0.1 IU/mL), tetanus (> 0.1 IU/mL), and poliovirus (> 8 reciprocal dilution). Protective Hep B (= 10 mIU/mL) and Hib (> 1.0 pg/mL) titers were elicited in 94.4% and 75.3% of lidocaine-prilocaine participants and in 92.1% and 66.3% of placebo participants, respectively. Two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of lidocaine-prilocaine during DTP vaccination in infants and children aged 3 to 28 months.\" \u00ae In the first study by Uhari, an unspecified amount of lidocaine-prilocaine or placebo cream was applied for at least 60 minutes in 155 infants.\u00ae Pain, crying and fear were evaluated immediately after immunization by parents and nurses using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for each outcome (a validated 100mm scale, where 0 is no pain/crying/fear and 100 is maximal pain/crying/fear). Parents also recorded any fever, tenderness, and other vaccine- or anaesthesia-related side effects onto a questionnaire.*\u00ae The study by Taddio et al. applied 2.5 gram of lidocaine-prilocaine or placebo for a duration of 60 to 120 minutes in 96 infants.' The immunization procedure was videotaped in order to evaluate pain later on. Using a VAS, pain was scored by a trained research assistant 15 seconds after immunization. From the videotapes, pain was also scored using the MBPS and cry patterns were analyzed by a research assistant blinded to treatment allocation.' Both studies showed reduced pain and crying in infants receiving lidocaine- prilocaine compared to placebo.\" \u00ae Uhari further observed lower rates of tenderness after immunization in the lidocaine-prilocaine group.\u00ae Taddio et al. also revealed longer latency to first cry.' Furthermore, Taddio et al. demonstrated that local skin reactions, mainly blanching, (60%) and redness (30%), were more often observed in the lidocaine- 22 prilocaine group compared to the placebo group.' No serious adverse reactions were observed in any participants in either study.\" \u00ae In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, Cassidy et al. evaluated the efficacy of lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream in 161 children aged 4 to 6 years receiving diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio (DPTP) vaccines.\u00ae! One gram of lidocaine- prilocaine or placebo cream was applied for 60 to 120 minutes and removed within 10 minutes prior to immunization. Adverse events were recorded by study staff when the patch was removed. Children self-reported pain using the Faces Pain Scale (FPS) (a validated pain assessment tool consisting of 7 faces, with the anchors 0 = no pain and 6 = worst pain possible), while parents and study staff rated the child's pain on a VAS. Parents also rated their own and their child's anxiety before immunization using a VAS. Pain was scored from videotapes of the procedure using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) (a valid pain assessment tool which time samples the following behaviours: crying, verbal complaints, torso movements, touching, facial expression and leg movements) and Child Facial Coding System (CFCS) (a valid pain assessment tool which measures 13 facial actions associated with pain) by a research assistant blinded to the study procedures and treatment allocation. Children receiving lidocaine-prilocaine demonstrated significantly less pain than children in the placebo group on several measures (CFCS, CHEOPS, parent VAS, study staff VAS, and child FPS). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were coldness and itching, and pallor and itching had the largest between groups difference, however, the latter was statistically insignificant. Furthermore, no severe adverse reactions were experienced and most participants experienced no reactions or mild skin reactions.*! 23 Lastly, one randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial demonstrated lidocaine-prilocaine as ineffective in children aged 9 years receiving MMR vaccination.\" This study was published as a letter with limited data provided. An unspecified amount of lidocaine-prilocaine cream was applied for 60 minutes before vaccination in 96 children. Pain was rated by the child and investigator on a verbal scale as no, mild, moderate or severe pain. Children also rated their pain on a VAS. There were no significant differences in verbal pain scores, however child rated VAS pain almost reached significance. This study has a few limitations. Firstly, given the limited data, it is unclear whether or not the amount of lidocaine-prilocaine cream applied was sufficient to provide anaesthesia. Furthermore, the study does not provide the mean scores of the treatment and placebo groups, therefore, it is difficult to determine the magnitude of effect. Lastly, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups. In summary, 1 to 2.5 grams of lidocaine-prilocaine cream applied for a minimum duration of 60 minutes has been shown to be effective in reducing pain in infants and children undergoing MMR, DTaP-IPV-Hib and Hep B, and DTP vaccination using valid indices of pain. Furthermore, the current literature does not show an effect of lidocaine- prilocaine cream on geometric mean antibody levels for MMR, DTaP-IPV-Hib and Hep B. Efficacy and Safety of Amethocaine Amethocaine 4% gel is an ester-type local as tetracaine). Amethocaine, like lidocaine-prilocaine, provides analgesia by penetrating the skin barrier and preventing action potentials from forming by inhibiting the influx of sodium ions onto the nerve cell. Thus, the nerve cell remains in a resting state, unable to transmit 24 nociceptive input into the central nervous system. An alternative to lidocaine-prilocaine, - amethocaine has a faster onset of action of 30 to 45 minutes and a duration of action of 4 to 6 hours. The most commonly reported skin reaction is transient erythema, with edema and pruritis less commonly reported. Unlike lidocaine-prilocaine, amethocaine has not been shown to be associated with methemoglobinemia.\" In a systematic review performed by Taddio and colleagues, amethocaine and lidocaine-prilocaine were examined to determine their safety and efficacy for procedural pain in children.\u00ae It was shown that when used as labelled, that is 60 minute application for lidocaine-prilocaine and 30 minute application for amethocaine, the two agents provided similar analgesic efficacy. However, when applied for the same duration of time, amethocaine provided superior anaesthesia over lidocaine-prilocaine. The authors also found that amethocaine resulted in erythema whereas lidocaine-prilocaine resulted in blanching of the skin.\u00a9 Amethocaine, is a relatively new topical local anaesthetic and its safety and efficacy during routine immunization has been investigated in one double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study (Table 1).\u00b0 In this study, 1 gram of amethocaine 4% cream or placebo was applied for 30 to 45 minutes prior to MMR vaccination in 120 infants aged 12 months. Adverse reactions were observed for five minutes following the removal of the gel. Following immunization, blood samples were collected to determine MMR antibody titers. Pain was scored using the MBPS by a research assistant blind to treatment allocation. Infants in the amethocaine group demonstrated less pain than the placebo group. Rates of redness, edema and pallor were significantly higher in the amethocaine group compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, amethocaine did not 25 interfere with MMR protective antibody levels. MMR immunity in the amethocaine group post vaccination was 88% compared to 87% in placebo id SAT 'syJuOU 7 0} YI \"OTe '(r00'0 = spray (ethyl chloride) is a volatile refrigerant liquid that provides cutaneous anaesthesia in seconds and at the fraction of the cost of topical anaesthetics. Through its rapid evaporation, vapocoolant spray lowers the skins temperature. The skin is maximally cooled for 1 to 2 minutes after applying vapocoolant by either spraying the skin or applying a saturated cotton ball for 15 second with the solution. Adverse reactions associated with vapocoolant sprays include skin sensitivity if applied repeatedly. Freezing of the skin can also occur if duration of application is excessive and thus application should be limited to 15 seconds. The literature surrounding the safety and efficacy of vapocoolant for the use in infants and children undergoing routine immunization is limited. A randomized controlled study was published demonstrating vapocoolant spray as effective as lidocaine-prilocaine in reducing pain in children age 4 to 6 years receiving DTaP vaccination.\" Cohen-Reis and Holubkov applied either 2.5 grams of lidocaine- prilocaine 5% cream for 60 minutes or a cotton ball saturated with vapocoolant for 15 seconds. In addition, the lidocaine-prilocaine and vapocoolant groups received distraction. A third group constituted the control group and received only distraction. Pain scores by nurses, parents and blind raters were significantly lower for both lidocaine-prilocaine and vapocoolant compared to distraction. Children rated vapocoolant as significantly reducing pain relative to distraction; however children in the lidocaine- prilocaine group did not differ from the control group.'\u00b0 A limitation to this study was that the nurses and parents were not blind to treatment allocation. 33 Efficacy of Sucrose Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose and tastes very sweet. The postulated mechanism of action by which sucrose exerts its analgesic effects is by triggering the release of endogenous opioids. Sucrose analgesia can also be attributed to non-opioid effects. The act of suckling itself has been shown to be analgesic in healthy, full term newborns when the suck rate exceeded 30 sucks per minute.\" The effects of sucrose are rapid and last for three to five minutes.\u00a9*' It has been demonstrated that the calming effects of sucrose are not as effective in older infants compared to newborn infants. For instance, sucrose administered in 6 week old infants is less effective and lasts 1 minute compared to newly born infants where sucrose immediately stops crying and lasts up to 5 minutes. Sucrose has been shown to be effective in reducing distress and crying during immunization in infants 2 weeks to 6 months of age.\" The studies examining sucrose for relief of pain associated with immunization are summarized in Table 2 and discussed below. In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of 10 mL of 25% sucrose plus sucking and parental holding was compared to no intervention in infants aged 6 to 16 weeks receiving DTaP, Hib, Hep B and heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate.\" Infants in the treatment group were given the sucrose in a bottle to suck for 2 minutes prior to immunization. During the procedure parents held their infants on their laps in a cross- cradle position, hugging their infant's upper body close to their chest. All infants were audiotaped during immunization and after immunization for 6 minutes. Heart rate of the infants was also obtained using a cardiac monitor. The length on vaccination time was 34 significantly longer in the treatment group by 5 seconds compared to control group. The treatment group demonstrated significantly less crying compared to the control group infants. Heart rate did not differ between treatment and control groups. The authors explained the non-differential heart rate outcome as a result of lack of sensitivity in their recording methods. A limitation to this study is that it is not possible to determine whether or not all three pain management techniques (sucrose, sucking, and parental holding) are necessary to minimize pain or if there is more benefit of all three compared to one or two techniques. Parents in this study, did however, report that they would prefer to use sucrose, sucking, and parental holding in the future. There are two randomised placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy of sucrose compared to water with no additional interventions.'\" \"! The first study administered 2 mL 75% sucrose or sterile water for 15 seconds in infants aged 2 to 6 months receiving DTP, Hib and oral polio 70 while the second study administered 3 250- uL doses of 50% sucrose or sterile water in 30-second intervals to infants at both their 2 month and 4 month DTP vaccination (infants received the same treatment allocation at both 2 and 4 months).'\"' The primary outcome for both studies was time spent crying. Lewindon et al. also had the nurse and parent rate their infant's distress on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100, where 0 was no distress and 100 was the worst distress possible for the infant. Both studies demonstrated less crying with sucrose compared to placebo. Barr et al. also found that infants overall cried more during their 2 month immunization than their 4 month immunization.\" Lastly, Lewindon et al. found distress as rated by the nurse was significantly lower in the sucrose group compared to the placebo group, however, when rated by parents their was no significant difference.'\" 35 Lastly, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 2 mL 12% oral sucrose solution was compared to placebo or to no intervention in infants aged 2 weeks to 18 months receiving one of Hep B, DTP, DTP-Hib, MMR-Hib or DTP-Hib-Hep B.\" The study solution was administered 2-minutes prior to the injection procedure. Allen and colleagues found that infants aged 2 weeks in the no treatment group cried significantly more than infants in the sucrose and placebo groups. These results were not replicated in older infants. Furthermore, infants receiving two injections cried significantly more than infants receiving one injection. Speed of the immunization procedure was not different between any of the three groups. The results of this study indicate that in the absence of non-nutritive sucking the calming effects of sucrose may not be limited to sucrose alone. In summary, the evidence for the efficacy of sucrose during immunization is limited to younger infants. The International Evidenced-Based Group for Neonatal Pain, recommends a dose of 2 mL sucrose 12 % - 24 % solution, given orally 2 minutes with a pacifier before intramuscular injection in infants.\"? 36 and Ibuprofen Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are often recommended by physicians, nurses and pharmacists for the prevention of adverse reactions associated with childhood immunization including fever, skin induration, swelling, tenderness, pain, and rash or erythema at the site of the injection. Acetaminophen is a non-opiate derivative of p- aminophenol which and a non-steroidal anti- of two optical isomers (/-isomer and d-isomer). Both drugs appear as a white crystalline powder.\" The exact mechanism(s) of action of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are not known. Acetaminophen's mechanism of analgesic action may be through inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, and possibly though blocking pain impulse generation peripherally. For antipyretic effects, acetaminophen likely inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins in the hypothalamus, producing peripheral vasodilation resulting in increased blood flow though the skin, sweating and heat loss. Acetaminophen has minimal anti-inflammatory activity. Ibuprofen's mechanism of analgesic action is likely through a reduction of the activity of prostaglandins, however, unlike acetaminophen this is a peripheral mechanism of action, not central. Similar to acetaminophen, ibuprofen likely produces antipyresis by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the hypothalamus. Ibuprofen also provides anti-inflammatory effects by possibly acting peripherally in the inflamed tissue by reducing prostaglandin activity and inhibiting the synthesis and/or release of prostaglandins.\u00a9 39 The usual dose of acetaminophen in infants and children is 10 \u2014 15 mg/kg orally every 4 \u2014 6 hours with a maximum of 5 doses/24 hours. For ibuprofen, the dose is 5 \u2014 10 mg/kg orally every 6 \u2014 8 hours up to a maximum 40 mg/kg/day. Short term use of therapeutic doses of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe. Serious adverse reactions usually only occur in overdose situations. There are several studies examining the effects of acetaminophen or ibuprofen for treatment and prevention of adverse effects associated with childhood immunization.'*\"* All of these studies examine either diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-whole pertussis (DT wP) vaccine or diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine and are presented in Table 3 and described below. Role of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen for DTaP Immunization The effects of prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen during DTaP immunization were recently investigated in a double-blind randomized placebo- controlled trial (Table 3).'\u00b0 In that study, Jackson et al., compared prophylactic ibuprofen (10mg/kg/dose up to 300mg) to placebo and prophylactic acetaminophen (15mg/kg up to 450mg) to placebo in children aged 4-6 years. Study medication was administered 2 hours before the vaccine followed by 2 more doses at 6-hour intervals. This study did not demonstrate an effect of either drug on reducing fever (38\u00b0C) or any other local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain) when compared to placebo. Since DTaP vaccine is associated with a lower incidence of minor and serious adverse reactions compared to DTwP vaccine (2.9 vs. 9.8 per 100,000 vaccinations),\"' the ability to detect an effect for acetaminophen or ibuprofen was more difficult to achieve with the DTaP vaccine. 40 Role of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen for DT wP Immunization Two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials investigated the efficacy of multiple doses of 'prophylactic' acetaminophen in infants and children aged 2 months to 6 years of age (Table 3).'* '* Both studies administered the first dose at the time of immunization, then gave either three or five additional doses post immunization. The dose of acetaminophen and duration between doses differed between the two studies. In the first study by Ipp et al, acetaminophen (15mg/kg/dose) was administered every 4 hours for 12 hours following immunization' while the latter study by Lewis et al administered acetaminophen (10mg/kg/dose) at 3, 7, 12 and 18 hours following immunization.\" Both studies demonstrated that in infants 2-6 months of age, prophylactic acetaminophen reduced fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), fussiness and pain (as rated by the child's parent). Additionally, Ipp et al also found a significant decrease in the incidence of local redness >2cm, crying and anorexia in the acetaminophen group.'* Neither study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of acetaminophen on adverse reactions in infants >6 months of age. However, this may be due to inadequate sample size. Furthermore, the duration between doses in the Lewis' et al study \" (i.e. 5-6 hours) may have been too long for older infants and children based on the pharmacology of acetaminophen. In another study by Uhari et al\", a single prophylactic dose of acetaminophen (10mg/kg) in infants aged 5 months proved to be ineffective in reducing fever or any other local or systemic reactions (Table 3). Only one study examined the effect of ibuprofen on adverse effects associated with the DTwP vaccine (Table 3).\"' That study compared ibuprofen \"prophylaxis\" 4] (20mg/kg/24 hours given in three equal doses) to ibuprofen (7.5mg/kg/dose) \"rescue\" therapy in infants 3-7 months of age. Prophylactic ibuprofen was associated with a lower incidence of systemic effects including crying, pain, drowsiness and fussiness, and local - effects including inflammatory reactions. Incidence of fever (\u00a938\u00b0C), however, was not different between groups. In summary, the current literature demonstrates that infants two to six months of age undergoing DTwP vaccination may benefit from prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen.' '\" 8 Specifically, 10-15mg/kg/dose acetaminophen administered before or at the time of immunization and every four hours thereafter for a duration of at least 12 hours may help reduce fever, pain, fussiness and local redness.\" \" Ibuprofen (20mg/kg/24 hours given in three equal doses) may help reduce local reactions such as inflammation and pain, along with systemic reactions such as fussiness, unusual crying and drowsiness.'' However these data are limited to DT wP vaccines which are no longer used in North America. The DTaP vaccine has replaced the DTwP because it is associated with less frequent adverse reactions compared to the whole-pertussis vaccine.\" To date published data do not demonstrate a benefit from either prophylactic acetaminophen or ibuprofen for prevention of adverse reactions following DTaP vaccine. Furthermore, it is not clear if older children can benefit from prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen treatment for adverse reactions associated with immunization. Additionally, there is no literature demonstrating acetaminophen or ibuprofen as useful for treatment of adverse reactions associated with other vaccines. Therefore, based on the current literature, acetaminophen and ibuprofen should only be used when needed (i.e. for tenderness or pain after immunization). 42 ev (\u00a20=4) % CT SA % ZI pue (,90=D% d) J d) \u00b0% GE \"SA % LE pure '(60=D% SE SAN EE i \"SA I pue d \"SA \u2014 7 \"SuyTUIO \u2014 7 'SulTJaMS '(S0'0 > 4) % ECT SA% GEO :d SAV 'sqJUOU 9 \u2014 7 'BIxa10Ny '(S00\u00b00 9 \u2014 7 0) 9}\u00a5.19pOUl) UIE ($70'0 > d) % VOC SA% % Pure '% (Q 'SA% 0 \u00b0% 8 SA % Ol id 'SA Y Immunizations The following section gives an overview of non-pharmacological management of pain during immunization. For an in-depth review, the reader is advised to consult the works cited in this section for further information. Breast-feeding during a painful procedure can reduce neonatal pain and distress. There are several postulated mechanisms which breast-feeding or breast-milk provides analgesic effects including; presence of a comfort person, physical sensation (skin to skin contact), diversion of attention, and sweetness of breast milk. Although there are no studies published examining the effects of breast-feeding during immunization, it has been demonstrated as effective during other painful procedures such as venipuncture. It has been suggested that breastfeeding or breast milk should be used in infants undergoing a single painful procedure compared to placebo, positioning or no intervention. However, the effectiveness of breastfeeding or breast milk for multiple procedures has not been established and more research needs to be undertaken in this area. Distraction techniques are designed to shift attention away from procedure-related pain and have been found to be effective in reducing pain and distress during immunization in children.\u00ae\u00b0 Examples of distraction include watching videotapes, counting, listening to music, games, interactive books, and engaging conversation. Uman et al. published a Cochrane review of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents.*\" The purpose of the review was to assess the efficacy of the studies which investigated psychological interventions for needle related pain in children and adolescents. In this review there were 1039 participants undergoing different physiological interventions for pain associated 48 with needle procedures (immunization and injections) and 951 control participants. Interventions which were found to be effective in reducing pain or distress associated with needle-related pain and distress included: distraction (standardized mean differences [SMD] -2.67 -0.27). Other interventions such as memory alteration (changing child's negative memory of past needle experience into positive ones), nurse coaching plus distraction, and information/preparation (regarding the procedure) were shown to be effective as well, however, limited evidence (mainly only one study for each of these interventions). The authors suggest that additional randomized controlled studies in this area are needed.*\u00b0 49 CHAPTER TWO STUDY OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 50 2.1: Primary Objectives The primary objective of this study was to determine the frequency of analgesic use and type of analgesics used by mothers during immunization in their children. 2.2: Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this study was to explore the opinions, beliefs and attitudes of mothers about analgesic use during immunization and the importance of pain management during immunizations in their children. Factors that determined analgesic use were also investigated. 2.3: Research Questions 1. What is the frequency of mothers' analgesic use during immunization in their child? 2. What is the frequency of types of analgesia that are being used by mothers? 3. What are the reasons for using or not using analgesia during immunization? 4.

What factors predict mothers' plan to use analgesia in their newly born infants? 51 CHAPTER THREE METHODS AND MATERIALS 52 3.1: Study Approval This study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of The Hospital for Sick Children, Mount Sinai Hospital and The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario (Appendix B). 3.2: Study Design and Questionnaire Prospective interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire (Appendix C) was designed after an extensive literature search in the following areas: analgesics and other strategies for minimizing immunization pain; attitudes regarding pain management (healthcare workers and family/parents); survey design methods; and infants/children. Questions were constructed according to published guidelines for questionnaire construction and question writing.\u00ae! Consisting mainly of closed-choice questions, the questionnaire inquired about mothers' analgesic use in their children, about mothers' plans for using analgesia in their newly born infants, about mothers' opinions for use of analgesia in children in general and factors that determine their use. Specifically, questions probing at analgesic practices, types of analgesia utilized, non-pharmacologic approaches, opinions on immunization pain, and demographic characteristics (variables that may be important determinants for the utilization of analgesics) were included (Table 4). 53 Table 4.

The survey was then pre-tested on a sample of 10 mothers for clarity, and determination of the time required to complete the questionnaire. 3.3: Study Setting Postnatal ward, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario. For feasibility and suitability purposes Mount Sinai Hospital was chosen as it can accommodate up to 50 mothers with newborns at a time, and has approximately 7,400 deliveries each year. Furthermore, Mount Sinai Hospital draws patients from all across the Greater Toronto Area, lending this study to a diverse sample, representative of a large urban population with varied medical practices, thus improving external validity. 3.4: Study Participants Mothers who had experience with immunization pain. All mothers had at least one other child who had been immunized prior to the birth of the present child. Mothers were chosen rather than fathers because it was the investigators experience that mothers more often accompany their child to routine immunization appointments. 3.5: Consent Process Hospital charts were screened by the research staff for eligible participants. The nurse assigned to the care of a potential patient was asked for permission to approach the patient. This was done to avoid approaching patients who would not be appropriate, for example, those with who did not speak English or those without previous children. If the nurse approved, a research assistant approached the mother with a brief description of the study and provided them with a consent form (Appendix D). All mothers read the consent 56 form which outlined the purpose of the study, the description of the study, potential harms and benefits, alternatives to participating in the study and a statement on confidentiality. After giving the mothers several minutes to read over the form, the research assistant offered to answer any questions they had regarding the study. Once the mothers were satisfied that their queries had been answered, the consent form was signed by mothers who agreed to participation. Each mother was provided with a photocopy of the signed consent form. A second photocopy of the consent form was placed in the mothers chart as per hospital protocol and the original consent form was retained by the investigator of the study. 3.6: Study Procedures After written consent was obtained, one of two study interviewers administered the questionnaire to each participant by reading out loud each question to ensure that the same thing was said to every mother interviewed. Mothers were informed that they could refuse to answer any questions with which they were uncomfortable. The interview lasted between 10 and 20 minutes depending on the length of the responses given by the mother. For inter-rater reliability purposes, 20 of the mothers interviewed had their ~ responses recorded by both study interviewers. While one interviewer conducted the interview and recorded responses, the other interviewer sat quietly and recorded the responses. Each of the interviewers conducted the interview with 10 mothers, and recorded answers with the other 10 mothers. 57 3.7: Outcome Measures The primary outcome for this study was the frequency of analgesic use and type of analgesia used by mothers in their youngest child, other than their newly born infant, before and after routine immunization. Secondary outcomes included analgesic use in all children, opinions about analgesic use and the importance of pain, and factors that determined analgesic use. 3.8: Sample Size Calculation It was determined that 200 interviews would need to be completed for the determination of trends using regression analysis techniques, where 10-15 subjects are required per variable in the model. Additionally, precision (pr) of 5-10% is considered acceptable for this type of research and a sample size of 200 interviews yields 6.9% precision using the formula N = Z'*P(1-P)/pr* where Z = 1.96 for an alpha of 0.05, based on a conservative proportion (P) of 0.50 and pr = 6.9.\" 3.9: Statistical Analysis Analysis was conducted by using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) 14.0 for Windows (v.14.0, North Carolina, USA). Data were analyzed descriptively and reported as a mean (standard deviation) or frequency (percent). Inter- rater reliability was analyzed on 20 mothers using the following formula to calculate Kappa: (po \u2014 pe) / (1 \u2014 pe), where py = observed proportion agreement and p, = expected proportion agreement. T-tests and Mann-Whitney U were used to test differences between groups (mothers who consented to participation and mothers who declined participation). Clinically relevant factors were entered into a backwards logistic regression to predict four dependent variables: analgesia prior to immunization in the 58 youngest child, analgesia after immunization in the youngest child, plan for analgesia in new born infant prior to immunization, and plan for analgesia in newborn infant after immunization. A p-value of > 0.10 was used as the cut off value for removal of individual variables in the model. The following variables were entered into the regression models: number of children, child's fear of needles, family member's fear of needles (including the mother), mother's rating of needle poke pain, amount of money reasonable to pay for analgesia for immunization, doctor giving information about analgesic use for immunization, children's health care provider (paediatrician or family doctor), mother's age, and mother's level of education. Overall model fit was assessed using Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic where p-values of > 0.05 indicate sufficient fit. A p- value < 0.05 was considered significant. 59 CHAPTER FOUR RESULTS 60 4.1: Description of Results The study data collection phase occurred between December 31, 2005 and August 5, 2006. The results of the study are summarized in Tables 5 - 15. A total of 257 mothers who fit the inclusion criteria were approached for consent and 201 consented to participate in the study (78 % of those approached consented to participate) as shown in Figure 1. The number of children did not differ between mothers who consented and mothers who declined (median number of children was 2 (range 2 to 7) and 2 (range 2 to 11), p = 0.26, respectively). Mothers who declined to participate were older in age (mean age of mothers who declined = 35.5 + 4.7 years and mean age of mothers who consented = 33.9 + 4.4 years, p = 0.03). Reasons women gave for declining consent included: not interested/willing to participate (N = 27), feeling unwell either emotionally or physically (N = 13), time constraint due to being discharged (N = 8), survey too long (N = 2), language barrier (N = 2), did not immunize children (N = 1), husband participates in surveys not the wife (N = 1) and did not have more than 1 child (N = 1). Of the 201 consented, 200 interviews were completed. One interview was not completed because the participant was recruited in error as their child was deceased. One study interviewer administered 124 of the questionnaires, while the other interviewer administered the remaining 76 questionnaires. 61 Figure 1. Patient Participation Summary 62 4.2: Participant Characteristics Three of the 200 mothers' answers for practices of analgesic use before and after immunization in their youngest child were not included in the analysis because the child was an adult (over the age of 18 years), thus their practices were not relevant to current practices in childhood. Therefore, data from 197 mothers who reported on analgesic practices of their infants and children were included. All mothers interviewed were able to speak and understand English. The characteristics of the participants, including age, racial background, religious denomination, education and first language, are described in Table 5. The median number of children (new baby included) per mother was 2 (range 2 to 7). The mean age of the children was 3.5 (4 2.3) years, with a range of 11 months to 14 years. | Table 5: Participant Characteristics Characteristics Mothers Respondin In Years, mean (SD), range : 33.9 (4.4), 21 to 46 Backgrout a a Caucasian, N (%) 115 (59.6) Black, N (%) 10 (5.2) Chinese, N (%) 8 (4.1) South Asia, N (%) 5 (2.6) Latin American, N (%) 4 (2.1) Filipino, N (%) 3 (1.6) Other, N (%) 45 (23.3) Catholic, N (%) 81 (45.3) Jewish, N (%) 20 (11.2) Orthodox, N (%) 17 (9.5) Protestant, N (%) 13 (7.3) Eastern Non-Christian, N (%) 14 (7.8) Not Affiliated, N (%) 33 (18.4) 63 Characteristics Mothers Responding ine Not Completed High School, N (%) 1 (0.5) In High School , N (%) 1 (0.5) Completed High School, N (%) 19 (9.7) In College or University, N (%) 9 (4.6) Completed College or University, N (%) 131 (66.5) In Post-Graduate Program, N (%) 3 (1.5) Completed Post-Graduate Program, N (%) 32 (16.2) Other, N (%) 1 (0.5) English, N (%) 130 (66.0) Portuguese, N (%) 10 (5.1) Russian, N (%) 9 (4.6) Spanish, N (%) 6 (3.0) French, N (%) 5 (2.5) Other, N (%) 37 (18.5) HS -Mother's Repo Paediatrician, N (%) 141 (71.6) Family Doctor, N (%) 53 (26.9) Clinic Doctor, N (%) 2 (1.0) Combination of Doctors, N (%) 1 (0.5) 'Child, N (%) 18 (9.1) Mother, N (%) 29 (14.7) Other Family Member, N (%) 16 (8.1) 4.3: Results of the Survey 4,3.1: Inter-rater Reliability There were two survey items that differed between raters.

When analgesic utilization was reported, type of analgesia chosen for prior to and after immunization is presented in Table 7. Reasons mothers gave for medication utilization before and after immunization are presented in Tables 8 and 9. It is important to note here that reasons for medication utilization were provided to the participants and responses were not mutually exclusive. Table 6.

The frequency of mothers who were provided with information from their doctor or nurse on ways to minimize pain caused by immunization is reported in Table 11. Table 11.

Frequency of reported answers for whether or not mothers thought children should receive analgesia for immunization pain is summarized in Table 12. Opinions on whether or not children should receive analgesia for multiple injections at one immunization visit are reported in Table 13. When mothers responded that analgesia should be used for multiple injections, 45.2% responded that one needle is enough to warrant medication, while 20.8% and 6.1% responded two and three needles, respectively, as enough to warrant medication. The majority of mothers thought that parents should receive information about ways to manage pain caused by immunization, and most often said that this information should come from a doctor or nurse (Table 14). Mothers reported an average of $11.5 (4 13.0) and $17.4 ( 74.4) to pay to make immunization pain less for prior to and after immunization, respectively. Table 12.

Additionally, having a family member (not including mother) with needle phobia predicted mothers' use of analgesia before immunization (OR=24.31, 95% CI 2.7, 222.8). Mothers' use of analgesia after immunization was predicted by doctors providing information about use of analgesia after immunization for pain (OR=6.3; 95 % CI 2.5, 16.1). Furthermore, mothers use of analgesia in their child after immunization was predicted by number of children (OR=1.5; 95 % CI 1.01, 2.2). Backwards logistic regression revealed that mothers' plan to use analgesia prior to immunization in their new born infant was predicted by doctor having provided information about use of analgesia for needle poke pain in the past (OR=12.3; 95 % CI 5.7, 26.8). Additionally, each unit increase in mothers' rating of needle poke pain increased the odds of planning to give analgesia to their new born infant before immunization by 1.3 (95% CI 1.1, 1.6, p = 0.05). Having a child with needle phobia had an odds ratio that approached statistical significance (p = 0.06). Having a child with needle phobia was associated with an OR of 2.7 (95% CI 0.9, 8.1) in mothers planning to 70 give analgesia in their newborn infant compared to not having a child with needle phobia. Planning to use analgesia after immunization in their new baby was predicted by a doctor previously providing information to mothers on use of analgesia for minimizing pain after immunization (OR=2.3; 95 % CI 1.4, 5.1) and previous use of analgesia after immunization in their other children (OR=9.7; 95% CI 2.6, 35.6). 71 CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 72 The study found that the majority of mothers interviewed did not use analgesia to minimize pain associated with needle poke pain or soreness after immunization in their child. Furthermore, when analgesics were administered acetaminophen was almost always chosen for before and after immunization. It was also demonstrated that doctors providing information about analgesia for immunization pain predicted mothers' use in their child and their planned use in their new baby. Furthermore, needle phobia in a family member predicted mothers' use of analgesia before immunization and number of children predicted mothers' use of analgesia after immunization. With regards to plan for use of analgesia in their newly born infant, the majority of mothers reported that they would not use analgesia before immunization but would use after immunization. Mothers planned use of analgesia in their new baby was also predicted by how painful they thought a needle poke is and whether or not they had used medication in their children previously. The following discussion interprets the results in light of previous research. Both the strengths and limitations of the study will be addressed along with ethical issues encountered. Finally, the generalizability of the findings will be discussed and future directions will be suggested. 5.1: Strengths of the Study Questionnaire and Interview The study utilized a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. This method of data collection has advantages over other methods such as self-administered questionnaires or mailed questionnaires. Interviewer-administered questionnaires are typically associated with high response, whereas mailed questionnaires have lower 73 response rates.*! The present study had high response rates, with only some responses not provided because of unwillingness on the mothers part (mainly for items such as racial background, religious denomination). Interview studies are also advantageous since there is more control over verifying the identity of the respondent.\u00ae! If a mailed questionnaire had been utilized it could not be certain that the person responding to the questionnaire was the mother. For instance, the mother could have another person, such as her husband, answer the questionnaire. Also, interview questionnaires are advantageous over mailed questionnaires since there is opportunity for the interviewer to be able to clarify responses and probe for answers.\u00ae' In the current study each participant was read the questions by one of two possible trained research assistants which ensured each mother experienced the same interview process. Furthermore, since mothers were able to understand each question by asking for clarifications when necessary, each question was answered. If a self-administered questionnaire had been utilized questions could have been misinterpreted or left unanswered. The questionnaire was constructed so that questions were structured, eliciting yes or no answers. While every effort was made to ensure that each question included all possible response alternatives, mothers were also able to provide alternative responses if necessary. In addition, several open ended questions permitted participants to express their opinions and explain their practices. The structure of the questionnaire yielded high inter-rater reliability. Participants were able to answer each question and the interviewers were able to record the participant's responses with clarifications when necessary. 74 Sample of Participants The present study utilized a sample of mothers that was an ideal and relevant sample of mothers who had already experienced the immunization process and who were also looking to start this process with a new child. This unique sample was able to provide information on past use of analgesia for immunizations and expected use of analgesia during immunizations in their new child. An adequate sample size of 200 mothers was achieved. As previously stated, 200 interviews yields 6.9% precision, and 5- 10% precision is considered acceptable for this type of research.\u00ae Given that 25% of mothers reported using analgesia before immunization, the actual precision is 6.0%. Moreover, 30% of mothers reported using analgesia after immunization, thus the actual precision is 6.4%. Furthermore, mothers took their children to various doctors, therefore their responses were representative of various clinical practices. It is noted that the mothers in the study may have been stressed or anxious after having just experienced the physically and psychologically demanding experience of giving birth and that one may question the reliability of the mothers' answers, specifically whether or not they were able to understand and process the questions accurately. However, there is literature demonstrating that mothers are able to retain and understand information during stressful situations. Jamieson et al. found that after being read a consent form, 71% of labouring women were able to restate the purpose of the study in their own words and 68% were able to state the benefits of the study.*' Since the mothers in the present study were not in a stressful state equivalent to labour, the answers were likely reliable. Furthermore, mothers who may have been under stress were avoided for 75 consent, and some who were approached for consent expressed that they were not physically or emotionally well enough to participate. Lastly, all children reported on in the survey were between the ages of 11 months and 14 years in order to include mothers who would have had access to topical analgesia. The literature on topical analgesics surfaced around 15 years ago, thus mothers with children aged 20 years may not have had access to pain management methods such as topical local anaesthetics, and were therefore not included in the analysis. 5.2: Limitations of the Study As with any questionnaire, it is not possible to verify if the mothers actually did what they reported as their practices and whether or not they utilized medications properly (for example correct dosing). However, in a survey study conducted by Taddio et al. that included paediatricians in the Greater Toronto Area, similar trends were reported.'! The results of the current study demonstrated similar results with mothers reporting to use analgesia after immunization when needed and rarely using topical local anaesthetics for needle poke pain. The current study may have introduced bias by interviewing about practices and opinions regarding pain in infants and children, a topic which may be associated with social approval or disapproval. Thus, mothers may have felt the need to idealize their responses regarding the importance of treating pain to provide an answer they considered socially acceptable. For instance, the current study found that mothers often thought that analgesia should be used to treat pain during childhood immunization yet many did not treat immunization pain in their own child. Furthermore, opinions about pain and the importance of treating pain associated with immunizations may have been influenced by 76 events surrounding birth. For example, mothers may have changed their opinions after having gone through the painful experience of labour. Sex Differences The current study did not ask mothers for the sex of their child for which they were reporting analgesic practices. The literature regarding sex differences is unclear. Some research has indicated that sex differences exist for parent's perceptions of pain in their children.\" Specifically, parents have been shown to believe that boys should learn to tolerate pain and cope with pain on their own compared to girls.*\" Other studies show no influence of sex on treatment of pain associated day surgery in children aged 1 to 6 years by sex or in parental perceptions of pain associated with minor childhood injuries in children aged 15 to 40 months.*\" ? Although it may have been beneficial to record sex of immunized child so as to contribute to the current literature, it was not an objective of the current study to do so. 5.3: Ethical Considerations Recruitment The study encountered 17 mothers who refused consent because they were not feeling well either emotionally or physically. One mother had consented and then it was discovered that her child had died at a young age. Although it may have been less intrusive to approach eligible participants for consent at a paediatrician's office, the disadvantages of recruiting in this situation would have complicated the study. For instance, many paediatricians' offices would have to have been visited to avoid any sampling biases. The setting and method for obtaining informed consent in the present 77 study was acceptable and provided a convenient way to obtain a sample of mothers with different experiences. 5.4: Generalizability of Findings The study was conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital which is a large urban center drawing an ethically diverse patient population from the Greater Toronto Area. In a 2001 census statement by Statistics Canada it was revealed that the five most visible minorities of women in Toronto were Chinese (10.5 %), South Asian (9.8 %), Black (8.8 %), Filipino (3.9 %) and Latin American (2.2 %). The study included all of these minorities (Table 5). Furthermore, the 2001 census statement showed that 89.7 % of women aged 20-34 and 83.3 % of women aged 35-44 had completed at least some post-secondary education if not had a degree or diploma. Our sample represented this finding, 84 % of the mothers interviewed were educated at the post secondary level. Christianity is the largest religious group in Toronto, and the 2001 census statement reported that 31.1 % of Toronto's population is Catholic. Similarly, 41 % of the mothers interviewed were Catholic. According to the 2001 census statement by Statistics Canada the present study accurately represented the demographics of the GTA, however, the study was limited by recruiting only English speaking women. Thus, it cannot be said if these results are generalizable to the GTA, other large urban cities and rural settings. 5.5: Implications of the Results The results of this study indicate a barrier between the knowledge that health care providers have access to and the information accessible to parents. It was shown that mothers underutilized currently available methods of minimizing pain during routine immunization in their children, especially for pain associated with the needle poke. And 78 although the majority of mothers did not use analgesia after immunization this was because they didn't think their child needed it. The most common reasons for not using medication before immunization were not knowing about the option and failure for physician or nurse recommendation. Furthermore, mothers often said that their doctor did not provide them with information about ways to minimize pain associated with the poke of the needle during immunization. Some of the literature has sought to explain possible reasons for why analgesics such as lidocaine-prilocaine and other interventions have not been integrated into clinical practice. Reasons generally provided are practical issues expressed by health care providers such as inconvenience and cost.\u00b0' However, it is questionable as to whether or not parents, who are large stakeholders in the management of paediatric pain, would agree with not using medication for these reasons. In the present study inconvenience and cost were not given as reasons for under-utilization of analgesics during immunizations. The amount of money parents expressed as reasonable to pay to make pain less in their children were well above the range of current treatment methods available. On average parents said reasonable amounts to pay for before was $11.50 (+13.0) and $17.4 (+ 74.4) Canadian funds for after, when in clinical practice the cost of topical analgesia is $0.50- 9.00 Canadian funds per patient dose (i.e., vapocoolant and lidocaine-prilocaine) and oral analgesia is < $2 per 500 mg (both acetaminophen and ibuprofen).\"\" The present study further indicates that mothers are unaware or misinformed of their options for treating pain associated with needle puncture; however, mothers seem to be knowledgeable in treating pain after the immunization if necessary. Interestingly, mothers who reported administering medication for pain associated with the needle poke, 79 most often reported using acetaminophen. Mothers also reported that when their doctor did provide them with information about ways to reduce pain they almost always recommended acetaminophen or ibuprofen for both pain associated with the needle and soreness after. However, acetaminophen and ibuprofen have not been shown to minimize pain from acute insults such as a needle poke. Instead, these drugs are often recommended prophylactically to prevent adverse reactions associated with immunization. Thus it is questionable as to whether or not mothers are misinterpreting information provided to them by their doctor or if they are being misinformed of the reasons for administering medication. A meaningful piece of information to arise from this study is the finding that doctors providing information to mothers about ways to reduce immunization pain through the use of analgesia is predictive of mothers' actual use of analgesia in their children. Past research has demonstrated that parents have trust in their child's physician. In a study of 485 parents, a mean total score of 45.4 out of a possible 55 indicated a high level of trust in child's physician by the parent.\u00ae* Furthermore, it was demonstrated that parents whose children were enrolled in Medicaid had higher trust in their physician than those with private insurance. Moseley et al. explains that parents with private health care are possibly more informed consumers and are more active participants in their child's health care compared to those with free health care. Additionally, Moseley et al. found that parents with children younger than 3 years of age displayed more trust than those with no children younger than 3 years of age.\u00ae* These findings are applicable to the setting of the current study where children have free health care and immunizations start at a young age. Therefore, it would be beneficial for physicians and paediatricians to 80 target parents with their new babies for disseminating information about ways to manage pain during immunizations as they may be more trusting of their health care provider compared to parents with older children. Furthermore, since mothers' plan for analgesia after immunization in their new baby was predicted by use in their previous children, new parents are ideal to target for use in future children as well. It is important to note however, that although mothers often thought that children should receive analgesia for pain associated with immunization, many mothers did not implement this opinion into practice. Furthermore, although more mothers planned to treat pain in their newly born infant compared to their past child, this increase was lower than we would like to see. This suggests that perhaps mothers do not think pain is an important issue and that having information on the topic may not be enough. Health care providers need to empower mothers to treat their child's pain and value the importance of the issue. 5.6: Future Directions Health care providers and researchers need to look at barriers to providing information about ways to minimize and manage pain during immunizations in children. The following suggestions are ways in which health care workers and researchers can assist in bridging the gap between research and clinical practice and furthermore empower parents to take an active role in advocating for adequate pain management for their children. Involvement from Government Agencies The Public Heath Agency of Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization publishes the Canadian Immunization Guide.** While this source contains 81 national guidelines for childhood immunization practices, virtually no information regarding the management of pain associated with immunizations is identified in this important document. The Canadian Coalition for Immunization Awareness and Promotion (CCIAP) is - another major stakeholder whose mandate is to \"contribute to the control/elimination/eradication of vaccine preventable diseases in Canada by increasing awareness of the benefits and risks of immunization for all ages via education, promotion, advocacy and media relations\".** Consistent with the Canadian Immunization Guide, there appears to be no information on the CCIAP website regarding the management of pain for routine immunizations. Given the connection between the pain and anxiety associated with immunizations and parents' non-compliance '\u00b0, it is in the best interest of key stakeholders such as CCIAP to promote pain management of routine immunizations. Parents and children may be more likely to comply with national immunization recommendations if they receive information about ways to reduce the pain and anxiety associated with immunizations. Simply put, if vaccines are associated with a less painful experience parents and children may be more likely to comply with the national recommendations.\" Currently in Canada a consensus statement for pain management of immunizations does not exist. In 2005 The Royal Australian College of Physicians (RACP) issued a guideline statement entitled The Management for Procedure Related Pain in Children and Adolescents.*' With regards to immunization practices, the RACP recommends that health care providers should consider methods to reduce pain when administering immunizations to infants and children. Specifically the use of 0.5-1g of 82 lidocaine-prilocaine, 60-90 minutes prior to the injection and swaddling and containment is recommended for infants. For children, topical anaesthetics applied prior to the immunization, vapocoolant spray 15 seconds prior to the shot and distraction, relaxation and coping techniques are all recommended.\u00ae*' It is recommended that Canada adopt a similar guideline statement for the management of immunization pain in infants and children. Collaboration between researchers and stakeholders is a fundamental step as the stakeholders often have established combined voices and can indicate to the public and policy makers that this issue is important and deserves their attention. The inherent challenge in the formation of alliances is convincing key stakeholders to support and value research on pain and pain management for childhood immunizations. Educational Resources Targeting Parents A significant number of mothers in the current study believed that parents should have information about ways to reduce their children's pain during immunizations. Pamphlets and posters outlining ways to manage immunization pain could be developed targeting parents and made available in a variety of health care settings such as physician offices, labour and delivery units of hospitals and public health care centres. Parents and children often are required to wait in a waiting room before they are seen by the doctor or nurse. This waiting time provides an excellent opportunity for parents to pick up information pamphlets or read information on posters. The majority of mothers in the sample indicated that they subscribe or regularly read the publication, Today's Parent. Given that Today's Parent is a highly subscribed publication, submission of an article outlining what parents can do to help reduce the pain 83 of childhood immunization to the magazine could be functional, as it is a direct connection to many Canadian parents. Educational Workshops for Health Care Providers Following from the work by Gaskell et al. who developed a 'study day' program aimed at community nursing staff involved in the delivery of childhood immunizations, similar workshops should be provided to a variety of health care professionals including nurses, family doctors, paediatricians and birthing counsellors/centres.**\u00ae Gaskell's et al. program aimed to enhance participant's awareness of the fear associated with immunization in children and to teach strategies to help children and parents cope better with the immunization process.*\u00ae An evaluation of their study revealed that all the participants said that they would recommend the 'study day' to their colleagues.*\u00ae 5.7: Conclusions The current study found that mothers did not use analgesia for routine immunization in their children, especially for pain related to the poke of the needle. The major predictor of mothers' use of analgesia in their children for routine immunizations is having a doctor provide information on ways to manage pain during and after the procedure. Immunizations are a required procedure in children and parents should be granted clear, accessible and evidence-based information about the pain associated with immunizations and the interventions (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) that exist to alleviate and reduce the pain associated with immunizations. Currently we do not have all the answers and more research is needed to determine the impact of immunization pain on children and on ways to decrease pain during childhood 84 immunization. Future research is also required to assess strategies to improve parental knowledge and increase physicians' values of treating immunization pain. 85 References 1.

Before agreeing to participate in this study, it is important that you read and understand the following explanation of the proposed study procedures. The following information describes the purpose, procedures, benefits, discomforts, risks and precautions associated with this study. It also describes your right to refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time. In order to decide whether you wish to participate in this research study, you should understand enough about its risks and benefits to be able to make an informed decision. This is known as the informed consent process. Please ask the study doctor or study staff to explain any words you don't understand before signing this consent form. Make sure all your questions have been answered to your satisfaction before signing this document. Purpose Infants and children undergo routine immunizations as part of their medical care. Immunizations can be painful and researchers have studied some different ways reduce pain. We don't know, however, how mothers and doctors feel about pain during immunization and if they think it is important enough to treat. The aim of this study is to find out what mothers and doctors think about immunization pain and what they do when children are immunized. Procedures We will use surveys to find out what mothers and doctors think about pain in children having immunizations. Mothers from the postnatal ward at Mount Sinai Hospital will be included. Doctors will be surveyed separately. If you agree to participate, we will ask you questions about your previous experiences with immunization pain in your children and your opinions about pain during immunization. Two separate groups of mothers will be interviewed: 1. The first 30 mothers that participate will be asked to participate in an open-ended interview which will take approximately 20-30 minutes. We will ask your permission to audiotape the interview and you will be asked to sign a separate audiotape consent form. 2. The next 250 mothers will participate in a different version of the interview (close-ended) which will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. We will ask 20 of these mothers to participate in this interview twice so that we can make sure that our interviewer collects responses in the same way. Risks 110 There are no known risks associated with participation in this study. Potential Discomforts or Inconvenience The interview will take 10-30 minutes to complete. Benefits You may or may not receive any medical benefit from your participation in this study. Information learned from this study may benefit other patients in the future. The results of this study may help us to better target information to interested parents about managing pain during routine immunizations.
