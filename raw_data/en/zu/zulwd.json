We are glad to have you with us as members of our community. We hope that this handbook will answer your questions about the operation and organization of our school . If you have questions that are not covered he re, please direct them to you r Faculty Chair or the appropriate Coordinator , or feel free to contact the LS or HS front office and ask any of our staff members. Mission Statement At Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor, we nurture children in their growth from Early Childhood through Grade 12. Our curriculum engages the head, heart and hands, inspiring curiosity, thinking, empathy and initiative. Our graduates enter adulthood with confidence and self -knowledge, a deep interest in other people, and an understanding of the world; prepared to thrive i n higher education and their adult lives. In all that we do we take the following as our guiding principles : We recognize that children's needs, interests, strengths and challenges evolve from their early childhood years through high school graduation. Our curriculum is consciously designed to best meet each developmental stage as children grow, providing the right experience at the appropriate time. We seek to work together in ways that increase the diversity of our school community and promote equity and inclusion for all community members regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, financial means, sexual orientation, sexual identity, gender, or disability status. This includes ensuring that we have a continually evolving curriculum that meets all our st udents. Relationships are what make our work possible - between students and teachers, among classmates, among faculty members, between all community members - and we consciously strive to foster and support healthy relationships in all areas of our comm unity. Human beings are individuals with their own personal strengths, challenges, and interests. We seek to meet each community member with love and care, ensuring that there is flexibility and support in our classrooms, policies and practices, and com munity expectations. Children are best supported when there is partnership between home and school. We seek to provide parent support, education and engagement, and we ask that parents collaboratively work with teachers in the same way. Each community member is a whole human being: body, soul and spirit. Our faculty and staff members draw insight and inspiration from the work of Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy. Through our curriculum, policies, employment agreements, community expectations and serv ices beyond the classroom we strive to fully engage all community members and create a culture of purposeful activity and joy. Through our community life we respect and support the inner development and growth of our community members, sharing the celebr ation of festivals, athletic competition, artistic work and study. Lower School Campus (LS) 2775 Newport Road, Ann Arbor, MI High School Campus (HS) 2230 Pontiac Trail, Ann Arbor MI PreK & Kindergarten PreK -K or EC Early Childhood Grades 1-8 Grades High School (9-12) HS ALL - EC through Grade 12 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Introduction 2 Collaboration and shared responsibility are the foundations of our school governance and leadership model. We work with consensus within all governance groups. We are committed to a tran sparent and cooperative process for all significant decisions in the school. Waldorf Education The first Waldorf school was founded in Stuttgart, Germany in 1919. It was based on the work of Rudolf Steiner (1861 - 1925), an Austrian -born scientist, educator , artist and philosopher. Steiner based the curriculum of the Waldorf schools on his belief that it was critical to call forth all of the child's innate capacities, not just the intellect or particular v ocational skills. He established his first school for the children of the employees at a local factory. Starting from this single school, Waldorf education has become one of the most rapidly growing school movements in the world today. There are now over 1 ,050 Waldorf schools worldwide, and 1800 Early Childh ood programs, and we are proud to be part of this as Waldorf Education approaches its 100th Anniversary. At our school, we strive to implement the complete Waldorf curriculum, and we seek fully trained Waldorf teachers for every full -time position. We bel ieve that the spirit of the curriculum is as valid today as it was when originally formulated in 1919. We also feel strongly that it is not only consonant with the spirit of Waldorf education, but also inherent in that spirit that the curriculum be constan tly renewed out of contemporary insights. We feel that the best education should help students not only to become knowledgeable adults, but also inwardly free, secure and creative people in later life. We wish to educate human beings who have confidence in themselves and are prepared to meet the challenges of our rapidly changing society. We strive to help students see connections between disciplines, to synthesize and integrate information, and to love learning throughout their lives. The Waldorf curricu lum is developmental. In each grade, the activities and lessons are tailored to the child's changing sense of self and relationship to the world and others. The curriculum recognizes that one must address different aspects of the child's nature at differen t ages. Subjects are taught in a \"block\" method in which several weeks of intensive study are devoted to a single subject. The integration of academics, the arts and practical skills lies at the heart of the Waldorf curriculum. This comprehensive curriculum means that all students follow the same enriched course of study. Our goal is to help each student develop his or her many capacities and capabilities. Some electives are offered in the high school years, but the core classes are the same for all stu dents. Materials are presented to our students orally by the classroom teacher initially. As the students grow older, reference books, classic literature and original source material increasingly supplement the Class Teacher's oral presentations. Student s create their own \"textbooks\" in most subjects by synthesizing the material presented in class. These beautiful books incorporate factual information with art, creative writing, scientific observations, and maps. Increasing in complexity and depth as the students mature, these books are wonderful lasting records of each child's capabilities and gifts. Waldorf Class Teachers specialize not in a subject or a grade, but rather in a specific group of students. Classroom teachers stay with their students for at least Grades 1 -5, and sometimes for Grades 1 -8. This means that our teachers have long -term knowledge of how each student learns best, what their motivations and hopes are, and a deep relationship with that child. This strong investment in each studen t's success helps the Class Teacher shape each classroom into a tightly bonded community, which extends to the families in the school. These personal relationships and sense of community are treasured by our students, their families and the faculty . Each student will venture into the wider world assured of his or her worth and abilities because of the surety of this community. History of our School Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor (RSSAA) opened its doors with G rades 1 through 4 on September 4, 1980 in a small three -room building on Packard Road near historic Cobblestone Farm. Behind the school 's opening were decades of work in the community by many people, including Dr. Ernst Katz (Prof. Emeritus of Physics, University of Michigan) and Mrs. Ruth Nilss on, a parent and teacher who was instrumental in founding the school . 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Introduction 3 The school 's third year saw a move to a leased building on ten acres in York Township, necessitated by continued growth and the addition of our K indergarten. A new first grade was added each succeeding year, with the 1984 -85 school year marking the first time that the LS had its full complement of K indergar ten through 8th grade classes. Being in Milan was very challenging for the school : most of our students came from Ann Arbor and had t o be bussed in. The building itself was not large enough to accommodate our expansion to a full K -8 program, nor did its design really meet our needs. It was extremely fortunate that we were able to purchase our Newport Road campus in 1986. With our move b ack to Ann Arbor in 1986, we had room to grow. Steady and rapid growth in enrollment continued to reflect the community's response to the value of our educational program. The growth of the school was supported by an active parent body that worked closely with the faculty on tasks such as publicity, fundraising, and recruitment. Such involvement was essential in helping the school to confront first the challenges of its infancy, and now the new challen ges brought by continued growth. Our HS opened in fall 1997 in a leased facility, the Genesis Building on Packard Road, completing the vision of the founding teachers an d parents to have a full PreK through Grade 12 program. In October 2001, a six -acre pro perty located on Pontiac Trail was purchased to be the permanent home for our growing HS. After extensive renovations to the building and site, the new campus opened for classes in fall 2002. The steady growth of our programs led to the need for expanded space on our Lower School campus. In the fall of 2016, we were proud to open our new middle school building, an airy, light- filled space dedicated to our growing adolescents. Our high school celebrated its 20th Anniversary in the 2017 -18 school year and we find our school continuing to grow as it meets the needs of the next generation. Supporting our amazing academic programs and offering a home to our championship sports teams is a priority that we're committed to. In the fall of 2018, we completed o ur high school expansion project, adding a full -size gymnasium, dedicated eurythmy space, a new life sciences laboratory and additional classrooms. In 2019- 20, the 100th anniversary of Waldorf education was honored with a worldwide celebration . Cultural Aw areness Position Statement Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor welcomes students, parents, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds. We are committed to developing the human potential of every child. We respect each individual's ethnicity, ancestry, nati onality, native language, socioeconomic background, family structure, age, religion, belief system, abilities, appearance, gender, sexual identity, sexual orientation, occupation, and political affiliation. It is a goal of our educational vision to bring students to an understanding and experience of the common humanity of all the world's people. We recognize that the richness inherent in a school comes not only from the curriculum, but also from the community of students who are learning about the world t ogether. To this end, we are building a school that represents the community in which we are located and the world in which we live. As a school we actively seek ways to nurture inclusiveness through: The ongoing development of a rich and engaging curricul um where students experience various cultural and historical perspectives The engagement of faculty and administration members in relevant trainings, discussions and studies Promoting cultural awareness through community events and meetings Facilitating co mmunication among students, parents, teachers, staff, and the school b oard Creating ongoing opportunities for raising awareness and building trust We reject racism in all its forms and embrace the principles of common humanity expressed by the founder of Waldorf education, Rudolf Steiner. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 4 Early Childhoo d Mixed -Age Pre -School and Kindergarten Program Our Early Childhood (EC) program is d esigned by our Waldorf -Certified faculty with a unique daily rhythm that is filled with reverence for the magic of early childhood. Our mixed -age Pre -School and Kindergarten p rograms work with children 3 to 6 years of age. Students under the age of six or seven learn primar ily through imitation and activity. Thus, in our Early Childhood program the students engage in creative play with in a home -like environment , with simple, natural materials that encourage imagination and sensory development . Rhythms of the seasons and fest ivals are woven into the daily activities. We currently offer three, four and five half- or full -day options for our EC program. Three -day program takes place on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday Four -day program take s place Monday through Thursday Five-day program takes place Monday through Friday Families in the four -day class must commit to staying three or four days for the school year. This is a stand -alone class. Families wishing to change from four to five day or from half to full day should first communicate with the class teacher and work with the EC Coordinator so that a new contract can be issued. Golde n Eagle s Program In the last year of Kindergarten, we prepare our students for a successful Grade One year through the Golden Eagles curriculum. This approach allows us to maximize the important relationships between young students and their teacher, betw een parents and the class teacher, and among classmates, while still allowing the older kindergarten students to progress developmentally and build capacities and skills that will be needed for Grade One success. The Golden Eagles program is brought to th e children within their mixed- age classrooms . Our Golden Eagle program is designed to encompass the five-full-day schedule, which helps the children to build their physical and social skills, as well as stamina for the day to best prepare them for Grade One. If families choose to enroll their children in a four day or half day option, they will need to remain in close contact with their child's teacher about their child's development in relation to the goals of the Golden Eagle program. Ideally , children will have transitioned to five full days after returning to school from the winter break in January. Transitioning to the five-full-day schedule by this point in the year is valuable in relationship to the children's physical skills and connection to thei r class. Our Grade One teachers have also noted a significant difference in the children who attended K indergarten for five full days before entering Grade One , noting how much easier it was for them to manage the grade school schedule. At any point, a par ent can choose to have a conversation with their teacher about whether the Golden Eagle Program seems like the right fit for their child or if they feel it would be best to delay that placement until the next year. Admissions Criteria Students in our Pre -Kindergarten and Kindergarten programs must be toilet trained according to State of Michigan (LARA) Childcare Licensing requirements. Children must be ready to be in a classroom as evidenced by ability to communicate their needs and follow the teacher's in structions. Children need to be at least 2 years and 9 months to be enrolled in our Pre-School and/or Kindergarten classroom . To b e included in our Golden Eagle program, children should preferably turn 6 by June 1 of the school year. Wait Pool If all spaces are filled in the program when your child is admitted, you will be placed in a wait pool. If spaces in the program open , offers are made to families based on program availability and not necessarily in order of application. Criteria include the day length option parents have requested for their child (3 day, 4 day, 5 day) and the child's age, due to age -based Teacher : Student ratios for our program. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 5 Early Chil dhood Faculty and Staff Our Early Childhood F aculty and staff participate in on -going professional development in Waldorf Early Childhood Education, child development, health and safety requirements, CPR, First Aid and Blood Borne Pathogens. The following teacher/child ratios for each age group help to ensure a quality program: Preschoolers 2 years 9 months to 4 years 1 teacher to 8 children Kindergarteners 5 to 6 years 1 teacher to 10 children In our mixed- age Kindergarten classrooms, our ratio is at least 1 teacher to 8 children. Rhythm and Daily Schedule We recognize the importance that rhythm and simplicity play in young children's lives. We strive to support them by keeping the same daily rhythm and holding the children in a sense of security about what happens next and what is to be expected. In Early Childhood , we are guided by daily, weekly and seasonal activities which provide this essential experience for the child. Each morning begins with pla y in the woods followed by time indoors when we greet the day, sing , and move together in our Language Arts Circle. A wholesome snack and outdoor recess are also part of the daily rhythm. A time for creative play comes next, during which the teachers engag e in their weekly activities such as laundering or bread making with the students happily joining in to hel p. This is also a time when the students enjoy the use of various handmade, natural -fiber toys and costumes. Each day highlights a special artistic a ctivity such as watercolor painting, drawing and beeswax modeling . We may also include Eurythmy blocks during the year . Next comes tidying up, bathroom visits, snack time, washing up and story. A closing circle leads us to outdoor play, which ends the mo rning. Children who stay for the full-day option will return indoors for lunch (provided from home) a nd rest time. The full day ends with another outdoor play period and the option to continue for Aftercare. Academics in the EC are introduced in a natur al and age -appropriate manner and woven in throughout the da y. Mathematics, science, world language s, movement, language arts and artistic work are infused in our daily activities and are closely supported by our teachers. For the children who are approach ing the transition to Grade One we offer a Golden Eagles program of skill -building activities throughout the year. Beginning in January they may also be offered blocks of special subjects, such as woodwork and gardening , depending on the Lower School schedule . Dropping Off and Picking Up Your Student The EC day begins with a n outdoor Morning Greeting Circle to greet the day and each other. After the c ircle ends, families who have stayed for the c ircle say their goodbyes and the students begin their walk and outside playtime. We often find that a short and sweet goodbye helps the child to separate and join their friends. For children who have difficulty saying goodbye, this c ircle serves as a gent le transition. By keeping your farewell routine consistent (at the end of the c ircle and song, you hug and say goodbye), children will grow increasingly comfortable knowing what to expect each morning. If you anticipate your child having difficulty with transitions, please feel free to talk to your child's teacher ahead of time. If your child arrives after morning play has begun, please accompany them to where their class is : either on our walk around the soccer field or playing in the designated outdoor space of your child's class. Please be sure to connect with one of the EC Faculty so they are aware of your child's arrival. If you arrive after 9:30 am, please check in at the Front Office to sign you child in and then walk them to the classroom . There are signs on the bulletin boards near the main office and near the b lacktop entrance that state where each class is playing in the morning. This is helpful in case they are not in the classroom by 9:30 am . Sometimes it is difficult for children to enter in to play easily when they arrive after our morning has already started. Beginning the day together with the other student s help s to establish a good rhythm for your child and helps them more fully integrate socially. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 6 If your child is to be picked up by som eone other than yourself, please let the teacher know in writing, by phone, or by emailing the school at lsattendance@steinerschool.org in a timely ma nner. The person must be on the Child Information Card (CIC) that you filled out electronically upon enrol lment. Staff will ask for photo ID from adults listed on your child's CIC form at the time of pick up. There are places near each classroom door where notes can be left in the morning for the teacher to check before pick -up. It is very important that the staff knows who will be picking up the students each day. If you have a last -minute change regarding your student's pick -up arrangement , please call the front office at 734 -995- 4141 and let the staff know your change of plans. If the person picking up your child is not on your CIC we ask that you please call the front office with your request. The person picking up must have their photo ID with them. The school assumes responsibility for all enrolled children from the time between sign -in and sign -out by families. Families are responsible for the safety fo r their children at all other times. See Lower School Campus Practical Matters ( EC-8) for full details on Drop Off and Pick Up of students. Aftercare Programs Aftercare is offered from 3 - 5 pm, with a provided snack, plenty of time to play both outside and inside, and optional participation in crafts and games. Aftercare staff includes staff members from the full -day EC option to ensure consistency and comfort for our youngest students unti l the end of their day. Advanced registration for Aftercare may be scheduled by the day, week, month or year. Aftercare also has drop -in options available. Advanced registration and drop -in forms are available in the front office. Families will be sent separate monthly bills for all Aftercare services. EC familie s who have chosen \"All Day\" have Afterc are included in their contract and will not receive separate billing. EC children not picked up by 3:10 pm will be charged for Aftercare.

Snack Snack time, from food preparation to the enjoyment and social quality of sharing a meal, is a significant element of our morning in the EC. We provide wholesome food with organic ingredients and produce from local farm s whenever possible throughout the year. Snacks are arr anged in a weekly rhythm and they include whole grains or home -baked bread, vegetables and fruits. Because we have an active outdoor play time , it will be important for you r child to have a hearty breakfast before arriving at school. If you have any special concerns regarding allergies or dietary practices of your family, please be sure to discuss them with your child's teacher. Health and Safety The State of Michigan requi res that each student have a completed health and immunization form or original waiver on file in the Front Office. It is also important that an up -to-date emergency form (CIC) be on file so that the appropriate persons may be contacted in case of emergenc y if the parent is unreachable. Please be sure to inform your child's teacher and indicate on the emergency form if your child has any allergies. The teachers share with you a deep concern for your child's physical and emotional health. Any child with an infectious condition or communicable disease must remain at home. Please let your child's teacher and the office know if your child has contracted a communicable illness including but not limited to, chicken pox, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza (the flu), lice or strep throat . The best environment for a sick child is to be resting at home. If a student is not well enough to participate in all EC activities, including going outdoors, then they should be kept home. Guidelines for when it is appropriate to have your student return to school following certain illnesses: 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 7 24-48 hours after a fever has ended 24-48 hours after the last experience of vomiting or diarrhea Once pink eye has ceased to cause runny eyes 24 hours after beginning a course of antibiotics After lice treatment has been applied The teachers will make every effort to support you in keepin g your child healthy. The number one, most important defense against all illness is hand washing. We will be monitoring this closely at school and encourage you to please reiterate this at home with your child. If your child's temperature is above the gui delines below, please keep them home. If they still have a fever at 1 pm, please keep them home the following day. Oral Temp 100 By Ear 101 Under Arm 99 Temporal/Forehead 100.4 Teachers appreciate being informed of disturbances in your child's routin e. If your child has had a poor night's sleep or a cough, etc., a note on the dresser inside of each classroom is an effective way to communicate these minor changes. See the All-School Health, Illness and Medication section for information on medications and immunizations. Communication Before the school year starts , the Early Childhood Coordinator provides families with their child's Lead T eacher contact information . The Lead Teacher will let families know the best ways and times to be in touch. If you have any concerns or questions about your child, please contact the teacher directly by phone to set up an in -person meeting. In our experience, emailing is best utilized for coordinating meetings and details/logistical questions rather than sharing classroom concerns about specific children or situations. Conferences are also scheduled twice a year, one in November and one in February, and provide a time to discuss your child's school experience and development. If you have any further questions or concerns about the classroom or things that are happening at school, please see the All-School Policies and Procedures section of this handbook . Required Documents The following forms need to be completed and/or submitted in your FACTS Family Portal before a child's first day: Signed Child Information Card (CIC) Signed MICR form (noting consent or dissent) Immunization Record or signed DHHS immunization waiver Signed health statement Signed handbook statement Signed statement of licensing handbook Signed Media Release Signed Artwork Release Any additional information from a child's physician as needed (e.g. allergy medicatio n/plan , asthma medicatio n/plan, etc.) The following forms must be completed and returned within 30 days of initial enrollment: Physical Evaluation signed by physician or the physician's designee o Preschoolers (ages 3 -4) - within the preceding 12 months Returning families must: Annually review Child Information Card and update as needed Annually complete and sign health statement 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 8 Return a physical evaluation signed by a physician or physician's designee o Preschoolers (ages 3 -4) - every 2 years Absences Please call the Lower School office or email lsattendance@steinerschool.org by 8:45 am if your child will not be attending school that day for any reason. Please alert your child's teacher if you know ahead of time that your child will be out of school. If your student has a change in their schedule, a note from home should indic ate the nature of the change, i.e., going home with a friend. When you do this, we know that you are aware of this schedule change and we can ensure that your student is being taken care of properly. Parent Meetings and Educational Events Throughout the y ear there are numerous times where we can come together to hear about what is going on in the classroom, join in study and have conversations about how to best support our children. Parent meetings are held regularly by your child's teacher. The school ho sts a few events during the year that are open to families to come and hear a guest speaker talk. Please see the school calendar online at www.steinerschool.org and look for announcements through ParentSquare for upcoming events and topics. Parent Partici pation Parent involvement in the life of our school is a wonderful way to build a healthy, vibrant community. Please talk to your teacher to learn how you can help! Parent Council Parent Council works together with the Board of Trustees, parents, faculty a nd administration to help create a thriving, cohesive community , guided by the principles of Waldorf education. Some of the ways in which Parent Council supports the school is by organizing drives, craft mornings , Winter Festival and much more. Attend a Parent Council meeting to learn more about how you can join in. Birthdays We like to invite each family to join us in class to celebrate their child's birthday. It is a wonderful time for you to experience our day. As your child's birthday approaches, your Class Teacher will be in communication about how you can be a part of the celebration. Birthdays are an exciting time to celebrate a special day in your child's life, and many times children want some of their f ellow classmates to celebrate with them. We ask that party invitations are not handed out at school. Children love to get mail, and that is a great way to send invitations! Media The EC program tries to create an environment that is filled with opportun ity to grow and engage the young child's imagination to its fullest potential. We provide a media free environment for the young children in our care. As EC teachers we observe the students in their play and social interactions with their peers daily . There are situations when media affects children's ability to engage their true imagination or their ability to navigate through social situations with their peers. In such cases, when media begins to influence a child, a group of children, or the class, w e will inform you and see what we can all do to help move the situation along. We ask that media exposure be as limited as possible for the young child, especially during the school week. We also understand that technology is a part of today's world , and we seek to honor each family's own decision concern ing this matter. Early Childhood/Parent Library This lovely collection of books and periodicals, especially relevant to RSSAA EC families , is available to the community for self-checkout. We have children 's picture books along with information on parenting, child development, and Waldorf education. Books on Waldorf crafts, festivals, food, songs, and stories are also here. A librarian is available to assist with 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Early Childhood 9 checkout and return on Tuesday mornings betw een 8:30 am and 9:30 am. The library is in the Parent Community Space/School Store. Grade One Admissions Policy The optimum birthdate for a student entering Grade One at RSSAA is 6 years of age by June 1. This information will be communicated to intere sted parents at the beginning of the admissions process. Protocol for Golden Eagle Students At the February Parent -Teacher Conferences, before a child's Golden Eagle year, teachers will have a more in -depth conversation with parents of all children with la te spring or summer birthdays. This is especially important if the teacher is seeing challenges with the child in the classroom that may indicate the need for extra support. A First- Grade -Readiness Observation will be carried out with all Golden Eagle chi ldren in the fall of their Golden Eagle year and will be discussed with parents at the November Parent -Teacher Conferences. This observation, as well as age, maturity and the knowledge of the child within the classroom will be used to begin a conversation with parents about placement and the child's readiness to enter Grade One in Septembe r. If the Early Childhood and Education Support faculty and staff determine that a child who is age eligible for Grade One needs further support (i.e. outside referral, an additional year in the Early Childhood, a support plan for entering Grade One) then the EC Carrying Group will work with parents to coordinate this support. If it is determined that the child will be moving on to Grade One , the EC Carrying Group will work with the Lower School Carrying Group to prepare and implement a support plan if nee ded. Protocol for Students with Birthdays after June 1 If a parent of a child with a birthday after June 1 would like their child to enter either the Golden Eagle Program or Grade One a year early , they should take the request for consideration to the app ropriate Level Carrying Group. Requests to enter the Golden Eagles a year early will be decided by the EC Carrying Group. Requests to enter Grade One early will be decided by the LS Carrying Group with input from the Grade One teacher, EC Carrying Group and parents. Further observation may be used to help make the determination. Protocol for Students Applying from Outside RSSAA Children entering our school in Grade One from outside of our Early Childhood Program will also take part in a First Grade Readi ness Observation. This observation will be used to determine whether we can meet the child's needs in our First Grade and to assess what extra support, if any, they may need. If the applicant has a birthday after June 1, they will go through the process listed above: the Lower School Carrying Group will make the decision but will seek input from the Grade One Teacher as well as the Early Childhood Carrying Group. See All-School Policies and Procedures section for important information on probation, suspension and dismissal. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Grades 1 - 8 10 Grades 1 - 8 Program All of our teachers recognize that each student has unique academic, artistic and physical gifts. The task of the LS teacher is to provide the inspiration and environment in which these gifts can be cultivated. The LS teacher uses different pedagogical met hods from those of their EC and HS colleagues. The most important of these is that every subject - even science and math - is initially presented artistically, through a story, poem, drama, drawing or song. This artistic doorway is one through which students with widely varying intellectual capacities and learning styles can readily enter. When hired, Grade One teachers will be asked to make a five -year commitment to their class. During the Grade Four year, the Carrying Group will guide a process of refle ction about the future of the class. Observations from families , perspectives from special subject teachers, a review of the general health of the class, and the teacher's own professional aspirations will be considered. In the fall of Grade Five , the pl an for the class will be announced . Please feel free to speak to your child's class teacher or the Carrying Group about how these changes might affect your child. The Class Teacher is responsible for instruction in virtuall y all the academic subjects in G rades 1 through 8. Seventh and eighth grade classes typically have guest Main Lesson teachers from the HS who are specialists in their field. A number of special subject teachers who are experts in their fields teach Spanish, German, art , singing, orc hestra, handwork, Eurythmy and physical education . In Grades 3 and 4, violins and instruction are provided for all students . In Grades 5 through 8, p rivate lessons in the orchestral instrument of the student's choice are required . All students participate in our instrumental music program that is comprised of the following performance groups: chamber music, wind e nsembles, and full orchestra. Evaluation of Student Work A written r eport on the progress of each student is given to the families at the end of the school year. In addition to a lengthy report by the Class Teacher , it will include a paragraph report from each of the special subject teachers. The report will discuss in detail how your student has progressed in the various classes, his or her mastery of the different subjects, and the student's personal growth in the social sphere. During Grades 7 and 8 , a written report will be given to the parents following each academic block during the school year. Although we do not give letter grades , Class Teacher s keep records of spelling and math tests, homework assignments, Main Lesson book completion, and other mea sures of student progress. Class Teacher s expect students will complete homework assignments and Main Lesson units. If there are any concerns about your student's academic progress, the Class Teacher will contact you. Mid-Morning Snack Families must provide a mid-morning snack to be eaten before morning recess. We encourage nutritious, wholesome foods that can be eaten conveniently and neatly in the room. Please do not send gum, soda or candy. Let your student's teacher know of any food allergie s or foods he or she should not eat. Lunch at School Lunch for Grades 1 -8 begins at 12:30 pm . Students should bring a sack lunch, including a water bottle . We encourage nutritious, wholesome foods that can be eaten conven iently and neatly in the room. Please do not send gum, soda or candy. Let your student's teacher know of any food allergies or foods he or she should not eat. Leaving School During the School Day If you need to take your student out of school before the regular dismissal time, please let th e teacher know then sign the student out in the Front O ffice. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Grades 1 - 8 11 Instrumental Music Program The Lower School has a strong instrumental music program that begins in Grade 3 with the introduction of string instruments and continuing into Grade 4 with school -provided v iolins. Other string instrument choices must be provided by the parents (viola or cello). In Grade 5 the students are introduced to wind instruments and ar e then expected to either choose a wind instrument or to continue on with their chosen stri ng instrument through Grade 8. Grades 5 -8 students are required to take private lessons to support the success of the instrumental music program. The Instrumental Music Director will provide lists of suggested private teachers. Sports and After -School Activities The Lower School offers an after -school sports program as well as several club activities. The after -school sports program reflects the needs of the developing child. Beginning when the students are in Grade 4 and conti nuing through Grade 8 , we offer \"Sport s Club\" \u2014a series of classes in various sports held on select Friday afternoons throughout the year. Specific sports introduced could include: basketball, volleyball, golf, archery, tennis , handball, soccer and lacrosse. The classes pr ovide the students the opportunity to learn and practice skills and learn game rules in order to be better prepared for league play. The Lower School Games T eacher coordinates the Sport s Club. Grades 5-8 are also offered Co-ed Soccer and Girls V olleybal l in the fall, Boys and Gi rls Basketball in the winter, and Boys and Girls Track in the spring. The school belongs to the Ann Arbor Independent Athletic Association (AAIAA) and is in a league with other small , private and parochial schools. All Middle School sport s teams participate in a league tournament at the end of their respective seasons. Sports seasons generally run eight weeks with an a verage of two games per week. P articipating league schools usually face each other two times during a season. Practices are held in the school 's home gym at the LS. Fees for the program are commensurate with the fees of the Ann Arbor Rec & Ed sports programs. In order to play, every st udent must complete and submit the registration form and pay a registration fee for each team selected. A registration packet, including all forms and deadlines, is p rovided on the school's website at www.stein erschool.org . The Athletic Director oversees the program. The sports program is self-sufficient, and the variou s sports subsidize each other. The only income f rom the program at pre sent is the registration fee. The money collected is used to pay for equipment, tournament costs and referee fees. Parents can join the Sports Boosters who help run concessions with proceeds supporting the sports program. We recruit coaches from amongst our teachers, college students, HS students and interested adults outs ide the school community. Field Trips Class trips serve social and pedagogical purposes and have become a tradition at the school . These trips gradually increase in length and scope, ranging from one -day field trips in Grade 1 to overnight trips of a week or more by Grade 8 . Visitors Parents, grandparents and special friends may somet imes wish to visit the school. P ersonal tours can be arranged by calling the LS Coordinator in advan ce to arrange a suitable time. Student classroom v isits of one day can be arranged by calling the LS Coordinator to arrange a suitable time. Visits of longer than one day will be handled on a case -by-case basis by the LS Coordinator. Please note that field trips which occur during a student's visit will require the parent to accompany the visiting student. Birthdays Birthdays are a special time and are often celebrated with songs , stories and cards for the birthday child. If your student is in a younger grade, you may be asked to visit or send a special treat. Your student's Class Teacher will provide particulars on how birthdays are celebrated in their class . 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Grades 1 - 8 12 Student Conduct Student Tardiness Policy The school appreciates the cooperation of families in getting students to the school on time.

If a student needs to contact a parent or other driver after school , a cell phone may be used outside the school building if the student politely asks and receives permission from an adult on yard duty. If an electronic device is seen or heard during the school day or used without permission after school , it will be confiscated immediately and taken to the LS front office. The family will be informed and the electronic device will be held until an adult family member picks it up. Thereafter, for one week the student will be required to drop off the electronic device in the LS front office before school and pick it up after school ends. Further violation of this policy will result in a meeting with the family , teachers and student to determine appropriate actions. Electronic devices on field trips: The school considers field trips to be an extension of school day activities and expects students to follow the current protocol for cell phones on campus which states that students are not to use cell phones during the school day and if they do the faculty will confiscate them and hold the devices until an adult can pick them up. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Grades 1 - 8 13 The protocol for day field trips is for the teacher to collect all electronic devices prio r to the field trip. These devices will be returned to students at the end of the trip. The protocol for overnight trips will be for students to leave electronic devices at home or give them to the teacher for the duration of the trip. Teachers may leave t he electronic devices in a safe room at the school. Teachers are not held responsible for electronic devices left at school In the C lassroom Students should follow teacher s' requests quickly and quietly. Students should r aise their hands when they want to say something. At no time is any student to be in a clas sroom without adult supervision . All students are asked to play their part in keep ing our school safe and clean. Chewing gum, marking classroom furniture or writing on walls are not allowed. Toys or items that might offend oth ers should not come to school. If a student does bring such an item, a teacher or other staff member may take it from the student and return it at th e end of the day. If the student brings the item again, it may be taken away until the family has been informed and the return arranged with them. Playground Safety Students are expected to play and behave in a safe and polite manner on the playground. During the normal sch ool recesses, they are expected to abide by the following rules: Ropes are for jumping only. Sticks may be used for building but not placed in trees as bridges. No one may run or point with a stick. Students who repeatedly play this way must stand on t he Grade 1 porch for the remainder of recess. No tackle sports. No rough play. Nature treasures must remain outside. No tree climbing or play among the trees along the property boundaries. Students may not go over the fence to get a ball. A staff member wi ll retrieve balls. No food or drinks are allowed on the playground. Snowball throwing is not allowed. No standing or sitting on the top boards of the Gaga pit. When the ground is frozen, climbing on all structures (play structure, cheese, fire pole, standi ng on tire swing) is prohibited. All wooded areas on the LS campus are inspected after a windstorm and on a bi -annual basis for dead debris or fallen trees. If needed a service is called out to cull dead branches and prune or remove trees. Sledding Guidel ines There will be no sledding until a recess monitor is on the hill. There must be two monitors on the playground before sledding begins so that one monitor can give their undivided attention to the sledding students. Only the designated class may be on the sledding hill. The monitor must ensure that the hill is clear of rocks and debris. Plastic sleds only - no snowboards. No standing on sleds. Sledding must be down the front or back face of the hill. Students return to the top by walking up the sides of the hill.

Students are asked to stay together and li sten to t he teachers and other adult chaperones. Social Development and Guidance We have worked hard to create an approach that supports the social development of the children in our care. Our faculty and staff engage in Professional Development with Kim John Payne, M.ED, author of Simplicity Parenting , and a consultant and trainer to over 230 U.S. independent and public schools . We implement Kim John Payne's Three Care Streams approach to healthy school culture and social inclusion. Our Three Care Streams committee includes our Care Coordinating Group (CCG), Learning Care Group (LCG), Behavioral Care Group (BCG), Social Care Group (SCG) and Student Social Action Committee (SSAC). Please see our virtual brochure detailing these gr oups and the Three Care Streams process. These groups/committees are organized to address challenges that students can experience. If a child is engaging in challenging behavior in the classroom environment, your child's teacher will reach out to you to di scuss. If the challenges continue, your child's teacher may request a Support Circle in which members from the Care Coordinating Group and your child's teacher will meet with you to discuss your child's strengths and challenges and ways in which these can be addressed at home and at school. In extreme circumstances if a child cannot be kept safe due to their conduct, if their conduct is endangering other children, or if the child is unable to successfully participate in the school program as deemed by the C arrying Group, the process for suspension and/or dismissal will be followed. Discipline Protocol The approach RSSAA takes with discipline is developmentally appropriate . The response to a situation with a first grader will be different from the response t o a seventh grader. Our Social Care Group works very closely as a support group for all teachers and, along with faculty and staff , formally tracks behavioral and discipline issues via th e LS Discipline Form, the Guardian Alert Form, and the Social Inclusi on Incident Report. The committee meets weekly to review all recorded issues and formulate s plans of action to address with faculty , students and parents. The committee al so does a weekly report to the faculty Meeting. Each form is described below. LS Di scipline Form If student's behavior in class is disruptive , the teacher will send the student to the office with a yellow card/form. The student will stay in the office the allotted time as designated by the teacher or a minimum of 15 minutes. The LS Coordinator or the Administrative Assistant will phone the family to inform them that the student has been sent to the office with a yellow card and that the teacher will call the family that evening regarding the student's behavior. The form is copied for the teacher who issued the form and for the Class Teacher and th e original is placed in the Social Inclusion/Discipline Binder in the Front Office. If a student receives a third yellow card they will be sent home and a meeting with family , student, Class Teacher and LS Coordinator must take place before the student may return to school. A Change Plan form will be created during this meeting to support the student's behavior in class. Guardian Alert Form The school also has a protocol for monitoring behavior on the playground during recess and in the hallway during transitions . Students are placed on Guardian Alert when a faculty or staff member expresses concern over behavior observed in the classroom , hallway or during recess. The Social Care Group is informed of the need to place the student on Guardian Alert and the group lead communicates this to faculty and staff. Students on alert are monitored at recess and in the hallway by all recess monitors, daily , for two weeks. Informat ion is collected on the \" Guardian Alert\" form. At the two -week mark the recorded inf ormation is reviewed by the Class Teacher and the Social Care Group and a recommendation is made to either remove the student from alert status, or to continue monitoring behavior for another two-week period. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Grad es 1 - 8 15 Social Inclusion Incident Report Faculty an d staff report social or behavioral incidents that are observed during the school day either in the classroom or in the halls and at recess . These forms are kept in a binder in the Front Office and are reviewed weekly by the Social Care Group and the Class Teacher. The ultimate goal s of our Social Inclusion Protocol are to ensure that all students feel secure and behave appropriately when at school, and to track and address behavioral and discipline issues. With this work, we strive to meet student needs with fairness and love and to engage in a meaningful working relationship with families . Sending Students Home During the School Day Any s tudent in any grade can be sent home during the day by any teacher if their behavior is sufficiently disruptive. Any teacher may issue such a suspension in consultation with the Class T eacher and the Coordinator. Students who are being sent home should b e delivered to the office by a teacher and the teacher or the Coordinator will call the family . Any time a student is sent home, a conversation between the family , teacher and, if appropriate, the student must take place before the student can return to s chool. Written documentation of any meeting with the family will be kept by the teacher and in the student's file. Change -Plan Process The purpose of a Change Plan is to alert a student and their family to serious concerns about either academic performance or behavior. It is meant to be a serious step taken after other methods have been tried. The goal is always to help the student to recognize and find ways to be successful at our school. It defines a time during which improvement will be sought. Families will be notified in writing of the specific terms a nd conditions of the probation. W e work to address student needs through a Support Circle process before we move to a C hange Plan. 1. If a support plan cannot be resolved successfully (after a reasonable amount of time depending on the issue and the child's age), then the Carrying Group and Class Teacher will make decisions about the next steps. 2. At this point the Carrying Group will meet with the fami ly to inform them that withholding of a contract for the next academic year is a possibility. Immediate Susp ension or Dismissal in Grades 6 -8 Certain extreme behaviors may result in immediate suspension or dismissal . Examples of such behaviors include but are not limited to: Bringing weapons , alcohol or illegal substances to school Theft Arson Destruction of property Extreme physical and/or verbal hostility, such as fighting or abusive swearing Inappropriate sexual behavior on school property Violent behav ior or threats of violence See the All-School Policies and Procedures section for important information on probation, suspension and dismissal. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Lower School Campus Practical Matters (EC -8) 16 Lower School Campus Practical Matters (EC-8) Dropping Off and Picking Up Your Student Class Start Time Class Pickup Time Grades 1 -3 8:20 am 3:10 pm Grades 4-5 8:20 am 3:20 pm Grades 6 -8 8:15 am 3:20 pm Morning Circle Start Time Early -Bird Pickup Time Afternoon Pickup Time Early Childhood 8:30 am 12:15 pm 2:55 pm Morning Drop -Off EC-8 Our Curbside Drop -off Service is available for Pre -School through Grade 8 between 8 and 8:20 am for all students.

Form a single line. Pull as far forward as possible. Let your student out of or into the car and then proceed slowly. No parking along the yellow curb or areas marked with orange cones . For safety reasons no students may be left on school grounds unattended, regardless of age. Students who walk or bike home from school must report to and sign in with the bus duty monitor designated by an orange safety vest. Students who take the Ann Arbor city bus must wait in the designated area and sign in with the bus -duty monitor. Families who arrive late must p ark their cars and meet their students in Aftercare. Families who are in the building before morning drop -off or after 3: 20 pm must always keep their students with them. Volunteers working on campus after school (i.e. school store, coaches) may sign their students into Aftercare at no charge. As an environmentally conscious school we have a \"no idle\" policy. Please do not idle your vehicle when parked or at a standst ill anywhere on school grounds, except under extenuating circumstances ( i.e. prolonged waiting in extreme temperatures) . Aftercare Programs Aftercare Our Aftercare Program is available at the LS from 3 to 5 pm. We ask families to register students in advance by filling out an online registration form, but we can also accommodate drop -in care. The Aftercare program is more relaxed than the school day. Students play outside, use the gym, have stories, art projects, and board games available to them, and older students may do homework. A healthy snack is offered around 4 pm. There is a one hour minimum invoiced. Hours: 3-5 pm Fees (subject to change) : $8.50 per hour (one hour minimum) if registered 24 hours in advance $9.50 per hour (one hour minimum) for drop -in care $1 per minute afte r 5 pm Aftercare Fees Payment s Invoices for Aftercare are issued monthly and due upon receipt. For families who pay tuition via FACTS, Aftercare charges will be added automatically to FACTS unless other arrangements are made with the Business Office. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Lower School Campus Practica l Matters (EC -8) 18 Entrance Security Drop -Off and Pick -Up During School Day Before and Aftercare All Doors OPEN between these times: 8 - 8:25 am 2:45 - 3:30 pm All Doors LOCKED between these times: 8:25 am - 2:45 pm All Doors LOCKED Enter through Main Entrance with buzzer All Doors LOCKED Enter through side Aftercare Entrance with buzzer How do I access the building ?

Lower School Guidelines for Illness Please notify the school if your child contract s a communicable illness including but not limited to chicken pox, measles , mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza (the flu) or strep throat. Parents are also reminded of the importance of keeping their children/teens home from school when they have these, as well as other, contagious infections or illnesses. Guidelines for when it is appropriate to have your student return to school following certain illnesses: 24 hours after a fever has ended 24 hours after the last experience of vomiting or diarrhea Once pink eye has ceased to cause runny eyes 24 hours after beginning a course of antibiotics The protocol for when to send your child back to school following the more common cold with a cough is when you believe that your student will be able to participate in class and not be a distraction to others. The number one, most important defense again st all illness i s hand washing . We will be monitoring this closely at school and encourage you to please reiterate this at home with your child. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Lower School Campus Practical Matters (EC -8) 19 See the All-School Health, Illness and Medication section for information on medicat ions and immunizations . Library Programs We have three library programs : the Ellie Klopp Memorial Library and an Early Childhood/Parent Library, both at the Lower School, and the High School Collections, which include the Megan Margerum -Leys Library, Book Nook, College Prep, Computer, and Special Subject Collections. Our primary purpose is to bring good books to young readers and those who guide them. We also support teachers in curricular work, inspire and engage the imaginations of our community members through our outreach programs, and educate parents and caregivers on Waldorf Education and related subjects. Ellie Klopp Memorial Library Ellie Klopp (1917 -1996) was our school's first librarian. The l ibrary named in her honor offers over 5800 books of all kinds. Book Collections Picture (Easy) Books - To be read aloud or read alone Fiction - Hardcover classics and series Readers - First books for novice readers General - Non-fiction and literature Paperback - Softcover chapter books and novels, series books Special Collections - Include Waldorf publications, Reference, Newbery Medal winners, fiction and non-fiction in Spanish, German, and Mandarin All books are cataloged by a modified Dewey Decimal System arranged alphabetically by author's last name and Dewey call number. We have computer access for searching our online catalog, and student research . We invite you to look more closely at our pr ogram via the Library Blog available at Blogspot , where you can find links to the catalog, the school website , and our email address and contact information. Open Hours The hours for the Ellie Klopp Libra ry are posted on the library door and include a mix of times to accommodate as many people as possible . Students, teachers, staff, and families are welcome. Two books may be checked out during a two - week period. A return box is located just outside the l ibrary door. About Book Check -Out The check -out process is easy and can be demonstrated by the librarians after you have located the books you wish to borrow. All books are labeled with a green, blue, and white sticker on the front cover for easy identif ication. Borrowers may not check out new books until all overdue books have been returned. Overdue notice s are sent periodically. Overdue books are not fined unless a book is damaged beyond repair or lost. A bill for replacement cost will be issued from the Business Office. Early Childhood/ Parent Library This lovely collection of books and periodicals, especially relevant to EC families , is available to the community for self - checkout. We have c hildren's picture books along with information on parenting, child development, and Waldorf education. Books on Waldorf crafts, festivals, food, songs, and stories are also here. A librarian is available to assist with checkout and return on Tuesday mornings between 8:30 am and 9:30 am. The library is located in the Parent Community Space/ School Store . Animals For the safety of our community and the animal, please: Do not allow pets outside of your vehicle when on school grounds Do not attempt to handl e any animals on school grounds 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Lower School Campus Practical Matters (EC -8) 20 If students are outside, for example on recess, bring all students inside immediately Report the sighting of the animal to the Front Office Keep students inside until the all -clear is issued by the Front Office Pest Policy Organic control methods are given priority over pesticides, which are used as a last resort. Herbicides and pesticides will not be applied in areas where individuals are or will be present for 12 hours. 1. Families will be informed prior to annual pesticide applications to the school grounds or buildings. Pesticide notices will also be posted at entrance doors. Families can request notification by first class US Mail. 2. We follow the Michigan Department of Agriculture Rule 637 for In tegrated Pest Management in schools, and logs are kept for each building. Photography & Video Camera Use To ensure that the students are allowed to experience plays and assemblies without distraction, the faculty asks that any recordings or photographs of festivals, plays, etc., be done in cooperation with the teacher in charge of the event. A prior conversation will facilitate clarity regarding this. The faculty member will work with families to find an appropriate time for them to take pictures of meaning ful events. Any parental photographing of students during school hours should be done unobtrusively so as not to distract students or faculty. Please request permission from families before sharing or posting photos of other students. Lower School Resp onse to a Direct Threat to Campus Security and Safety In the unlikely event that the Lower School is threatened by a perpetrator with intent to hurt students, faculty or staff , the school faculty and staff are trained in the ALICE response method. This is a system now being used by many school districts (including Ann Arbor Public Schools) that gives individual teachers the latitude to assess a situation and take the action they deem the most likely to protect the students in their care. These responses c ould include a traditional lock - down (doors, locked, window blinds drawn, students hiding in the corners of the room); an enhanced lockdown where furniture is used to barricade doorways; or escape, through windows or out available doors. Each year the fac ulty and staff of the Lower School will receive training in ALICE at the August and September faculty meetings, and the approach will be shared with students in an appropriate way during the first month of school. Students will be taught to follow instruct ions but will never be asked to take any direct action against an intruder. Our goal is to help students escape a dangerous situation. During the student instruction they will be informed of the school reunification point for the school year (the place t o go if they leave the building to escape a dangerous situation). 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 21 High School Program High School Methods A message from the High School F aculty and Administration to the High School students: As a high school student, you are expected to actively participate in and contribute to your own education. Therefore, it is important that you begin to gain an understanding of the goals of this education as we, your teachers and administrators, see them . What follows is our attempt to articulate the educational ideals that we aspire to. Our purpose is to prepare you to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing world of the 21st century. It is not enough to teach you today's skills and today's knowled ge; rather, we must awaken in you the capacities you will need to learn new skills and gain new understanding throughout your life: capacities for sound judgment, critical thinking and an abiding interest in the world and in learning. Moreover, we must he lp you gain an awareness of yourself and others, out of which can arise sound moral judgment and the ideals which give our lives meaning and purpose. In short, we must help you develop not just a quick mind, but character. In the High School, our f irst ta sk will be to help you develop a keen interest in the world and a delight in your capacity for thought. A healthy development of such capacities for thought, one that puts you into a right relationship with the world, is grounded in direct experience and observation. In the sciences, which are taught primarily in the laboratory and in the field, observation and experimentation with the phenomena are the basis for the development of the laws and theories that modern scientists use to make sense of their ob servations. Similarly, in the humanities and social sciences, you will be taught using primary source materials: the original versions of the great works of literature and original historical documents. Starting from observation of the contents of a text, it is then possible to delve beneath the surface to ask what lies beyond the observable. How did this character become who he is? How have the events of ancient history shaped our current time? Is there an order, a lawfulness to the way things behave in nature and in society? Writing is an important part of the curriculum in all subject areas as you keep notes, laboratory records and journals of your observations and use them to write reports, essays and poetry, creating in each case a document summarizi ng not only the content of the course but also your own understanding of it. You are thus engaged in constructing your own knowledge rather than being asked to learn and reflect back the contents of standard textbooks. Work in the arts supports the academ ic curriculum by developing the capacity to solve problems creatively. Through the creative arts (such as drawing, modeling, painting and ceramics) we aim to help you cultivate imaginative thinking, perseverance and attention to detail. Practicing the per forming arts (including music, choir and drama) develops self - discipline, focus and the ability to work effectively in a group. The practical arts (for example auto mechanics, woodworking and bookbinding) are intended to enable you to understand the world in a concrete way. We, as teachers and administrators, see ourselves as facilitators of YOUR education and we want you to be totally involved in it. Our role is to help create the structure necessary to support a lively learning atmosphere where you can gain self - confidence and competence. We also wish to foster a sense of individual responsibility and community. To that end, we hope to set an example for healthy social interactions between students by maintaining a respectful attitude towards students and towards one another, and by expecting the same of you. We want to create a safe space where the ideals of the community can manifest. Through these means we strive to attain the goal set forth by Rudolf Steiner in 1919 at the founding of the first Wal dorf school: \"Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings, who are able of themselves to impart purpose and direction to their lives.\" 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 22 High School Communication Expectations Rudolf Steiner High School wants the school environment to be a warm and welcoming place for all students and staff, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual identity, national origin, sexual orientation, political views, economic status, and ability. All students and staff are welcome to their own individual, private views on all issues, however, the school is a learning environment and there must be self -management of communication, respect for all others, and an open effort to connect, listen, seek to understand and care for everyone. We seek to create a school where all students are able to fully engage in their learning, and all staff in their teaching, without concern about being marginalized, hurt by intentional or careless comments, or treated as less important than others because of their personal identity. It is important to understand that students of all races, genders, backgrounds, and individual identities are learning how to manage these complex issues that our whole society wrestles wi th daily. We do not expect students to get it right all the time, but we do, as a school, a community, and society, owe it to them to directly engage in these issues, reflect back to them on their behavior, help them develop a deeper understanding, and he lp them clearly see those around them. We, as a school and place of learning, seek to support students in their education on these topics, and not to discipline unnecessarily, however, violations of these expectations will have direct consequences as deta iled below. We strongly encourage all students in the school to minimize discussion of these types of topics on social media, texting and other electronic platforms, as these technologies are not supportive of the nuanced and thoughtful conversations that these topics deserve. Social m edia posts have a direct impact on the quality of the school and classroom environment and will be subject to the expectations for behavior outlined below . Students are asked to be especially careful not to make claims abou t classmates on social media or accuse them of things that they cannot respond to in the public forum. All students will be expected to meet these expectations. Expectations : The following types of statements and communication are not acceptable: Direct s tatements to others that exhibit racism, religious intolerance, sexism, anti -LGBTQ+ sentiments, denigration of immigrants, political intolerance, body shaming, or judgements based on economic status or ability. Jokes, humor and satire based on finding amus ement or enjoyment in any of these areas - this is inappropriate whether aimed at an individual or overheard, it should not be happening at school. The following types of behavior are not acceptable: Exclusion of any classmate from school -based activities - all students have the right to all school opportunities, and students are expected to talk with all students, collaborate with them in group work, and treat them with care and respect at all times. Students are completely welcome to have the ir own friend group but not to exclude those they are less attached to. School is a place where everyone deserves to feel part of the class. Spotlighting of individual students based on their identities - for instance, this means not expecting an immigra nt student to share opinions or ideas about immigration based on that student's immigration status, or a student who is Catholic being expected to explain aspects of Catholicism. All students should be supported in being comfortable in the classroom witho ut fear of being asked to speak out on an issue that they are personally connected with. Students are free to participate in all conversations at their own level of comfort. Wearing of any clothing or use of in -school materials that promote racist, sexist , anti -LGBTQ+, antireligious, anti - immigrant or other exclusive attitudes. When a statement or behavior that violates the above standards occurs the following will happen: 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High Scho ol 23 If heard or witnessed by a teacher or staff member , an immediate intervention will be made by the teacher or staff member. Teachers and staff members will be supported in understanding how to do this through training in faculty and staff meetings. Students should never assume a teacher heard a comment just because they were in the clas sroom at the same time. If the comment is not immediately addressed, please approach the teacher about your concern. If heard or witnessed by a student , that student has the following set of choices: Handle it themselves by directly pointing out the inapp ropriate behavior and simply stating \"That is inappropriate \". o The student who is told this is expected to do the following : Stop the behavior . Apologize and move on . Not ask for an explanation about what is wrong with the behavior instead reflecting intern ally or talking with a faculty/staff member about what was or was not inappropriate . Conversation can continue with faculty or staff help (this is not intended to be a permanent stop to discussion on these topics but a temporary pause as everyone learns how to have these conversations). Report it to faculty or staff using one of the following options o Bring the attention of an adult present at that moment to the issue. o Report it to one of the High School Coordinators of a core faculty member. Consequences for inappropriate communications will be: First incidence: Meet with at least two faculty or staff members to discuss the behavior and plan for ending it, with the goa l of a clear understanding of what is not acceptable. We expect that this will be the end of most processes, but if the behavior continues the process will continue. Second incidence: Meet with the two faculty or staff members from the first incidence, C oordinator, and parent(s). Written plan to be in place at end of meeting to ensure the behavior does not continue. Third incidence: One day suspension and Behavior Probation. Written probation plan, community service and weekly faculty follow- up meeting. Fourth incidence: Three -day suspension and final probation: All of above in step three and understanding that this is a final chance for changing behavior . Fifth incidence: Dismissal . As faculty and staff we do also reserve the right to move this process along more quickly depending on the severity and pervasiveness of the incidence. Our goal with these steps is to ensure that misunderstandings are understood and that education on appropriate types of communication is put before punishment, while also setting clear boundaries for what is appropriate at school and what is not. Student Conduct Our ideal is that you be left as free and independent as you are capable of being. We teachers and administrators do not wish to be separate and removed from you, an d we will provide structure and guidance as needed. Our goal is to lead you into freedom and responsibility. To that end, we will do our best to assist you in becoming clear about your goals and the consequences of your choices with the intention of helpi ng you achieve them and/or helping you to find realistic alternatives. This means that when there is a question about your behavior and/or choices, we will start by asking you to place your behavior and/or choices within the context of our common ideals as a learning community. Among these ideals are 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 24 respect for self and others, appreciation and tolerance of differences, and a commitment to participating in the learning process. In joining this school, you are affirming that you are committed to these ide als. If your behavior repeatedly falls short of this commitment, we will ask for a conference with you and your family to understand the reason for this and to confirm that this school is really where you want to be. No student should be here who doesn't want to be, and no student may be here who will not or cannot uphold our common ideals. The specific points discussed below are examples of the application of our ideals. It is our intention to keep our written rules to a minimum, with the understanding t hat all of our behavior at school, whether or not covered by a written rule, should be consistent with these ideals. Timeliness and Attendance Because of the interactive and experiential nature of Waldorf education, it is essential that students be present and on time for each class. Arriving late is disruptive and discourteous. Students are expected to remain in class for the duration of the period unless given permission to leave. The flow of a lecture , the understanding of a concept and the mood of a class are all disrupted when someone enters or leaves the classroom. If a student is tardy, then the student must report to the Front Office before going to class. A pattern of frequent tardiness is cause for concern and will result in a conference to discuss and remedy the difficulty. At the discretion of the instructor, a student who is late more than 30% of the time to a course may not receive credit. A student who is late more than 50% of the time to a course will NOT receive credit f or the course. We encourage students and families to schedule appointments and family vacations so that students do not miss school. If a student is going to be absent for part or all of the day, the family should notify the school before 8 am. Prolonged absences (for any reason) may severely impair the ability to attain the objectives of courses and may result in loss of credit. If a student is absent for more than 15% of any given course, the student may not be given credit for the course. If a student kn ows in advance that they will be absent for three or more days, the student should fill out the Extended Absence form , available in the Front Office , at least one week before the absence. It is the student's responsibility to make up any missed work due to absence or tardiness . Respect and Courtesy It is vital that we cultivate an attitude of respect through our awareness and consideration of each other, and by manifesting our tolerance of diversity. People with differing views, strengths and weaknesses cr eate a rich, diverse community. We expect to have differences of opinion and to have energetic discussions carried out in an atmosphere of civility. In order to create this atmosphere and to promote our general safety and well -being, abusive language, phy sical violence and weapons are not acceptable. Pranks and other forms of behavior that might be deemed hurtful are also not acceptable. Physical Contact It is the Rudolf Steiner High School policy that physical signs of affection between students remain ap propriate. Students will not kiss, sit on laps or engage in romantic hugging on campus at any time. This is an academic environment and such behavior is inappropriate. Holding hands and friendly hugging is permitted as long as it is respectful to others a nd the school. Electronic Devices Policy Talking, laughing, joking, having great conversations and bursting into song are all welcome at appropriate times, but the use of personal electronic devices during the school day is not, as this takes us away from interaction with one another. Electronic devices must be turned off at all times inside the building and left in lockers, or locked vehicles, during the school day. This includes cellphones, headphones, computers, tablets and e -readers, mp3/iPods, cameras , and game consoles. Students who have a class -related need to use an electronic device can fill out the Computer Room and Technology Use form in the office and have their teacher or the High School Coordinator sign it to give permission for in - school use. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 25 Laboratory Safety Rules and Procedures The following Rules and Agreement letter is issued to all students using the science labs. They must read this document carefully before signing: Please read the following safety rules carefully. Failure to observe appropriate rules will result in ejection from the lab and an F for that day's lab. Failure to observe these rules may also result in serious injury. 1. No food or drinks (not even water) are allowed in the lab. It is dangerous to consume food or drin ks while working with chemicals. 2. Never pour any chemical down the drain. All waste must be disposed of according to instructions given by the instructor. 3. Goggles must be worn at all times when experiments are underway. You may take off your goggles only wh en the last person has stopped working and not before the instructor's o.k. 4. Appropriate clothing must be worn. Loose or dangling clothes and jewelry are a hazard, especially dangling sleeves. Long hair must be tied back. No sandals or open toed shoes. (You will not be able to participate in lab with inappropriate footwear or clothing.) 5. Follow all instructions carefully. Do not do anything that is not part of an approved experimental procedure. Carefully read all written procedures through from beginning to end before attempting an experiment. 6. Act in a responsible manner at all times. No fooling around or horseplay in the lab. 7. Before lighting a Bunsen burner and heating anything, have the instructor check your set up. 8. Never leave a lit Bunsen burner unattend ed. Turn off your Bunsen burner when you are not using it. 9. Clean up all spilled chemicals immediately, including water. If you spill a chemical, ask the instructor how to clean it up. 10. Check odors only whe n instructed to do so. Do not smell liquids directly . Waft vapor gently towards nose with hand. 11. Never start heating a test tube from the bottom. Begin just below the surface of the liquid and work down. When heating a test tube, do not point it at anyone. 12. Hot glass looks exactly like cold glass. Make sure g lass is cool before you pick it up. 13. Treat burns immediately by putting burned area under cold water for at least 15 minutes. Cold water markedly reduces the subsequent pain and blisters. 14. If any chemical comes into contact with the eye, flush the eye with water at the yellow eye wash station. The yellow eye wash station is located next to the lab door. Pulling down the black tray can activate it. Water will immediately begin to flow. Wash the eye for a good ten minutes or more. The water will run onto the fl oor; do not worry about the floor, your eyes are much more important. 15. Lubricate glass tubing with water or glycerine before inserting into stoppers. Wrap tubing in cloth before inserting. Hold tubing near the end to be inserted. 16. Do not taste any chemicals or put anything from the lab in your mouth without being told to do so. 17. Report any injury, accident, or close call - no matter how small - to the instructor immediately. 18. Equipment must be put away properly and work area cleaned before leaving the lab. Addi tional Safety Rules and Proper Lab Practices 1. Read chemical labels very carefully. Read them three times: when you pick the chemical up, just before you use it, and after you are finished. Many mistakes result from mixing the wrong chemicals. Be alert for s afety warnings on labels. 2. When using a chemical, try not to contaminate the chemical by returning excess to the container. Take only what you need. Use a separate spoon/spatula/pipet for each chemical to avoid cross -contamination. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 26 3. When using a Bunsen burne r, use a blue flame and the smallest flame that will do the job. 4. Wash glassware using detergent and brushes. Glassware must be dried and returned to the proper shelves or drawers after use. 5. Clean your lab bench, put away all equipment and reagents, and wash your hands at the end of each laboratory session. Personal Appearance High School students are coming together to learn, to work and to bring out the best in one another. Choices in clothing should support this. Students should come dr essed in a way that is practical, com fortable and appropriate for the day's activities, be they academic, artistic, movement, or in the laboratory. The clothes students wear should not be excessively distracting to our work. All students need to be suffi ciently covered to meet the common standards of modesty. Attire that glamorizes drug or alcohol use, hostility, violence or sexual themes is contrary to our purpose. For safety reasons shoes are required at all times. Also, when we are at the Lower Schoo l, we fo llow the Lower School dress code . Clothing for School Trips We are committed to activities beyond our campus. In order for these to be successful, everyone needs to be prepared for the experience. Faculty members ensure that the academic work nee ded to provide an adequate background for the experience and the practical planning around meals, housing and transportation is complete. We ask that individual students contribute by bringing appropriate clothing for each type of activity. Ninth Grade Fa rm Trip - students need to be dressed to be out in the sun, rain and wind daily. We ask that students wear work shorts and pants (no short shorts), and shirts and t -shirts with at least small cap sleeves (no spaghetti straps). We ask this because of concerns about sunburn and scrapes and cuts in the fi elds. Students should also have good rain protection and at least one pair of long pants and a sweatshirt (it can be surprisingly cold at the farm) . Tenth Grade Survey Trip - students need to be dressed to be out in the sun, rain and wind daily. We ask that students wear work shorts and pants (no short shorts), and shirts and t -shirts with at least small cap sleeves (no spaghetti straps). We ask this because of concerns about sunburn and scrapes and cuts in the w oods. Students should also have good rain protection and at least one pair of long pants, a sweatshirt and a warm jacket (it can be surprisingly cold on the Lake Michigan shore) . Model United Nations Trip - students will be presenting in committees and to the convention. They are expected to be in professional work attire - at least dress pants/skirt and a good shirt/blouse. Many students wear suits and/or dresses . Hiking Club Trips - students should follow the equipment list and ensure that they have had their pack checked by a faculty member or chaperone before the trip begins. In general students are expected to have full rain protection, cold weather protection and a variety of quick dry and backpacking clothing. Because of the dange r of hypothermia while hiking, students who do not meet the equipment list requirements for clothing will not be allowed to participate in the trip . Maine Trip - students need to be dressed for sun, rain and /or wind daily. We ask that students wear work s horts and pants (no short shorts), and shirts and t -shirts with at least small cap sleeves (no spaghetti straps). We ask this because of concerns about sunburn and scrapes and cuts on the ro cks. Students should also have good rain protection and at least one pair of long pants and a sweatshirt (there are always cold nights on the Atlantic in September) . Italy Trip - students should follow the provided packing list with an awareness that they will be spending the ten days in European cities where a slightl y conservative approach to dress is most appropriate . 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 27 Being Prepared for Class It is every student's individual responsibility to be physically, emotionally and mentally prepared to participate in class. This includes being organized, completing and retur ning homework, and having the necessary classroom tools. It also includes getting a good night's sleep and eating breakfast. When a student arrives to class, we want them to be able to give full attention to the material presented. Respect for School Pro perty Many people, adults and students, have worked very hard to create our school. We need to treat it like a home rather than an impersonal \"institution\" . As we live in our school, we all will help to define its character. There have been and will be opportunities for students to contribute to decisions about the design and use of the school and its grounds. Careless or malicious acts which deface or destroy property challenge and jeopardize our community. Students should be conscious of the impact that they have on our property. Some of the ways in which students may do this are to: Be where they are supposed to be, only when they are supposed to be there Keep personal belongings organized and in lockers Not eat or drink in classes without teacher permission, except for water in a water bottle Be sure to recycle or throw away trash Return borrowed school items to the classroom or office from which they were take n Maintain a noise level that respects others' activities Keep rough housing under control and in an area which can sustain it Respect the school's furniture, including keeping shoes off upholstered seats Notice and appreciate the contributions of each other to the well -being of the community Behavior in Chorus Classes Students sing in the All -School Chorus twice a week. This is a wonderful experience as we work together to make music, but the size of the choir also presents some challenges. Therefore, we ask that students observe the following: Arrive in the Assembly Hall on time and i mmediately get a choir folder and take your place Watch the Choir Director attentively and come to silence as soon as the Choir Director is ready to start warm -ups Keep conversation and chatter to a minimum throughout the class, ensuring to never disrupt progress in the class Work to support classmates in performing our challenging music, rather than distracting and diverting them If a student is unable to meet these expectations, they will be required to attend an additional choir practice period on Tuesda ys after school. Assembly Guidelines The Grade 12 students host the weekly All -School Assembly during the fall and winter, and Grade 11 take s over in the spring. Students are expected to attend all assemblies and are invited to participate by bringing m usic, poems, interesting facts, announcements and performances of all kinds. Students occasionally put together slide shows for assemblies and we ask that they observe the following: That all students who participated be represented during the slideshow, and that there is not an undue focus on any one or small group of students That the slideshow be limited to a maximum of five minutes in length That the slideshow show a balance of curriculum -related and social activities - as an example a slideshow on th e ninth grade Farm Trip should show both farming/building activities and times around the campfire/playing games That all slideshows be previewed by a faculty member or one of the HS Coordinators before being shared at Assembly 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 28 Respect for Our Neighbors The families living in the surrounding neighborhood have been very supportive of our joining their larger community. It is important that we be aware of and respect their needs and requests. Please do not walk, drive or park in this neighborhood during sc hool hours without prior permission. Please be aware that children playing in their backyards may hear and see students so maintain behavior that is appropriate for them to see and hear. If a problem should arise, please be respectful, try to resolve the issue and bring the concern to a faculty/staff member. Pranks and other forms of behavior that might be deemed hurtful are not acceptable. Conduct at Off -Campus Facilities As a part of our school program s, students will have opportunities to go off campus for field trips. Please be aware that when we go to these locations, students are still in school. All school rules and expectations of conduct remain in force. Our students are ambassadors for the school, and the school reputation depends on their conduct. Dance/Open -Mic/Performance Guidelines Each Steiner student may bring two outside guests. This is standard procedure at most high schools. Alumni may come and bring one guest. Alumni need to be registered before the event, but do not count towards t he two -outside -guest s rule. Students will be h eld accountable for their guest s' behavior. All guests must be registered (but may pay at the door) by the end of school day immediately preceding the dance. On- site tickets will be sold only to currently enrolled RSHS students and registered guests at a higher price. There will be no on -site ticket sales to non -registered guests. Students and visitors will sign in and sign out with a designated chaperone when they arrive and when they leave. A sign - in student and guest list will be at the door. Attendees may go outside through the fro nt entrance or onto the Commons patio. They may not go past the internal doors between the two sets of bathrooms . They may not go into classrooms or the assembly hall. Once students have arrived, they should not go out to the cars (unless given permissi on by a chaperone). Students or guests who have signed out and left the property may not return. Any of the chaperones m ay ask anyone to leave the event at any time. Chaperones will only do this if there is a serious problem such as suspicion of drug o r alcohol use, ignoring requests made by a chaperone, rude behavior to an adult or another student or damage to the building or grounds. The chaperones will not argue with the offender or the sponsoring student about this judgment. If asked to leave, the student or guest must do so quietly and quickly. Open -Mic/Performance events are open to the public. Performers must be pre -screened for appropriate content and listed in the program. Cell Phone Policy Although useful in arranging car pooling, letting f amilies know when a student will be home, and reaching friends and family outside of the school day, cell phones during the school day are a major and unnecessary, distraction. To ensure that all students are able to fully take part in academic lessons, so cial interactions, and all of the events of the school day we ask that: Students turn off their phones and store them i n lockers or locked vehicles from 8 am - 3:10 pm Students do not use a cell phone, even outside, during school hours. If a student needs to make a phone call , they should come to the Front O ffice Students in the after -school program may use their phones to communicate with their carpool drivers or family , and to listen to music on headphones. Students may not use their phones to watch videos, pla y games, or browse the internet If a s tudent does not leave their phone in a locker, and instead has it out in the school during school hours, then further action from teachers and administration will be necessary. This will be set individually with each student as the situation 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 29 warrants , though the process typically in cludes a Pink Slip (explanation in the following pages) and/or an expectation that the student is to turn their phone into the front office each day for one to two weeks following the incident. Flagrant or repeated violations of the cell phone policy can r esult in behavior probation. Plagiarism and Website U se Policy The internet can be a rich and interesting place to research classroom topics and find resources for written assignments and papers. However, the ease with which a student can copy and paste data from a site to their own paper or work can often tempt a student into plagiarism. Students are expected to provide sources and citations for all materials taken from others, whether electronic or a published book, magazine , or video. Students should provide sources and full citations for: Direct quotations from another person, whether published or unpublished Graphics - such as charts , photographs , and drawings - from a source An idea taken from the work of another person Data and facts given by anot her person, whether published or unpublished Plagiarism is considered cheating. Please see the HS Policy on Cheating . Social Media Policy are all ways for us to share personal information, photographs, and videos. New social media programs and applications are being developed continuously , and the possible ways for students, faculty, and families to be part of an o nline community continue to expand. These programs and applications offer a lot of positive opportunities to connect, share interests and ideas, promote causes important to us and have fun. However, the seeming ly private nature of these sites, w hich are, in reality , extremely public, can lead to inappropriate postings, embarrassing photographs and information being thoughtless ly shared, and even cyber -bulling. We expect that all students will be conscious of the ways in which they use social media outlet s and will work to preserve classmates' privacy and dignity. Students are reminded not to reveal passwords or the passwords of others and are expected to refrain from: Spreading rumors or false information about others through social media outlets Sendi ng rude, harassing or threatening email messages, instant messages or text messages Creating websites or posts that ridicule, humiliate, or intimidate others Posting embarrassing or inappropriate pictures, images or videos of others Forwarding or dissemina ting photographs and videos that invade another student's privacy or dignity Sending email messages, instant messages or text messages to others disguising themself as another person Students are also asked to let faculty or staff know as soon as they become aware that another student is engaging in the behavior outlined above. This is essential to ensure that our small school remains a positive social environment for all students. Computer Use Computer use to facilitate academic work is encouraged. Students are allowed into the lab with a signed permission slip from a teacher. Computer use guidelines as posted are expected to be fo llowed at all times. Personal computers are not allowed at school unless approved and under the guidance of a teacher. Computer Use Rules and Agreement The following Rules and Agreement letter is issued to all students using the computer lab. They must read this document carefully before signing: 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 30 Rudolf Steiner High School students will have ongoing access to computers and a full array of software tools available from the school, including internet resources. RSHS is pleased to offer a variety of computing resources to our students; however, we req uire that students understand and agree to the basic rules of computer usage. RSHS's policy for computer usage is in accord with the guiding principles and behavioral expectations that are published in the School Handbook in the HS section titled Student C onduct. Violations of the Computer Use Rules and Agreement will be considered to be a violation of Student Conduct and will be handled accordingly. If a student violates the guidelines in this policy and agreement, the student may face disciplinary actions , and rights and privileges to use any or all of the HS's computing resources may be revoked. Students may not use RSHS's computing resources in any way that contradicts the educational mission of the school. Prohibited activities include, but are not limi ted to, the following: Harassment . Communications with other people must be courteous, respectful, and considerate, whether the communication is electronic or in person. Computing resources may not be used to create any materials which are unkind or abusiv e in nature. Vandalism . Students may not modify any material on a computer other than their own data files. o Students may not install, remove, or change system software or application software without the teacher's approval and direct supervision. o Students may not modify or destroy the work of another student. o Students may not install or create \"viruses.\" o Students may not abuse the computing resources. Students may not attempt to \"hack,\" or gain unauthorized entry, into other computer systems or modify mater ials on other systems through our computers. Inappropriate materials . This includes materials that students may encounter on the internet or that students may bring to school from other sources. It is especially important to note that access to the interne t can be revoked at any time if a student's actions are not related to the task or the subject matter of the class or assignment. Use without authorization . Regarding the computers in the HS offices, if students do not have express permission as part of an assignment or at the request of staff, students may not use the computers in any way. Drug and Alcohol Policy Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is committed to providing a safe and healthy learning and social environment for all our students. Many famil ies and students choose Rudolf Steiner High School for this reason. The use of drugs and alcohol seriously impacts a student's judgment, ability to participate in classes and activities, physic al health, and ongoing brain development, not to mention the i llegal nature of these substances for students of high school age. Drug use also negatively impacts the class social environment, splitting it into users and non- users, which limits and warps healthy interactions among students, and, in the event of conse quences, among families and faculty as well. In the admission paperwork and interview, students have agreed to refrain from the use of drugs and alcohol throughout their high school years and their families have supported this agreement. Families are remin ded of this agreement throughout the years at the fall back -to-school meeting and through the School Handbook . As outlined in this School Handbook , students are not to attend school or any school event under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with any drugs or alcohol or vaping devices in their possession. This expectation is also communicated by the faculty in health classes in the ninth and tenth grade years, in back -to-school orientations each fall, and the coaches reiterate this to their sports teams each season. If a student attends school or a school event under the influence of drugs or alcohol , or in possession of either or a vaping device : 1. Faculty will meet with the students involved to ascertain the facts of the situation. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 31 2. If the use or possession of drugs , alcohol or a vaping device is confirmed we will meet with student and family and use the Template for Response to a School Drug or Alcohol Incident for our behavioral probation response. It is important to note two things. First, each event of alcohol or drug use will have its own characteristics (type of drug or alcohol, event attended, whether the event was disrup ted, etc.) so each behavioral probation response will be individual, taking into account the specific student involved and the student body as a whole. Second, the High School faculty is committed to a behavioral probation process that allows students to rebuild the trust that has been broken through the inappropriate behavior by taking up the responsibility for the incident. This template has been developed with an intention of structuring that healing of relationship s. Conflict Resolution If a studen t is having difficulty with another student or a faculty/staff member, the student may pursue several options. Students and/or family members are encouraged to first speak with the student or faculty/staff member directly. Students are also always welcome to speak to any faculty or staff member privately. Curriculum or pedagogical issues may be taken further with the High School Faculty Chair who will actively work with students to address the problem. Other issues may be taken to one of the High School Coordinator s who will actively work with students to address the problem. Asking for help to resolve conflicts is always appropriate. Using abusive language or violence to deal with conflicts is never appropriate. Probation If Conduct Falls Short It is our assumption that , in choosing to attend Rudolf Steiner High School , students have expressed a commitment to our common ideals as a learning community. If an individual student's conduct falls short of this commitment, there are a number of corrective steps that will be put in place. In the first instance, the teachers will speak with the student about the behavior and help to remind the student of this co mmitment. If the situation warrants it, the family will be notified and may be asked to participate in a meeting. Repeated problems may necessitate a review by the High School faculty for appropriate action, which might involve placing a student on proba tion. The purpose of probation is to alert a student and their family to serious concerns about either academic performance or behavior. It defines a time during which improvement will be sought. Families will be notified in writing of the specific te rms and conditions of the probation. In the unlikely event that a situation warrants immediate removal from school, a student may be sent home (suspended) after the family has been notified. In case of suspension, there will be conditions for re -admittanc e to the school. A written record of the suspension and the reasons for it will be sent to the family and included in the individual student's record. In case of a serious or repeated breach of discipline or decorum, or failure to abide by our basic guide lines, dismissal from the school may become necessary. Pink Slips The High School uses a \"pink slip\" system for minor behavioral issues within the school day and at school activities. Students who break the High School expectations are sent to the front office and asked to complete a \"pink slip\". The form asks them to reflect on what they did that broke expectations, why it is not appropriate, and what they can do to make it right again. The student then takes the completed form to one of the High Schoo l Coordinator s or a faculty member (not the one who sent them to the office) to talk through the behavior and to decide upon appropriate next steps. In most cases the \"pink slip\" is sufficient to help the student correct the behavior. The High School C oordinator decides whether to share the pink slip with parents depending on the severity of the behavior, whether it is a repeated or ongoing problem, and the way in which the student responded to the correction. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 32 Probationary Guidelines Probationary s tatus means that a student's academic and/or behavioral performance is being monitored more closely than usual due to concerns that have arisen regarding the student's ability or willingness to maintain the standards expected by the school. It is meant to be a serious step taken after other methods have been tried. The goal is always to help the student to recognize and find ways to be successful at our school. When we accept a student, we believe that the student has the ability and potential to succeed . Probation is a means to help the student bring into focus the challenges they face and gives an opportunity to make choices about their future. Two Types of Probation Academic - A student will be placed on academic probation when the full -time High School faculty/staff determine that a student is not making sufficient academic progress. This is determined by several methods: 1. A student will automatically be placed on academic probation when the student has failed to earn credit for two courses in a s chool year. 2. A student will automatically be placed on academic probation when the student has received minimal passing transcript comments in three or more courses in a school year. 3. A student may be placed on academic probation by receiving some combinat ion of minimal passing transcript comments or failing to earn credit, depending on the circumstances as determined by full -time High School faculty/staff. For example, if a student receives one minimal passing transcript comment and one failure to earn cr edit within the same school year, and the faculty is generally concerned about the student's attitude and performance in their classes, this may be grounds for going on academic probation. Artistic courses, such as instrumental or choral music and visual arts, will also be used as determining factors in placing a student on academic probation. In most circumstances the family will be notified that a student is at risk to fail a class before the end of that course. The exception might be a main lesson in which, due to the depth of the work done in a short period of time, a student's performance may not be known until the end of the course. Behavioral - A student may be placed on behavioral probation at any time if a situation is deemed serious enough to warrant it. This may be done by consultation of the full -time faculty/staff. More likely, if a behavioral problem is identified, a meeting with the student and/or family will be held to identify concerns, strategies for improvement and goals. The hope of this intervention is that the situation can be resolved without the student being placed on probationary status. If the behavior(s) were to continue, the student would be placed on probation. Probationary Process A student and the student's family will b e notified in writing if the student is being placed on probation. This statement will include the reasons for probation and the expected standards to be met. A faculty member will be assigned as a mentor to the student to assist the student in understan ding the reasons for probation and developing strategies for improvement. After eight weeks, a student's progress will be reviewed by the faculty and either continued, revised or discontinued. The probation may be reviewed at any time if a new circumstan ce arises. A student who continues on probation after the initial eight- week period risks being asked to leave the school or not having their contract renewed for the next school year. Not earning credit, or receiving minimal credit, for another class after being placed on academic probation may be grounds for dismissal, depending on all circumstances and the good will of the student in improving. While we must always respect that young people are searching for their own paths in life, the loss of any stude nt is a loss for the school. We must strive to find the balance between the needs of one student and the needs of many. Our hope and goal is that this process need only be used occasionally and that its use will result in a student finding their directio n while maintaining the integrity of the school. Template for Response to a School Drug or Alcohol Incident Suspension: The student will automatically receive a minimum of a three -day suspension --three full days of classes. This can be extended if circums tances warrant a longer absence, but the goal is to give the faculty and family time to have the 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 33 necessary meetings and respond appropriately, while having students return to school to continue academic progress as soon as reasonable. All tests and projec ts due during suspension are scored as \"zeros\". Homework can be made up at the teacher's discretion, but the student should not expect the teacher to make special efforts on their behalf. Any no credits resulting from days of suspension (for instance if a final block test is missed) will be listed as \"No -credit\" on the transcript. Behavior Probation : In a meeting within two school days of the start of the suspension or as soon as feasible, the full circle of full -time High School faculty members will draf t a behavioral probation plan that will then be reviewed with the family of the affected student at least one school day before the end of the suspension period. It is important to the faculty that the family be in support of a probation plan before it is shared with the student. The final behavioral probation plan will be presented to the student at the end of the suspension period, before they return to school. It must be agreed to and signed by both the family and the student before the student reenters the classroom. Length of Probation : The behavioral probation period will be ten weeks, not including breaks from school. If the incident happens fewer than ten weeks before the beginning of the summer vacation, then behavioral probation will extend into the fall term. Academic P rogress : The student is expected to be academically successful in all classes during the behavioral probation period. A meeting with the family will be held if a student receives a no -credit during the behavioral probation period. General Behavior : If a s tudent receives any pink -slips during behavioral probation a meeting with the family will be called. If a student's behavior continues to result in pink -slips, the faculty may extend the behavioral probation period, resulting in the student's inability to participate in sports and trips and, if behavior does not improve, could lead to the student's dismissal from the school. Sports : The student may not practice with any school team for a minimum of two weeks from the start of suspension. The student may then practice with a team but is benched for a minimum of two games/competitions to a maximum of the full season of games/competition, as decided by the faculty in the initial creation of the behavioral probation contract. International Exchange : The stu dent is ineligible for international exchange for the balance of the full school year. If a student is currently hosting an exchange visitor, then the student is allowed to finish hosting but is not allowed to then participate in their own exchange. Class Trips : The student is automatically ineligible for any class trips that take place during the behavioral probation period. Ninth and Tenth: The student may participate in the end- of-year class trip (provided behavioral probation period is over) unless the full -time faculty decides that there is a specific reason that the student should not attend. Twelfth: Maine trip: A student will not be eligible for the Maine trip, which typically takes place the second week of school in September, if the incident ha s happened at the end of junior year or the beginning of senior year resulting in the behavioral probation period not being complete. Italy trip: The circle of full -time High School faculty will make a decision on a student's eligibility for Italy at the end of the behavioral probation period, they could decide to approve the trip, not approve the trip, or, if the decision is being made months before the trip, to wait until a later date to finalize a decision. School -Wide Optional Over -Night Trips: The s tudent is automatically ineligible for any optional school wide over - night trips (Model UN, Hiking Club etc.) that take place during the behavioral probation period. The faculty will make a decision on eligibility for these trips occurring after the behavi oral probation period at the end of the behavioral probation period. If the incident happens within the preparation period for the Model UN or Hiking Club trips, the student may petition the faculty to be included in the preparation events, but a decision about going on the trip will be made on an individual basis at the end of the behavioral probation period. School Clubs : The participation of the student in school clubs will be evaluated on an individual basis during the formation of the probation contra ct. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 34 Attendance at school athletic and social events : The student cannot attend school athletic or social events for four weeks of regularly scheduled school from the suspension date. Community Service Requirement: The student is to complete 20 hours of co mmunity service approved by an appointed faculty member during the behavioral probation period. Continued Problematic Behavior : If a student violates their agreement with the school to not use drugs and alcohol at school or a school event a second time, th e student will be dismissed from Rudolf Steiner High School. See the All-School Policies and Procedures section for important information on probation, suspension and dismissal. Emergency Plans Fire Fire exit maps and where to go in the case of a fire are posted in all classrooms and other strategic locations in the building. Teachers know the exit plan from their room and teach their students what it is. There are primary and secondary exits listed for fire drills. There is a fire alarm in the building which will sound in a drill or in a real fire situation. Teacher shuts windows, takes the attendance sheet and closes the door after the class has exited the room silently Students and teacher exit the building by their assigned route and gather along the campus exit road Students stay with their class, looking for the large 9, 10, 11 or 12 signs to gather behind Office staff and teachers take attendance in each grade Teachers spread out among the four grades to ensure that calm and quiet is maintained Everyone remains out side of the building until the all -clear is given by a HS Coordinator or the Faculty Chair Tornado In the event of a tornado watch , administrative staff members will monitor radio and websites for tornado warnings If a warning is issued, a n administrative staff member will go through the school ringing the hand bell The teacher will take the attendance sheet and close the windows and blinds as students line up to exit the room Students and teachers exit silently and go quickly and directly to the basement under the Commons or the locker rooms Teachers will take attendance and report missing students immediately to an administrative staff member Students will assume the protective position facing interior walls and covering their heads with arm s and wait in silence until the all -clear is given by a HS Coordinator or the Faculty Chair Shelter -in-Place The administration will announce the Shelter -in-Place with the megaphone throughout the school . Faculty Protocol Lock classroom doors, close windows, draw blinds Take attendance and account for all students - be ready to report attendance to administrative staff member who will come to the door Remain with students until an administrative staff member comes to the door to update you on the reason for the Shelter -in-Place and the next steps you should take During a Shelter -in-Place it is ok to open the door to respond to staff members as there is no immediate threat in the building 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 35 During a Shelter -in-Place it is advised to continue with the work of th e class once the room is secure and all students have been accounted for Students should be kept in the room until faculty are informed that it is ok for them to move around the building again. Administrative staff will ensure that there are opportunities for students to attend to personal needs, such as trips to the bathroom, in a controlled and calm way Stud ent Protocol when a Shelter -in-Place happens at a passing time, break or lunch Upon hearing the megaphone announcement , immediately go to the classro om where main lesson was held that day Follow all faculty and administrative staff directions and instructions Students should not use a phone during the Shelter -in-Place. Direct Threat to Campus Security and Safety In the unlikely event that the High Scho ol is threatened by a perpetrator with intent to hurt students, faculty or staff , the High School faculty and staff are trained in the ALICE response method. This is a system now being used by many school districts (including Ann Arbor Public Schools) tha t gives individual teachers the latitude to assess a situation and take the action they deem the most likely to protect the students in their care. These responses could include a traditional lock - down (doors, locked, window blinds drawn, students hiding in the corners of the room); an enhanced lockdown where furniture is used to barricade doorways; or escape, through windows or out available doors. Each year the faculty and staff of the High School will receive training in ALICE at the August back -to-school meetings, and the approach will be shared with students during the first month of school. Students will be taught to follow faculty instructions but will never be asked to take any direct action against an intruder. Our goal is to help students escape a dangerous situation. During the student instruction they will be informed of the school reunification point for the school year (the place to go if they leave the building to escape a dangerous situation). Academic Guidelines Course Expectations The requirements to receive credit for any given course will be outlined by the teacher of that course. These requirements will consist of some combination of the following: Mastery of subject material Completion of assigned work on time Participation in classes Proper citation of work that is not one's own Partial credit may also be awarded in situations that may not warrant full credit, such as: Illness for a portion of the class Passing the lab portion of a class but not the main lesson portion Approved extended absence for a portion of the class On exchange for a portion of the class Half credit will only be given if a student has completed at least 50% of the class and will be used only when a student has worked, participated , and completed between half and all of the work in a class, but is not able to gain full credit because too much work was missed. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 36 In the event that a teacher finds that a student is not meeting some or all of these requirements, the following steps will be taken to help the student to succeed: The teacher will work with the student to try to remedy the problems. This may include a study hall at lunch or after school. If necessary, the teacher will inform the student's family , usually by sending a progress report home, and enlist their help in supporting the student. We may ask families to provide tutoring or counseling. If necessary, a meeting will be convened with the student, the student's family and the High School faculty to try to find ways to support the student. If a teacher concludes that a student did not meet the requirements of the course, despite the efforts to help, the teacher has available the option of not giving credit for the course. This becomes part of the student's permanent record and may require repetition of the course outside of the regular school schedule. A student may receive a mentor and be put on academic probation (See Probationary Guidelines ). It may jeopardize a student's qualification for a high school diploma, and it may jeopardize the student's place in the school. Main Lesson Books The main lesson book is one of the key elements of the curric ulum. It is assumed that every student will make their best effort to present well written material in an artistically pleasing presentation under the guidance of the teacher. Considerable freedom is generally given to express oneself within this context, but the following guidelines are mandatory unless otherwise specified by the teacher: Text written in cursive Same color ink throughout the book Margins on every page Spelling mistakes corrected Title page Use of flowing ink pens HS Policy on Cheating Rudolf Steiner High School urges students to conduct themselves ethically and honorably. It is expected that the grade a student earns is based upon work that the student has performed. Cheating is dishonest. It harms you and it harms the other students who do not cheat. We, therefore, will not condone nor will we tolerate any student submitting work that is not produced solely by the student's own initiative. The following behaviors may be considered as possible acts of cheating: plagiarism, talking d uring an exam, copying another's test/assignment, allowing others to copy your work, roving eyes, open books or noteboo ks during an exam, crib sheets/ cheat sheets, passing notes during an exam, copying electronic files and printing another student's work, having someone do your assignment for you (homework, project, book report), stealing exams, selling exams, altering a grade (in grade book, on a computer, on a report card), taking an exam for someone else, using bribery/blackmail/threats, intimidation in pursuit of a better grade. Note that we consider any student who provides their own work to another student to be cheating - this includes the sharing of your completed work (assignments or main lesson book pages), positioning tests so that another student can have easy access, or in any other way doing the work for another student. One area that is especially important to consider at RSSAA is how to make up work fairly when you have missed class. In the High School it is never appropriate for you to take another student's main lesson book page, or other homework, and copy it. Instead , you should always start your efforts to make up your work with a conversation with the teacher in the class you missed. They can guide you on the best way to address the missing work, including possibly working with the teacher at lunch, reading support materials, or being asked to use another student's notes from the class presentation. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 37 It is important that during the high school years students learn to actively avoid che ating and the faculty and staff of Rudolf Steiner High School will work with students to support them completing their own work in ethical and responsible ways. If a student is suspected of cheating, we will use the following process: The class teacher and H S Student Support Coordinator will meet and decide on which of the following responses is most appropriate . A conversation between the class teacher and student A conversation between the class teacher, H S Student Support Coordinator and stude nt A conversation between the class teacher, a second High School teacher (likely High School Fa culty Chair) and the student A conversation between the class teacher, H S Student Support Coordinator, student and student's family . If the conversation substan tiates the cheating then the class teacher, High School Faculty Chair and High School Student Support Coordinator will take the following steps: If a first offense, the student may receive a \"0\" on the test or assignment and the student will be asked to in form their parents of the act of cheating - faculty will follow up with a conversation with the family . If a second offense, the student will receive a \"0\" on the test or assignment, may receive n o credit in the class, a follow- up conversation with the fam ily will be held, and the student will likely be placed on probation. Any further cheating will be handled through a plan made as part of the probation agreement - this could include reporting of the behavior on college applications. Absence from Lessons It is expected that student s will make every effort to attend school regularly. This is particularly important in main lesson, where the teacher delivers new content orally every day. When a class is missed, it is the student's responsibility to make up for the absence, with the guidance of the teacher. See section on Timeliness and Attendance for more information on this topic. Evaluations Rudolf Steiner High School does not issue grades to students. Rather, students receive written evaluations for each class. Progress will be evaluated on a regular basis as follows: Main Lesson Blocks Arts/Crafts Blocks Subject Classes At the end of each block or class Year -Long Track Classes Math, Foreign Language, Music At the end of each quarter (approximately 9 weeks) Year -Long Subject Classes Movement, Chorus At the end of each semester (approximately 18 weeks) Each report will be a comprehensive summary of the student's individual relationship to the subject and should include feedback about written work, performance in class and overall grasp of the subject. It should include both strengths and areas that need improvement. It can include test results. Overal l performance will not be reduced to a single grade because of the limited value and meaning of such a grade. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 38 The Transcript Comment section from these reports is used to populate each student's transcript, which will be an integral part of the senior ye ar college applications. In the event that students are not meeting some or all of the course requirements, several steps can be taken to help the student succeed. The teacher will work with the student directly to remedy the problem. If necessary, the t eacher will inform the family and enlist their help in supporting the student. The teacher may convene a meeting with the student, family , and the HS Faculty to find additional ways to support the student. Special accommodation plans will be developed for students as necessary. Changes in a Student's Program With the exception of designated electives, students are expected to take all courses listed in the School Profile. A student may petition in writing to alter the course of study a minimum of three week s prior to the requested change. The faculty is the sole arbiter of such proposals and its decision is final in all cases. Transcripts At the end of each school year, each student will receive a transcript which lists the courses taken, the credit earned a nd an evaluative comment for each class. At the end of four years a student will have four pages of transcripts. These take the place of traditional transcripts with grades that most schools issue. Transcripts are what is sent to colleges and universities with applications. Because we are a non -traditional and ungraded school, these transcripts are very important in providing a pictur e of the quality of a student's academic work. Graduation Requirements Because all students at Rudolf Steiner High School have chosen to attend this school, it is assumed that each student wants to be successful and will do his or her very best to be so. The expectation is that a student will pass all of the courses that the student takes. These requirements are as follows: English 4 credits Science 3 credits Mathematics 4 credits History/Social Science 2 credits Foreign Language 2 credits Music/Art 2 credits Movement and Health 1 credit Computer Science 0.5 credit Civics and Government 0.5 credit Economics 0.5 credit Other 5.5 credits Total 25 credits Students who join the school after Grade 9 and students who have not been successful in all their classes must meet minimum distribution requirements in order to receive a high school diploma. Standardized Tests The PSAT, SAT and ACT tests are important components of the college application proc ess. Students will take the PSAT in Grades 10 and 11 . We provide an SAT/ACT preparation course in the subject lesson curriculum in Grade 11 and provide materials and assistance to students in registering for SAT and ACT tests in the Grades 11 and 12 . 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 39 AP Testing In their eleventh and twelfth grade years, some High School students choose to take Advanced Placement and other tests (such as language placement tests) in order to show colleges proficiency in a particular area. In general , these tests are less important, or persuasive, to college and university admission teams than an excellent transcript. Therefore, we encourage students to seriously consider the balance of preparing for an additional test and the regular daily school homework load before s igning up for such a test. We also encourage consultation with the HS Student Support Coordinator before signing up to ensure that there is a strong preparation plan in place. If a student chooses to take AP or other proficiency tests, we ask that the s tudent : Inform a HS Coordinator, in writing by October 1 , of the tests the student is registered for Inform all teachers whose classes will be missed at least one week in advance of the test day Limit time off school to the half -day on the day of the test Take responsibility for making up the missed class time International Students For international students, a major challenge of the first six months in the school is English fluency. Classroom note taking, essay writing and test taking are all made harder by the effort and concentration needed to handle the English involved in these educational tasks. The High School considers international students to be an asset in our classrooms, bringing di fferent life experiences and responses to classroom work to the High School community. Therefore, to support these students in being successful in their first semester of work at the High School we use an alternative evaluation system. International stud ents are assessed by: A. Regular Assessment - international students who enter the High School with a high level of English competency and who can clearly manage the English language workload will be evaluated with all native speaking students. B. Language Lear ning Period - international students who are working to develop their skills will be allowed a one semester language learning period. International students in the first quarter of this one semester period will be evaluated on the following expectations: Regular attendance in all classes Regular participation and effort made to participle in class activities Submission of main lesson pages, although often short and supported by faculty Attempt to take any quizzes or tests, although they might not be successful Active participation in ELL classes with effort made there to support class success Students who meet the expectations above will receive \"Credit - English Language Learning Period\" as their transcript comments for all classes in this first quar ter. International students in the second quarter of this one semester period will be evaluated on the following expectations Regular attendance in all classes Regular participation in class discussions and activities Completion of main lesson books with appropriate pages included Completion of quizzes and tests Active participation in ELL classes Students who meet the expectations above will receive \"Credit - English Language Learning Period\" as the transcript comment for all classes in this second quarte r of adjustment that they have not been able to meet the regular assessment requirements for. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 40 The goal for all international students is that they progress over the one semester period to a level of English fluency and competency that will enable them to be successful in receiving credit in the H igh School based on the regular evaluation criteria. Students who cannot meet regular evaluation criteria during their second semester at the High School will be held to the standard academic probation process and may be asked to leave the school. College Counseling Comprehensive college counseling services are offered to all students in Grades 11 and 12 . However, students may begin exploring post high school options at any time by requesting an appointment or vis iting the college resources library in the Frame House . There are college process information books, college cata logs, web page listings and other useful resources available. There are also resources for summer an d other post -high school programs. Students are encouraged to go to the Frame House to check in and /or ask questions of the College Counselor . Beginning in Grade 10, packets of information are periodically sent to all students and their family providing information and marking important mileston es as students move through the high school years and make decisions about their futures. October through May, there are monthly information evenings for families about the college application process. Extrac urricular Activities Participation We encourage everyone to participate in after -school activities either at the school or in the community but expect them to remain current with class work. In support of these activities, the faculty and staff are prepared to be flexible about requirements and timeta bles, but students need to communicate their situation in advance to the appropriate faculty/staff members. After -school activities cannot replace school responsibilities. Sports We are committed to assisting students in their athletic interests and will develop our sports program as interest and enrollment allows. There will be a fee charged for sports participation to offset costs to the school. Rudolf Steiner High School is a member of the Michigan High School Athletic Association. All athletic activi ties will abide by the MHSAA regulations as described in their handbook (available online or in the Athletic Director's office) and our own Athletic Code of Conduct. All students participating in school -sponsored athletics will receive a copy of our Athle tics Handbook and are expected to abide by its rules. Rudolf Steiner High School is also a member of the NCAA and certifies athletes' eligibility for college competition and scholarships. If a student is interested in college athletics, the student should let the H S Student Support Coordinator know by the end of Grade 10 so that the process can be completed appropriately. All athletes must have a current physical examination form on file (dated on or after April 15 of the previous school year). Students who are on probation for academic or behavioral reasons may not be eligible to participate on a school athletic team for the duration of their probationary period. Clubs In addition to athletic activities, the school strives to facilitate other in terests and activities. Depending on interest and availability of adult sponsors, we will host a variety of clubs. These may include drama, yearbook, hiking, community service, gardening, Model United Nations, etc. Students are encouraged to be active i n organizing other students around common interests, and in recruiting adult sponsors. Community Service As members of our school community, the Ann Arbor community and the world community, it is important that each of us finds ways to contribute to the well -being of our communities without thought of personal gain. Students are encouraged to thoughtfully find areas of community need and to dedicate some portion of daily time and energy to making a difference. There are also o pportunities for club community service work. Community service should be organized in cooperation with the school office . 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School 41 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - High School Campus Practical Matters 42 High School Campus Practical Matters Entrance Security On school mornings, students may enter the school through the gym doors or the main entrance .

The benefit is pai d to the school on the family's behalf and is a percentage of the tuition and fees owed based on the remaining portion of the school year at the time of the withdrawal. The family is responsible for any remaining balance. Withdrawal for any reason does not reduce or cancel the obligation for the full year's tuition and fees. Probation Probationary status means that a student's academic and/or behavioral performance is being monitored more closely than usual due to concerns that have arisen regarding the stu dent's ability or willingness to maintain the standards expected by the school. It is meant to be a serious step taken after other methods have not worked. The goal is always to help the student to recognize and find ways to be successful at our school. When RSSAA accepts a student, we believe that the student has the ability and potential to succeed. Probation is a means to help students bring into focus the challenges they face and gives them an opportunity to make choices about their future. Please s ee the Grades 1 -8 Student Conduct section or the High Sch ool Student Conduct section for probation information specific to those grades. Suspension Students who are a disruption to the learning environment o r endanger themselves or others may be suspended. The suspension may last one or more days. Before a student is sent home, the teacher or staff member will consult with a member of the appropriate Carrying Group . A suspended student may not return to class until a meeting between the appropriate faculty and/or staff member and the student's family has occurred. Depending on the age of the student, the student may attend the meeting. Dismissal If a student is disruptive or incorrigible to the point where it is unlikely that suc cessful learning can take place or the required academic standards are not being met, the school reserves the right to dismiss a student. This process is managed by the Carrying Group who will gather information, involve the appropriate staff and faculty as needed, and make the final decision. Prior to implementation the Carrying Group will meet with the Review Team, which is composed of the College Chair and a Coordinator from another part of the school , who will ensure that the school's policies and procedures have been followed. Tuition and fees are not excused, returned or pro -rated for periods of dismissal o r suspension. A family who has purchased Tuition Refund Insurance receives a benefit under the terms of the insurance policy. The benefit is paid to the school on the family's behalf and is a percentage of the tuition and fees owed based on the remaining portion of the school year at the time of the dismissal. The family is responsible fo r any remaining balance. Families should be aware that in addition to the situation described above, certain beh aviors may result in immediate suspension or dismissal . Examples of such beha vior include but are not limited to: bringing weapons or illegal drugs or alcohol to school ; theft; arson; destruction of property; threats of violence; extreme physical and/or verbal hostility, such as fighting or abusive swearing; overt and inappropriate sexual behavior on school property. Please see the Grade s 1-8 Student Conduct section or the High School Student Conduct section for dismissal information specific to those grades.

Every student is unique with special talents and challenges. Sometimes students require assistance to help them with their challenges if the challenges affect progress in our curriculum. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is not set up specifically for functional -needs students but offers a degree of support for those students in need. Please click here for more information on Student Educational Support Bullying and Teasing Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor recognizes that a school that is physically and emotionally safe and secure for all students promotes learning, increases student attendance and engagement, and supports student success. To protect the rights of all students and groups for a safe and secure lear ning environment, the school prohibits acts of bullying, harassment, and other forms of aggression and violence. Bullying or harassment, like other forms of aggressive and violent behaviors, interferes with both a school's ability to educate its students a nd a student's ability to learn. All administrators, faculty, staff, parents, volunteers, and students are expected to refuse to tolerate bullying and harassment and to demonstrate behavior that is respectful and civil. It is especially important for adult s to model these behaviors (even when disciplining) in order to provide positive examples for student behavior. \"Bullying\" or \"harassment\" is any gesture or written, verbal, graphic, or physical act (including electronically transmitted acts - i.e., cyberb ullying, through the use of internet, cell phone, computer, or wireless handheld device, currently in use or later developed and used by students) that is reasonably perceived as being dehumanizing, intimidating, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or other wise likely to evoke fear of physical harm or emotional distress and may be motivated either by bias or prejudice based upon any actual or perceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gende r identity or expression; or a mental, physical, or sensory disability or impairment; or by any other distinguishing characteristic, or is based upon association with another person who has or is perceived to have any distinguishing characteristic. Bullyin g and harassment also include forms of retaliation against individuals who report or cooperate in an investigation under this policy. Such behaviors are considered to be bullying or harassment whether they take place on or off school property, at any schoo l-sponsored function, or at any time or place where a child's imminent safety or over -all wellbeing may be at issue. \"Bullying\" and \"Harassment\" are conduct that meets all of the following criteria: is reasonably perceived as being dehumanizing, intimida ting, hostile, humiliating, threatening, or otherwise likely to evoke fear of physical harm or emotional distress; is directed at one or more pupils; is repeated; is conveyed through physical, verbal, technological or emotional means; substantially interferes with educational opportunities, benefits, or programs of one or more pupils; and adversely affects the ability of a pupil to participate in or benefit from th e school's educational programs or activities by placing the pupil in reasonable fear of physical harm or by causing emotional distress. The scope of this policy includes the prohibition of every form of bullying, harassment, and cyberbullying/harassment, whether in the classroom, on school premises, immediately adjacent to school premises, when a student is traveling to or from school, or at a school -sponsored event. Bullying or harassment, including cyberbullying/ harassment, that is not initiated at a lo cation defined above is covered by this policy if the incident results in a potentially material or substantial disruption of the school learning environment for one or more students and/or the orderly day -today operations of any school or school program. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 48 Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor expects students to conduct themselves in a manner in keeping with their levels of development, maturity, and demonstrated capabilities with a proper regard for the rights and welfare of other students, school staff, vol unteers, and contractors. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor believes that a comprehensive health education curriculum, within a coordinated school health framework, helps students attain knowledge and skills vital to school success, a productive workforce and good citizenship. Critical skills include anticipating consequences of choices, making informed decisions, communicating effectively, resolving conflicts, and developing cultural competency. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor recognizes that in order to have the maximum impact, it is critical to provide a minimum of annual training for school employees and volunteers who have significant contact with pupils on school policies and procedures regarding bullying and harassment. Training will provide scho ol employees with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities and the necessary skills to fulfill them. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor believes that standards for student behavior must be set through interaction among the students, parents and guardians, staff, and community members, producing an atmosphere that encourages students to grow in self -discipline and their ability to respect the rights of others. The development of this atmosphere requires respect for self and others, as well as for school and community property on the part of students, staff, parents, and community members. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor believes that the best discipline for aggressive behavior is designed to (1) support students in taking responsibility for their actions, (2) develop empathy, and (3) teach alternative ways to achieve the goals and the solve problems that motivated the aggressive behavior. Staff members who interact with students shall apply best practices designed to prevent discipline pr oblems and encourage students' abilities to develop self -discipline and make better choices in the future. Since bystander support of bullying and harassment can encourage these behaviors, RSSAA prohibits both active and passive support for acts of harass ment or bullying. The staff should encourage students not to be part of the problem; not to pass on the rumor or derogatory message; to walk away from these acts when they see them; to constructively attempt to stop them; to report them to the designated a uthority; and to reach out in friendship to the target. Periodic classroom meetings will be conducted to teach bystanders how and when to respond to bullying and harassment incidents. Informal classroom discussions and activities designed to provide awaren ess and increase student connectedness promote a positive shift in peer norms that will support empowered bystanders. When bystanders do report or cooperate in an investigation, they will be protected from retaliation with the same type of procedures used to respond to bullying and harassment. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor requires faculty and staff to develop and implement procedures that ensure both the appropriate consequences and remedial responses to a student or staff member who commits one or mo re acts of bullying and harassment. The following factors, at a minimum, shall be given full consideration by the school in the development of the procedures for determining appropriate consequences and remedial measures for each act of harassment or bully ing. Factors for Determining Consequences Age, development, and maturity levels of the parties involved Degree of harm (physical and/or emotional distress) Surrounding circumstances Nature and severity of the behavior(s) Incidences of past or continuing pattern(s) of behavior Relationship between the parties involved Context in which the alleged incident(s) occurred Note : A student's academic or athletic status is not a legitimate factor for determining consequences. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 49 Factors for Determining Remedial M easures Personal Life skill competencies Experiential deficiencies Social relationships Strengths Talents Traits Interests Hobbies Extra -curricular activities Classroom participation Academic performance Environmental School culture School climate and lack of connectedness Student -staff relationships and staff behavior toward the student Level of consistency in staff responses to bullying or harassing behaviors Level of consistency in application or severity of consequences given to student s Staff -staff relationships witnessed by students General staff management of classrooms and other educational environments Staff ability to prevent and de -escalate difficult or inflammatory situations Social -emotional and behavioral supports Social r elationships Community activities Neighborhood culture Family situation Range and number of opportunities for student engagement, involvement, and recognition for achievement (beyond academics and athletics) Consequences and appropriate remedial action s for a student or staff member who engages in one or more acts of bullying or harassment may range from positive behavioral interventions up to and including suspension or expulsion, in the case of a student, or suspension or termination in the case of an employee, as set forth in the code of student conduct and employee handbook. School employees will also be held accountable for bullying or harassing behavior directed toward school employees, volunteers, parents, or students. Consequences for a student w ho commits an act of bullying and harassment shall vary in method and severity according to the nature of the behavior, the developmental age of the student, and the student's history of problem behaviors and performance, and must be consistent with the sc hool's approved code of student conduct. Remedial measures shall be designed to: correct the problem behavior; prevent another occurrence of the behavior ; and protect the victim of the act . Effective discipline should employ a school -wide approach to adopt a rubric of bullying offenses and the associated consequences. The consequences and remedial measures may include, but are not limited to, the examples listed below: Examples of Consequences 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedur es 50 Admonishment Participation in a guided reflection process designed to teach alternative behavior Temporary removal from the classroom Loss of privileges In-school suspension during the school week or the weekend, for students Out-of-school suspension Legal action Expulsion or termination Examples of Remedial Measures Strategies for Individual Behavioral Change: Framing the aggressive behavior as a failed attempt to solve a real problem or reach a goal. The adult assists the misbehaving student to find a better way to solve the problem or meet the goa l. Restitution and restoration Transformative conferencing/restorative justice practices Supervised peer support group Corrective instruction or other relevant learning or service experience Supportive discipline to increase accountability for the bull ying offense Supportive interventions, including participation of an Intervention and Referral Services team, peer mediation, etc. Behavioral assessment or evaluation, including, but not limited to, a referral to a Child Study Group, as appropriate Behavio ral management plan, with benchmarks that are closely monitored Involvement of school disciplinarian Student counseling Parent conferences Student treatment Student therapy Strategies for Environmental Change (Classroom, School Building, or School District): Activities or strategies designed to help the student who engaged in bullying or harassment reflect on the offending behavior, maintaining an emotionally -neutral and strength- based approach School and community surveys or other strategi es for determining the conditions contributing to harassment, intimidation, or bullying Change process to improve school culture School climate improvement/improvement in conditions for learning and instructional pedagogy (incorporation of brain -compatibl e strategies) Modifications of schedules Adjustments in hallway traffic Modifications in student routes or patterns traveling to and from school Increased supervision and targeted use of monitors (e.g., hallway, playground) General professional development programs for certificated and noncertificated staff Professional development plans for staff in key disciplinary roles Disciplinary action for school staff who contributed to the problem 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 51 Parent conferences Referral to fa mily counseling The School Administrator, and/or the appropriate level coordinator, are responsible for receiving complaints alleging violations of this policy. All school employees are required to report alleged violations of this policy to the School Administrator or the level coordinator. All other members of the school community, including students, parents, volunteers, and visitors, are encouraged to report any act that may be a violation of this policy. Reports may be made anonymously, but formal dis ciplinary action may not be based solely on the basis of an anonymous report. The School Administrator and/or the level coordinator are responsible for determining whether an alleged act constitutes a violation of this policy. In so doing, the School Admi nistrator and/or the level coordinator shall conduct a prompt, thorough, and complete investigation of each alleged incident. The investigation is to be completed within three school days after a report or complaint is made. The parents of the students inv olved shall receive written notice from the school on the outcome of the investigation (in compliance with current privacy laws and regulations). All reports on instances of bullying and/or harassment must be recorded by the school for annual data review. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor prohibits reprisal or retaliation against any person who reports an act of bullying or harassment or cooperates in an investigation. The consequences and appropriate remedial action for a person who engages in reprisal o r retaliation shall be determined by the administrator after consideration of the nature, severity, and circumstances of the act. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor prohibits any person from falsely accusing another as a means of bullying or harassment. T he consequences and appropriate remedial action for a person found to have falsely accused another as a means of bullying or harassment may range from positive behavioral interventions up to and including suspension or expulsion. Consequences and appropria te remedial action for a school employee found to have falsely accused another as a means of bullying or harassment shall be in accordance with school policies, procedures, and agreements. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor requires school officials to annually disseminate the policy to all school staff, students, and parents, along with a statement explaining that it applies to all applicable acts of harassment and bullying that occur on school property, or at school -sponsored functions. The school shall incorporate information regarding the policy against harassment or bullying into each school employee training program and handbook. Communication Process Faculty and Staff Perhaps our most important avenue for communication is the willingness of our facu lty and staff to talk with students and families about any question or concern. Please do not hesitate to approach any of your student's teachers or any member of the administration with questions . We all consider communication with families an important p art of our job. If you are not sure to whom a question should be directed, check with the LS or HS office. We will be happy to direct you to the appropriate individual. Class Parent Meetings Parent evenings are scheduled throughout the year in every EC-8 class and are or ganized by the Class Teacher s. This valuable time together is used to share information with families about the curriculum and to discuss any concerns that families might have about life in t he classroom for their students or general questio ns about the school program. Special subject teachers will attend at least one meeting per grade during the year in the Grades . Families are strongly advised to attend these evenings. The H igh School schedules two parent evenings every year. Families then divide into class groups for discussion of curriculum, extra curricular and social issues relevant to their students' grade. Class meetings are chaired by HS Faculty and Staff. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 52 Community Support Process The purpose of this process is to suppo rt members of our community in working through concerns by facilitating communication to enhance shared understanding and strengthen relationships. You are encouraged to make every attempt to speak directly to the teacher or RSSAA F aculty or staff member involved. If speaking to the teacher or staff member does not resolve your concerns, contact any member of your Carrying Group : Early Childhood Program Lower School Program High School Program EC Coordinator Abby Kurlfink LS Coordinator Peggy Wilson HS Coordinator s Heather Lomason & Ann Brennan EC Faculty Chair Anne Birney LS Faculty Chair Rob White HS Faculty Chair Gary Banks School Administrator Si\u00e2n Owen -Cruise School Administrator Si\u00e2n Owen -Cruise School Administrator Si\u00e2n Owen -Cruise Once the initial contact has been made, a time will be scheduled to sit down together.

Emergency Communication We use our ParentSquare communication system to contact the entire school community in the case of school closings, snow days, unsafe conditions or emergencies. Both a call and a text are sent to cell numbers provided by families in both the LS and the HS . ParentSquare allows us to effectively communicate with the entire community instantaneously. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 55 School Safety Drills As part of our comprehensive safety and preparedness program, we conduct regular emergency drills as required by the state of Michigan, which includes five fire drills (1 fire drill quarterly in Early Childhood) , two severe weather drills and three lockdown/shelte r-in-place drills (in case of an external threat or chemical disaster) each year. Directions on where and how to exit the classroom for fire drills, and where to plac e students in the building for severe weather and lo ckdown drills, are placed near the classroom door. Weather Closings When Ann Arbor P ublic Schools are closed for bad weather, R SSAA will also be closed. If RSSAA is closed due to the weather, both the LS and the HS campuses will be closed. Please see Appendix A: Unsafe Weather Guidelines . If we must be closed due to inclement weather, the school community will be alerted via our ParentSquare system and the following radio stations will broadcast the school closings : WAAM, 1600 AM and WUOM, 91.7 FM. We also notify the Channel 4 and 7 School Closing Hotline. On rare occasion s, it is possible that only the LS or only the HS would be closed for a building emergency (for example, no heat). For families who live in outly ing areas, we encourage you to drive safely during winter storms. If you choose to leave later due to weather, your student will not be counted as tardy. Please check your student in at the front office when they arrive at school . Health, Illness and Medi cation The school must be notified if your student has a contagious infection or illness. Parents are reminded of the importance of keeping your student home with a serious illness so as not to infect the school community. Your student's name will be kept confidential in such communications. If your student is ill, please keep your student home. Remember that students who feel \"under the weather\" at breakfast usually feel worse by mid -morning. If your student was ill the night before, please keep your stud ent home. If your student has a temperature above normal, a red or sore throat, or signs of infection, they do not belong in school. If you have taken your student to the doctor and they have been diagnosed with a communicable illness, please let the office know. Emergency Information Forms (CIC) must be on file by the first day of school. These forms are the school's link to reaching families and are important for the comfort and safety of y our child. If you mo ve, get a new phone number, or change your job, you can update your form through your Family Portal or let the office know right away . First aid supplies are kept in the front office at both the LS and the HS and in the Early Childhood and Aftercare areas . Each Grades and EC Classroom is also supplied with a First Aid Kit. In case of a medical emergency, families will be notified. Families will be notified in the event of a serious injury or head injury and an Incident Report will be co mpleted by the faculty or staff member who was present . If a communicable illness is reported in a class (strep throat, chicken pox, etc.) we will send a notice to the classroom via ParentSquare. If your student becomes ill while at school, we will phone you to come and get your student . The office is an uncomfortable place to be when sick and our space is limited. Prompt arrangement for transportation is appreciated. No medication will be given to a student without written instruction and permission from a parent. If your student must take medication, please send the medication and the instructions for its use to the office. EC and Grades students should not keep medication on their person. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 56 Allergic Reactions In the event of severe allergic reactions, EpiP ens are stored on site at both campuses. Our school has also met the requirement to have first responders and key staff and faculty receive E piPen administration training by a certified, registered nurse. It is the responsibility of families with anaphyla ctic children to identify their children to the relevant School Coordinator. Families must also supply written information regarding: The foods which trigger an anaphylactic reaction A treatment protocol, signed by the child's physician Any changes in the child's condition from previous years or since last reported Permission to post photographs and medical information in key locations, such as the classroom All staff members (teaching and non -teaching) will be made aware that a child with anaphylaxis is a ttending their school, and that child should be identified, either individually or at a staff meeting, before or immediately after the child registe rs at the school. The s chool policy on managing anaphylaxis in the school will be provided to all staff alon g with specific information about each anaphylactic child in attendance. Immunizations RSSAA complies with all State of Michigan, Department of Health and Human Services laws and regulations regarding immunizations, exemptions, waivers , and reporting. More information about current laws and regulations can be found at www.michigan.gov/immunize. Accident Insurance The school has a S tudent Accident Insurance Policy that can provide benefits when there is no other family insurance applicabl e or when there is a deductible or other out- of-pocket expense related to an injury sustained at school or durin g a school -sponsored activity. A deductible, which may be satisfied by other valid collectible ins urance or plan payments, is applied to each cl aim. Please note that the insurance company establishes a maximum benefit amount annually. Contact the Business Office for more information on this insurance. The State of Michigan sponsors an insurance plan called MIChild. MIChild is for uninsured childre n of Michigan's working families. MIChild services are provided by many HMOs and other health c are plans throughout Michigan. Information can be found online. Contracts and Financial Matters Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor does not discriminate in its admission policies on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, height, weight, ma rital status, veteran status, disability or gender identity . Enrollment Contract By signing an enrollment contract, families accept t he obligation to pay tuition for the entire school year. The school depends upon this financial commitment and determines its budget accordingly. Contracts for the upcoming year are offe red to students in good standing . Returning student contracts must be submitted by the specified deadline in order to secure a place in the class and avoid a late enrollment fee. After the deadline, any remaining places will be offered to students on our waiting list and other qualified applicants. The faculty reserves the r ight to withhold a contract for the next year if the student has had on -going academic or social problems during the year. The Business Office also reserves the right to withhold a contract if student accounts are not current. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 57 Enrollment Deposit An enrollment deposit of $5 00 (per student) must accompany the signed contract for all new students. This deposit will be refundable , less any outstand ing amount due the school , upon completion of the school year for non -returning students. Continuing students will have their enrollment deposit applied to the new school year's requirement. The enrollment deposit is non -refundable should the student not e nter or should he or she be withdrawn or dismissed prior to the normal completion of the school year. Tuition Assistance The faculty and Board of Trustees encourage families to consider Waldorf education apart from financial circumstances. Awards of tuitio n assistance are based on need and budgeted funds. A link to the Tuition Assistance application is available on the Affordability page of our school website. The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit - Early Childhood, Before and After Care If you pay for childcare for your children under the age of 13, you may be eligible to receive the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit which could lower your federal taxes. How it works : Take 20 to 35 percent of qualifying dependent care costs as a credit on your tax return (up to a limit). This credit applies on up to $3,000 in care -related expenses for one dependent or $6,000 for two or more. The credit is available regardless of your income, bu t the percentage of allowable expenses (20 to 35 percent) can vary based on what you earn. The more income you earn, the smaller your percentage may be. The credit isn't refundable. So, while it may be used to lower your tax bill, the IRS won't issue you a ny leftover portion as a refund. You can find out if you are eligible for the tax credit on the IRS website . Tuition and Payments There are two plans av ailable for the payment of tuition: Annual Payment Plan: Under this plan, full tuition is paid by July 1 (or upon enrollment if after July 1). Tuition Refund I nsurance is recommended under this plan. Monthly Payment Plan: Under this plan, tuition is paid in up to 10 monthly payments via automatic withdrawal by a tuition management company. The first payment is due in July (or within 30 days of your contract date, whichever is later) and every month thereafter through April of the following year. Enrollment with the tuition management company and Tuition Refund Insurance are required under this plan. If families fall behind in their tuition payments for any reason, it is imperative that they contact the Business Office and meet with the Finance Manager to discuss an alternative plan for meeting their tuition obligation. The school is willing to work with families experiencing financial difficulties, but we cannot help if families fail to communicate . Please be advised that if families do not respond to reminders about their tuition obligation, and if they do not take advantage of opportunities to discuss their financial situation, their student may be asked to remain at home until payment is received or an acceptable plan for making payments has been established. Tuition Payment Policy Tuition must be paid to date by December 15 in order for your student to return after Winter Break, and in full by June 30 in order for your student to return for the ne xt school year. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - All-School Policies and Procedures 58 Tuition Refund Insurance Tuition Refund Insurance protects your financial commitment against unforeseen withdrawals and dismissals. This plan is optional for those paying tuition on the annual payment plan and required for those paying tui tion on the monthly payment plan. As part of the insurance plan, RSSAA will assist you in filing a claim, collect any claim payment to which you are entitled and credit your account, paying any excess to you. The benefit is a percentage based on the remain ing portion of the school year at the time of withdrawal. You will still be required to pay RSSAA any balance which remains unpaid after payment by the insurance carrier. All questions and claims should be directed to the Business Office. Aftercare Fees Pa yment Policy Invoices for Aftercare are issued monthly and due upon receipt. For families who pay tuition via FACTS, Aftercare charges will be added automatically to FACTS unless other arrangements are made with the Business Office. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Governing Structure of our School 59 Governing Structure of our School In developing the structure and curriculum for Waldorf schools, Rudolf Steiner felt that it was important to have the schools governed by the people who work with the students every day. Thus, the faculty of our school plays an important role in setting policy. The College of Teachers, the Board of Trustees and our administration team jointly administer our school. College of Teachers At Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor, ultimate responsibility for all matters of pedagogy rests with the Col lege of Teachers, a core group of full -time faculty and staff dedicated to the philosophical integrity and the long -term interests of the school. Any issue regarding curriculum, student learning concerns, etc., falls into the initial decision -making realm of the College of Teachers. The full faculty assists the work of the College as well as the faculty committees, which take their mandate from and report to the College. Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees is responsible for the legal and financial orga nization of the school. The Board includes faculty , parents/guardians, and community members. In order to facilitate the work of the Board, committees have been established which implement policy, make policy recommendations and report directly to the Boar d of Trustees. All Board committees have at least one faculty representative. Administration The school's administration team is responsible for operational matters that support both the daily educational programs and the long -term viability of the school. It is also responsible for implementing the policies established by the Board of Trustees and the College of Teachers. Members of the administration team report to the School Administrator. Carrying Groups The faculty and administration work together in Carrying Groups that are responsible for managing the following PREK -12 processes with support from the College and faculty : Employee recruitment, hiring, performance improvement and separation Student admissions, suspension, dismissal Crisis management, accidents and safety issues Early Childhood Program Lower School Program High School Program EC Coordinator LS Coordinator HS Coordinat ing Group EC Faculty Chair LS Faculty Chair HS Faculty Chair School Administrator School Administrator School Administrator All decisions in these areas will be made according to the RSSAA Governance Model which details the ways in which faculty and College input and recommendations are sought and managed. In addition, each decision will be reviewed by a Review Team (made up o f the College Chair and a member of the Carrying Group from another area of the school) before implementation. The goal of our Carrying Group model is to facilitate responsive, caring, and legally appropriate decision making on these essential issues. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Governing Structure of our School 60 Governance Representatives and Committees Please visit the school website at www.steinerschool.org for the most current information.

School Committees Faculty Evaluation Team (FET) The FET provides feedback to faculty members to further their development and help them strive for excellence in their teaching. FET arranges and manages formal evaluations of full -time and part -time faculty members from Early Childhood through Grade 12, and also ensures the evaluation of assistants, after -care personnel, and coaches. FET, in conjunction with the Faculty Development Committee, arranges evaluations by external Master Teachers. The FET also arranges, collects, and reviews the input from the annual Parent Surveys. FET consists of the Faculty Chairs and other long -time, experienced Waldorf teachers. This committee reports to the College of Teachers. Faculty Development Committee (FDC) FDC has numerous roles. They facilitate teacher profess ional development and growth through conferences, trainings, and mentoring. FDC actively encourages teachers across the school to participate in training, conference and workshop opportunities. FDC ensures mentoring for new hires, less experienced teacher s, and teachers identified as needing additional support. In addition, they facilitate and encourage peer mentoring (buddies). FDC plays an additional role in the life of the school. FDC manages the FDC budget and Title II budget. FDC keeps an updated lis t of mentoring resources for teachers. They track teacher professional development and mentoring. They review mentoring relationships to ensure the mentoring process is working in a healthy way. Curriculum Support Committee (CSC) The purpose of the Curric ulum Support Committee (CSC) is to ensure high quality implementation of the curriculum, PREK -12, at RSSAA. This is not a committee that performs teacher evaluation, but rather one that provides support so teachers can deliver a quality curriculum experie nce for students and communicates information about our curriculum to the parent body and wider community. This committee will develop messaging that elucidates how Waldorf education is different and exceptional. Pedagogical Integration Team (PIT) 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Governing Structure of our School 62 The Ped agogical Integration Team (PIT) is a communication point, designed to enhance connection between the College committees, the College Chair and the School Administrator. The PIT reports to the College of Teachers and is responsible for ensuring that the wo rk of all College committees is being attended to, that the Chairs of each committee are well supported by the College Chair and School Administrator, and that issues that need College attention are brought to the College for discussion and decision making . PIT is not a decision making or policy -setting body, its mandate is limited to communication between committees and to identifying where discussions and decisions about items should be held. Care Coordinating Group The Care C oordinating Group facilitates an explicit process that provides practical tools adopted from the Three Care Streams Process developed by Kim John Payne. \"The Learning Care Group includes a group of teachers and staff who support the academics and learning needs of students who need something beyond what is already offered in the classroom. They take an active part in initiating and implementing learning/developmental support plans. The Behavioral Care Group supports all teachers and parents in finding pro -social, restorative, and in clusive based ways to help reorient a child in need of guidance. The Social Care Group assists and nurtures an environment of mutual respect, safety and inclusion within our school community. It also advises the Student Social Action Committee comprised o f Middle School Students. These volunteer students are provided with training and take an active role in supporting and guiding the younger students with faculty supervision.\" Festivals Committee The Festivals Committee is responsible for overseeing all the school -wide celebrations. The LS Assembly and Michaelmas are examples of the kind of events for which the committee accepts responsibility. Some celebrations are hosted by one of the grades, such as the Halloween Festival and the Thanksgiving Celebrati on. For these events, Class Teachers and parent volunteers work closely with the Festivals Committee to organize the celebration. HUB Group The HUB Group is an administrative committee formed to facilitate communication amongst the governing bodies of the school. HUB is also charged with the responsibility to make decisions about school operations that do not require group discussion or policy changes and to discuss and direct problems, concerns, and new ideas to the proper committee or governing body. Me mbers of the group include the EC, LS and HS Faculty Chairs, College Chair, EC, LS and HS Coordinators, and the School Administrator . HUB meets weekly, with attendance as needed from the Board President. Safety Committee This is an Administrative committe e (on each campus) that is responsible for the development and im plementation of school -wide safety planning and crisis management. Members of the committee on each campus include the section Coordinator, two appointed faculty representatives, and the facilities and operations staff for both the LS and the HS. The School Administrator and Finance Manager oversee and support the LS and HS Safety Committee to ensure the highest level of safety and compliance. Safety protocols for handling both internal and external threats to students, faculty and administrative staff are established. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee reports to the College of Teachers and is responsible for forming, promoting and forwarding the diversity of the school population the creation of policies and procedures that consciously work towards equity fo r all community members and increasing the level of inclusion of all community members.

Nominating Committee The Nominating Committee has been established to assist the Board of Trustees in identifying and nominating new Board members and overseeing Board orientation. The committee also assists the Board with communication and evaluation procedures. Student Educational Support The Care Coordinating Group and Educational Support Team are dedicated to helping students be successful in our school environment. Every student is unique with special talents and challenges. Sometimes students require assistance to help them with thei r challenges if the challenges affect progress in our curriculum. Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is not set up specifically for students with functional needs but offers a degree of support for those students in need. Lower School The Educational S upport Program consists of an Educational Support Team and the Care Coordinating Group. The current Support Team at the Lower School consists of: Two Educational Support teachers who have been Class teachers and offer reading and math support Part-time reading tutor Change to Reading Support Tutor 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Governing Structure of our School 64 Handwork teacher who has Extra Lesson Remedial training Lower School Coordinator Early Childhood Coordinator All members have studied child development and plan for the specific needs of individual or groups of students as they come to light. The team contemplates possible interventions for students and collaborates to serve the students in our care. We provide support for students in small groups. If a student's needs indicate more help than we can provide, parents are advised to arrange for help privately. This may include referrals to doctors, therapists and/or tutors for continued support. The Care Coordinating Group is a resource for teachers needing support regarding a student's school perfor mance. The group meets weekly to develop policy and protocol for our Student Support program. In evaluating the program needs of students, the group seeks Class Teacher observations, feedback from special subject teachers, evaluations of our education supp ort specialists, and consultation of outside specialists when needed. The Educational Support Program is overseen by the Care Coordinating Group (CCG). The CCG is responsible for the following: Facilitating communications between public school personnel and Steiner School personnel for students with documented disabilities, and yearly Individual Education Plans (IEP) (now called Non -Public Service Plans) Writing Accommodation 504 Plans for students in both the Lower School and the High School In collabor ation with Class Teachers, academic progress is tracked Offering small -group remedial reading sessions with a member of the support team to students in Grades 2 -8 Offering small -group remedial math sessions with a member of the support team to students in Grades 4 -8 Help interpret reports, evaluations and determine possible support needs for candidates who are applying to our school High School In the High School, the Support Team consists of full -time faculty and t wo High School Coordinator s with input fr om part - time teachers.

In fact, it is hard to imagine how the school would function without all of the volunteer hel p we receive from our families . We offer many opportunities for famil ies to get involved in the life of the school . Families are invited to serve on committees, join study groups or find other areas where they may wish to volunteer their time. We encourage all families to take advantage of the many opportunities to become i nvolved in the life of the school . Annual Special Events Throughout the year, there are public events sponsored by the school. The Winter Festival , as well as being a fundraising event, transforms the school into a winter wonderland for people of all ages and helps kindle the holiday spirit. Religious and Cultural Holidays Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is a diverse community reflecting many traditions and perspectives. If each of us is sensitive to both the direct and subtle ways we demonstrate respect and appreciation for these differences, we will each be a positive force in providing a multi -cultural education for our students. We are committed to honoring the rich cultural diversity within our community. Classification of the significance of a holiday' s observance is based on recommendations from representatives of the group who celebrate it. A balance between any formal religious standard and the actual contemporary observance of the holiday has been the intended aim of these recommendations. Holiday observances of major significance to a group are indicated on the online A ll-School Calendar by \"Event -Free Day\" . RSSAA will not fo llowing during and \"Event -Free Day\": Major exams Reviews for major exams Tryouts , for example, teams, plays One-time or major events ( festivals, class photos, dances , etc.) Class/Parent meetings Students will likely be with their families or at a place of worship in observance of these holidays. They might not be in school and/or have time available to do the required homework. Absence to observe these holidays will be excused and the student will have make -up privil eges for missed work. Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur Christmas Epiphany Ramadan Palm Sunday Passover/Pesach Good Friday Easter Eid al -Fitr Additional celebrations that are recognized within our community include: All Saints' Day All Soul's Day Ascension Day Ash Wednesday Beltane Chanukah/Hanukkah Corpus Christi Diwali Feast of the Nativity Holi Holy Saturday Imbolc Kwanzaa Lammas Mabon Midsummer Orthodox Palm Sunday Orthodox Holy Easter Ostara If your student will be away from school for any of these celebrations , please let your class teacher know. Monthly Cultural Observances One way in which the school is working to ensure that our curriculum, classroom activities, and celebrations include a wide range of diverse and inclusive topics is by connecting to monthl y observances that are held in the wider culture of 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Life 66 the United States. Recognizing these months and ensuring that the students are all involved in activities and education centered in that particular culture, or with that particular focus that month, is a step that ensures that each year all students have that experience as a minimum. Our school is dedicated to bringing work surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion into the everyday classroom with our students, not just month by month. Observing months is an important way for the teachers to have a touch point to making sure that specific topics are being presented in the classroom either through books, toys, crafts or activities. It is one way to ensure that there is a structure to support the work bein g done across the curriculum from the Early Childhood c lassrooms to the High School. The months that we are observing are: September 15 to October 15 - Hispanic Heritage Month October - Disability Awareness Month November - Native American/Indigenous Pe oples Month February - Black History Month March - Women's History Month April - Arab American Heritage Month May - Asian Pacific Heritage Month June - Pride Month Each area of the school will be observing these in different ways and working throughout the s chool year to find the best way to involve the students at each level in these observances and celebrations. Early Childhood So much of the learning in Early Ch ildhood is done through observation and imitation. Our Early Childhood faculty and staff are striving to be inclusive in the way that we work with one another, the children, and the families in our program. Some activities that we do in observance of spe cific months include our Early Childhood Lending Library. Our library is full of children's books on topics such as LGBTQ, African American history, Muslim and Jewish religions and traditions, and gender equity among many others that children can check out weekly. Our teachers also read these stories with the children in the classroom which naturally prompts questions and discussion. These books are read throughout the year, but certain books are read during specific observance months , for example, Prince and Knight by Daniel Haack might be chosen to be read during June for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Month. We also provide an extensive book list for parents that contains many books related to diversity, equity and inc lusion. In honor of Black History Month, the Early Childhood celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with a month -long service project. We collect donated personal care items for Starfish Family Services for young families in need. On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day we host an optional family event with book readings, activities, and family meetings on talking to children about race, activism, and socioeconomic disparities. The focus on Black History is then continued through the month of February. Grades One to Eight Stories and biographies are central to the curriculum of the Grades, and we are developing ways to bring these monthly observations alive for the children through their imaginations, and through connecting with both fictional and non- fictional stories. Each month a series of books will be promoted through the library on topics and stories connected to the focus of the month. Through faculty meetings each individual class teacher will be encouraged and supported in bringing age appropriate and diverse tales, games, and activities to the children. The faculty of the Lower School will be working to develop curriculum materials for each month in this yearly cycle. High School At the High School we are continually striving to help our students develop a rich, full understanding of the world in which we live. This includes teaching the historical background of current social and political events and situations, as well as encour aging interest in and respect for a diverse range of cultures, religions, and life experiences. Each month one all-2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Li fe 67 school assembly will be centered around the monthly observance with a range of teacher and student led activities and experiences. In additi on, teachers will be working in their own classes (from Main Lesson, to language classes, to art classes) to bring content and experiences relevant to the celebration of the month. Festivals Festivals and seasonal events are an important aspect of Wald orf education. They are celebrations that bring rhythm and order to the year and meaning to our lives. Over the years they have been a source of joy and strength to our community of students, families , faculty, staff, alumni, and friends. These occasions a re outlined below. September The Rose Ceremony : Students in Grades 1 through 12 are welcomed back to school at the Rose Ceremony on the first day of school. One by one the first graders are guided across the stage by a member of the senior class who then p resents the child with a rose. This is a rite of passage for students going from Kindergarten to Grade 1. Michaelmas : This autumn festival of courage takes place as leaves are turning and days are growing shorter. The annual first- through -fourth grade play tells the story of the dragon tamed through Michael's aid. The play is followed by a community picnic and kite -flying. Early Childhood students attend the play and join in the all -school festivities. Early Childhood Michaelmas Harvest Festival : On the Sa turday following Michaelmas, the EC Families gather for a Michaelmas Harvest Celebration in the morning where the families and EC teachers enjoy festive games and food.

Early Childhood children have a separate parade and puppet play followed by a special snack . November Lantern Walk : As the days grow ever shorter as winter approaches, famili es gather in the evening darkness. After singing around a campfire, students in Grades 1 through 3 and their families walk with lighted lanterns, singing, across the back play field and into the woods where they encounter magical places that are gently li t to reveal sparkling crystals and quiet \"fairies.\" Early Childhood Festival of Light: The EC will \"celebrate the light within\" in early November during this meaningful evening event before the days of the season become even shorter. Thanksgiving Celebration : Grade 3 students and their families prepare a special feast for the LS grades. Some of the food served was planted and harvested by the students in the LS garden. Harvest songs, poems and skits are performed by Grade 3 before the y serve the guests. December St. Nicholas Day : St. Nicholas make a quiet visit to Grades 1 -12 classrooms, bringing each student a simple tr eat. A special basket is delivered to the Early Childhood classes. Santa Lucia Day : This festival celebrates light in winter's darkness. Dressed in white and wearing a crown o f candles (LED), a Grade 8 student Santa Lucia leads Grade 2 through the school, walk ing in procession. Each student is dressed in white and carries a glowing light as s/he softly sings. As the procession enters each classroom, all activity ceases momentarily in quiet welcoming. A tray of cookies is left behind for each class and the offic e staff. Spiral of Light: Students in Grades 1 -12, faculty and staff participate in this peaceful celebration of bringing light into darkness on (or near) the shortest day of the year. Evergreen boughs lay on the gym floor in a large spiral and candles (LED) are nestled in the spiral's center. The room is darkened , and music is played in a far corner. A student from each class, a teacher, and all twelfth graders, one at a time, walk into the center of the spiral, select a candle and, as they wa lk back out , select a spot to place the light. In this way the room slowly fills with light until the entire spiral is aglow. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Life 68 January Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration : Students in Grades 1 - 8 gather for an assembly to celebrate the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Grade 8 performs a play for the students, faculty , staff and families based on people and events of the Civil Rights Movement. In the various classes, appropriate to age, there are stories and discussion of Dr. King's dream for equality, justice and basic human rights for all. The HS holds an observance of this day at Assembly that week. The Early Childhood Program hosts a voluntary event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for families to participate in and organizes an opportunity for the entire school to participate in serving the greater community . January/ February Lunar New Yea r: Students participate in this festival, which marks the beginning of the lunar calendar, with craft, food, story and song. Traditionally, it is a time spent welcoming the health and prosperity of the coming year, bringing about reconciliation and ushering in harmony and good fortune. In the EC the children enjoy a special puppet play. April Grandparents & Grandfriends Day: The HS and LS invite grandparents and grandfriends to both campuses for an experience that engages them w ith faculty and students. This may include classroom visits, performances, a talk from a faculty member and lunch or snacks. In the Early Childhood, Grandparents are invited i n throughout the year to visit the children's classes and enjoy special activities as scheduled with the class teacher .

This study culminates in a Pentathlon where our students are joined by fifth graders f rom other Waldorf schools to participate in five Olympic events. The LS community cheers the athletes on as judges evaluate them not only on speed, skill, and strength, but on grace and beauty as well. Grade 10 students from the HS act as assistants and j udges. June Rose Ceremony : Students in Grades 1 -12 gather on the last day of school for a closing Rose Ceremony. Reversing roles of the first day Rose Ceremony, Grade 1 students now come forward to present graduating seniors with roses. The senior class is then honored with applause and good wishes as they embark on new journeys. Early Childhood Picnic : The EC families gather to celebrate the year together. All celebrations and assemblies make their special contribution to the year as a whole. Such values are common to all religions and great philosophies and are indepe ndent of any particular creed. The school is nonsectarian, and we encourage families to share with the Class Teacher or HS teachers aspects of their cultural tradition s, which can add to the richness of our experience of the seasons. Lower School Assembly One LS Assembly is held during the school year at which families can see and appreciate the work of their students as the students present some of what they have been doing. Typically, the cl asses give gl impses of math, language arts, Eurythmy, music or foreign language. Each class participates and families have an opportunity to see the natural progression of the curriculum as it is developed through the grades. Please feel free to invite g randparents and friends to this assembly. Although K indergarten and Grade 1 students do not present anything on the stage, they and their families are encouraged to attend in order to become familiar with the work of the grade school. Attendance is require d of all students in Grades 2 through 8. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Life 69 Volunteering There is an active volunteer program at our school .

Fundraising Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor, like almost all non -profit independent schools in the country, relies on a combination of tuition and fundraising revenue to support daily operations. Tuition and other fees cover 90% of the annual operating 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Life 70 expenses of the school. Many of you may have questions about how those dollars are spent and why it makes a difference if you donate. Below is a brief description of the various school fund drives and why they are important to us all: Annual Fund Annual Fund contributions support professional development programs for our teachers and tuition assistance for our families. Because each of us has a stake in our school's success, our goal is to have 100% of families and FT faculty and staff participating. The percentage of participation is a key indicator to lending institutions, outside donors and granting agencies that we have consistent support from those we serve. When you consider your giving for the year, Annual Fund should be at the top of your list. More information about this important funding source for our teachers and families will come through parent representatives and email communications. Events Event s provide funding and volunteer opportunities that support the RSSAA community. Your gifts to these fundraising initiatives directly support the school's mission and cover what tuition does not. Purchasing Programs There are several ways you can support the school through your purchases . Amazon Smile When you make purchases through Amazon, remember to register the Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor as a non -profit you support. A percentage of your purchases are then donated to RSSAA. Community Connector We encourage people to shop locally with our community members who have local businesses. This in turn supports our families. In some cases, these organizations support RSSAA with a donation. Designated Gifts Individuals are inspired to give gi fts towards specific programs or n eeds at the school. Some examples include an underground sprinkler for the soccer field, playground equipment and rental of space for school events . Planned Gifts Making a gift to Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor using appreciated stock, real estate, IRA Charitable Rollover, charitable trust, or life insurance can be beneficial - whether for the tax benefits that planned gifts offer, the financial flexibility they afford, or the lasting legacy they can help a donor leave behind. There is a type of planned gift that will allow you to make a significant impact on RSSAA through your estate plan. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss your long -term charitable goals. Inspire. Create. Lead . Capital Campaign Our vision for this capital campaign is to strengthen and expand our community through facility growth, program support and financial stability. The completion of our new Middle School and parking lot in summer 2016 was the first phase of our capital projects. The secon d phase of this campaign built a gym and expanded high school classrooms. The aim is to give our whole RSSAA community, Early Childhood through Grade 12, a place to call home. We completed this second phase in the summer of 2018. The final phase of the cam paign will finance a stability fund to eliminate long -term debt, education support and an endowment fund to keep our curriculum and faculty at the highest level . Our hope is that everyone who is part of the RSSAA family - current families, alumni families, grandparents, friends and alumni, will consider a gift to our school. At the core of our development work is the building and nurturing of relationships with individuals, organizations, and businesses who share our vision of educational excellence. The collective strength of our community makes our circle strong. Join our circle of giving for the future of our beloved school. 2021-22 RSSAA School Handbook - Community Life 71 Please consider how you can play a role for new generations of Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor students by joining our circle of giving.

If RSSAA is closed due to the weather, both the LS and the HS campuses will be closed. Inclement Weather School Closing Protocol Working with the WISD Transportation Department and in consultation with the county Superintendents, AAPS schools will be closed based on the following protocol: 1. When the weather prediction calls for potentially hazardous conditions due to inclement weather, the WISD Transportation Department, along with AAPS Ancillary Service Director, will begin mon itoring conditions starting late in the evening/early morning hours. a. WISD Transportation Supervisors drive a variety of roads across the b. AAPS monitors conditions at the school c. Sheriff and AAPD are consulted regarding road conditions d. City and County Road Departments are consulted regarding road conditions and timing of the road clearing schedule 2. County Superintendents conduct a conference call after Transportation reports their recommendation for closing schools based on conditions of roads and schoo ls drives/sidewalks and weather forecast. 3. AAPS Superintendent confirms decision to close or open school - Decision to close should be confirmed no later than 4:30 a.m. and communicated to appropriate staff . \"How Does The Ann Arbor Public Schools Make a 'Sn ow Day' Decision?\" by Brad Mellor, Director of Transportation Throughout the evening weathe r conditions are monitored via i nternet, TV, radio, and an informal network of other transportation directors throughout the area. If warranted a call is made to the district's snow routes team to go into action. Before 3 am, three Transportation Supervisors and the Teamster Union Steward meet with the director of transportation at the transportation terminal. Each of these 4 individuals is a highly experienced dr iver, with many years behind the wheel of a school bus. By 3:15 am, they're on the road in 4 different buses. Over the next hour or so, the buses will follow 4 predetermined routes to the 4 corners of the district. The drivers radio back comments from l ocations along the route, which are recorded in the dispatch center. At the same time, the director of transportation will be fielding more cell calls from the other districts. (Other local districts seem to want to know what Ann Arbor is going to do be fore they make their decision!) Our team will drive well -lit city avenues, the interstate highway, and some remote gravel roads. They'll stop and walk the sidewalks at schools, and check the conditions in subdivisions and neighborhoods. By 4 am the driv ers will report back to the transportation terminal. Each driver will be polled and record their perceptions. The only question is \"Can we safely open School, and get them back home?\" One last tour of the cell phone circuit to other schools, and then i t's time to wake up the Superintendent. The Superintendent will be presented with a recommendation based on all input and evidence. After reviewing all the information the Superintendent makes the final decision. This is the process used to determine th e viability of the area roads to deliver AAPS students safely to and from s chool.
