China Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Re-ceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have long been sought as ther-apeutic targets for EOC, as they are frequently hyperactivatedin primary tumors and drive disease relapse, progression, andmetastasis. More recently, these oncogenic drivers have beenimplicated in EOC response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase(PARP) inhibitors and epigenome-interfering agents. Thisevidence revives RTKs as promising targets for therapeutic intervention of EOC. This review summarizes recent studies on the role of RTKs in EOC malignancy and the use of theirinhibitors for clinical treatment. Our focus is on the ERBB fam-ily, c-Met, and VEGFR, as they are linked to drug resistance andtargetable using commercially available drugs. The importanceof these RTKs and their inhibitors is highlighted by theirimpact on signal transduction and intratumoral heterogeneityin EOC and successful use as maintenance therapy in the clinicthrough suppression of the VEGF/VEGFR axis. Finally, thetherapeutic potential of RTK inhibitors is discussed in thecontext prolifera- cacy of PARP inhibitors and programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 immune checkpointtherapies. INTRODUCTION Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for more than 90% of human ovarian cancer cases and is one of the leading causes ofcancer-related deaths among women worldwide. 1,2In 2021, there were approximately 13,000 EOC-related deaths in the United Statesalone. 3Alarmingly, the majority (70%) of these patients initially pre- sent with advanced disease and face 5-year survival rates as low as50%. The mainstay of management of EOC involves surgical debulk- ing combined with systemic platinum-/taxane-based chemotherapyin either a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 4-6Despite diverse tar- geted therapies aiming to cure EOC, 75% of women still experiencea relapse or recurrence of the disease. 7,8Hence, more effective thera- pies and treatment regimens are needed to improve patient survivaland outcomes. Conventional platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapies are known to disrupt EOC via impairing microtubule-mediated cell division andDNA synthesis/replication process, respectively. Poor patient response to such treatment regimens is increasingly linked to broad heterogeneity among EOC tumors in terms of oncogenic activation or dysregulation atcellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels. 3,9To date, 75% of the EOC diag- nosed in the clinic belong to the high-grade serous ovarian cancer(HGSOC) subtype.

A variety of molecular targeting strategies have been pursued for EOC treatment, ranging from direct inhibition of the oncogenicpathways to co-targeting of molecular machinery involved in chro-matin remodeling and repair of damaged DNA. 1,19-23Of high promise to clinical application, however, is the disruption of onco-genic signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their down-stream which are extensively nearly half ofthe tumors, according to large-scale genomic analyses ofpatient biopsies. 11,19Through elevated transcription or protein translation, RTKs become highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Upon ligand-based stimulation or overexpression they un- dergo clustering/aggregation and autophosphorylation to becomeactivated and to allow the recruitment of diverse substrates and as-sembly of the multi-functional protein complexes. These changes, inturn, stimulate the pro-proliferative and/or anti-apoptotic pathwaysand expression of cell mitosis-related genes. 24Meanwhile, reprogramming cell-extracellular matrix(ECM) adhesion toward epithelial-mesenchymal transition avoidance programmed cell death, and immune sur-veillance. 24Conceivably, ovarian carcinomas driven by various RTK oncogenes via their small-molecule inhibitors or func- tion-blocking antibodies.25 To date, a number RTK antagonists have been explored as poten- tial monotherapy or part of the combination therapies for EOC.26-30 Particularly, they have been evaluated through pairing with other treatment options, notably poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)inhibitors used to treat a subgroup of EOC patients carrying genet-ically inherited mutations or low expression of the BRCA1/2gene. 31-33Extensive studies have found that ovary and other tis- sues/organs from these patients are highly dependent on thePARP-driven pathway for repairing damaged DNA, avoidance of senescence and apoptosis or death. 26,34These ndings prompt the development of contemporary PARP inhibitor-based therapy forsuch a group of EOC patients. 35-37Intriguingly, when prolonged PARP inhibitor treatment is applied, some RTKs seem to becomeactivated in a feedback manner. 38Moreover, RTK targeting is viewed valuable to EOC treatment from the angle of harnessingthe ef cacy of immune checkpoint based or inhibitors of the epige- netic regulators such as azacytidine or bromodomain and extra-ter-minal (BET) inhibitors. 39-42With accumulating evidence on the impact of the ERBB family, a sub- group of druggable RTKs, on disease progression and drug resistance, this review concentrates on therapeutic evaluation of these RTKs andtheir antagonists for EOC. Given the growing promise of combinato-rial therapy for EOC, we have discussed the scope and ef cacy of ERBB inhibitors in the wake of co-targeting with various chemo-and targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors and programmedcell death 1/ligand 1-based immune checkpoint therapies. ONCOGENIC ACTIVATION AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION OF THE ERBBs A glance at protein structure, enzymatic activity, and oncogenic activation While many RTKs exist in the human kinome, members of the ERBB family are the most frequently dysregulated oncogenic drivers acrosshuman epithelial cancers, including EOC. 24,43-45As the prototype of druggable RTKs, the ERBB four members: EGFR(ERBB1/HER1), ERBB3/HER3, and ERBB4/HER4. 24 Structurally, members of the ERBB family are composed of an extra- cellular ligand-binding domain, a cell membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain ( Figure 1 ). Within the family, only EGFR and ERBB4 become activated through their extra-cellular domain interaction with the ligands, such as epidermalgrowth factor, transforming growth factor a, amphiregulin, and here- gulin. 46All the family members, with the exception of ERBB3, possess enzymatic activities and are activated upon homodimerization/poly-merization or heterodimerization with ERBB3 or the ligand-activatedform of EGFR, ERBB4, or EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 frequently ampli ed, mutated, or overexpressed at the genomic or protein level, but rarely through structural alteration or gene fusion. 47 Like most of RTKs, the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic roles ofERBB receptors are achieved eliciting arrays of downstream signalingcascades ( Figure 1 ), activation Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways, g1, STATs, uptake and biosynthesis (e.g., glucose,amino acids, and nucleotides), these signaling cascades markedly upre-gulate expression of many pro-proliferative and pro-cell survival genesat the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. 48-50It is also worth noting that members of the ERBB family and c-Met impacttumor growth and progression via intricate crosstalk with other mediators such as in flammation- and integrin-dependent signaling or epigenetic machinery. 51-54Inhibiting their signaling cascades leads to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, impaired tumor cell growth, and pro-inva-sive behavior. 30,51ERBB receptors are also known as crucial players in tumor metastasis, as they promote EMT, tumor invasiveness, angiogen-esis, and distant metastatic progression. 55 There is evidence that RTKs become activated through a feedbackloop in tumor cells after prolonged treatment with traditional chemo-therapies or targeted therapies. Notably, several activated RTKs weredetected upon sustained inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway or transcription/epigenetic mediator BRD4, a member of the BET 294 Molecular Therapy: Oncolytics Vol. 28 March 2023www.moleculartherapy.org Reviewfamily.40,56In line with this evidence, FAK, an integrin-linked non- RTK and a key downstream signaling effector of otherRTKs, modulates tumor cell responses to pharmacological inhibitionof BRD4, according to our recent study. 23,52,57In addition, RTKs may contribute to poor prognosis and drug resistance by promotingexpression or activity of the drug transporters. 58,59In these scenarios, RTK antagonists could serve as a second line of therapy for EOC pa-tients after acquiring drug resistance. Genomic dysregulation and signaling alteration of the druggable ERBBs in EOC tumors Members of the ERBB family have been strongly implicated as key drivers of EOC malignancy ( Figure 1 ).24Notably, EGFR is overex- pressed in 30% -98% of EOC and is linked to poor clinical out- comes.60,61ERBB2 is overexpressed or ampli ed in about 20% -66% of the biopsies across multiple EOC patient cohorts.62,63The dysregu- lation of ERBB receptors and other RTKs in EOC is also readily detect-able at the mRNA level ( Figure 2 ), in contrast to the point mutations in their cytoplasmic domains of RNA splicing as seen in other cancertypes (e.g., EGFR in glioblastoma). 51Interestingly, the genomic and mRNA seem mutually exclusive for c-MET and theERBB receptors ( Figure 2 ). Importantly, the altered gene copy number or expression of the ERBB family possesses diagnostic value. In partic-ular, ERBB2 expression correlates with poor prognosis of EOC. 64In addition, despite the lack of independent kinase activity, the ERBB3gene is frequently ampli ed in EOC, and this alteration correlates with poor progression-free survival (PFS). 43,65,66Exceptionally, ERBB4 forms a fusion gene with IKZF2 in some EOC tumors.26 Besides genomic alterations, the importance of the ERBB receptors in EOC is underscored by frequent activation of their downstream signaling intermediates ( Figure 3 ). Notably, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways, which are two common sets of pathwaysdownstream of ERBB receptors, are constitutively activated in approx-imately 70% of ovarian tumors at rates second only to DNA repair path-ways. 19This dysregulated signaling is oncogenic and drives tumor cell proliferation, migration, survival, invasion, and chemotherapy resis-tance. 67,68In addition, ERBB receptors are implicated in regulating DNA damage response and disease progression in EOC.64Collectively, in EOC tumors, members of the ERBB family undergo extensivegenomic alterations or mutations, and their signaling pathways are markedly rewired or dysregulated, fueling their therapeutic utility. Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the signaling and functional roles of the major druggable RTKs in epithelial ovarian tumor cells Physiological ligands and dimerization (homo- and hetero-), signaling pathways and cellular roles are highlighted for ERBB receptors and other RTK s. Ligands for some common RTKs are listed in the top left corner and include the following: EGF, growth factor Therapy: Oncolytics Vol. 28 March 2023 295www.moleculartherapy.org ReviewOther RTKs ERBB receptors, other RTKs, including c-Met, AXL, PDGFR, members of the EPH family, and VEGFR, are regarded as potentialvaluable targets for EOC treatment ( Figure 2 ). These RTKs are acti- vated in mechanisms similar to the ERBB receptors, presumablydue to their structural similarity. 33,56,69,70In particular, c-Met activation is implicated as part of a feedback loop under prolongedexposure to traditional chemotherapies or targeted therapies. In addi- tion, there is a feedback-type activation of several druggable RTKs implicated during sustained inhibition the RAS/RAF/MEKpathway or transcription/epigenetic modulators such as BRD4. 40,56 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE ERBB ANTAGONISTS AS MONOTHERAPY Thus far, a number of including humanized for EOC ( Table 1 ). Mechanistically, these agents act via two distinct modes: (1) interference of the extracellular ligand bindingor receptor dimerization and (2) competitive inhibition of the ATP-binding capability of the kinase domain ( Figure 1 ). In the rst mode, monoclonal antibody drugs block the ligand binding of the ERBB recep-tors on the cell surface or facilitate receptor internalization and degra-dation to prevent clustering/aggregation-dependent of the ERBB receptors. Upon treatment with these inhibitors, signal transduction of the ERBB oncogenes is blocked, leading to diminishedprotein translation and transcription for many critical genes involved innutrient supply, cell proliferation, and survival. 60Given the marked dif- ference in their modes of action, the function-blocking antibodies andTKIs may exert divergent anti-tumor effects, making them attractivecandidates for combinatorial targeting therapies. 36 To date, many small-molecule inhibitors of ERBB2, EGFR, and METhave been clinically investigated for EOC, as these RTKs are frequentlydysregulated in primary tumors according to analyses of the TCGA data ( Figures 2 and3) and other published patient cohorts. 61Notably, erlotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR, has been shown toinhibit growth of EOC cells and to modulate their sensitivity to cyto-toxic agents such as carboplatin. 71Lapatinib and poziotinib, two com- mon inhibitors of ERBB2, have also been studied regarding their rolein modulating EOC resistance to taxane-based regimens. 72,73In a more preclinical study, afatinib, a third-generation small-mole-cule inhibitor of ERBB oncogenes, was found to have moderate ef - cacy against EOC. 74Interestingly, these RTK inhibitors seem particu- larly effective against a subgroup of EOC cells overexpressing ERBB2receptor. 75Based on this evidence, clinical trials with several inhibitors of EGFR and ERBB2 have been carried out in EOC mRNA alterations of the ERBB receptors and other druggable receptor kinases in Atlas; patients/samples: 585)EGFR, ERBB2, and 26 other genes were proled in terms fusions, mutations, protein putative copy-number alterations from GISTIC, RNA Seq highly patients carrying ERBB2 mutations.76-78Unexpectedly, lapatinib exhibited poor ef cacy when used as a monotherapy in persistent or recurrent EOC.79 Besides small-molecule inhibitors, function-blocking monoclonalantibodies of EGFR and ERBB2 have been clinically tested in EOC(Table 1 ). These agents, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and matu- zumab, inhibit activity of the ERBB receptors by interfering with theirhomo- or hetero-dimerization-mediated activation in tumor cells. 24,43 In line with the notion, ovarian tumor cells expressing high levels of ERBB2 proteins are sensitive to the effect of trastuzumab, the rst gen- eration of trastuzumab appears to exert a pro-apoptotic PI3K/AKT disrupts ERBB2 and other members of the ERBB family,is shown to suppress growth of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo . 83,84Furthermore, cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, was investigated as monotherapy for patients with primary peri-toneal cancers or recurrent EOC. 85Unfortunately, this agent exhibited poor ef cacy among patients with recurrent EOC. Overall, the initial ndings from the above clinical studies suggest that ERBB inhibitors may provide limited ef cacy in EOC. Nevertheless, these agents could have potential value for EOC treatment if suitablebiomarkers are developed to stratify the EOC patient populationsaccording to expression level or activity of ERBB receptors. BIOMARKERS AND CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE ERBB INHIBITORS AS PART OF COMBINATORIALTHERAPIES Aside from being evaluated as monotherapy, a number of ERBB inhib- itors have been clinically pursued for EOC treatment in conjunctionwith conventional chemotherapies or other targeting agents. Notably, multiple clinical trials have been performed to evaluate ef cacy of TKIs of multiple ERBB members for EOC ( Tables 1 and 2). Interest- ingly, one of these trials is the phase II study (NCT00436644) investi-gating the impact of the combination of lapatinib and in pa-tient populations with platinum-refractory/-resistant peritoneal orovarian carcinomas ( Table 2 ). Unfortunately, the data from analysis of correlative markers did not show dramatic predicted bene t. In addition, disruption of the ERBB signaling with lapatinib appearsinsufcient to overcome topotecan resistance. In conjunction with systemic chemotherapeutic agents The most clinically relevant trials of the ERBB antagonists are inves- tigations of both drug ef cacy biomarkers for combinatorial therapies. One such trial (NCT0030446) is a phaseII study of the combination of erlotinib plus carboplatin in patientswith recurrent EOC ( Table 2 ). 86This drug combination appears effective for EOC patients with platinum-sensitive disease only. Ina phase III trial (NCT00263822), an effort was made toward devel-opment of better biomarkers for analysis of erlotinib ef cacy in a cohort of ovarian cancer patients who underwent rst-line plat- inum-based treatment ( Table 2 ). 87The results from this trial showed that the PFS and overall survival (OS) of the EOC patientswere strongly associated with copy number gain of EGFR gene, asthe patients carrying ampli ed EGFR exhibited poorer OS than their counterparts. 87,88This nding implies that delineating EGFR mutations alone may not be suf cient to foresee patient response to erlotinib treatment, nor do the gain-of-function mutations inEGFR-associated signaling cascades (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, NRAS,and PIK3CA). Furthermore, patient with KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA exhibitedlonger PFS than those without any of these genetic mutations. Together, these trial results implicate an uphill challenge forTable 1.

Notably, in the PENELOPE trial(NCT01684878), adding pertuzumab did not signi cantly improve PFS in the patient cohort with platinum-resistant tumors and lowexpression of ERBB3. 43The results from a subgroup analysis, howev- er, revealed better ef cacy of pertuzumab treatment in conjunction with gemcitabine and paclitaxel.90In addition, cetuximab was tested in combination with carboplatin for patients with recurrent ovariancancer. 85It was also tested in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin for the patient population with advanced-stage peritoneal lesions orfallopian tube cancer. 91Collectively, these trials indicate that cetuxi- mab has some bene cial effect for patients with EGFR-positive and platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas. Combination of chemical inhibitors and antibody blockers The simultaneous administration of two inhibitors against the sameERBB target has also been explored for EOC treatment. This type of strategy is sometimes referred to as \"dual blockade \"as it disruptsoncogenic activity through simultaneous targeting of extracellular and intracellular domains of ERBB receptors. Notably, in one exper-imental study, the combination of afatinib and trastuzumab on the ERBB2 +breast cancer cells.92 this effect appeared independent of tumor cell sensitivityto trastuzumab. Instead, afatinib appears to act on tumor cell resis-tance to trastuzumab by blocking the compensatory signalingpathway. Whether this phenomenon also occurs in vivo or in the clin- ical setting, however, remains elusive. One major concern is the highprevalence of constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in EOCtumors due to PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss or Akt ampli cation, as highlighted in the TCGA patient population ( Figure 3 ). This is also consistent with a recent genomic study. 19To some extent, knowing such genomic landscape may aid in foreseeing intrinsic resistanceto the ERBB antagonist-based therapies in EOC patient population.It may also fuel the co-administration of PI3K or AKT inhibitorsand trastuzumab as a new line of targeted therapy for EOCpatients. 30,93 TOWARD SYNTHETIC LETHAL TARGETING In combination with PARP inhibitors One of the most exciting advances in targeted therapy for EOC over the past decade is the clinical application alterations of the druggable downstream effectors RTK-dependent signaling pathways in ovaria n serous cystadenocarcinomaThe output was obtained through analysis of the TCGA cohort (Pan Cancer Atlas, patients/samples: n = 585) described in Figure 2 . 298 Molecular Therapy: Oncolytics Vol. 28 March 2023www.moleculartherapy.org Reviewinhibitors of PARP enzymes, which appears particularly effective in treatment of the patient population carrying functionally defectiveBRCA1/2 genes. 3,8Thus far, several RTK inhibitors have been explored for treatment of metastatic EOC in conjunction with thePARP inhibitors. Neratinib, which irreversibly inhibits activities ofmultiple members of the ERBB family through disruption of auto-phosphorylation and signal transduction, has been approved foruse in treatment of metastatic breast cancer. 94This pan-ERBB in- hibitor also seems capable of downregulating expression of ERBB1/2/4, c-MET, PDGFR, and mutant RAS proteins via the au-tophagic degradation route. 95In a recent study, the combination of neratinib with niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, was found to have syn-ergistic effect in cisplatin-resistant or multi-drug-resistant ovariancancer cells. 96Mechanistically, this drug combination appears to induce the ATM-dependent activation of AMPK in tumor cells,which in an ongoing phase I trial (NCT04502602) to investigate optimaldosing for the combination of neratinib and niraparib in plat- inum-resistant ovarian cancer.EGFR and Met have also been implicated in modulation of PARP in- hibitor sensitivity. 32,98Since multiple inhibitors of these RTKs are clinically used for treatment of non-EOC types and exhibit non-over-lapping toxicities with the PARP inhibitors, combining these twoclasses of drugs may represent a line of rapid bench-to-bedsidedrug development for EOC. It is of particular attraction, since thereare growing cases of clinical resistance to the PARP inhibitors inEOC patient populations. 99,100 Co-inhibition with transcriptional and epigenetic mediators Another hurdle in applying RTK inhibitors for EOC treatment is frequent activation of their downstream transcriptional and epige-netic mediators. Notably, a large portion of ovarian tumors exhibitMyc ampli cation. 23,101This type of clinical malignancy seems vulnerable to the targeting of BRD4, a transcriptional and epigeneticmediator and a member of the bromodomain-containing proteinfamily, based on our study and others. 22,23,102Yet, sustained ment with BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, an investigational inhibitor inter-fering with the interaction BRD4 and the transcription fac- tor Myc and histone proteins, leads to an adaptive response ofTable 2.

FUNCTIONAL ROLES AND TARGETING OF THE NON-ERBB RTKs VEGF/VEGFR-driven pathways and angiogenesis Thus far, the most successful clinical targeting of the RTKs in EOC has been through the monoclonal antibody-based inhibition of theVEGF-VEGFR axis. 103There is a growing consensus that tumor growth and dissemination are highly dependent on the formationof new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. 104In human ovarian tumors, the VEGFR2 signaling pathway is highly activated.55 This receptor drives angiogenesis in an autocrine fashion throughphysical interaction with its ligand, VEGF-A. 104,105In EOC, tumor angiogenesis is highly prone to the VEGF-neutralizingmonoclonal ( Table 3 addition, a growth-suppressive impact on EOCtumors. 25This inhibitory effect seems markedly enhanced when co-administered with chemotherapy.107,108Intriguingly, such a drug offers a limited impact on patient survival duration.42,103Nonetheless, bevacizumab is now widely used together with olaparib, a PARP in-hibitor, as maintenance therapy for women with tumors exhibitingthe BRCA mutation or genomic instability and/or who have shown response to platinum-based chemotherapy. 109In contrast, the use of bevacizumab in conjunction with the immune checkpoint inhibi-tors appears to have limited clinical bene t based on a recent study. 42 c-MET and its inhibitors Next to the ERBB family, c-Met has received the most attention regarding the clinical prognosis and therapeutic targeting in humancancers. This kinase is upregulated in 10% of the ovarian cancer cases in a previous study, as well as in our TGCA cohort ( Figure 2 ),and it is strongly implicated in promotion of tumor progression and metastasis. 110,111Recently, c-Met has been linked to tumor resis- tance to the PARP inhibitors.100,112This resistance can readily be inhibitor talazoparib while, the combined inhibition of c-Met and EGFR has been foundto sensitize tumor cells response to alazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, in breast cancer. 32,33Consistent with this evidence, the combination of EGFR and c-Met inhibitors exhibited additive or synergistic inhib-itory effects on tumor growth and metastatic potential. 110,111 Conceivably, simultaneous targeting of c-Met and EGFR may pro- vide an alternative strategy for sensitizing some EOC tumors tothe PARP inhibitors. Other RTK inhibitors Another class of RTKs, the Eph family, has also been linked to EOCmalignancy. 27EPH kinases are activated upon interaction/binding with their ligands on the surface of the opposing stroma cells ( Fig- ure 1 ).70In the TCGA cohort, several members of the Eph family are upregulated ( Figure 2 ), consistent with recent studies.27,69There is also evidence that some members of the Eph family are dysregu-lated at the protein level and correlate with patient survival. 27,69To date, multiple inhibitors, including NVP-BHG712 and a class of xanthine-based chemical inhibitors, have been developed to target EPHB4 kinase in EOC.114,115. It is worth noting that additional RTKs, such as ALK and AXL, have been found to be active or overexpressed in EOC ( Figure 1 ).116,117 They are altered at the genomic level in 10% of EOC tumors ( Fig- ure 2 ). These RTKs appear to play a role in metastasis through regu- lation of the tumor microenvironment.118Recently, APG-2449, a promising inhibitor of ALK kinase, has been tested for EOC targetingin a preclinical model. 119BGB324, a small-molecule inhibitor of AXL, has been shown to increase tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel and carbo- platin in a PDX model-based EOC study.120Table 3.

One straightforward approach to overcoming such resistance toERBB targeting is to combine inhibitors of both ERBB2 and PI3K/AKT or mTOR kinases for EOC treatment ( Figures 1 and3). Thus far, several inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway have beenevaluated for EOC in combination with the ERBB antagonists. 30,121 Notably, in a recent randomized phase II trial, the combination of buparlisib, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel is associated with a higher overall patient response rate as compared with the placebo arm.122Meanwhile, the ef cacy of this combinatorial targeting may be boosted by co-targeting estrogen-dependent func-tions/pathways, as this hormone is elevated in >60% of ovarian cancercases and is consistently implicated in onset and progression ofovarian cancer. 123,124Conceivably, with the aid of ER-based strati ca- tion, ER+/ERBB2+patient populations are likely more responsive to co-inhibition of ERBB2 and PI3K, and acquire the ability to overcomeintrinsic resistance to the ERBB2 antagonists. Co-inhibition of RTKs and constitutively activated RAS/MEK pathways Another signaling pathway behind EOC resistance to ERBB targeting is the RAS/MAPK pathway ( Figure 1 ). A number of intermediates of this oncogenic pathway have been found to be mutated and/or consti-tutively activated in EOC tumors, and are associated with resistanceto traditional chemotherapies and rapid disease progression. 56,125In addition, several RTKs were found activated in NF1-de cient ovarian tumor cells after prolonged MEK inhibitor treatment.56Hence, the combination of ERBB antagonists and inhibitors of the RAS-MEKpathway may represent another viable targeting option for EOCtreatment. Co-targeting of RTKs and anti-apoptotic pathways : ERBB oncogenes are also known to drive drug resistance in the clinic through activation of the anti-apoptotic pathways. This scenario is confounded bythe evidence that the anti-apoptotic mediators, such a well-known genomic level. 126Hence, co-targeting of this pathway and ERBB receptors could improve ef cacy of the RTK antagonists in EOC. Co-targeting the integrin/FAK axis : another pro-survival pathway uti- lized by cancer cells is the integrin/FAK signaling axis. This axis haslong been recognized to crosstalk with multiple ERBB receptors dur- ing tumor development and progression. 57In addition, it is stronglyactivated in the ovarian tumor cells carrying TP53 mutations.127 Conceivably, dual blockade of the ERBB- and integrin-dependent signal transduction may synergistically hinder tumor growth. Mean-while, FAK, a key effector of integrin signaling, is extensively ampli-ed with the Myc oncogene in many ovarian tumors. 22,23Clinically, such genomic landscape may also represent a distinct class of EOCmalignancy, as tumors with such genomic characteristics are highlyrefractory to traditional chemotherapies based on in vitro studies. 23,128In addition, tumor cells carrying the FAK-associated 8q24 amplicon appear more susceptible to PARP inhibition.26In line with this notion, MRCKA has been shown to drive the activityof the integrin/FAK axis to impact EOC malignancy, presenting an alternative targeting strategy. 128This nding and the data from an evaluation with a MEK inhibitor, are consistent with our recent studyon co-targeting of FAK and Myc in EOC. 23,56Overall, co-targeting of the ERBB oncogenes and the integrin/FAK axis may representanother potential therapeutic option for EOC. Co-suppression of the in flammatory pathways : the activation of in- flammatory pathways through the NF- kB-based signaling network is also implicated in tumor resistance to RTK inhibitors in ovariancancer. 54Recently, JAK2 has been shown to promote resistance to the RTK inhibitors in EOC cells.54,129The NF- kB-based network may also indirectly impact EOC resistance to RTK inhibitors through FAK-mediated recruitment of stromal cells, such as myeloid-derivedsuppressive cells. 130 PERSPECTIVE ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETING OF THE RTKs Owing to signi cant toxicities and rapid development of drug resis- tance to standard chemotherapy encountered during EOC treatment, recent research efforts have been directed toward development of individualized therapies. This endeavor is heightened by broad het-erogeneity among EOC tumors. However, such a therapeutic strategybecomes increasingly achievable with powerful multi-omics technol-ogies to rapidly pro le key genetic alterations and activation of onco- genic pathways in the EOC patient biopsies. It will also provide rapiddetection and quanti cation of dysregulated RTK signaling in tumor cells, mediators of resistance to the RTK inhibitors or state of re-acti-vated RTKs, thereby fueling the RTK antagonists as a potential secondor third line of therapy for EOC. In addition, the ERBB2-basedantibody conjugates may represent another therapeutic option for EOC. 131 -133This class of ERBB2 drugs is particularly appealing, as they are target speci c and possess a favorable toxicity pro le.134 Decades of experimental and clinical studies have accumulated evi- dence that any single agent-based targeting is usually insuf cient for eradication of EOC, as the disease is propelled by a wide range of onco-genic dysregulation and intrinsic resistance to traditional chemother-apies. This clinical challenge is further aggravated by acquired drugresistance through in flux of cancer stem cells, evolving microenviron- ments, and expansion of intratumoral heterogeneity. 15,117,126,135 -138 Despite such a complex landscape, EOC tumors sometimes appear particularly vulnerable to certain targeting. Notably, the BRCA1/2 Molecular Therapy: Oncolytics Vol. 28 March 2023 301www.moleculartherapy.org Reviewmutated ovarian tumors are highly susceptible to inhibition of the PARP enzyme-dependent pathway, as such a pathway is essential for DNA repair and cell survival. As a result, PARP inhibitors provide aline of synthetic lethal targeting for EOC. 9,139Based on recent advances in genomic understanding of EOC, such a strategy may be enhanced byadding RTK inhibitors in the wake of overcoming adaptive therapeuticresistance. 23Finally, there is still promise for developing targeted therapies through combination of RTK antagonists and immunecheckpoint inhibitors. This strategy may exert dual therapeutic impacton EOC, as some RTK-targeting agents simultaneously mediateantitumor activity of immune cells, including natural killer cells. 140 CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the oncogenic ERBB members and other RTKs arefrequently dysregulated in EOC at the genomic and expression levels.Their oncogenic signaling is strengthened by diverse genomic alter-ations or mutations of key intermediates of the PI3K/AKT andRAS/MAPK pathways during onset, growth, and progression ofEOC. Some RTK signaling pathways are also revoked in the courseof prolonged use of systemic and targeted therapeutic agents. As aresult, the RTK inhibitors are well positioned as potential second-or third-line therapy for EOC treatment in the context of combinato-rial targeting.
