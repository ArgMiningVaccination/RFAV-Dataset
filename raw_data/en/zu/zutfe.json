With recent evidenc e demons trating the positive effects of dose escala tion on tumor control, the trend has been toward irradiating smaller areas with gre ater dose s. This has led to the developme nt of conformal radiotherapy and, more recently, intensity- modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). We describe our technique and preliminary toxicity profile for ultrasound-guided outpatient placement of intr apros tatic fiducia l markers be fore simultaneous integrated bo ost (SIB)-IMRT f or high-risk prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 15 me n with prostate cancer wh o underwent hypofractionated IMRT between January 2009 and May 2010 were included in the study. All patients underwent ultrasound-guided transrectal place ment of three gold intra prostatic fiducial markers under local anesthesia using our standard technique. Daily on-line image guidance adjustment s were made according to the location of the fiduc ial mark ers. Before the beginning of the radia tion thera py, flexible rectoscopy with rec tal biopsies was performed for evaluation of all the patients. In the event of toxicity, further rectoscopy with muc osal biopsy was carried out. T he treatme nts were designed to delive r 67.5 Gy in 25 fractions (2.7 Gy/fraction) to the prostate, while simultaneously delivering at least 56.25 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) to the seminal vesicles and 50 Gy (2.0 Gy /fraction) to the ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1876 pelvic ly mph nod es. All tre atme nt planning was pe delivered with five equispaced 6 MV IMRT beams (e very 72) from a V ARIAN C linac 6 00C/D Lina c, equipped with a 120- leaf MLC . This number of fields ha d been dete rmined to give acceptable dose distribution s whilst being practical for quality analys is verification and t reatment. In optimizat ion, dos imetric target coverage w as conside red to be achieve d when 95% of the volume received at least 95% of the prescribed dose, while for org ans at risk, dose-volume limits were derived using best estimates f rom the relevant liter ature. The dose distributions were also studied to ensure that the re we re no significa nt hot- spots in uncontour ed normal tissue. The c harts wer e reviewed to e valuate the acute toxic ity prof ile of IMRT hypofractio nation with fi ducial markers dur ing t he treatme nt cours e using the Commo n Toxic ity C riteria, version 3.0. T he goal w as to score late toxic ity ac cording to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/ European Organizatio n for Research and Tr eatment C ancer (RTOG/E ORTC) scale . The Intern ational Pr ostate core, Inter nationa l Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), c linical Glea were tabulated. Results: Fiducial marker p lacement proceed ed without complications. All pa tients were classified as being at high risk (NC CN score). Grad e 1 perineal dermatitis occurred in three patients. Acute gen itourinary (GU) toxic ity manif ested in five patients (28%) a s grade 1 or 2 urethr itis. No patients develope d urinary retentio n requiring cath eterizati on and no patients had any episode of gross hematuria. No case s of acute gastrointestin al (GI) tox icity grade 2 were ob served. N o late GI or GU toxicity according to the RTOG/EORT C scale or significant change in the Inte rnational Prosta te Symptom Score were found at nine months in patie nts w ith available follow-u p. Conclusion: The placement of intraprostatic fiducial markers before SIB-IMT radiation therapy is a safe and efficacious method for pr ostate localization and produces an excel lent toxicity profile; however, additional investiga tion is requi red into 1 Zelefsky MJ , Leibel SA, Gaudin P B et al : Dose escalation with three-dimensio nal confor mal ra diation the rapy affects the outcome in prostate cancer.

EXPERIENCE OF HELICAL TOMOTHERAPY FOR HYP OFRACTIONATED RE-IRRADIATION OF CANCE R Antonino R omeo 1, Roberta Gunelli 2, Ugo Giorgi M ichele tti 1, Giulia Ghigi 1, Elisa Maria Lore nza Neri 1, Enrico Menghi 4, Annelis a D'a ngelo 4, Anna S 4, Cinzia FC, Italy Background: The local recurrence rate for localized prostate cancer after curative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is between 25% and 32%. The standard curative salvage treatment for disease that is still organ confined is radical surgery. Cryotherapy and brachytherapy have recently been proposed. The use of re-irradiation by three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is traditionally limited by low cure an d high complication rates. Highly conformal radiotherapy techniques, e.g. helical tomotherapy, with their adaptive capabilities offer new treatment options, providing the opportunity to e valuate new indications such as hypofractionated re-irradiation in locally r ecurrent prostate cancer. Patients a nd Methods: Between July 2009 and November 2010, we used tomotherapy to re-irradiate the prostate gland in five patients. A ll but one patient experienced biochemical and local recurrence (documented by 18 F-choline PET/CT) of prostate cancer previously treated by curative EBRT . One patient with newly diagnosed prostate cance r had received prior irradiation to the pelvis because of rectal cancer. All patients wer e treated with a hypofractionated accel erated course of radiotherapy (25 Gy in fractions of 5 Gy each). Results: Dose-volume histograms for targets and organs at risk were satisfactory. Treatments were well tolerated. No toxicities grade 2 were observed. Side-effects were limited to an increase in urinary frequency. A lowering of PSA value was seen in 4/5 patients three months after treatment completion. One patient had biochemical and nodal progression. Discussion and Conclusion: Our experience suggests that hypofractionated re-irradiation of the prostate gland performed by helical tomotherapy is feasible and safe. A larger number of cases and longer follow-up are now needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments. 131 3D CONFORM AL VERSUS INTENSITY- MODUL ATED RADIOTHERAPY IN POST PROSTA TECTOMY PATIENTS: COMPARISON Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy Totaro 1, Vincenzo De C hiara 1, Paolo Morrone 2, Anna R ita Cicalese advanced prostate clinical d isease-free sur vival. While compar isons for intact prostate cancer show a benefit for intensity-mod ulated the rapy (IMRT) over 3D conformal planning (3DCR T), this has not bee n studied for post- prostatectomy radiotherapy to date. The aim of this study wa s to compare the d osimetric parameters of IM RT and 3DC RT to predi ct the relative possible clinica l bene fit of the treatments. Patients and Methods: This study analyzed ten patients who were candidates f or p ost-prostat ectom y radiotherapy. All volumes were delineated by th e same radiation therapist in accord ance with EORTC consensus gu ideline. A CTV (prostate-bed) expansio n of 1 cm (5 mm posterior) was u sed to determine the PTV. The ur inary bla dder, rectum and penile bulb were also d elineated. For all patients, two treatment plans were p erformed: one used a five-beam confor mal the rapy and the other a five-beam step- and-shoot IMRT with inverse planning optimization. Fo r each pla n, 66Gy in 33 fractions were pr escribed to the P TV. Diffe rences in dose volume histograms (DVHs) betwee n the plans were evalua ted using two-tailed pair ed S tudent's t-test. In addition, to study the covera ge and conformity of PTV with respect to 95% iso dose, for both techniques , the tar get cove rage (TC) and conformity index (CI) were evaluated c ) with a better con formity for IMRT plans (mean CI=1.0 3 for IMRT versus 1.23 f or 3DCRT ). We also de cided to compare th e two treatm ent plans with respect to the volum e of the organ at ris k that received three high dose levels: 60 Gy (V60), 50 Gy (V50) and 40 Gy (V40). In particular, for the bladder, V60 was found to be 30% and 5 0% for IMRT an d 3DCRT, respecti be 45% and 75%, respecti vely; finally, V 40 was found to be 65 % an d 95%, respectively. For the rectum , V60 was found t o be 20% r IMRT and 3DCRT, r espec , respecti vely; and V40 wa s found to be 40% and 55 %, respectively. For the penile bulb, V60 was found to be 10% IMR T and 3DC RT, respectively; V50 was fo und to be 50% and 75%, re spectively; and V40 was found to be 75% an d 75%, res pectively. We also evaluat ed the mean dose to thes e orga ns: for the bla dder it was found to be 48 Gy and 58 Gy for IM RT and 3DC RT, re spective ly; for the rectum, it was found to be 40 Gy and 46 Gy, respe ctively; for the penile bulb, it was found to be 49 Gy an d 54 Gy, respectiv ely. All these differen ces had a significance of p< 0.1. Discussion and Conclusion: According to these data, the IMRT plans give a greater sparing of normal t issues at low doses, with slightly better coverage of the PTV . This should result in a resolute decrease of ac ute ge nitourinary a nd rec tal toxicity. Another relevant finding is that IMRT r educes the dose to penile bulb so that patients that undergo nerve-sparing prostatectomy with preservation of erectile function should have a positive possibility for continued s exual activity. Further research in clinical trials is necess ary to determina te the significance of the better planned dose of IMRT compared to 3DC RT on pa tient outcome . 1 Zelefsky MJ, Fuks Z et al : High dose radiation delivered by intensity modulated conformal radiotherapy imp roves the outcome of loca lized pros tate cancer.

Radioter apia Bologna, Recent studie s have shown tha t diffe rent filling condition s of the bladder and rectum can significant ly inf luence th e inter- and intra-fracti on positio n of the pr ostate d uring radiotherapy, with consequent modifications of dose distribution to the target and adjacent organs. This may result in an impairment of local control and/or increased risk of late sequelae. The aim o f this study was primarily to determine the inter-fraction set-up error and organ motion assessed with a kilovoltage cone beam CT (kVCBC T) in patient s treated for prostate cancer with radical radiotherapy. Patients and Met hods : The study i nvolved 18 patients treated with radical radiotherapy between January 2009 ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1878 and January 2010. All pa tients were instructed to empty their rectum and fill their bladder , drinking 500 ml o f water 30 min before the planning CT/t herapy. For all patients, th e prost ate position had been assess ed bef ore each fractio n through kVC BCT image guidance ( XVI, Elekta) . Pat ients were positioned first by us ing las ers and skin ta ttoos and then kVC BCT acquisition was p erformed. For eac h fract ion, the daily CBCT scan w as regis tered with planning kilovoltage C T imag es and positioning ad justments were asses sed using a robotic table with six deg rees a rigid- body appr oach and was performed accord ing to the foll owing procedur e: (i) a fully a utomatic registratio n based on bony anatomy assessed the set -up error; (ii) a p hysician and a radiotherapy technologist manually adjus ted the matching on the target through a gray-va lue a lgorithm, ass essing the t otal inter-fractio n error (set-up plus organ moti on), and (ii i) aft er the m atching pr ocedure s, the f inal correction s were automatically applied to t he robotic treatm ent couch for t hree translational and three ro tational deviation vectors and the patient was treated. For e ach fractio n, valu es of inter-fracti on set-u p and total error ( set-up pl us org an motion) a ssessed at steps (i) and (ii) were reg istered for t hree p rincipal axes (L-R, A-P, C-C) and for three ang le ro tations (pitch, roll and jaw). For each patient, the avera ge deviation i an d the standard deviations i for both set-up and org an motion were c alculated in each direction. M oreover, for the entire p opulation of patients, we calculated th e global systematic error (M ), the distribution of the s ystemat ic errors () an d the distribution of the random error s (). Resu lts: To ass ess inter-fracti on set-up and organ motion er rors, data f rom 680 kVCBCT were analyzed. Concerning set -up errors, in L-R, C-C an d A-P directions, deviations for M were found to be 0.9, 0.1 and 0.5 mm, with of 2.9, 1.9 a nd 4.3 mm an d o f 2.4, 2.2 and 3.3 mm, respectively. Rotation deviations were <1 fo r M, and . C oncer ning inter- fraction organ motio n relativ e to b ony anatom y, deviations for M we re found to be 0.9, 1.2 a nd 1.5 mm, with of 0.2, 0.3 a nd 2.4 mm an d o f 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 mm f or L-R, C- C and A-P, re spectively. Ro tation de viations were < 1 for M, and . Conclusion: Daily k VCBCT is a simple and highly efficient proced ure that permit s an accurate positioning of the patie nt and a reliable lo calization of t he target. A current task in our cent er is to evalu ate t he oppo rtunity to as sess ind ividual marg ins for patients who underg o prostate treatment s with IG RT, also setting the stage for hypof ractionation studi es and adapt ive rad iotherapy. 133 MONOLATERAL NERVE-SPARING PROSTATECTOMY: RE VIEW OF AND ONCOLOGIC OUTCOME Lorenzo Masieri , Fede rico La nzi, M ichele La Saver Clinica a I, Uni versit\u00e0 di Firenz e, Fir enze, Italy Background an d Aim: The literature des cribes well- document ed indications f or nerve-sparing r adical prostatectomy. However, to date, there is no clear reference to the monolateral preservation of the bundles. The purpose of this study was to identify patients who are candidates for monolateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy (MR P) and to evaluate the oncologic and functional results. Patients and Methods: The study included 936 patients who underwent consecutive radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer. In (49.5%), neurovascular bundles were not preserved; in 359 (38.3%) patients, it was possible to preserve both bundle s (BRP); while in 114 (12.2%) patients, an MR P wa s performed. The 114 MRP p atients included in the study filled out an IIEF questionnaire pre- operati vely a nd 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery. We performe d MRP in patie nts not suitable for Gleason 7, and method was used to assess the biochemic al recurrence-free survival and the 2 test was used to investigate the c orrelation between MRP and RRP. Results: The mean age at surgery was 62.8 years, mean PSA was 8.52 (range: 3-19.6) ng/m l, 70% of patients score <7 at biopsy and 26.7% o f patients had a Gleason score of 7 at biopsy (mea n of ten samples, range 6-24) and was positive for cancer bilaterally in 30% of patients (mean of 4 samples, range: 2-7) while in 70% of them only one lobe of the prostate was involved (mean of 3 samples , range: 1-5). The mean preope rative IIEF-5 was : 14-25). The final histopathologic al staging showe d 56 cases of pT2 (49.2% ) and 45 cases of patients with pT3b and pT4 disea se and three patients with positive lymph node s were excluded fr om the study. In seve n patients (7.4%) there wer e positive surgical marg ins on the side of the preserved bundle. There was a low incidence of positive surgical margins in the MRP group but it was not statistically significant when we stratified the overall population for RRP, MRP and BRP recurrence-free survival for RRP, and B RP at 60 months was Overall, spontaneous sexual potency (or using PDE5-I) was obtained in 62 patients (54.2%) in the MRP g roup in comparison to 73.1% in the BRP group ( p= 0.0015). The patients who unde rwent MRP p resented a mean I IEF-5 of 18.3 Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1879 (range: and mean age of 62.1 (range: 45-72) years. Conclu sion: The retrospective review of this patient series sugg ests the potenti al role of preservation of one of the neurovascular bundles. In this patient series, MRP allowed recovery of se xual funct ion in >50% of patient s, with good oncologic outcome. H oweve r it is necessar y to conduct prospect ive studies f or furthe r evaluation. 134 THE EFFECT OF THE PRESENCE OF A MEDIAN LOBE ON THE OUTCOM ES OF ROBOT-AS SISTED TECTOM Bernardo Roc co 1, Pietro Acquati 1, Rafael F. Coelho 2, Kenneth J . Palmer 2, Sanket Chauhan 2, Anant h Sivaraman Celebration, F L, U.S .A. Aim: To repor t the effect o f the presence of a median lobe on perioper ative outcomes, positive surgic RARP ). Patients and Methods : We analyze d data from 1,693 consecutive patients who underwent R ARP by a single su rgeon for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients w ere categorized into two group s based on the presence or absenc e of a median lobe identified during RARP. Outcomes analyzed included operative time, e stimated blood loss (EBL), nerve- sparin g tion of hosp ital stay, days with ca thete r, presence of anastomotic leakage on cystogr am, num ber of bladder neck reconstruction proced ures, tumor volum e, patho logica l pathological G leason score and continenc e rates. Continence was defined as the use of 'no pads' b ased on the pat ient responses to the E xpanded Prosta te Cancer Inde x Composite questi ons at 1, 4, 6, 12 and 24 wee ks after cathete r removal. Results: Median lobe was in vely identif ied in 323 (19%) patients. Pa tients with a median lobe were slightly older (median 63 vs. 60 years, p< 0.001 ), had h igher PSA levels (median 5.7 ng/ ml, p< 0.001) a nd higher AUA-SS vs. 6, p< 0.001) The number 0.001) and ht (64 vs. 46 g, p< 0.001) were also higher. Both groups ha d equivalent EBL, length of hosp ital stay, days wi er, s tage, pathological Gleason s core, ne rve-spar ing procedures, complication rates , anastomotic leakage rates, mean tumor volume, PSM rates and PSM rate at the bladder neck . The median OR time was slightly greate r in patients with me dian lobe (80 vs. 75 minutes, p< 0.001). There w as no difference i n the operative time betw een the two groups when stra tifying this result by prostate weight. Continence rates were also equivalent between patients with and without a median lobe at 1 week (27.8% vs. 94.1%, p= 0.183). Finally, the median time to recovery of continence was similar between the groups based on the Kaplan-Meier curves (medi an: 5 weeks, 95% CI=4.41-5.59 vs. median: 5 weeks, 95% C I=4.66-5.34; log rank test, p= 0.113). Conclusion: The presence of a median lobe does not affect perioperative outcomes, PSM rates and early continence outcomes in patien undergoing RARP p erform ed by an experie nced surgeon. The re was a slight inc rease in the operative time in patients with a med ian lobe which was, however, re lated to the lar ger pros tate size in this group. 135 ANALYSIS OF THE CLINICAL PARAMETERS COMMONLY USED TO CHOOS E NERVE-SPARING PROSTA TECTOMY FOR PATIENTS WITH POSITIVE BIOPSY THE TRANSITION ZONE ALONE Michele Lanc iotti , Lorenz o Ma sieri, F rio Gianc ane, laudia Maur Gac ci, Aim: The aim of this study was to analy ze the indication for nerve-sparing surgery for patients with positive prostate biopsies at the level of the transition zone (even in patients with PSA above1 0 ng/ml), the impact of this factor on b iochem ical recurrence-free survival (BCR) and extracapsular extension (ECE). Patients and Methods: The study included 273 patients unde rgoing open ra dical pr ostatectomy a nd pelvic lymphadenectomy for clinically organ-confined cancer (OC), not submitted to juvan t apy, ipher al (PZ ) and transitional zon e (TZ). Clinical and pathological data were available from ou r pro spectively maintained institutional registry of 936 conse cutive patients. The correlation be tween clinicopathologi cal paramete rs and t he site of the biopsy we re investigated with the chi-square and Mann-W hitney U- tests. The impact of these variables on biochemical progression-free survival wa s evaluated follo w-up was 26.9 (range, 7 62, median 24) months. The mean age was 65.7 (range 49-78, median 66) years. At the final pathological exam ination, 152/273 (55.6%) patients present ed OC disease, ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1880 while 121 pa tients present ed ECE, with a prev alence of 44.4%. identified 54/273 pa tients (19.8%) positi ve biopsie s at the level of TZ only. Amon g these, 36 (66.7%) h ad PSA <10 ng/ml, 15 (27.7%) had a PSA in the range 10-20 ng/ml, and 3 (5.6%) >20 ng/ml. O f the 18 patients with PSA >10 ng/ml, only 3 presented E CE. The OC disease incidenc e in patie nts with positive biopsy only in the TZ and with PSA >10 ng/m l was significantly higher than in those pat ients wit h sam e PSA level and pos itive biopsy in the PZ a lone ( p< 0.05). Pat ients with positive biopsy of t he TZ showed a signif icantly high er incidence of OC tumor ( 83.3%) compared to those patients with lone ation (TZ or PZ) of t he tum or did not prove to be predictor of relaps e-free survival (p -value was n on- signi ficant) : the B CR at f ive year s amounted to 94.4% and 90.2%, respectively. Of the 54 pat ients with positiv e samples in the T Z, 51 (94.4%) had GS 6 , and 21 (38.9%) had a GS=7 . Conclusion: Our records show that tumors diagnos ed in the TZ alone are asso ciated wi th a lo wer risk of ECE a fter radic al pros tatectomy. In particular, eve n with PSA > 10 ng/ml, the pr obability of OC disease rem ains significantly higher th an in patients with positivity of the PZ alone. Thes e data s hould b e ass essed in order to extend the possibility of a nerve-spa ring surg ery to patients with positiv e bioptic cores only in the transitional zone and PSA >10 ng/m l. 136 PAPILLARY UROTHELIAL NEOPLASM Background: Few lon g-term single-cent er studies have shown the outcome in patients a ffected by papillary pre sent study evaluated the vior of de novo primar y bla dder PUNLM P lesions (Primary-P UNLM P) as we ll as Surveillanc e- PUN LMP (diagnosed during follo and Methods: From Janu y 2010, 47 8 pati ents (male=3 40. female=138; mean age 71. went transurethral resect ion (T URBT ) of all visible tumors. We retrospectively a nalyze d our TURBT database and identified a ll patie nts with a histologica l examination which revealed a PUNLM P les ion type . Results: We identified a total of 43 P UNLMP of the bla dder; 25 ( 58%) patients were categorized as Primary-PUNLMP and th e remaining 18 (42%) patients wer e categorized as S urveillance- PUNLMP. During follow-up (range: 12-48 months), in the Primary group, 14/25 did not develop any recurrences vs. 6/18 (33% ) in the Surveillance-PUNL MP group. In the first group, 4/25 (16%) patients developed PUNLMP recurrence (1-2 episodes in 1-4 years) and 8/25 (32%) progressed to a higher grade lesio n within 1-4 years. Grade progression was non-invasive low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LG-TCC) in 7 patients (HG-TCC) None of the Primary-PUNLMP patients developed muscle- invasive carcinoma or died because of disease progression. Tumor size did not correlate with the likelihood of recurrence. In the second group, 12/18 patients (67%) had PUNLMP during surveillance for higher grade urinary bladder lesio ns. Th ese included 7 (58.3%) prior LG -TCC , 4 (33.3%) p rior in cystectomy for invasiv e neoplasm in bladder diverticula. Grade progression to LG-TCC occurred in patients (27.7%), progre ssion oc curred (11.1%) died in the HG- TCC group and one patient (5.5%) died in the LG-TCC group died after developing a high-grade upper urinary tract tumor. Conclusion: Bladder PUNLMP can occur either as a de novo lesion or during surveillance for prior higher grade urinary bladder urothelial neoplasm. None of the Primary-PUNLMP patients in this study developed invasive car cinoma o r died because of the disease despite 48% recurrence and 32% grade progression rates. Surveillance-PUNLMP was associated with a worse outcome (61.1% grade/stage progression, 16.6% deaths becau se of disease pr ogression), most likely due to their initial higher grade/stage urothelial neoplasm. 137 DOES PROST ATE WEIGHT AFFECT PERIOPERATIVE OUTCOMES, POSITIVE SURGICAL MARGIN RATES AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AFTER ROBOT-ASSISTED RADICAL PROSTA TECTOMY PERFORM ED BY AN EXPERIENCED SURGE ON?

Conclusion: RARP performed by an exper ienced surgeon in patients with an enlar ged prostate is feasible, with sligh tly higher operat ive time and e stimated blood loss and without an y impact on ea rly continenc e rates. There was a trend towards lower e arly pote ncy rates in pat ients wi th larger prost ates, which can probably be explaine d by the greater age of the se patients .

Long-term results [biochemi cal progression-free over all surviva l (OS): 77% at 12 years] (1) show that low dose rate (LDR) 125 I brachytherapy might represent an effective and patient-friendly modality, with equivalent results in both bPFS and OS, being more respectful of erectile function and urinary continenc e for low- risk pros tate canc er (2). Pos t-implant CT-based dosimetry ha s become the gold standard for assessing the quality of permanent prostate brachytherapy and the actual dose deliver ed to prost ate and normal surroundin g structu res. The purpose of this study was to assess dosimetric results and clinica l outc ome in patients with e arly-sta ge, good-prognosis prostate cancer treated at our institution wi th LDR 125 I brachy therapy. Patients and Meth ods: At our institution, all prostate cancer patient s are manag ed by a multidiscip linary team to apply tailored therapy in order to trea t the cancer, to respect sexual potency, urinary continence and also to reach 10, Gleason score 6, T1-T2 (3), good urinary functionality and prostate volume 50 g. The transperineal seed impla nt was performed unde r regional a nesthesia. After ultrasound imagi ng of the prostate, rectum an urethral nd intraoperative do simetric lanning, the brachytherapy needles, loaded with customize d strand 125 I seeds, were inserted through a guidance template. The prescription dos e was 145 Gy . One month after the impla nt, a CT scan was performed for post-implant dosimetric a prostate D90 v alue 140 conside red the me asure of good impla nt quality (4). All patie nts received a three month multidisciplinary follow-up, including di gital rectal examination and PSA determination. For the purpose of this analysis, we recorded the following data: post-implant dosimetric paramete rs, time needed to perform the proce dure, the acute and late GU and GI toxicity according to EORTC /RTOG cr iteria, erectile function an d urinary contine nce preservation and post-im plant PSA levels. Results: Between February 2009 and Feb ruary 2011, 22 low-risk prostate cancer patients were eval uated, with the LDR 125 I brachytherap y as primar y treatment. The mean age was 62.7 (range : 50-74) years, mea n pre -treatment P SA value was 6.77 (range: 3.87-10.77) ng/ml, with a me an prostate volume ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1882 35.89 (range: 17 .25-5 8.16) c m Two patie nts r eceived a transurethral r esection of the prostate, six and seven yea rs before implant. At one-mo nth post- planning, mean ( range: 123.95 -166.64) Gy. As a result of experience gain ed over two years of applyi ng this treatment regime, the time needed to pe rform the pr ocedure decreased from 270 to 9 0 minut es. With a med ian f ollow-up of nine months , the obser ved toxicity was low with no a cute or late urinary obs tructio n: 45% an d 9% of patients presented grade 1 (G1) and grad e 2 ( G2) acute GU toxi city, respec tively, and only 9% of patients dev eloped G1 acute GI toxicity. A total of 27% of patients presented G1 late GU toxicity not requ iring medi cation. At the time of writing, urina e and erectile funct ion ar e prese rved in the whole grou p. All patients are free f rom biochemica l and loc al recurrence, with me an PSA v alues redu ced by 70%, 85% an d 86.1% at ee, six and nine m onths, respectively . Conclusion: Our da ta confir m that LDR 125 I brach yther apy is a safe and eff ective curative modality for selected low- risk prostat e canc er patients who wish to maintain er ectile function and urinary continence. T he outcome seems strongly depende nt on a multidi sciplinar y approach, as well as on th e high technica l ability of dedicated profes sionals and the ca reful sele ction of the patients to be treated. 1 Taira Al V , Merrick G, Wayne Y et al : Long-te rm outcome for clinically localized pr ostate cancer tre ated with permanent J Oncology pr 2010. 2 Incira L, Va icinas K a nd Juoz aityte E: on yther apy.

Patients and Met hods: We identified 19 patients who underwent sRAR P wit h bilateral limited pelvic lymph node dissection by a single surgeon between July 2002 and October 2010. RT consisted of XRT in nine cases, brachytherapy in seven cases, brachytherapy plus XRT in tw o cases and proton beam therapy in one c ase. Biochemic al failure was defined a s a PS A of >2.0 ng/ml over the absolute nadir. Contine nce was defined as the use of 'no pads' afte r surger y and potenc y was defined a s the ability to achieve and maintain adequate erection for penetrati on, with or without PDE-5 inhibitors. Bioc hemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a of after sRARP. Results: The median (IQR) 30 (range: 37-32.5) 2, 5 (range: 4- 15), and 12 (range: 7.5-13), respectively. The medi an PSA nadir after RT and the median PSA before surgery were 4 .3 (range : 3.4-4.9) and 1.2 ( range: 0.75-1.2) ng/ml, respec tively . Six patients were placed on ADT. The median OR time and blood loss were 92.5 (range : 90-107.5) min and 100 (range: 100-100) ml, respectively. A partial ner ve-sparin g surgery was performed in five (26.3%) patients, while all other patients underwent non nerve-sparing surgery. On histopathological evaluation, five patients (26.3%) had pT2 d isease, eight had pT3 a, wh ile five (26.3%) had pT3 b. Due to intense scarring, it was not feasible to accurately stage one prostate. Three patients (15.8%) had a po sitive surgical marg in. The med ian Gleason score, prostate wei ght and tumor volume wer e 8 (range: 7-8), 34 (range: 25-43) . The me dian length of hospita l stay and day s on cat heter were 1 (range: 1-2) day and 8 (range: 7-11) days, respectively. Two (10.5%) patients had three complicatio ns (15.8%). Two patients had anast omosis leak (1d), both treated by extended Foley's ( Clavien treated by direc t inte rnal urethrotomy. There were no rectal injuries or bladder neck contractures. Fifteen pa tients had a t least six mont hs of fol low-up, of who m twelve (80%) wer e continent. The medi an time t o achieve continenc e was 5.5 (r ange: 2.6-9) months. Only two pa tients who had partial nerve-sparing surgery had six mon ths of follow-up, and none of them were potent. On a median follow- up of 24 (range: 6-45) months, 4 patients (21%) had BCR. Conclusion: sRALP is a technically challenging but feasible proce dure. The challenge lies in extens ive fibrosis and loss of dissection planes, secondary to radiation the rapy.

Case Re port: Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) was performed af ter radical nephrectomy. Ultrasonography detected enlargement of the left kidney with a mass occupying the caudal half of the organ, hypoechoic with irregular central fluid collection and de- structuration of the normal renal echo -structure. The power- Doppler appear ance was hypov ascular without visualization of the renal vein. At CT scan, the lesion was described as a voluminous heterogeneous mass of 8.6\u00d711 cm in the lower pole of the left kidney. Before contra st medium injection, the lesion appeared hyperdense compared with the surrounding renal parenchyma, with signs of bleeding. It also revealed a renal pelvis and ureter dilatation with non-flow of contrast medium in to the bladder. Radical nephrectomy w as performed. On gross exami nation, the mass was we ll circumscribed and en capsulated, with a wel l-defined limit betwee n the thin rim of renal tissue and the lesion. The outer surface was lobular and the cut surface showed a solid whorled white appearance. The tumor was very hard in consistency. No cystic change, hemorrhage, or necrosis was evident. On microscopic examination, the lesion showed fascicles of long spindle cells, showing a whirling pattern with interve ning areas of c ollagen de position. Nucle i were regular oval with bland chromatin. Mit oses were not evident. No tumor cell pleomorphis m, epithelia l components or immature eleme nts were evide nt on multiple sections that were studied. On immunohistochemica l evaluation, tumor cells were strongly positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for cytok eratin and HMB 45. Discussion and Conclusion: Renal leiomyomas are rare benign tumors of the kidne y originating from mu scle cell s. A few cases o f leiomyoma are d escrib ed in the literature. They can be found directly at autopsy as they are asymptomatic, or diagnosed by the appearance of symptoms (abdomina l/flank pain, hema turia, palpable mass). Today the widespread use of ultrasonography and CT has increased the detection of clinically asymptomatic leiomyomas . Ultra At CT scan l eiomyomas appear hyperdense compared to the surrounding tissue, with density similar to that of muscles. The differential diagnosis betwee n leiomyoma an d other malignant lesions (above all renal cell carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma) is still possible only by histological examina tion. Macroscopically, leiomyoma is described as a white or red peripheral lesion, well defined, with a solid aspect and elastic consiste nce. Colo r is related to ma ss vascularization. Histologically, renal ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1884 appear to be c ompose d of fusoc ellula r elements, showing ab sence of mitotic fig ures, ple omorphism, hype rchromatism and, above all, with an a bsence of periles ional in vasion. Finally , despite the diagnostic difficulties, the gold standa rd of therapy is still surger y. 142 LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCE R TREATED WITH THREE-DIMENSIONAL CONFORMAL RADIATION THERAPY (3D-CRT): A SINGLE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE Girol amo Spagnoletti , Rita Marchese, Anna Mar ia Leo, Grazi a della, Vincenzo Oriolo therap y (3D-CRT) is often used as a curative treatment for clinically localized prostate ca ncer.

Aim: The aim of the present study was to analyz e outcome and acute and late side effects of three-dime nsiona l conforma l radiation th erapy (3D- CRT) for localized prostate cancer in patients aged 75 years and older. Patients and Methods: Ninety-two localized prostate cancer patients aged >75 years were treated at the Radiation Oncology Depart ment in Fog gia betw een January 2007 and Decem ber 2009. All patients were affected by intermediate- ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1886 risk disease, with PSA 20 n g/ml or less and tumor category T2c o r less. Each patient was scored by using the Cumulative Illness Rat ing Scale (CIRS ) Sev erity Index comorbidity scale. All men were treated with radical 3D-CRT with o r without horm onal therapy. None of the patie nts received treatment of the pelvic lymphatics. A cute and la te side-effects we re analyzed accor ding to the tox icity cr lated . Results: The me dian f ollow-up was 25 months and the mean age was 78 ye ars (range: 75- 89 yea rs). CIRS Sever ity Index w as none (0) for eight pa tients, mild (1) for 42 patients, moderate ( 1.01-2) for 29 patients and severe (2.10- 3) for 13 patients.

Most stud ies define b iochemi cal relapse as equal to two or three PSA values that are at least 0.2 ng/ml after prostatectomy. Salvage radiotherapy i s often considered as a valid option for these patie nts (1, 2). In this study, we analyzed the benefit and tox icity of s alvage and Metho We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 18 pa tients who unde rwent radiotherapy for PSA recurrence after surgery between January 2007 and December 2009 at the Radiation Oncology Department in Foggia. Bioche mical relapse was defined as equal to three PSA values that were at least 0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy. At the time o f diag nosis o f recurrence, the median PSA value was 5 (range 0.5-30.1) ng/ml. Biopsy findings showed local recur rence in ten patients (55.5%). Patients received a median of 72 Gy to the prostate bed without treatment of the regional lymphatics. Recur rence- free survival and overall survival were calcu lated and toxicity was asse ssed with RTO G scale. Results: The median follow- up was 24 months. Radiotherapy treatm ent was w ell tol erated and all patients received the prescribed dose. Acute toxicity included rectal (G0, 90% and 84.5%, respectively. Conc lusion : Salvage radiotherapy is an effective treatment after radical prostatectomy, and in cases of persistent PSA follow ing surgery for prostate cancer, it can be used with a significant chan ce of overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Co mplications are similar to those reported for adjuvant irradiation . 1 Neuhof D, Hen tschel T, Bischof M, Sroka-Perez G, Hohenfellner M and Debus Long-term and Salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a study of 62 patients.

Since the alpha/b eta ratio estimates for prostate ca ncer are much lowe r than the typical values for ma ny othe r type s of tumor (2), we perfo rmed a small randomize d tria l to co mpare a hypofractionated versus a con ventional sch edule for radioth erapy in localized prostate carcinoma. We have already reported the acute toxic ity (3). Now our ai m is to evaluate late gastroint estinal ( GI) and genitourina ry (GU) toxic ities in the two pa tient g roups and to assess the mathematical model theoretically predicting equivalent fractionations. Patients and Methods: From September 2008 to July 2009, 40 patients with cT1-T2 N0M0 prostate canc er were randomized to receive either a convention al or a hypofractionated r adiation therapy with cur ative intent.

Treatments wer e delivered using four to s ix cop lanar 10-18 MV photon beams at a dose of 72- 78 G y in 36-39 fraction s within 7-8 weeks, or 64 .8-70.2 Gy in 24-26 fraction s within 5 we eks. Based on standard linear -quadr atic modeling, the hypofra ctiona ted proto col was designed to keep late complica tions consta nt in rectal tiss ues. GI and GU toxicities we re sc ored according to the RTO G/EOR TC system. Eff icacy o f radiotherapy, based on clinical, radiologic and prostate- specif ic an tigen data, was also evaluated ever y three months for two years and every six months subsequently. Results: All pat ients co mpleted the whole course of radiothera py without int erruptions. Mini mum follow-up w as one and a h alf ye ars; media n follow-up wa s 25 months. None of the patients expe rienc ed gr ade 3-4 toxicity. Grade 1 and grade 2 GI and GU toxicities occurred during and soon after tr eatment in bot h gr oups without significant differences . In the long term, 35% of patients in the hypofractionated g roup and 4 0% of pat ients in the control group reported increas ed freq uency of urination or nocturia (p> 0.5). Their symptoms cannot be sco red as G 1 because t hey did not reach twice the level of the pretreatment habit. Only one patient in the hypofract pre- existin g hemor rhoid al diseas e. Discussion and Co nclusion: No difference w as noted in the chronic complications bet ween hypofractionated and conventiona lly fractionated radiotherapy groups. As regards late recta l side -effects, according to the linear -quadr atic formula in our study des ign, la te toxicity was already expected to be equivalent in the two treatment grou ps. Our stud y confir ms that hypof ractionati on is a pro mising regimen for prostate cancer radiothe rapy and that a relia ble radiobi ological model. The follow-up period was long enough to conclude that the hypofractionated schedule was well tolerated in both the short and long term and the incidence of clinically significant GI and GU toxicity after conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy appeared to be similar. Longer follow-up is mandator y to ev aluate the effectivenes s of the two r egimens. Regarding tumor c ontrol, as suming a low a lpha/beta ratio for prostate carcinoma, we expec t an inter esting the rapeutic gain. 1 Brenner DJ et al : Direct evidence that prostate tumors show high sensitivity to fraction ation (low / ratio), similar to late-responding norma l tissue.

The Virtual HDR Cyberknife is indicate d for patie nts with localized cancer prostate (T1-T2b) with favor able prognos is (Glea son score 6, PSA 10 ng/ml) and selected patients with intermediate prognosis (Gleason score of 7, PSA 10.2-20 ng/ml). The low /\u00ae ratio for prostate cancer requires high radiation wi th an hypofractionated schedule of dose for tumor control and it has been shown to be biologically le thal for pr ostate ca ncer c ells. In this report, we summa rize preliminary experience with planning emulating HDR brachythera py dos e distribution. Patients and M ethods: At our institution, over a period of 36 mon ths, 11 patients with a median age of 78 (range 73-86) years and a me dian Gleason score of 6 (range 5-7) were submitte d to treatme nt with the Virtual HDR Cyberknife. T he planning ta rget volume (PTV), defined with MRI and CT imaging, included the prostate and semi nal vesicles, plus 2 mm of expansion for favorable prognosis or 5 mm for intermediate prognosis in all directions, ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1888 except posteriorly. T he pr escription dose was 38 Gy in four fractions with an extraure thral PTV Dma x at least 150% of the prescription of dose. T he Fiducial Tra cking System f ollows the fiducials that ar e placed one week before. Results: A dose of 38 Gy in four fractions with a median dose of 60% (range 57-75 %) was prescribed for a ll pa tients. No bioche mica l failures were obs erved in a me dian follow-up of 12 (range 3- 36) mont hs. The median value of pre-treatme nt PSA was 8.8 (range 4.5-14.3) ng/ml and this de creased in pa tients with a follow-up of mor e than thre e months, with a media n value of 0.16 ( range 0.032- 1.21) ng.ml. Acute and late grade 2-3 rectal or uri nary toxicities were observed in some patients . Only one patient had acute G3 recta l toxic ity. One patie nt die d of other causes.

Aim: The aim of the study was to esti mate rectal and urinar y tract to xicity when prostate and sem receive hypofr actionated iate and high risk recurren ce). Patients and hypofractionated 3DCRT cGy/day to 62 Gy to the prostate and vesicles between Sept ember 2009 and August 2010. The mean age was 72 years (medi an 73, rang e 59-83 years). B ased on prognos tic clas sificat ion accor ding to guidelines by the National C omprehensive Cancer Network, all patien ts were divided patients (32.8%); and unfav orable prognosis , 25 patients (50%). The mean PSA at diagnos is was 36 ng/ml (median 11.6 ng/ml, rang e 1.84- 465). The mean Gleason sco re was 7 (median 7, range 4-10). Hormonother apy was admin istered i n 45 patients (90%). Total androgenic deprivation was used in 60% of pat ients, peripheral antagonist in 30%, and LH-RH in 10%. The mean treatment time was 38 days. The mean dose to planning treatment volume (PTV) was 62.45 Gy (median 62.26 Gy). The receivi ng 38 Gy (rV38) was 43%. The mean percentage of rectal volume receiving 54 Gy (rV54) was 2 2%. The mean percen tage volum e receiving 38 Gy (rV38) was 34%. The mean PTV volume was 151 cc. The mean follow-up was of 12 months. The patients were treated accor ding to Memorial Sloan-Kett ering Cancer Cen ter set-up (Zelefsky IJROBP1994): 6 fields, conformation, photons calcu lated f or PTV , and femoral heads. For OAR d elineation on TPS, bladder wall and rectum wall was drawn. All patients were clinically evaluated for urinary and rectal complic ations according to R TOG acute effects score. Results and Conc lusion: According to the American S ociety for Therapeutic Rad iology and Onc ology, a rise by 2 ng/ml or more above the nadir PSA is considered the stan dard definition for biochemical failure after radiotherapy, with or without Only one t had biochem ical recurr one patien t systemic disease (bone metastasis ). Regard ing acute toxicity, we registered 13/50 G2(18%) were registered. Hypo fractionation allowed reduction of treatm ent time. 151 ADAPTIVE RADIOTHERAPY WITH GOLD MARKE RS TO REDUCE RADIOTHERAPY- RELATED TOXICITY IN LOW-RISK PROSTA CANCE C uzzonigr 2, Riuniti di Ancona, Anc ona, Italy Aim: The main aim of t his study was to h ighlight the good bladder and rectum toleranc e reco rded in a group of patients with low-risk prostate can cer when treated with an adaptive on- line radiotherapy protocol. Patients and submitted to an image-guided radiation therapy protocol at the Radio therapy Department of Ancon a, between Jan uary 2007 and Nove mber 2010. Three gold markers (1.2 mm\u00d7 3 mm) were placed in the prostate (left base, apex and right mid- gland) unde r ultrasound guidance by the referring uro logist (AG) ; before implantation, patients had an enema and w ere placed on antibiotics; local rectal anesthesia w as perform ed. Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1889 The corre ct gold marker p ositio ns we re verified by fluoroscopy. The planning computed tom ography (CTsim) was acq uired (1 mm axial slices) five days aft er implantation, when stability of the m arker s had been ach ieved. Po lyurethane foam was individually tailor ed to im mobilize the legs and to ensure a stable pos itioning of the pa tient's pelvis; the patients were asked to keep a full bladde r and an empt y rectum in order to reduce inter- fraction orga n-filling variability. The prostate without the seminal vesi cles as clinical target volume (CTV) was delineated by the s ame expert physician (GM). An initial 3D co nformal R T plan (p re-planning) was performed, prescribing 78 Gy (2 Gy per fraction) to the planning target volume (PTV) and using a standard CTV-t o-PTV margin of 1 cm except for 0.5 cm on the po sterior ed ge. A daily match o f marker positions between CB CT and C Tsim was performed in order to correct inter-frac tion prostate motion. After the first week of treatment, a new treatmen t plan was performed for each patient wher e the first five CBC Ts were used to create a patient pe rsonalized PTV , as a merged volume, including the 5-day prostate position var iability (plus 2 mm due to operator and Linac mechanical ina ccuracy). Patient symptoms were monitored regularly (at leas t each 3-4 months up to the time of writing). The obs erved to xicity was recorded and classified according to the RTOG scor e. Results: The applie d adaptive on-line protocol w ith schedul ed re-pl anning to compensat e for the an terior prostate tilt (incorrigible with a li near shift) allowed us to reduce CTV -PTV margin in the maj ority of patients: the median CT V-PTV marg in in the pre- planning phase was 98.82\u00b125 .70 cc (range 29.73-134.14 cc), while the median CTV-PTV mar gin in the re-planni ng ph ase was 20.38\u00b112.56 c c (range 4 .79-56.09 c c), with a media n advanta ge of 78 .44\u00b121.67 cc (range 24 .94-117.57 cc). The reduction of re-plan ning margin allow ed a reduction of the d ose to the rectum and bladder, and re sulted in low a cute and late toxicity . Late rectal toxicity was rec orded only in thre e patients (one G1, one G 2 and one G3 patien t) and late bladde r toxicity in 13 patients (eight G1, four G2 and one G3 patients); all one, prese nted sexu al impo tence, mainly as worsening of pre-radiother apy impotence due to hormon al therapy ; only one patient showed true radiotherapy-related impote nce. Conclusion: Image-guided radi ation therapy is helpful to per sonali ze and reduce t he C TV-PTV margin. Consequently, toxicities were v ery low, with few cases o f G1- G2 acute and late bladder and re ctal effects, and only two cases of G3 Carlo Vivacqua 1, Marco Paolucc i 2, Roberto Di Lor dale Castello, Ita Aim: To evaluate the e fficac y, complic ations and prostatectomy (RRP). Patients and Me thods: From Jan uary 2009 to February 2010, twelve patients were submitted to RRP, obturatory lymphadenectomy and IORT . At clinical staging, s tumor s were T2c, three prese nted with perineura l infiltration, two showed seminal vesicle infiltration and one extracapsular disease. Mean preoperative PSA value was 14 (range 11-23) ng/ml a nd the Gleas on score at biopsy the tients presented is was performe d with 6-8 stitches. IORT was administered with linear electron accelerator and adminis tration of energy of 12 MeV . Results: The time surp lus for IORT administration was 45 minutes (\u00b130-60 minu tes according to the diffic ulty in findin g the correct posit ion of the probe unde rneath the pubic bone ),with the entire proce dural time being 200 (\u00b130) minutes . Bleeding was less than 500 cc, without nee d for trans fusions. Thr ee tumors were pT2c, thre e were pT3a, one w as pT3b, one w as pT2c N1 and four patie nts presented R+ . Perioperative complications were not observed. Bladder catheter was removed after ten days. At three months follow-up, five patients presented stress-incontinence (three pads/day); at six months , one pa tient still presented the same problem. Erectile dysfunction was reported by all patients. PSA failure was not present at mean follow-up of 16 (range 13-23) months. Discussion: IORT d uring RRP can be used safely in the treatment of prostate cancer with locally advanced disease or with high Gleason score. On cologic follow-up was too short and the number of patie nts was too low in our series to lead to conclusions on the outcome, but the absence of PSA failure is encouraging. The use o f a linear electron accelerator with maximum energy administration of 12 MeV does not seem to expose the pat ients to signifi cant adverse effects. Conclusion: Selected patients affected by prostate cancer can benefit from radical surgery associated with a supple mentary treatment as IORT, without evide nce of signific ant a dvers e side-effects. 154 RARE NON-GE RM CELL TESTICULAR TUMOURS : LEIOMYOSARCOM A AND ADULT GRANULOS A CELL TUM OUR Daniele Tiscione , 1807-1956 1890 Background: Non- germ cell tumors of the testicle include the sex cord/gonadal strom al tumors (Leydig c ell, S ertol i cell and gr anulos a cell) a nd non- specific stromal tumors (leiomyos arcoma) .

The average age at presentation is 44 years a nd the tumors are usua lly >7 cm diameter. Case Report A: A 65-yea r-old man pr esented at our clinic with a six-month his tory of left testicula r pain and swelling. His past medical history was signi ficant for a lef t testicular trauma tha t had oc curred sever al years before . Scrotal ultrasound scans and tumor marke rs were nor mal.

All le iomyosarcomas an d 20% of the adult type gr anulosa cell tumors are malignant. In both cases, distant metastases are relativel y rare. T he standard treat ment is or chiect omy. Adj uvant treatments, such as chemother apy, radiotherapy or retroperitoneal lymph-no de dissection, do not seem a ble to improve prognosis, which remain s good in case s of localized tumors. Conclusio n: In our opinion, scrota l trauma , associated ith chr onic infla mmation, sho uld be conside red as a risk factor for testicular cancer. In case s of small te sticular nodules (< 1 cm), an initial conser vative approach may be con sidered.

Moreover, some authors sugges ted tha t urothelia l canc er with di vergent differentiation, even if it occurs only rarely, has a wo rse prognosis when compared with pure urothelial cancer. Howev er, the managemen t options for this disease are still under discussion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of patients affected by uncommon pathological variants of bladder cancer wh o had undergone radical Materials and specime Janua ry 2000 and De cembe r 2009, were reviewed pathologically in order to identify the pathologica l variants of urothe lial bla dder cell carcino ma.

Moreover, all clinic al data regarding patie nt outc ome we re analyzed. Results: A total of 66 pathological variants of bladder cancer were collected over the entire study period. Pathological analysis showed: 41 cases of squamou s cell carcinoma, 8 cas es o f mic ropapillary carcinoma, 4 cases o f clear cell carcinoma, 3 cas es of adenocarcinoma, 2 cases of small cell carcinoma, 2 cases of sarcomatoid differentiation, 3 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like tumor, 1 case of giant cell tumor and two un differentiated cases. Moreover, we f ound one pT1, 14 pT2, 2 pT2 w ith carcinoma situ , 29 pT3a , 5 pT3b, 15 pT4, and 5 and 2 N3. At a mean follo w-up period of 97.6 (range 10 to 114) months, 19 patients were alive without disease, 5 were alive with disease progression and 42 had died from their disease (mean survival time=9.7 months). We found that squamous differentiat ion was the most common variant and was correlated with higher grade and stage. Mo reover, blad der carcinoma wi th sarcoma toid differentiation had a p oorer prognosis and patients affected by clear cell carcinoma or micropapillary carcinoma had a better prognos is. Conclusion: The present study, by mean s of a long-term follow-up, showed Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1891 that the uncommon pathological variants of urothel ial blad der cell carcinoma are specific clinic al and pathologi cal entities to be taken into account.

Gius L 1, ichele Battaglia Transpla ntation sity of B ari, Section of Andrology and Kidney Trans plantation, B ari, Nephrology a nd of Bari, I taly Background: Cancer stem cells (CSC s) are a subset of undifferentiated cells responsible fo r tumor initiation, maintenance and progression. They possess an u nlimited potential for prolifera tion, self-rene wal ability and genera tion of progeny cells that become the most impo rtant cell population of the tumor. Rece ntly, in an experiment al model of severe combined immu nodeficient mic e, a popu lation of CD133 +stem cells isolated from human renal cell carcino ma (RCC) and which was able to initiate t umor growth was detected. Aim: The aim of this study was the isolation and characterizat ion of CD133 +cells derived from human clear cell RCC in order to study the features of the progenitor/stem cells , including the ability for self-renewal . Patients and Methods : Fresh human renal cortical tissue was harvested from 15 patients diagnosed with RCC. Tis sue fractions of both he althy and tumor ous renal tissue were use d for the isolation of progenitor/stem cel ls. Two healthy cell populations were isolated: one resident in the renal tubules and the other in the glomeruli. The same procedur e was also used for the pathological tissue, but in this c ase it wa s imp ossible to distinguish tubules and glomeruli since this portion appe ared deprived of a compartme ntalized structur e. The isolated cells were pu rified for stem ce ll mar ker CD1 33. The CD1 33 +- derived c lones were purified for CD24. This ma rker allowe d us to distinguis h resident renal stem cells from hematopoie tic ones. The e xpres sion protein from CD133 +/CD24 +cells was used to perform a protein array including 16 stem cell markers (OCT 3/4, NANOG, SOX We i renal stem cells (CD133+/24+) from healthy and neoplastic renal tissue. By cytofluorime tric analys is, we confir med the e markers in CSCs: CD133, CD24, PAX-2, BMI-I, and OCT-4. of this popula tion was NCAM +. The quantitative an alysis of cellular proteins obtained from the array confirmed the ste mness o f CD133 +/24 +CSCs 17, OTX2 and SNAIL versus the normal stem cells isolated from the same patient. Discussion and Co nclusion: Taken together, these results showed that stem cells are present in clear cell RCC and that they are more undifferentiated than normal stem cells due to their expression of embryogenesis-derived markers. It is conce ivable, therefore, that only the eradication of CSCs or, alternatively, the induction of differentiation in cells without self-renewal pote ntial, is able to lea d to eff ective treatment of Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1893 cancer.

In March 2010, becaus e of progres sively increasing PSA (1.6 ng/ml), the patient underwent magne tic resonance imaging of the pelvis, showing abnormal solid tissue with contra st enhance ment meas uring 20\u00d79 mm in the left p osterior r ption of the prostatic nd aprostat ic fat infiltration. A bioptic sam ple histo logically confirmed t he cancer rec urrence. The patient was initially treated with hormone therapy (bicalutamide 150 m g daily per os ). We treated the patient with conformal radioth erapy (CRT) at a dos e of 7 4 Gy in 37 fractions. The treatm ent was performed with periodic con trol of th e treatm ent s et-up by co ne b eam C T ( image-guid ed radiother apy). The tre atmen t was well tolerated. Tox icity was meas ured us ing the RTO G sca le (gastrointestin al toxicity of grade 1 and a g enitourinary to xicity of grade 2 ). At the end of trea tment, PSA w as 0.57 ng/ml. Ho rmon e therapy w as continued durin g the treatment and interru pted six months after. After o ne year , the patient is free of recurrence and w ithout evidence of late t oxicity. Conclusion: Salva ge radioth erapy after HIFU is feasible and safe, with a toler able acut e toxicity, while a longer fo llow- up is nee ded to de fine the impact on late sequelae and outcome. 1 Blana A, Murat FJ, Walter B et al : First analysis of the long- term results with transrectal HIFU in patients with localized prostate cancer.

COMPARISON COM PLICATIONS, STRATIFIED ACCORDI NG TO CL AVIEN SYSTEM IN OP EN VERSUS ROBOTIC PROSTATECTOMY Ottavio De Cobe lli 1, Sara Melegar i 1, Gia ncarlo Albo 1, Deliu-vic tor M atei 1, Gennaro M usi 1, Federic a Mazzoleni ologia, Milano, Ita ly Background: The introduction of PSA monitoring has assisted in the downstaging of prostate cancer an d diagnosis in younger men, consequ ently meetin g oncological g oals an d achieving a good quality of life in term s of continence, potency, hospitalizatio n and morbidity. A ccording to EAU 2010 guidelines, radical prost atectomy i s considered the gold standa rd of treatm ent for prostate cance r. Robotic app roach es have been developed to achieve these outcomes. In 1992 and 2004, Clavien (1) proposed a simple grading system fo r surgical complicatio ns, w hich was t hen us ed by Coeh lo et al . (2) to classify robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The aim of this study was to compare incidence of complications, stratified acco rding to the Clavien system, in retro (RARP). Mate rials and Meth ods: From February 1999 to May 2 008, we p erformed 953 RRP proced ures and from November 1st 2006 to Decem ber 31st 2010, we per formed 697 RARP p rocedures. To avo id population bias related to the learning curve, we selected the last 197 RRP p rocedu res t hat were perfo rmed two y ears before the first RARP procedure, and 358 consecutive RARP procedures that w ere p erform ed from Feb ruary 200 8 to February 2010.

Results: A total of 115 overall compl ications were recorded in t he RRP group vs. 87 in the roboti c group ( p-value =0.001). A total of 45.2% o f patients who underw ent RRP had one complication vs. 19.0% of patients in the robotic gro up. The fol lowing observations were made: inguinal hernia, 9 vs. 7 in the RRP vs. the RAR P group, res pectively; drained hemato ma, on e 1 vs. 4; acute urine re tention, 5 vs. 9; perianasto motic leak age, 30 vs. 31; drain ed lymph ocele, 6 vs. 2; balanitis, 10 vs. 0; pneumonia 0vs neede trans fusion 44 vs.19; and ureter al fistula, 1 vs. 0, respectively. A single pa tient in each group experienced an early anastomotic stenosis .

SALVAGE RADIOTHERAP Y AFTER RADICAL SURGERY FOR PROS TATE CANCER: EXPERIENCE AT THE NIGUARDA CA' GRANDA HOSPITAL Zanni role of radiothera py (RT) in pr ostate after radic tatec tomy is modal ities of RT to investigate the optimal timing of RT. The a im of the study was to determine any advantage between the different modalities of treatment. Patients and Methods : Between 1994 and 2008 at the Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital in Milan, 33 8 patients were treated with external beam RT to the prostate bed after radical prostatectomy (pT2R+, pT3). These patients were divided into three groups : 137 pa tients (40.5% ) who underwe nt RT within six months from surger y and whos e post-prosta tectomy PSA level was undetectable (group A); 98 patients (29%) treated with RT within six months, but with persistent PSA va lues (PSA >0.02 ng/ml) (group P); and 103 patients (30.5% ) who unde rwent RT in the salvage setting, following a delayed rise in PSA or based on clinical evidence of relapse (group S). Adjuvant androgen ablation was given in 17/137 patients in group A, 27/98 patients in group P and 16/103 patients in group S . In group P, the mean value of PSA was 0.36 (range 0.02-7.7) ng/ml, while the mean PSA for group S was 0.78 (range 0.1-5.5) ng/ml. For the three groups, the med ian RT dose was 64.8 (range 5 9.4-7 2) Gy. The K aplan-M eier m ethod was used to e stimate the s of biochemic al relapse- free surviv al (b-RFS) and overa ll survival (OS). The log-rank test was used to test the significance between the three groups with respect to selected endpoints. Results: For all groups, gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were n ever higher than grade 2 according to RTOG classification. In group A, there were six de aths, four unrelate d to prostate cancer and two due to metastatic disease; in group P, there were five deaths (thre e due to ca ncer a nd two due to othe r disease) and in group S there were six deaths (four related and two not related to prostate cancer). We ev aluated biochemica l relapse of disease according to ASTRO criteria. A total of 27/137 patients (19.7% ) in group A, 35/98 patients (35.7% ) in group P, and 64/103 patients (62.1%) in group S showed a biochemical relapse. The three groups show ed a statistically signific ant diff erenc e in b-R FS ( p< 0.01) , while ther e was no significant difference in OS. Un ivariate analysis wa s performed for two subgroups (GS <o r 8 and RT do se or <70 Gy). For all three groups , patients with GS<8 showed a significantly better b-RFS than those wit hGS8, whi le the Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1895 dose of radiother apy did no t signific antly affect b-RFS, possi bly becaus e of the sma ll numbe r of patie nts receiving a dose 70 Gy (5/137 in group A, 21/98 in group P and 39/103 in gr oup S).

Testicular cance r norma lly appears as a casually found, painless , unilater al mass in the scrotum; ultrasound confirms the presence of a testicula r mass and explor ation of the contra lateral tes tis can lead to dia gnosis in cases wher e the testicular mass is no t palpabl e and i n cases of retroper itoneal or visceral lesions or elevated serum mar kers. All patients with a suspected testicular m ass m ust undergo inguina l exploration; immediate orchiectomy with divis ion of the spermatic c ord a t the in ternal inguinal ring mus t be performed if a tum or is found. If the di agnosis is not clea r, a testicular biopsy is taken for frozen section histological e xamination. F rozen se ction histological examination is r equired in ca ses of solita ry testis or bilateral ed our exper ience concer ning the reliability of froze n sec tion examination in pr imary testicula r tumors by comparin g each frozen section examination r esult to the final diagnosis. Patien ts and M ethods : From 2001 to 2009, at I EO, 323 p atients underwent or chiectomy. In 80 of these pa tients (24.7% ), the surgeon clamped the sperma tic cord and performed a biopsy for frozen section his tological examina tion; this was required for patients with a smal l tumor without elevate d serum marke rs and for patients with bilateral lesions or single testis, both of which were considered to be cas es of doubt. S pecimens were well oriented and resection ma rgins properly and the pathologist perf ormed a perpendic ular section of the tumor with margin including the entire tumor and uninvo lved testicu lar parenchyma. All procedures had to be completed within 20 minutes since the spermatic cord was clamped. In cases of malignancy, radical orchiectom y was performed and in cases of benign findings, the lesion was simply enucleated. Slid es of frozen section and the per manent sections were r eviewed an d compared with regard to the histological diagnosis a nd presence/absence of malignancy. Results: Of the 80 specim ens analyzed, 18 (22.5%) were negative for malignancy and 15 (18.7%) were benign lesions such as tumors of non-specific stroma, Leydig cell tumor, cystadenomas, or simple cysts. A total of 50.1% of cases of malignant lesion were diagnosed, in particular, 10 were seminoma, 16 were non semin oma germ cell tumor, 4 were intr atubular germ cell ne oplasia, 10 were lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma and others . In 8.7% of cases , the diagnosis was delayed. The definitive pathology confirmed the diagnosis in 90% o f cases of seminoma, in 95.5% of cases of non seminoma germ cell tumors and in 94.5% of cases of benign lesions. Discussion: A total of 80-90% of all testicular masses are malignant germ cell tumors and patients sho uld undergo orchiectomy. On the other hand, benign testicu lar lesions are recognized in approximately 10-20% of cases, enabling testis-sparing surgery based on the findings of frozen section examination results. Frozen section is accurate for distinguishing benign from m alignant lesions and testicu lar function is preserved, w henever possible , requiring close collaboration between the surgeon and the pathologist. In a study of 317 patients, comparing frozen section examinations results with definitive pathology, Elert et al . obtained a correct frozen section diagnosis for all benign lesio ns, 90% of seminoma and 92% of non seminoma. Conclusio n: Intraoperative frozen section examination correctly identified more than 90% of malignant and benign testicular masses. Surgical management of testicular tumors based on frozen section examination results is safe and helpful in clinical practice. 1 Elert A, Olbert P, Heg ele A, Barth P, Ho fmann R and Heidenreich A: Accuracy of frozen section examination of testicular tumor s of unc ertain origin.

Howeve r, the mole cular mechanisms th e deve lopment an d progres sion of prostate ca ncer still are not ye t fully unde rstood. Recently, in a murine model, a conditional Lkb1 knockout was able to induce atypical hyperpl asia and prostate intraepithelial neo plasia. Furthermore, the lack of LKB1 positively co rrelated with nu clear muta eutz-Jegher s , rited condition predisposing to mu cocutaneou s pigmentations and several types of bot h be nign a nd maligna nt ne oplasm. Materials and Methods : We performed a retrospe ctive analys is of 22 human ate the ro le of LKB1 deregu lation in pro state cancer. Exhaustive analysis of t he LKB1 gene at DNA and pr otein level was performed by me ans of di rect sequencing , MLPA analysis, meth blotting. The LKB1 staining patter n w as evaluat ed by means of immunohis tochemistry in diff erent c ell subty pes a in different pre-neoplastic and fully malignant cancer spe cimens. Finally, to test whether the restoration of LKB1 e xpress ion and functio n wou ld affect p rostate cancer cell growth, we used DU145 L KB1- deficient ce lls. Results: A signific ant decrease of LKB 1 expression was o bserved in tumoral tissue compared to he althy tissue. Moreo ver, a significant inv erse c orrelation of LKB 1 protein expression with tumor gr ade was found. However, none of the sam ples a nalyzed, indepe ndently of the stage and grade, e videnc e of LKB1 inactiva tion by canonical isla methylation). Our immunohis tochemica l showed that LKB1 had an increase d e xpression in p rolife rative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), while it was reduce d pr ostate intraepithelial neoplasia , and tota lly abse nt from prostate carcinoma. We also found no evidenc e of W nt pat hway activation. Finally, we foun d that reconstitu tion of a fu nctio nal LKB1 protein in cancer -deficient cells inte rfered with cell cycle pr ogres sion and inhibited tumor cell growth. Conclus ion: In this study , we rep ort the fir st m olecular analysis of the LKB1 gene at DNA an d protei n levels in human pr ostate cancer. LKB1 inact ivation a ppea rs to be a crucial prostat e cancer initia tion and progr ession, sugges as a tumor suppr essor. The loss of LKB1 expression in high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia occurring in areas of PIA indicates that if PIA represents a p recursor lesion of prosta te cancer, LKB1 needs to be silenced in order for such a lesion to progress toward a fully maligna nt stage. 164 RENAL CELL CARCINOMA AND THYROID METASTASIS WITH THROMBOSIS OF THE INTERNAL JUGULAR Italy Background: Appr oximately noma (RCC) pres ent metastas is at the diagnosis , and 40-50% develop metastases later. Metastasis to the thyroid gland is rather uncommon (2-3%) . In clinical series, such metastasis is related to a favorabl e clinical history, with an average time from diagnosis of the RCC to metastasis of more than 10 0 months (1). The tenden cy of RCC to extend by mean s of neoplast ic thrombi to larger veins is well known. We present a case of a pat ient with a palpable thyroid mass w hich was d iagno sed as and Methods: An 83-year-old woma n (with a history of hypertension, hype rcholesterolemia, and stroke with left hemiparesis and aphasia, compl etely restored) presented with a palpable thyroid mass that was clinically suspe cted to be a mult inodula r thyro id fu nction 2.22 pg/ml, fT4: 1.33 ng/dl and she h ad no kidney symptoms. Ultrasound examination of the neck showed an enlarged thyroid with multiple hypo echoic nodu les. Biopsy revealed RCC large, omoge neous and partially necrotic mass involving the mid-lowe r part of the right kidney, without evident renal vein or inferior vena cava thrombosis. No lung or bone les ions were evident. Thu s, the patien t underw ent a robot-assisted nephrectom y (RAN) with a Da Vinci Standard Surgical System, followed by a total, parathyroid-sparing, thyroidectomy. During the procedure, thrombosis of internal jugular vein and right superior thyroid vein was suspected and c onfirmed by intraoperative echo Doppler, so thrombectom y and ligatur e of the internal jugular vein were performed. Results: The primary tumor wa s diagnosed as a Fuhrman grade 2 RCC, with initial invasi on of the renal vein and wi th foc al invasion to the perinephric fat.

Patients and Methods: From Jan uary 2006 to September 26 patients (18 men and 8 w omen) with mus cle invasive bladder cancer, who had previously been treated surgically, underwent salvage radiation therapy; 21 of those patients underwent trans urethr al endo scopic res ection and 5 of them underwent ra dical cystectomy . The media n age was 75 (range 49-90) years. Up until 2007, patients w ere treated with 3D conforma tional technique and from 2008 until the time of writing, with inten sity-modulated radiati on therapy (IMRT) . Treatment volumes included pelvis and bladder in 18 patients, with total doses of 45-50 Gy prescribed to the pelvic nodes and up to 60-70 Gy to the bladder or bladde r bed, with single daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy. In eight patients, the treatment was directed only to the bladder, with doses of 60 Gy in two patients, of 66 Gy in two patients and of 70 Gy i n four patients. Five patients received concomi tant chemot herapy, based on cispla bine. Results: The median follow-up was 14 (range 6-39) months. Radiation therapy-related toxicity was acceptable with G3-G4 acute toxicity of the gastrointes tinal tract (GIT) in 10% of patie nts and G3-G4 acute toxicity of the genitourina ry tract (GUT) in 15% patients. Late toxicity of the GIT two years after completing radiotherapy was absent, and was G 4 in 2% patients in the GUT. The median OS and DFS were 19 and 18 (range 1-39) mo nths, respecti vely. At the tim e of writing , 54% of the patients were alive and 71% were wi thout clinical evidenc e of disease. Over 80% of nts who previously unde rwent bladde thera py retained bladder function. Discussion and Conclus ion: Our data suggest a clear benefit from salvage radiothe rapy in terms of OS and DFS, allowing more than 80% of patients , alive without dise ase progr ession, to reta in bladder function. 166 DIABETES MELLITUS IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA: ROLE OF OGG1 AND TUB ERIN Antonio V avallo 1, Gius eppe Luc arelli 5, Stefa Impedovo 1, Silvano alazzo B Pasquale Ditonno 1 1Depa rtment of E merge ncy and Or gan Tra (DET Kidney of Foggia , Italy Background: There is strong evidence that the incidence of renal cell cancer (RCC) increases in patients with diabetes ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1898 mellitus (DM) but mecha nisms under lying this a ssociation are still largely un know n.

In both cases, difficulties exist in treating different volumes at different dose levels, which can be addressed through the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with the simultaneous integrated boos t technique. In par ticular, additional difficulties occur in cases where prior radiation therapy has been given. HT allows a high conformati on and dose escalation on tumor volumes with consi derable sp aring of organs at risk (OAR ) if compu ted tomography ( CT) is performed da ily before treatment. Patients and Methods: Between October 2010 and February 20 11, we treated five patients with nodal relapse after radical treatment (in one patient there was recurrence at the level of a single lymph node and in four patients there was recurrence in more than one lymph node) and two p atients with HRPC wi th me tastatic locoregional lymph nodes (in external and internal iliac chain) . The average age was 63.9 years. In one patient with nod al recur rence and relaps e in the prostate gland af radi otherapy, the treatment strategy was radiotherapy to nodal volume and HIFU to the p rostate. All patient s receiv ed hormonal therapy. All patients underwent fluorocholine pos itron-emission tomography (PET) for staging. Five patients underwent virtual simulation for treatment planning, using a CT simulator and two patients received PET-CT virtual simulation. The treatme nt volumes were the lombo-aortic and/or pelvic chains (irradiated with prophylactic doses), the PET-positive nodes (with curative doses) and the prostatic bed (with curative doses). Prescription doses wer e: 51 -54-54.4 Gy in 30-32 to PET- positive nodes an d 75.2 Gy in 32 fractions of 2.35 Gy to the prostate bed. The OAR were: rectum, bladder, penis bulb, ureters, femoral heads, small bowe l, kidneys, liver and pan creas. In previously irradiated patien ts, the prior treatm ent plannin g was r eviewed in order to evaluate any overlapping of the irradiated volumes . Results: Patients were evaluated in ter ms of acu te an d late t oxici ty an d prostate-specific antigen control. Toxicity wa s evaluated according to the RTOG-EORT C scale.

Li ver, kidney and pancreatic function were as sessed by b lood tests. Results: All patients complet ed treatment, which was well tolerated. Gastrointestinal acute toxicity w as evaluated in all patients and w as the following: G1 in fi ve patien ts (nause a and/ or moderate diarrhea not requiring dr ugs); G2 in one patient with extensive irradia tion v olume ( diarrhea requiring drugs); no G 3-G4 toxicity was observed. Gen itourinary acu te toxicity was G4 in one patient, with acute urinary ob struction requi ring catheter, but this occurrence appeared af ter only three sessions (at a dose of 7.05 Gy), and it resolved quickly with antibiotics, steroids and alpha 1 block ers; in add ition, this patient had a history of previo us episodes of acu te urinary obstruction requiring catheter. Hematological toxi city was G1 in two patients (sligh t decrease of white and red blood count and he moglobin) and G0 in the other s. In one pa tient, there was a sl ight increase o f pancreatic am ylase. Late toxicity w as not evaluated because of the limited follow-up ( three months ). MRI, performed in one patie nt, revealed remission o f previously positive lymph nodes. Prostat e-specific antigen le vel was evaluated and decreased in all patients. Discussion and C onclusion: Our i nitial experi ence shows tha t HT enables a good daily check o f internal anato my to ens ure proper s et-up for patients. Under this observation, treatment of extensive vo lumes, ne ar dose-limitin g for OAR, and dose escalation on targ et volume, can be performed with reduced acute toxicity. T hese results are h owever prelim inary and furt her follow-up is nece ssary to evaluate outcome and late toxicity. 1 Malinverni G, Land oni C , Stasi M , Pic iele P a Fa zio F: Clinic al application of 11C -cholin e PET in patients with biochemi cal relapse of prostate cancer.

Patients and Meth ods: Between June 2005 a nd De cembe r 2010, 50 consecuti ve patients with non- metastatic, intermediate-risk or locally ad vanced, prostate cancer were treated with IORT before prostatectomy as part of the ir surgic al procedure. The me dian age was 65 ye ars. The medi an iPSA was 14 ng/ml and the medi an bioptic Gleason score was 7. Acco rding to NCCN 2010, the risk group distribution w as as follows : four patie nts at interme diate risk (8%), 43 patients at high ris k (86% ) and thre e patients at very high r isk (6%). A total of 21 patients (42 % ) were treated w ith neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Immed iately before IORT , prostate dimensions e measu red wi th intraope rative ultrasound in order to select the electron beam energy and the applicator size properly and to estimate the doses to target and organs at risk. IOR T was delivered by a mobile linear accelerator in the operating room, u sing 8-10 MeV electron e nergie s and 5-7 cm diamete r applic ators. The prescribed dos e 12 Gy at the 90% isodose . Acc ording to the pathological findings, it would be possible to administer further adjuvant radio- or hormonal therapy: three mo nths later, postoperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was prescribed to the prostatic bed a lone and w hole pelvis in c ases of Sloan Center nomograms, the mean preoperative probability of organ- confined disease, extracapsular disease and lymph node involvemen t we re 15%, 4 5% and 22%, respectively. histological findings were follows: GS 8, pT2 disease in 8 patie nts, pT3 in 37 pa tients, pT4 in 5 patients, pN0 in 27 patients and pN1 in 23 patients. One patient died from postope rative pulmona ry embolism. Or gan- surgical mar gins (R0) was diagnos ed in four patients and no fur ther radiation tr eatme nt was prescribe d. Adjuv ant pelvic and prostatic bed EBRT was administered to 21 and 19 patients, respectively. No patient had major acute rectal toxicity. Twenty-three patients had G1- G2 urinary acu te toxicity and patients had urinary toxicity (iatroge nic monolatera l ure thral stricture and acute urinary retention, respectively). No increased risk of ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1900 urinary incontinence was re corded. Afte r a media n follow-up of 31 months , seven patie nts had evide nce of bioche mica l failure, tw o of them with evidence of clinical failure (lymph node and bone m etastasis). Conclusion: IORT deliv ered befor e prost atect omy appears to be a feasible and safe approach f or locally advanced prostate cancer, bu t longer follow-up is needed to evaluate late toxic ity and clinica l control. Further investigation is warranted in order to ide ntify the patients that benefit most from this treatment moda lity. 169 PERMANENT BRACHYTHERAPY AS SALVAGE THERAPY FOR LOCALLY RECURRENT PROSTATE CANCER AFTER EXTERNAL BEAM IRRADIA TION Andrea V avassori 1, 2, Elena Rondi 2, Rugger o Spoto 1, Roberta La zzari 1, Jereczek-Fossa 1, Dario Z erini 1, Veronica D ell'acqua 1, e Decobelli Gennar Di Oncologia, M ilano, Ita ly Aim: To estimate the incide nce of acute and la te toxicity and to evaluate the biochemica l ou tcome al exter nal beam ra diothera py for prost ate cancer. Patients and M ethods: Betwe en August 2000 and May 2010, 18 patients under went sa lvage PPB using 125 I for beam radiotherapy (EBRT ). medi an patie nt age w as 68 yea rs. Risk group distribution at initial diagno sis was as follows: four patients at low r isk (22.2%) , five patients at inte rmedia te risk (27.8%) and n ine patients at high r isk (50% ).

On e patient die d from prostate cancer after biochemical failure; two patients died from other cau ses. Eight patients (47.1%) were alive without bioche mical failure at the time of writing. At last follow-u p, the biochemical contro l rate using ris k category a t first diagnosis wa s 50%, 60%, and 44% in patients with low-, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively. Conclusion: Salvage PPB after irradia tion is feasible, with low urinary and rectal morbidity . The main limitations of this study include a small numbe r of patients and a short follow-up ; further experience and longe r follow- up are needed to evaluate the role of PPB in the treatment of local recurrences and to identify patients most likely to benefit from it. 170 CURATIVE RADIOTHERAPY IN PROSTA TIC CARCINOMA: IMPACT OF AGE ON INTES TINAL AND UROL OGICAL ACUTE TOXICITY Angelo Err ico 1, Michele Battaglia 2, Dora Di Cosmo 1, Annalis Pierange Nar della 3, Fulvio M aria F ucilli 4, Frances co Lafr ances china 2, Francesco Paolo Se lvaggi 2 Roma, Italy Aim: Prostate carcinoma is an age-related cancer with high incidence in elderly men, which requires care to achieve a favorable balance of risk in its tr eatment. The aim o f this study was to analyze the imp act of age on acu te intestinal and urological toxic ity in pat ients with prostate cancer treated wi th external beam radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Betw een June 2008 and May 2010, 101 patients with non metastatic localiz ed and locally a dvanced prostate c ancer were treated at our institution wi th curat ive ventionally fractionat ed confor mal radiother apy. Only two patie nts were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. For intermed iate- and high-risk patients, the total dose to t he prostate ranged from 78 Gy to 80 G y (2 Gy/fraction) ; the total dose to the semi nal vesicles ranged from 64 Gy t o 70 Gy. Low-ris k patients received 80 Gy to the prostate and the base of seminal vesicles. The median age of patients was 73 (range 51-81) years. Pat ients wer e stratified i nto two groups according to age: Gr oup 1 cons isted of 72 pa tients 75 yea rs of age (71.3%) and Group 2 consiste d of 29 patients > 75 years of age (28.7% ). Acute toxic ity was evalua ted weekly on the basis of the R TOG s cale. Bivariate analysis was performed using the Chi-square test and multivariate comparisons wer e realized us ing C ox's method. The follo wing para meters we re included in this analysis as covariates: age, dose to the seminal vesicles and adjuvant hormonal therapy. Results: No patient Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1901 in either group showed >G2 acute intest inal or urological toxici ty. Among G nts, 32 (44.4%) ha d no rec tal toxicity and 21 (29.2%) had G1-G2 rectal toxicity. Among Gr oup 2 pa tients, 9 (31 %) had G0 urina ctal toxi city an d 4 patients (13.8 %) had G1-G 2 rectal toxicity. There was no significant correlation between acute urinary or rectal toxicity and the age of patients ( p= 0.43 and p= 0.269, re spect ively) analys w as no signif icant correlation for acu te intestinal and urological toxicity unde r mult ivariate alysis. Discussion rapy for l ocaliz ed prost ate carcinoma is an effective treatment option in e lderly patients. This analysis demons trates that age has no sign ificant impact on radiation-induc ed inte stinal an d urological ac ute toxicity and can be safely used a s curative treatment for prost ate cancer patients ol der than 75 ye ars. 171 HYPOFRACTIONATED IG-IMRT AND ACUTE TOXICITY IN PROSTAT E CANCER: THE EXPERIENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RADIOTHERAPY SANT' ORSOLA-MALPI GHI HOSPITAL, Cammelli 1, Maria Angelini 1, Alessandro Bertaccini 2, Renz o Mazzarotto 1 Background: image -guide d radiation the rapy (IGR T) has taken a leading role in pr ostate cancer treatment, allowin g optimization of the target irradiation technique through the use of the in tensity-modulated radia tion therapy (IMRT ) supplied in a hypo regime. The en dpoint is to improve patient outcom e, both in te rms of loc al control of the di sease and in terms of re duction of radiothe rapy toxicity. Aim: The aim of this study was to provide p relim inary data of our exper ience related to gastr ointestinal (GI) an d genito urinary (GU) toxicity profiles of those patients who have completed this treatmen t. Patients and M ethods: Betwee n Octob er 2010 and February 2011, 18 pa tients affected by interm ediate- to high-risk pr ostate cancer have been treated at the Radiother apy Department of P oliclinico S. Orsola- Malpig hi of Bologna. The plac ement of three gold fiducial markers inside the prostatic g land was p lanned first by the use of ultraso und guidance, and the n, afte r two to three week s, compu ted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The total dose delivered to clinic al target was 67.5 Gy (25 frac tions of 2.7 Gy eac h). Results: Acute toxic ity was evaluate d during treatment through the use of the EORTC -RTOG toxicity grading scale with the following results. GI toxicity: 15 patients G0, 3 patients G1. GU t oxicity: 13 patients G0, 5 patients G1. Conclus ion: Although this study did not include a sufficiently meaningf ul number of patie nts, it is possible to conclude that the hypofrac tionated regime with IG-IMRT is a very we ll tole rated treatment. 172 HIGH-DOSE CURATIVE RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROS TATE CANCE R: RECTAL DOSE-VOLUME CONSTRAINTS AND ACUTE INTESTINAL TOXICITY Angelo Er rico 1, Michele Battaglia 2, Annalis a Natuno 1, Maria Paola Cilibe rti 1, Dor a Di C osmo 1, Giuse ppe Squ eo 1, Stefa S acro Cuore, Roma, Italy Aim: To assess the impact of rec tal dose-vol ume cons traint on acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in patients with non - metastatic localized and locally advanced prostate cancer treated with high-dose curative radiotherapy. Patients an d Methods: Between June 2008 and May 2010, 101 patients with prostate ca ncer received conventionally fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in our institution. For intermedi ate- and high-risk patients, total dose to the prostate ranged from 78 G y to 80 Gy (2 Gy /fraction) and total dose to the seminal vesicles ranged from 64 Gy to 70 Gy. No patient received pelvic lymph node irradiation. Lo w-risk patients (eight patients) received 80 Gy to the prostate and the base of s eminal ve sicles. The median age of the pa tients was 73 (range 51-81) years. The median PSA was 9.3 (range 0.89- 89.3) ng/ml and 31% of patients had Gleason 6, 32% of patients had GS=7 and 37% of patients had GS 8. Almo st all patients (91%) received hormonotherapy before and during radiotherapy. GI toxicity was assessed weekly according to the RTOG toxicity scale. The comp lete rectal wall, from the rectosigmoid flexure to the anal verge, was contoured as an organ at risk. An e mpty rectum (rectal volume <100cc ) was require d for both s imula tion and treatment; this condition was obtaine d by careful patie nt training. Ac cording to dose constraints used in our institution, no patient had rectal V50>55% nor V70>25%. We retros pectively re- assessed our data according to the recent constraints proposed by the ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1902 QUANT the differences i n rect al acute toxicity evaluating these cons traints at the dos e-volume histogra ms (DVH).

Whe n the recurr ence risk is essentially local, supple menta ry radiother apy is justified with the aim of improving biological recurr ence-f ree survival, lo cal control, metastasis-free survi val and spe cific and global s urvival, while respect ing pati ent quality of life. Aims : To estimate the acute toxicity in postopera tive hi- art tomotherapy for prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: Between 2009 and 2010, we treated 28 patients for localized prostate cancer to 62 Gy or 66 Gy using hi-art tomotherapy. The median age at diagnosis was 65 (range 54-77) years. The median Gleason score was 7 (range 5-9). The median PSA was 18.6 (range 1.9-35.4) ng/ml. Te n patients w ere treated with bicalutamide, four were treated with bicalutam ide + leuprore lina acetate and one was treated with leuprorelina acetate. Compute d tomography was performed for all patients for centering and to prepare a restraint system. CT was used for centering a nd radiotherapy sess ions we re conducted under conditions of full bladder and upright vacuum. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was represented from the tumor bed in 17 patients and tumor bed and the corresponding nodal stations in 11 patients with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). The planned tumor volume (PTV) was represented by the GTV + 7 mm of expansion in all directions except posteriorly by 5 mm. The daily dose was 2 Gy for fractions to the tumo r bed and 1.6 Gy for fractions to the nodal PET-positive stations. For plan validation, particular attention was paid to the doses of tolerance to the organs at risk and to the cove r of the PTV with a n isodose of at least 9 5%. Toxicity was graded according to RTOG, IIEF an d IPSS. The acute rectal and bladder toxicities were compared with those reported in the literature for patients treated with 3DCRT. Results: The incidence of late rectal toxicity RTOG grades 1, 2, and 3 was 25% (seven patients) and 7.1% (two patients) vs.15% (literature value) and 0% vs. 7% (literature value), respectively. The i ncidence o f late urinary toxicity RTOG g rade 1, 2, and 3 was 21.4% (six patients), 7.1% (two patients) vs.12% (literatur e value) and 0% vs. 6% (literature value), respectively . The urinary and rectal toxicities were higher in the group of patients whose targets also in cluded the pelvic lymph nodes. Conc lusion: Using hi-art tomother apy for adjuvant treatment in patients with prostate cancer significantly reduces not only the acute toxicity but, f rom a preliminary analysis with a follow- up to 12 months, also chronic to xicity. Based on the excellent results obta ined, the low toxicity and literatur e studies, we have begun new protocol escalation dose, largely for high-risk patients. 175 INTER-OBSERVER VARIABILITY IN THE ASSESSMENT OF HISTOLOGICAL S UBTYPE AND FUHRM AN GRADE OF RENAL TUMOR BIOPSIES : RESULTS OF A PROS PECTIVE STUDY Alessandro V olpe 1, Luis a Zegna 1, Cristina B ozzola 2, Francesco Varvello 1, Michele B illia 1, Antone lla Di Domenic o 1, Paolo De Angelis 1, Guido M onga 2 and Carlo T errone 1 1Urologia and 2Anatom ia Pat ologica, Piem Ospedale M aggio re della Car it\u00e0, Novara, Italy Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1903 Background A im: Indic ations f or perc utaneous a re increasi ng. The accur acy in the assessment of ubtype (HS ) and Fuhrman grade whe n this informa tion is used for clinical decision making. T he aim of this study was to assess the inter-observ er variability in determining HS a nd FG on RTBs performed on sur gical speci mens after radical or partial nephr ectomy. Patients and Met hods: RTBs wer e perfo rmed on surgical spe cime ns from 43 patients who under went radical or parti al nephr ectomy for a renal tumor between March 2009 and J uly 2010. The median tumor size was 50 (IQR 32-70) mm. In all cases, four cores were obtained with an 18 G au toma tic needle (two cores in the central part and two cor es in the periphe ral part of the renal mass). All cores and surg ical specime ns were analyzed b lindly ts. T he conco rdance between the pathologis ts in the assess ment of a dequ acy of the tissue to obtain a diagno sis, HS and F G w as evaluated using the Cohen 's kappa coefficien t (CKC) eithe r for central and periph eral RTBs. The results were also stratified based on tumor s ize (gr oup A <4 cm ; group B 4-7 cm and gr oup C >7 cm). Statistical analys is was performed with SPSS v. 15.0 e R v. 2.11.0. Results: Central and peripher al RTBs were defined by the two patholog ists as ad equate to obtain a diagnosis in 70-79% and 79-84% of the patie nts, r espectively. The adequacy of central biopsie s inc reased with decreasing tumor size. C KC for the concorda nce on biops y adequacy was 0.82 (very good ) for central b iopsies and 0 .91 (very good) for peripher al biopsies. All adequa te RTBs a llowed the diagnosis of HS for both pathologists. CKC for the concordance on the diagnos is of HS was 0.94 (very good) . The concordance between HS on RTB s and s urgical specimen was pe rfect in all cases. The diagno sis of FG was possible on c entral b iopsies and peripher al biopsies in 68-74% and of patients, respecti vely. CKC for the conco rdance o n FG was 0.52 (mode rate) for centr al biopsies a nd 0.63 (good) for peripher al biopsies. FG on RTB s and s urgica l specimens wa s concordant in 82% of cases. Discuss ion and Conclusion: Central RTBs appear to be les s frequently adequate for histological assessm ent tha n peripheral RTBs, esp ecially for er renal masses . The concordance betwee n pathologists in the assessme nt of HS on RTBs is very good. Det ermination of FG is easier and inter -observer c FG i s hig her for periph eral RTBs. Based on these result s, peripheral RTBs should b e favored over cent ral RTBs for histologic al diag nosis of HEXAMINOLE VULINATE: DIAGNOSTIC Opse Maggior e della C arit\u00e0, Nov ara, Italy Background: The sensitivity of white light cystoscopy (WLC) can be improved, especially for the detection of flat urothelial neoplasms. Fluorescent or blue light cystoscopy (BLC) has the potential to overc ome the limitations of WLC. Aim: The aim of this study was to compa re the diagnostic accuracy of WLC and BLC in the diagnosis of urothelial cancer and to ident ify the conditions where BLC ca n provide the highest d iagno stic advant age over WLC. Patients and Meth ods: A total of 65 patients with a suspicious prim ary or recurrent bladder tumor were enrolled in the study. Patients who had intravesical instillations in the three months before the procedure were n ot elig ible. After intravesical instillatio n of 85 mg hexami nolevulinate o ne hour before t he pro cedur e, the p atients under went WLC followed by BLC. All observed lesions were reported in a diagram, b iopsied or resected . The cor rect an d false- detectio n rates of the two techniques were compared. Data were stratified accordi ng to pathology of bladder lesions and bladder site where the lesions were observed. A subs et analysis was also performed to assess th e diagnostic accuracy of WLC and BLC in patients who had (n=34) or had not (n=31) undergone previous intravesical treatments to prevent recurrence and progression. Results: Overall, 256 bladder lesions were detected (97 with BLC only). At pathology, 219 lesions were found to be malignant, while 37 were benign. The detection rate was 67.1% for WL C (147/219) and 97.2% for BLC (213/219). The highest diagnostic advantage for BLC was observed for the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ (100% vs . 25%) and for lesions located at the bladder dome (100% vs . 53%). The false-detection rate Overall, in 24/65 patients (36.9%), BLC allowed the diagnosis of at least one carcinoma in situ , dysplastic or papillary lesion that would have otherwise been missed at WLC. The subset analysis showed that the detection rate of BLC did not decrease in patients who had undergone previous endovesical treatmen t (97.6% vs . 98.3%), and also that false-detection rate did not increase (14.3% vs . 14.2%). Discussion and Conclusion: BLC is a promising technique that has a significantly higher detection rate than WLC. The high diagnostic advantage with BLC can be obtained for the diagnosis of carcin oma in situ and of lesio ns located at the bladder dome. The detection rate of BLC does not decrease in patients who have undergone previous endovesical treatment when the last instillation is not performed in the three months before the procedure. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1904 177 RENAL CELL CARCINOM A WITH Xp11 TRANSLOCATION AND IMMUNOHI STOCHEMICAL CATHEPSIN Vicentino, Vicenza , ground: Renal slocation involving X p11 (Xp11-RCC ) has recen tly been i ncluded as a separate entity in the new version of the WHO c lassification of kidney tumor s (2004) . Thi s rare var iant is characteri zed by different chromos omal t ranslocat ions involving Xp11 and results in a gene fusion (1). The co rrelat ion betw een translocation s ubtype and t umor behavior is s till unclear. Xp11 RCC frequently affects chi ldren an d yo ung ad ults but rare cases of patient s ove r 40 years o ld have been recently reporte d. The diagnos is w as bas ed on morpholog ical fi ndings, transcription factor E 3 (TFE3) s taining and c ytogenetic . Recent studies sh owed that TFE3 mediates the of cath an d it prob ably has the same effect in Xp11 trans location car cinomas (2). Case Repor t: We here report the cas e of an Xp11 translocati on carcin oma in a 28 - year-old man who present ed with macrosco pic h emat uria in Augu st 2008, without sign ificant medical history. A computed tomography scan showed a 9\u00d77 cm solid ren al m ass, suspicious for malignan cy, with massive rig ht rena l vein thrombosis the unde r adical right nephrectomy with ven ous thrombectomy in Sept ember 2008. Th e p athological examina tion s howed a ren al carcin oma wit h mixed clear cell, papil lary and solid patterns containing areas of he morrhage a nd necrosis. Features of a ggressiveness, su ch as periren al fibroad ipous tissue were obs erved. Immuno histochem istry sh owed th at the neoplastic cells were stron gly and diffusely positive for TFE3 and CD1 0 but had a weak s taining for cytokera tin. S taining for CD13 was negati ve. Moreo ver, tissue s trong rearran gement of the TFE3 gene located o n the sho rt arm of chr omosome X. O n the basis o f the cli nical, microscopic, immunohisto chemi cal an d genetic ex aminati ons, this case was classified as X p11 translocatio n RCC. A fter nephrectomy, in December 2008, the patient recei ved s unitinib as adjuvant treatment, and there was no measurable disease until October 2009, when he had a relap se involving bone, liver and renal cavity. In Ju ne 20 10, the pati ent un derw ent a D 7-D9 decompressive laminectomy for the appearance of neurological symptoms. In August 2010, the pa tient started RA D001/ everolimus therapy, but after three months exper ience d disease progression . From Decem ber 2010 to dat e, the pati ent is und er treatment with 400 mg of sorafenib b.i.d. Discussion: We observed a rare case of juvenile Xp1 1-RCC confirmed by morphological, immunohistochemical and cy togenetic analyses. The immu nohistochemical analyses t umor samples showed a strong cytoplasmic cathepsin-K staining. As recent ly reported, catheps in-K is selectiv ely ex pressed in over 75% of cases of Xp11 RCC, whereas common renal cell neoplasm subtypes are negative for this marker (2). In Xp11 RCC, cathepsin-K is a highly specific marker bu t not completely sensitive. Nevertheless, not all TFE3-positive carcinomas express cathepsin-K; this is likely due to the presence of different translocations involving c hromosome Xp11 (2). The expression of cathepsin- K in Xp11 RCC may not only be a marker useful in differential diagnosis bu t also a possible therapeutic target. Unlike other published case reports (3, 4) , we observed only a minima l response to tyrosi ne kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. The molecular pathways activated in Xp11 RCC are different from those involved in the common RCC subtypes. For th is reaso n, standard ther apeut agents such as tyrosine kinase inh ibitors and mTOR inhibitors may be less effective in Xp1 1 RCC. This molecular pattern may represen t the rational e for a therapeut ic ap proach using a selective inhibitor of cathep sin-K. 1 Komai K et al : Adult Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma diagnosed by cytogenetics and immun ohistochemistry.

A t the Ra diotherapy Department of S.M. Goretti Hospital in La tina we ha ve be en using the risk grouping system ad opted by the Na tional Comprehensive Can cer Net work (NCC N) v.1.2008, to retrosp ectively review the records of the patien ts. W e report our results. Patie nts and M ethods: From January 2002 to June 2008, 267 patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (cT1- 3N0M 0) were re ferred to the R adiother apy Departme nt of the S.M. Goretti Hospital. Out of 267 patients, 200 were considere d evaluable for clinica l outcome a nd toxic ity re port. Acco rding to NCCN v.1.2008, patients were stratified into groups of low risk (LR): PSA <1 0 ng/ml and GS<6 k (IR): PSA 20 ng/ml or GS 7 or clinical T-stage 2b-2c; high risk (HR ): >20 ng/ml or GS 8-10 or clinical T-stage 3a. The treatment consisted of a cours e of 3DC RT to the prosta te (low risk) or prostate and seminal vesicles (intermediate and high risk, respectively) . A total dose of 76 Gy in 38 daily f ractions was delivered. A co urse of neoad juvant hormone therapy (monthly LHR H an alog plus bicalutamide 50 mg/day) was administered to 98% of patients , with the intent of achie ving a reduction in the prostate volume and allowing a more tolerable treatment regime . High-r isk patie nts received c oncomitant and adjuva nt hormone therapy, lasting a median of two years (range 2-76 months). From J anuary 2002 to Novemb er 2005, a 5-field 3DC RT technique was emp loyed for the first one hundred patients (gr oup 1). From D ecember 2005 on, a 7-field 3D CRT technique was used (group 2). Patient characteristics are reporte d in T able I. Table I. Variable 5-Fie ld 3DCRT 7-Field 3DCRT Median age, years IR 15% HR 63 % We report acute and late rectal and urina ry toxic ity ac cording . To state rectal toxicity, we recorde d the dose to a volume of rectal wall (V40, V50, V60, V 70, V72) for each patient. Overall and cancer-specific survival were also analyzed. Biochemical relapse was defined according to the ASTRO-Phoenix criterion. Results: All patients received the prescribed radiation dose. No G3 acute rectal or urinary toxicity was observed. G3 late rectal toxicity rates wer e as follows: 19% in group 1 (5-field 3DC RT) group 2 (7-field 3DCR T), p= 0.001. Sev ere rectal bleeding was submitted to ar gon pla sma coagula tion or hyperba ric oxygen thera py and a ll patie nts except one were manage d medic ally. No patient was considered to be in need of surgical removal of the rectal ulcer. No correlation was found betwee n dose- volume parameters (V40, V50, V60, V70, V72) for rectal wall volume a nd the ons et of late re ctal toxic ity.

Four years ago, we started a prospective feasibility study of IORT during radical prostatectomy (RP) for locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report data on morbidity , toxic ity (R TOG scoring c riteria), functional and oncologic outcomes of our prospective series. Patients and Methods: From Sep tember 2005, 72 patients with locally advanced PCa were treated with IORT during RP. A total of 67 patients had follow up 6 months . Inclusion crite ria were : age <75 years (Kattan's nomograms) and no inflamma tory bo wel disease. During surgery, the prostate was exposed with dissection of endopelvic fascia and pubo- prostatic ligaments. The distance betwee n the prostate and rectum wa s mea sured wi th ultrasound. A col limato r (Mobetron, Intraop, California, U.S.A.) with a m edian diamete r of 5.5 (range 4.5-7) cm a nd an angle 'bevel' of 15- 30 was introduc ed into the surgic al field a nd a dose of 10-12 Gy with 9-12 MeV wa s delivered. The dose was prescribed to a 90% isodose. The volume treated included prostate, seminal vesicles and periprostatic area. RP was then comp leted and an extended lymphadenectomy was performed. P ostoperative RT treatment three mo nths after IORT , based on histological findings, was planned for 38/44 patients. A 3D co nformal technique was used and a dose of 50 Gy (2 Gy /day) was delivered. Hormonal therapy (HT) was prescribed when indicated. Results: The med ian patient age was 67.2 (IQR 62.3-73.0, min-max 51-75) years and Gleason score ranged 4 to 9. A total of 23 patients (35%) received neoadjuvant treatment. The majority of patients had clinically locally advanced PCa (78%). We observed no intra- or perioperativ e complications. The median dose absorbed by the rectum w as 4.6 (range: 0.4-9.1) T3 in 40 patients and T4 in 5 patients. Positive lymph nodes were detected in 17 pa tients (25.7%) and positive surgical ma rgins (PSM) in 41 patients (61%). A total of 56 patients (85%) underwent postoperative RT t reatment, with a median follow-up of 24 months (6-46). Rectal and ur inary RT toxicity a re de tailed in Table I, according to the RT OG s cale. Table I.

The mean hospital s tay was 5 (ra nge 4-8) days. At la st follow-up, all patients were ali ve. Discu ssion and Conclusion: IORT during RP repr esents a safe procedure, with acceptable surgical time and minimal toxicity f or patients with locally advanc ed PCa. A larger ser ies and a longer follow-up are needed to conf irm the se findings and to assess long-term side- effects and biochemical control. 181 MALIGNANT HISTIOCYTOM A OF THE P ENIS: A CASE REPORT Fabio Ner i is an extremely rare tumor, wit h only 5% of penile tumors being mesenchymal tumor s. We pre sent he re a four- year follow-up of a patient af fected by prima ry mal ignant fibrous histiocytoma of the pen is. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publis hed report of such a case. Case Report: An uncircum cised 64-ye ar-old male presented in April 2007 with a 4-cm solid lesion on th nosum ). There w as no histor y of sexually transmitted disease, constitutional s ymptoms or dysuria. P hysical examination reve aled inguinal r egion. Ing uinal ult did not nodes edle biopsy r evealed ma lignant mesenchymal tumor. Thi s case was trea ted surgically with total pene ctomy. Histopathological exami the tumor was a malig nant histiocyt oma, with negative surgical margins. Immunohistochemic al stains we re posit ive for vimentin and for s and Conclusion: At the 4-ye ar follow-up, the patient was in very good con dition, withou t local or distant metas tasis, and with norma l uroflowme try is nor mal He has, however, developed a depr essive syndrome mainly re lated to the absence of a penis. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is rarely reported in the literature and primary involvement of the genitourina ry tra ct is very rare. Because of the rarity of such tumors , there is no agreement conce rning the best method for staging and manageme nt of thes e patients. 1 Parsons MA and Fox M: Malignant fibrous histiocyto ma of the pe nis.

Patients and Methods: From November 2004 to September 2010, 103 patients affected by localized prostate cancer underwent HIFU following TURP. In 39 patie nts, both proce dures were performed in the same session (Group A); in 64 patients, HIFU was delayed (Group B). Follow-up included serial PSA measurements and prostate biopsies 6 months after treatment for all patients. Biochemical recurrence was defined as PSA nadir + 2 ng/ml (ASTRO 2 005 criteria). We evaluated complication rates in Groups A and B.

T herapeutic alter natives inc lude a ctive surveillance, adjuv ant RT an d hormonal therapy. The ai m of our study w as to r eview the results of postope rative RT in patie nts who had underg one radical prostate ctomy. Patie nts and M ethods : Clinical rec ords of 283 consec utive pa tients who had undergone ant RT af ter prostate ctomy between Janua ry 199 9 and Decembe r 2008 we re review ed. P atien ts treated with s alvage RT f or bioc hemic al relapse w ere not inclu ded in this analysi s. RT w as planne d on 5-m m-thic k spiral C T slices w ith p atients in supine position. A 3D conform al technique was used with four indi vidually shaped fields including the prosta tic be d and the space of the seminal vesicles in 232 pat ients and the pelvis plus p rostatic bed in 50 patients. The median radiation dose was 66 (range, 45 -70) Gy to the prostatic bed and 45 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes. Biochemical failure was defined as any increase in the PSA level greater than the pre-RT PSA level in two consecutive PSA me asurement s. Acu te and late toxicity wer e scored according to the RT OG s cale. Results: The me dian age, preoperative PSA and Gle ason score were: 66.7 (ra nge, 44-76) years, 17.91 (range, 1.7-399.0) ng/ml an d 6.6 (range, 4-9), respectively. The patients were divided into pre operati ve risk categories acc ording to NCC N cr iteria, as follows: 102 patien ts had low risk, 92 patie nts had i nterm ediate risk and 88 patients had high risk. Pre-surgery hormone therapy was administ ered in 55 patients (20.1%). Radical prostatectomy was performed in 168 patients, while radical prostatectomy plus regional lymph node dissection was performed in 114 patients. Fou r patients underwent a laparoscopic approach. Pathologic tumor s was pT2 in ) (71.9%) had positive s urgical marg ins. Median postoperati ve Gleas on score and PSA we re: 7 (range, 4-10) and 0.066 (range, 0.0-20.0) ng/ml, respectively. Adjuvant hormone therapy was prescribed in 150 patients (53%). Follow-up ranged from 6 to 118 mon ths. Acute genitourinary toxicity was : grade 1 in 58 patients (20.5%), grade 2 in 27 patients (9.5%) and grade 4 in 9 patients (3.2%); no patient reported grade 3 toxicity. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was : grade 1 in 81 patients (28.7%), grade 2 in 30 patients (10.6%) and grade 3 in 2 patients (0.7%). Late genitourinary toxicity was : grade 1 in 35 patients (12.4%), grade 2 in 7 patients (2.4% ) and gra de 3 in 2 Late gastr ointes tinal to 1 in 9 p atients (3.2%), grade 2 in 7 patients (2.5% ) and gra de 3 in 2 pa tients (0.7%). Median PSA at the last follow-up was 0.02 ng/ml. Disease- free surviv al rate s at 2, 5 a nd 8 ye ars were: 90, 76 and 62% , respectively. Overall survi val rates at 2, 5 and 8 years were: 97, 90 and 79%, respectively. Sixteen patients (5.6%) experienced both biochemical and clinical progression: 15 presented bone metastasis and 1 lumbo-aortic lymph node metastass. Discussion and Conclusion: In this retrospective single-institution study, patients at high risk of disease recurrence after radical prostatecto my benefited from adjuvant radiothe rapy, with a ccepta ble ac ute a nd late toxic ity. 184 LAPAROSCOPI C RESOLUTION OF COMPLICATIONS NG Salerno, Italy Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy been undergoing contin uous refinements which have m ade it a feasible and reprod ucible operation. Nevertheless, intra operative complica tions often necessita te convers ion to ope n surge ry. Howev er, it is possible to repair rectal and v ascula r injur ies with out conversion during pre-peritoneal radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods: Two e xamples of LP PRP are descr ibed. In the first case, because of strong adhesion between the prostate and the rectum, injury of the anterior rectal wa ll occurre d. After c utting Santori ni's plexus and urethra , the prostate was place d in an endobag. The rectal lesion wa s repaired with Vicryl\u00b1 s utures. A sponge of Tachos il\u00b1 was applie d to using a lapar oscopic dedica ted devic e. In the second case, a lesion of the r ight exter nal ilia c vein occurre d during the removal of a needle fro m the abdominal cavity. The vein was isolated and clamp ed by a s elf-made tournique t. The lesion was repaired with a Prolene sut ure. A Sur gicel \u00b1 she et was applied to the vein. Bladder-neck b iopsy and water-tight urethrovesical anastomosis with double r unning s uture, as described by van Velthoven, were performed. Results: In both c ases, th e laparoscopic s urgical pr ocedure was performed witho ut any major consequences. Conclusion: LPPRP is a feasible and reproduci ble technique that may be subject to intra operative complications requiring c onve rsion to ope n su rgery. Nevertheless, i t is possible to re solve major complications, such as rect al and v ascular injuries, without conversion to open surgery. 185 BILATERAL LAPAROENDOS COPIC SINGLE-SITE SURGERY: FIRST TWO CASES Pietrelcina, Vasto (CH), Italy Background: Since copic singl e-site s urgery ( LESS) have been per formed in ou r institution, especially ne phrectomy, partial n ephrectom y and adrenalectomy. We dem onstra ted, in agreement with published literatur e, that L ESS surger y is safe and offers minimal scarring, as well as reduc ed postoperative pain and quick recove ry. H ere, w e present the first two c ases of bilateral LESS performed in our institution. With this repo rt, we propose LESS as the technique of choice f or surge ons with lapar oscopic skills, being able to reduce pain and the num ber of scars, especially in the case of bilateral surge ry. Patients and Methods: The first case was a non-s imultaneo us bilateral LESS adrenalectomy performe d in a 61-year-old ma n affected by lung cance r with a 6-cm non- functioning adren al mass in each adrenal . The first surgical procedure was left adrenalectomy. The second procedure was performed one mont h after the first. The patient had a BMI of 27.8 kg/m 2, ASA score of 3 and preoperative Hb level of 13 g/dl. We performed a transperitoneal h with subcostal insertion of a Triport\u00b1. The patien t was in the flank position and we used s tandard straight (non-articulatin g) 5/10- mm devices without additional port. Operating time was 150 min, estimated blood loss (EBL) wa s 50 ml , length of stay (LOS) was 4 days, visual analog scale (V AS) score was 2 in the first postop erative day (POD) for the first procedure. W e recor ded an operati ng time of 110 min, with an EBL of 10 ml, LOS of 3 day s and V AS score of 2 i n the first POD f or the second procedure; no intra- or perioperative complications were observed. The skin incision was 3 cm for the first and 3.5 cm for the secon d procedur e and the patien t was satisf ied with the scar. The second c ase we describe in this report was a non- simultan eous bilat eral LESS partial neph 50-year- old man affected by RCC (T1a) in each kidney, without comorbidity. The seco nd surgical p rocedure was performed 6 months after the first. The patient had a BMI of 27 kg/m 2, ASA score of 2 and preoperative Hb level of 16 g/dl. Firstly, the tumor in the left kidney was extirpated. We performed a transperitoneal approach with pararectal ins ertion of a Triport\u00b1 on th e left an d an X -cone (Karl Sto rz) o n the ri ght. The patient wa s in the flank pos ition and we used standard straight (non-articulating) 5/10-mm devices without addi tional port on the right side. On t he left side, we used two 5-mm additiona l port s for suturing the parenchyma l defect. For the left procedure, ope rating time was 160 mi n, with an EBL o f 550 ml, LOS of 3 days and V AS scor e of 3 in the first PO D. On the right-side surgery, we rec orded an operat ing time of 110 min, with an EBL of 80 ml, LOS of 2 days and V AS score of 1in the first POD. No intra- or perioperative complications occur red. Tumor size was 4 .3 an d 2.2 cm on the lef t and right sides, respectively, with negative surgical margins. The skin incision was 3.5 cm for each procedure and the patient was very satisfied with his scar. Results and Concl usion: Bilateral surgery is rarely require d but we sugge st that in these cases, more than a unilateral approach, a surgeon with laparoscopic experience shoul d consider the use of a technique that seems to offer advant ages in terms of cosm etics, decr eased port-site complications and decreased postoperative pain and hospital stay. Although LESS has some disadvantages, such as diffic ulty in instrument angulat ion and movem ent, especially in bilateral surgery, it should be considered as a n ew surgical strat egy. 1 Cindolo L, Berardinelli F, Gidaro F, Tamburro FR and Schips L: Assessing feasibility and safety of laparoe ndoscopic single- site surgery adrenalectomy: initial experience.

Case Report: The pa tient, wh o had a histor y of previous nephrolithotomy 30 years previously with subseq uent percutaneous nephrolitotom y and ESWL, presented with flank Abdominal ultras ound and CT scan were su ggestive of a malignant renal mass of the upper pole of the right kidney . A right transperitoneal lapar oscopic radical nephre ctom y wa s planned. After performin g a renal biopsy, we noticed a gauze oozing out from the lesion. C onsequent ly, we decided to perfor m a par tial neph rectomy. T he renal vessels wer e carefully dis sected and isolat ed; man nitol was given intravenously befo re pedi cle clamp ing. The renal artery and vein were clamped with a self-made tour niquet. The lesion was excised L igasur e\u00b1. Renal parenchyma was with Vicryl\u00b1 sutures, se cured with Hem- O-lock clips\u00b1. The vein and the artery were unclampe d. The le sion was extracted in Endobag. Af ter checking the peritone al cavity, a drain was placed into the abdomen. No pe rioper ative complic ations occurr ed and the patient was disc harged on day 4.

Many conservative treatments have been proposed. Bladder wall thermochemotherap y seems to be an intere sting treatment option. UniThe rmia is a new device that provides bladder wall thermochemotherapy with uniform hyperthermia (44.5C) all over the bladder with a high flow of a heated mitomyc in C (MMC) solution. The a im of this study was to evaluate drug stability, pharmacokinetics, tolerability and activity of this technique. Patients and Met hods: A total of 28 patients with BCG-refractory NMI BC (intermediate and high ris k) were treate d with a cour se of six instillations after trans urethral r esection of bla dder tumor ( TURBT ): one early single and five week ly instillations. The drug solution wa s complete ly re place d at the halfw ay point of each instillation. After the treatment, patients underwent cystoscop y every three months for the first year and every six mon ths afterwards. Results: There was a significant loss of MMC in the first ha lf of ins tillation, while in the second half, most of the drug wa s retrieved. This observatio n suggests that there was a significant absorption of MMC during the first half of instillation which was min imal in the s econd hal f. Plasmat ic Cmax was considera bly than the ted thre shold conce ntration for toxicity (400 ng/ml). Most side-effects were not beyond grade II, showin g a good safety profile.

T he hi ghest AUC of PSA kinetics was for PSA acce leration, c alculated within 3 to 4 years ( 731 to 1,460 d ays) before the last measurement. Conclusion: Three or more PSA me asure ments within 3 to 4 years (731 to 1,460 days) befo re the last meas uremen t enabled more accur ate cal culation of PSA acc eleration than measurement within 1 to 2 years (0 to 730 da ys). 190 ACUTE TOXICITY IN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS TREATED WITH HYPOFRACTI ONATED INTENSITY-MODUL ATED RADIO Mearini 3, Claudio ucchetti radiothe (IMR using inverse treatment planning an d dose-volume const raints for norma l tiss ues allows the delivery of highly con formal radiother apy (R T) and has the pote ntial to re duce toxicity by limiti ng the radiatio n dose given to the rectum and bladder. The ai m of this study was to assess the toxicity resu lting from hypofractionat ed IM RT in prostate cancer patients. Patients and Methods: Between Ma y 2009 and January 20 11, 37 consecuti ve patients wit h prostatic adenocarci noma underwent IMRT. Patient char acterist ics were as follows : median age 74 (rang e: 66-83) years; stag e: T1N0 in 22 9.45% 3 patients (8.10% n 1 score: 2-6 in 23 pa tients (62.16%), 7 in 11 patients (29.72%) and 8- 10 in 3 p atients (8.1%) . The med ian basal PSA w as 7.6 (r ange: 5.3 4-19.21) ng/m l. Twent y patients (54.05%) received hormon al therapy because of high-risk features; the ther apy isted IMRT was ered with 15 M V photons using a five-field technique. The tar get volume included the prosta te in 23 patie nts (62.16%), prostate and semina l vesicles (SV) in 14 patients (37.83%) o n the basis o f the risk of inv olvement or direct invol vement of SV. Planning target vo lume (PTV) consist ed of the clinical tar get volume ( CTV) plus 1 cm in a ll directions except f or the p rostate fossa-re ctal inte rface where a 0.5-cm margin was added. The prescribed dose to prostate \u00b1SV w as 7 4.25 Gy in 33 fractions at 2.25 Gy/fraction, equivalent to 78 Gy in 2-Gy fractions ; SV received 62 Gy in 33 fractions at 1.879 Gy /fraction using a simultaneous integrated boost when the risk of involvement was >15% . The median prostate vol ume w as 42. 99 (range 22. 573-105.65) cm 3. Acute toxicity was scored using the Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adv erse Ev 3.0. Biochemical failure was defined acco rding to the Phoenix definition (PSA level at least 2 g/l greater than the PSA nadir after RT). Results: The median follo w-up tim e was 7.7 (range: 0.8-18.5) months. The median pre- RT an d post-RT PSA levels were 8.17 (range: 0.11-15.65) ng/ml and 1.2 (range: 0.08-10.35) ng/ml, respectively. time of data analysis, 34/37 patie nts (91.89%) were alive without disea se, while the remai ning 3 patients (8.1%) were alive with toxicitie s, mainly urgency , ana l pain and increased frequency, were observed in 11 patients (29.7%): G1 in 9 (24.3%) and G2 in 2 patients (5.4%). There was no G3 or G4 acute toxicity. Acute genitourinary (GU) toxicities, mainly nic turia, uria, urgency a nd fre quency of urina were observed in 15 (40.5% ), Conclusion: Hypofractionated IMRT delivered wi th simultaneous integrated boost is safe, with acceptable acute GI and GU toxicity rates. A longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate recurrenc e rate and la te toxicity. 191 A NEURO-FUZZY SYSTEM FOR DIAGNOSIS OF HIGH-GRADE PROSTA TE CANCE and neural networks are complemen tary tec hnologies in the design of ada ptive intelligent s ystem. An a rtificial ne ural network ( ANN) le arns from scratch by adjusting the interconnections between laye rs. A neuro-fuzzy system is simply a fuzzy inference system trained by a neural network-learning algorithm . The aim of this work was to develop a neuro-fuzzy system for the selected diagnos is of high-gra de pr ostate cancer (Gleason score 7-10). Patients and Met hods: We retrospectively reviewed 1,280 patients who unde rwent prostate biops y. All men had a PSA level of less th an 20 ng/ml. O f the 1,280 men, 469 (36.6% ) had prostate cancer. A ne uro-fuzzy system was developed using a coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system mo del. The ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1912 model w as composed of an input laye r with f our neur ons (PSA , percent free PSA, PSA de nsity a nd age ) and an output neuro n repres enting th e outp ut value of the pre dictor. The cases were randomly divided into a training test group (800 cases) and a v alidation g roup (480 case s). Results: In the valid ation group, the mean area under the recei ver operatin g character istic curve for the ne uro-f uzzy syste m s 0.777. pairwise compar ison of the ar ea under the curve evidenced differe nces among PSA, per cent free PSA and PSA density in the ne uro-f uzzy system. Conclusion: This study pres ented a neuro syste m based on both se rum data ( total PS A, percent free PSA and PSA de nsity) and clinical data ( age) for the sele cted diagnosis of high-gr Ther e uvant radio (RT) reduc es the ri sk of biochemical and/or local r elaps e in patients with pT3 diseas e and/or po sitive marg ins and undetectabl e PSA values. The aim of this study was to evaluate treatment outcome and toxicity of hi gh dose (66-70 Gy) conformal RT after radical prostatecto my (RP). Patients and M ethods: Between A ugust 1998 and D ecemb er 2007, 182 con secutive patients with po sitive res ection 65 (rang ts in 17 pat ients (9. 5%) ; 136 patients (75 %) h ad surgi cal margins involved by dise ase; Gleason score: 2-6 42 79 patients (33.5%) and 8-10 i n 61 patie nts (43.5% ). The med ian pre- an d postoperat ive PSA levels were 9.45 (range: 0.57-108) (rang e: 0.00-4. 67) ng/ml, vely. The median time from surgery to ra diotherapy was 5. 3 (range: 1.2-8.8) months . A total of 110 patients (60.5% ) rec eived hormonal therapy be cause of high- risk featur es, consisting of LHRH analog or an ti- androgen. RT was deliv ered with 15-18 M V photo ns to the tumor bed using a three- or four -field conformal te chnique, within 3 to 6 months from su rgery. The prescribed me dian dose to the prosta te bed was 66.6 (range: 5 0-70) Gy. Results: Med ian follow-up ge: 17.26-140.66) months. Bioche mical relapse occurred in edian of 23.55 onths. The probability biochemical relapse-free survival was 90% at 3 years, 80% at 5 years and 70% at 10 years. Locor egional relapse occurred in only 4 patients (2.2% ) at a median tim e of 35.7 (range: 28 .66-39.56) m onths. The probability of locoregional relapse-free survival was 100% at 3 years, 90% at 5 years and 90% at 10 years. Distant metastasis developed in 16 patients (8.8%) at a m edian of 38.38 months (range: 4.6-83.9). The probability of distant metastasis-free survival was 95% at 3 years, 90% at 5 years and 85% at 10 years. At the time of data analysis, 128/ 182 p atients (70.3%) were alive without disease, 41 patients (22.6%) were al ive w ith biochemical relapse or locoregional rrence o r distan t metastasis, 4 patients (2.2%) h ad died of disease progression, 3 patients (1.6%) had died of a second cancer and 6 patients (3.3%) had died of other causes. The probability of overall survival was 95% at 3 years, 90% at 5 years and 80% at 10 years. In univariate an alysis, T st age and preoperative and pre-RT PSA were significant factors of biochemical relapse and pre-RT PSA was a significant predictor of d istant metastasi s. In multivariate analysis, ris k factors for biochemical relapse were T stage, preoperative and pre-RT PSA, and horm one therapy given for 402 da ys or more, w hile pre-RT PSA was the only independent predictor of distan t metastasi s. Due to the few observed events, no correlation was found bet ween locoregion al relapse and any of the risk facto rs indicated above. None of the above indicated risk factors was significant for overall survival in either univariat e or multivariate a nalysis. A cute g enitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities we re observed in 72 (39.6%) and 91 (50%) p atients, respectively, while late toxicities occurred in 28 in patients with high-risk pathological features is associated with a low risk of biochemical and local recu rrence, achieving minimal morbidity. 193 CRITICAL RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION OF THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR B RACHYTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH LOW-RISK PROSTA TE CANCER Claudio Giberti Fabriz Gaeta no Ninotta C di Ana tomia Ospe dale S an Pa olo, Savona , Italy Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1913 Background: The treatmen t of low-risk prostate cancer is still open to debate in the published literature and several options can be proposed to patients. In our institute, pat ients with low-risk pro state can cer are usually treated with retropubic pr ostat ectomy (RRP), brachytherapy (BT) the patient's charac teristics and prefer ence. Th e aim of this study was to assess the predictiv e value o f the mai n preoperative criteria for the diagnosis of low-ri sk pros tate cancer, by comparison with the definiti ve pa thological param eters assessed after RRP a R ALP, in order t o revi se critica lly the role of BT in th is gr oup of patient s. Patients and Met hods : In the perio d between 1996 and 2 010, 748 open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomies were carri ed in our institute. Amon g them, 215 proced ures were d ue to low-risk prostate cancer accord ing to AU A criteria, namely PSA 10 ng/ml, cli nical stage T1c <7 . All pathological specimens from these cases were revised by the same expert pathologist in order to avoi d any stat istical bias related to different classif ication criteria aft er such a long per iod of time. After this retrospectiv e revision, 109 pat ients (mean age: 6 4.3 years ) were con firmed to be affected by low-risk prostate cancer (mean PSA : 7 ng/ml, mean Gleason score: 5.7). The preoperati ve par ameter s related to thes e patients were compare d with those shown at the definitive pathologic al reports, namely Gleason score, T stage, grad ing, per ineur al invasion an d positive surgical margin rate. Results: At the defini tive pathological reports, and 31/109 (28 pT 2 and pT3 respecti vely. With regard t o grading, s, postop downgradi invasion, wh ile 10/10 9 (9.1%) pT 2 patients had po sitive surgical margins. Conclu sion: The assessment of extracapsular extension and high er Gleas on s cores i n 28.4% and 42.9 % of patien ts, respectively, at the d efinitive pathological repo trated pr eoperati ve un derstaging and undergrading. This data, which is already re ported in l iterature, suggest the need for critical evaluat ion of the role of conservative treatm ents, such as BT, i n the management of low-risk prostate cancer patients. 1 Bresee J, Spuma P, Lipsky M et al : What is t he 'true' incid ence of activ e surv eillance in undergo ing robot-assisted prostatectomy?

T o eval uate the clinical importance of percentage free PSA kinetics prior to 12-core prostate biopsy, we compared longitudinal percentage free PSA in prostate cancer patients and in controls. Patients and Methods: A prospective, Institutional Review Board- approved database of 2,208 12-core prostate biopsies performed in our institution from Fe bruary 2002 to January 2009 was search ed for patients with four or more total and free PSA measurements performed in one or more years before biopsy. The slope of percentage of fre e PSA over time was calculated with linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 256 men entered the study. Seventy-nine (30.8%) cancer cases were found at ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. The med ian PSA bef ore the biopsy was 7.05 (ran ge: 1.4-52.7) ng/ml, the median age was 62 (range: 36-84) years. The median percentage free PSA was 1 6.67% (ra nge: 1.48- 50.7%). The median PSA density was 0.14 (range: 0.03- 0.99). The median PSA doubling time (PSADT) was 4.49 (range: 2.1-5.54) months. The median percentage free PSA slope was -0.45 for prostate cancer patients and 0.28 for controls ( p< 0.001). On univariate and multivariate analyses, percent age free PSA, the slope of the natural logari thm of PSA and percentage free PSA slope showed a significant ability to predict the outcome of a 12-core prostate b iopsy. At ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of PSA was 0.555 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.492-0.617) and the AUC for percentage free PSA slope wa s 0.659 (95% CI=0.597-0.717) with a statistically significant difference (p= 0.041) between prostate cancer patients and controls. A value of percentage free PSA slope equal to zero corresponded to a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 60%. Conclusion: We fo und that percentage free PSA slope is an independent predictor of prostate cancer at 12-core prostate biopsy.

Case Rep ort: A 66-y ear-old female patient, affected by a small (3 cm) exophytic tumor, localized in the medium part of the l eft kidney , unde rwent ro bot-assisted renal tumor ectomy in our institute using the Da Vinci surgical robo t. The patient was pla ced in t he flank position. T he access was contro lled b y a 12-mm camera port, 2 cm from the umbilic us on the le ft pa rarectal line a nd two 8-mm robo tic tr ocars, introduce d on the left midaxillary line in a C co nfigur ation. A fourth trocar was introduced during the proce dure. After incisio n of the left paracolic gutter and exposure of the rena l lod ge, the left renal vein and artery were isolated. Gerota' s fascia was then incised, with complete is olation of th e tumor, and the renal cap sule was scored in order to d esign the margin of tumor dis section. The renal artery was cla mped with a bull-dog c lamp and cold dissection of the tum or was performed during warm ischemia. Af ter removi ng fibrin sealant patch (Tacho sil) was put into the inner def ect and then r enor rhaphy wa s per formed using Vycril 2/0 sliding c lips. The bull-dog clam p was removed after 13 min of war m ischemia a nd Gerota's fa scia was sutured. The speci men w as retriev ed into the endobag through the camera port. The operat ive time was 120 min. Blood loss was mi nimal. Result s: No peri- or postoperative complications occurr ed. The patient was discha rged on the fourth d ay after surgery . Pathological examinatio n reported pTaG1 ren al cell cancer. Follow-up was regul ar. Conclusion: The D a Vinci surgical robot significantly helps the surgeon duri ng the tumor dissection and the suture of renal parenchyma, shorte ning the wa and asier technique. 1 Benw ay B M, Bhayani S, Rogers C et al : Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: an international e xperience.

Patients and Metho ds: Between November 2007 and Decemb er 2009, 29 patients with localized prostate cancer wer e selected for this compa rative study a t the Ope rative Unit of Radiot herapy of V . Fazz i implemen tation o f dynamic-arc-IMRT wi th No moStat System for serial tomotherapy. Clinical target volume (CTV) 1, CTV- 1, inclu ded the prostate an d the seminal vesicles, while CTV-2 included the prostate and the base of the semina l vesicles. T o obtain planning ta rget volume (P TV) 1, PTV-1, the CTV- 1 was expanded with a 10-mm margin in all directions except for the posterior direction, where the margin was limited to 6-7 mm. A 3D margin of 6 mm was added to the CTV- 2 resulting in the PTV-2. Thirteen patients were treated with standard 3D- CRT to 60 Gy to PTV- 1, plus a seq uential boost to PTV- 2 with conventional fractionation (2 Gy/fraction in 38 fractions). In sixteen patients, IMRT t reatme nt plans wer e designed to deliver 66.5 Gy (1.9 Gy/fraction) to the seminal vesicles while simultaneously delivering 78.5 Gy 2.24 Gy/fraction) to the prostate in 35 fract ions, using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. The bladder, rectum and femora l heads were delineate d as organs a t risk ( OAR). OAR dosimetry evaluation was based on dose-volume histograms. Association of these dose paramet ers with acute and late toxicity was performed. Side-effects were classified according to the RTOG scale for acute and late gastrointe stinal (GI) a nd genitourinary (GU) toxicity. Additional symptoms, such as rectal blood loss, urgency, incontinence and erectile dysfunction we re investigate d. Results: Avera ge values of the volume t hat received at least 95% of the prescription dose (V95), target volume coverage by 100% of the prescr iption dose (V100%) and conformity index the PTV 97.8% and 0.9 in SIB-IM RT and 95%, 68.8% and 0.65 in 3D-CRT, respectively. The mean dose to the bladder was 38.8 (ra nge, 34-55) Gy and 26.8 CRT and IMRT, respectively, with an applied dose limit of Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1915 V50<3 T vo lume of the rectum r 70 Gy or more (V70) was 18% in SIB-IM RT and 33% in 3D-CRT, wit h an applied dose limit of V45<30%. The mea n dos e to the femur with S IB-IMRT was approx imately 30% lower than that obtained with 3D- CRT. The most comm on acute grade 2 events were cystitis ( 23 vs. 36.7%) an d urinary urgency/ 26.7%) CRT g roups, r espectively . Only one c ase o f grade 3 rectal bleedin g was observed in t he 3D-C RT treatment. At a median follow-u p of 12 months , late t oxicity was u ncommon in the SIB-IMR T group w ith only two pa tients with ur inary urgency vs. five patients w ith erectile dysfunction and urina ry ur gency and two chron lvic pain in the 3D-CRT group. Discus and C onclusion: IMRT wi th ser ial tomotherapy achieved more confor mal dose dist ribution to the PTV t han 3D -CRT, in return f or a larger, but acceptable , dose inhomogeneity and markedly re duced doses to critical structur es. SIB-IMRT, mor eover, was wel l-tolerated i n this patient series, with low rate s of gra de 2 or greater acute and late toxicity. The improved dosime tric results a chieve d with SIB-I MRT allowed dose esc alation to the prostate, while hypofractionation seemed to improve the toxicity pattern. This was probably due to differe nt / ratio and different biological equivalent dose (BED) in the prostate and the rectum, na mely in the pr ostate: 1 Purdy JA: Dose to normal tissue s outside the radiation therapy patient's treated volume.

Cells were grown at 37C (Sigma Aldrich) and antibiotics (100 units of penicilli n and 100 g of streptomycin). Cells wer e treated with several concentrations of GW29 74 (Sigma Al drich). As a control, cells were treated with DMSO, the solvent f or GW2974. After 48 h, the medium was removed, the cells were wash ed with PBS and scraped in ice, then subjected to five rounds of homogeniza tion in buffer (10 mM Tris HCl mM NaCl , 1% aprotinin, 1% PMSF an d 5 mM EDT A). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min a t 1500 \u00d7g, the n the supernatant was divided into aliquots and stored at 20C until used to quantify NSE, chromogranin A and buffer for immunobl otting. teins were determined by the Bradford procedure. Resu lts: The growth of PC-3 cells was significantly r educed ( p< 0.05) by each individual GW2 974 dose, with an inhibitory effect of about 14% at 1 M, 23% at 2 M, 28% at 3 M and 38% at4 M. NSE cytosol content was significantly increased ( p< 0.05) by treatment with G W297 4 dose . Chrom ogranin A levels were significantly increased ( p< 0.05) by adding each single dose of the dual ERBB1/ERBB 2 inhibitor to the PC-3 cell culture medium. Osteopontin mean levels were no t significantly different ( p> 0.05) in PC -3 cel ls treated with 0.1 M (6.47\u00b10.30 ng/well), 1 M (6.48\u00b10.32 ng/well) or 2 M ll) of red to vehicle -treate d cells (6.44\u00b10.38 ng/well). Discussion and Conclusion: We demonstrated that in PC-3 cells, ERBB1/ERBB 2 blockade caused growth inhibitio n and NE-related marker expression incre ase, whe reas it ha d no effe ct on os teopontin c ell conte nt. Since it has been shown that somato statin analogs, such as lanreotide, in combination with other agents are able t o reduce NE phenotype in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, it may be informative to test the response of androgen- independe nt prostate cancer cells to combined treatme nt lanre otide and GW 2974 or la patinib . 199 PROSTA TE HEALTH INDEX (PHI) IS ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BENIGN AND P RECANCEROUS CONDITIONS FROM PROSTA TE CANCER Matteo F erro 1, Daniela Terracciano 2, Claudia Mazzarella 2, Ada M arino 2, Angela M ariano 2, Angelina Di C arlo 2, Vincenz o Macchia 2, Roberto nseverino 3, Sisto Pe rdon\u00e0 Vincenz poli, Napoli, I taly Background: PSA has been widely us ed for the de tection of prostate cancer (PCa) for more than two decades . However, the m ajor drawback of PSA is its re lative la ck of specificity, most of all in the critical dia gnos tic range of 4-10 ng/ml, with a large consequ ent numb er of unnecessary prostate b iopsies.

The aim of AS is to decr ease the rate of definitive therapy a nd its side-effects in patie nts whos e biologica l tumor characteristics pose a minimal threat to their life expectancy. W e tested the two most commo nly used European and Ame rican AS protocols (PRIAS ( 1) and Jo hn Hop kins (JHP) (2), respectively) in patie nts who met their selective entry c riteria, but underwe nt radical prostatectomy (RP) as first-choice treatment, in pa rticular their ability to correctly se lect patients with low-risk prostate cancer, excluding patients with unfavorable prostate cance r charac teristic s at final pathological examination. Patients and Methods: The records regarding a total of 616 patients wer e extracted from our institutional urological oncology database of all men who underwent radical prostatectomy betwee n 2005-2010. F or all patients, full records of biops y and R P specimen pathologica l reports were available . Follo wing ce ntral re view of all slide s, pathological tumor volumes were calculated using 3-D stereology (as the produc t of tumor a rea per section and thickness section) based on a whole-mount section 3-mm s tep analysis. We selected two groups of patients: firstly, those wh o met the PRIAS inclusion criteria, T1-cT2, biopsy Gleason 3+3, PSA 10, PSA density <0.2 and positive cores 2 (1); secondly, those who met the JHP inclusion criteria, namely: T1c, biopsy Gleason 3+3, PSA density <0.15 and positive co res 2, 50% any core involvemen t (2). The primary outcome w as pathological upstaging (d efined as stage al upgra ding pattern 4 or 5) was i denti fied as a secondary outcome. We excluded 26 patients who had used horm onal therapy, including 5-a lpha-reduc tase inhibitors . Therefore, 147 and 126 patients were evaluated in PRIAS and JHP criteria, respectively.

Backgro und: Prostat e can cer (PCa) diagnosis is currently based on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination ( DRE) . The low s pecificity of PS A is respons ible f or a large numbe r of unnecessar y prostate biopsies to conf irm diagnosis. PC A3 score has been shown to be a non-invasive tool for impr oving diagnosis. PC A3 measur ement r equires urin e sample after DRE . Recently, the prostate health ind ex (PH I) ha s been pr oposed as an easily available b lood test with a speci ficity higher than that of percentage free PSA (fPCA) to discriminate between benign prostatic hypererplasia (BPH) and PCa. PHI is calculated mula PHI=( p2PSA/fP SA)\u00d7 tPSA, whe re tPSA and p2PSA is a PSA isoform. Patients and Methods: We compared the ability of PHI and PCA3 to identify prostate malignancy in a population of 40 patients selected for r e-biops y [17 with B PH, 14 with PCa and 9 with precancerous lesions such as aty pical small aci nar proliferation (ASAP)]. Results: We found that the median PCA3 levels were significantly higher in PCa patients compared to BPH cases ( p= 0.023); the differe nce in PCA3 vels betwe en PCa and AS AP c ases was not statistically significant. On t he contra ry, we did not observe any significant difference in PHI values between PCa and BPH or ASAP cases. ROC curve analysis showed that PCA3 has a better ability to discriminate BPH and PCa than PHI (AUC= 0.69 a nd 0.58 for PCA3 and PHI, respectively). Conclusion: Compared to PHI, PCA3 seems to be a better indic ator of ma ncy before re-biopsy. 1 Aubin SM, molec ular urine test: developme nt of a method to aid in the diagnosis of prostate can cer.

There are multiple risk factors for NMIBC, which include exposure to tobacco and industrial chemicals, ingestion of arsenic-laced wa ter, radiation therapy to organs adjacent to the bladder, therapeutic use of alkylating agents in chem otherapy regimens and infection with the tremat ode Schistosoma hematobium . The glycosaminoglycan layer on the bladder surface non-specifically blocks the adherence of ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1918 bacteria, ions and molecul es to the epithe lium. It may be an important e lement in the first line of def ense a gainst infection, calculi and ev en carcin ogens for t he transitio nal cells of the bladder. Qua litative or quantitative de fects in the glycosamin oglycan(s) pre sent ma y inf e an l's susceptibility to the significa nt number of these cases exhibit recurrence, with or without progression to invas ive disease. Cur rently, the re are few options other than cystectomy for the man agement of NMIB C with intraves ical chemother apy us ing se drugs, such s gemci tabine (GEM), mitomycin-C ( MMC) and doxorubicin (DOX) (2). In this study, w e investiga ted the effe cts of Ura cyst (chondroitin sulpha te) (3) on the growth inhibition of human bladder cancer cell lines J82, H T-1376 and MCR a nd th e effec ts of the combination of GEM, MMC and DOX with Urac yst on the antitumor activity of these drugs in vitro . Mater ials and Methods: Cell prolife ration was me asure d by MTT assay and the drug c ombinatio n studie s were ana lyzed using CalcuSyn s (4). was eva luated FACS af labeling with um iodide a nd FITC- anne xin V. Results: We found tha t Ura cyst, MMC, DOX and GE M induced a dose- and time- depe ndent growth and MCR ca ncer cells . The data suggest that the three cell line s had diff erent sensitivities to the treatme nt with the se dr ugs and tha t the MCR cells were the least sensitive amon g the th ree cel l lines. On the basis of the obtai ned results, we hypothesi zed that Uracyst may potentiate the antitumor activity of MM C, DOX and GEM . Specifical ly, we e valuated the growth inhib ition induced by d ifferent c once ntrations of Ura cyst in combinatio n with MMC, D OX or GE M at 72 h in the bladder cancer cell line HT- 1376. We observe d a syne rgistic effec t when th e cells we re trea ted w ith Urac yst in combination with MMC o r GEM a t an e quimolar ratio. On the other hand, an antagon istic effect was observ ed wh en the cells were treated with Ur acyst in combination with DOX. The s ynerg ism observe d was a lso indepe ndent of the sequ ence o f administration of the drugs. More over, with Urac yst/GEM and U racyst/MMC combina tions at concen tration s which w ere able to induce synergism on growth inhibition, a strong potentiation of apoptosis was record ed. Discussion and Conc lusion: In human bladde r cancer ph arma cologic combina tion of Uracys t with GE M or MMC resulte d in a strong synergism on cell growth inhib ition and apoptosis. This strategy may resolve the multidrug resistanc e of bla dder cancer, and ma y be u sed to overcome the toler ance of c ancer cells to chemother apeu These data encour age furt her investig ations on the combin ed use of Uracyst with GEM o r MMC in the treatment of human bladde r cancer. 1 Bodenstab W, Kaufman J and Parsons CL: Inactivat ion of antiadherence effect of bladder Hurst RE: Exogenous glycosamin oglycans coat damaged bladder surfaces i n experimen tally damaged m ouse bladder.

The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate th e clinical be nefits of radiat ion therapy (RT), specifically s imultane ous integra ted therap y (HT) for lo calized prostate can cer, based on the frequency of acute an d late adv erse events . Patients and Methods : Between Novemb er 2007 and February 2009, at th e Operative Unit of Radiothe rapy of V . Fazzi H rc-IMRT with NomoStat S ystem f or serial tomotherapy, 16 patients with localized prostate cancer were select ed from th e Prostate Cancer Unit and tr eated with SI B-IMRT. Radiation doses of 78.5 and 66.5 Gy (1. in 33 fractions wer e prescr ibed to the prostate and the seminal vesicles, respectively. Rad iation doses to the blad der, rect um, small bowel and f emor al heads wer e us ed as toxicity predictors. A ll patients rec eived short-course neoadjuvant HT (bicalutamide, 50 mg/day; goserelin, 3.6 m g every 28 days) starting 2-4 months before RT, depending on risk factors, such as PSA, Gleason s core and cli nical stage, and continuing until the end of irradiation. A total of 16 patients recei ved adjuvant HT (bicalutamide, 150 m g/day) for 6 month s. The me dian pretreatment PSA was 9 ng/ml. Patients were seen on a weekly basis during treatment, an d every one or three months thereafter. During follow-up, the periodical PSA score, acute (<120 days) and late (>120 days) gastr ointes tinal (GI) and genitour inary (GU) side-effects and erect ile dysfunction were investigated. T o evaluate acu te toxicity, th e Rad iation Ther apy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system w as used and the maximum score was re ported. Additional symptoms, such as rectal blood loss , urgency a nd incontinence, were sco red. Late toxicity was s cored a ccording to the slightly adapted RTOG /European Organiza tion fo r Research and Treat ment of Cancer (EORT C) criteria. Results: The med ian follow-up time was 28 (range, 23- 39) mont hs. The most common acute grade 2 events were cystitis (23%) and urinary urgency/fr equency (15%); no patient experienc ed acut e grade 3 eve nts. Five patients developed acute gr ade 2 or higher rectal toxicity, while 34% of the patients expe rienced no GU symptoms (grade 0) during treatment. Late toxicity was uncommon (two patients had urinary urgency and one patient had nocturia) and no patient experienced more severe symptoms or developed erectil e dys function, urinary urgen cy an d chr onic pelvi c pain. The PSA relapse-free survival provided a good indication of the efficacy of RT-HT. The median 12-month PSA was 0.45 ng/ml. The 12- and 24-month PSA relapse-free survival (PRFS) rates were 100% and 99.5% respectively. W e ed biochem ical r elapse in two patien ts; both had poor prognostic factors at initial diagnosis of prostate cancer. Conclusion: SIB- IMRT offers optimal clinical results in terms of acute toxicity, allows dose escalation to the target volumes and, therefore, appears to be a promising method for the improvement of radiation local control and di sease-free survival. Our data demons trated the feasibility and safety of SIB-IMR T with serial tomotherapy for patients with localized pros tate cancer and provided proof that this method allows safe dose escalation with low severe t oxicities to the normal tissues. 1 Guckenberger M et al : Toxicity after intensity-modulated, image 2 Latorzeff I, Boutry C et al : Benefit of intensity- modulated and image -guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.

Patients and M ethods: Verumontanum can be considered an anatomical landmar k in saving the longest portion of the urethra and, consequently, the largest ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1920 part of the striated s phincter. By the antegrade a pproach to the radical prostatectomy, it is possible to have an a natomic al prepa ration of the urethr al sphincte r with an excellent visualization of the ap ex, du e to cranial traction of the compl etely mob ilized prosta te. At this point, the urethra can be r esected w ith max imum respec t of the anatomic al bound aries of th e ure thral sphinc ter and mi nimizing the ris k of leavi ng prostatic tissue in situ . From January 2007 to Apr il 2008, w e pros pecti vely colle cted data from 1 radical re tropubic prosta tectomy (ARRP) for clinically localized p rostate cancer. We determined tw o co horts: Gr oup A ( 50 patie nts) unde rwent ARRP without the saving of verumontanum, and Group B (52 patients) underw ent ARR P with the saving of verumontanum. Both groups were homogen eous in terms of preo perative PSA, pathological score. ce was evaluat ed with I CIQ-SF que stionnair e at months 1, 3, 6 and 12 after the operation. Results: The mean follow-up was 27.3 (ra nge, 24 -33) months for Group A a nd 28.3 (range, 24-34) months for Grou p B. In 2/50 (4%) cases of Grou p A and in 3/52 (5.8%) of Group B, a positive apic al surgical margin w as found ( p= 0.4383). Of these pa tients, one in Gr oup A and o ne in Group B develope d biochemi cal recurrence ( p= 0.4877). Over all, 94% of Group A and 96.1% of Gr oup B patients comple tely f ulfille d our contine nce criteria (no pads and ICIQ-SF =0) at a minimum f ollow-up of 12 months. Continence w as obta ined within the first month in 36 patients of Group A (72%) vs. 41 patie nts of Group B (78.8 %). The number of pa tients in groups A and B achie ving continence within th ree, six and t welve months w ere: 41 (82%) vs. 46 (88.5%), 90%) a signi ficant overall contine nce; more over, this technique strongly the early recovery of continence (p< 0.0001). Conclusion: Verumontanum can be cons idered an anatomical landmark in saving most of the stria ted sphincter. In our exper ience, ARR P with sav ing of verum ontanum resul ted in an early recover y of continenc e without increasing the risk of leaving p rosta tic tissue in situ . This study was limited by the sma ll pat ient numbers of both groups and the exiguity of events . 207 A PROGRESSION SCO RE FOR BLADDER PT1 HIGH-GRADE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA: PRELIMINARY DATA Mari anzi irenze, Italy Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the combination of immu nohistochemi cal mar kers in elaborating a p rognostic score of recurrence and progression of non muscle-invasive high-grade urothelial b ladder car cinoma. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and pathological data of 23 patients wh o had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) histologica l T1 high-gr ade ( 19 cases, 82.6% ) or carcinoma in situ (4 cases, 17.4%). Additional inclusion criteria were: negative ana mnes is for previous urothelial tumors , pos t-TUR BT treatme nt with B CG, known follow-up, available microscopic slides and pa raffin blocks of each case (first and follo w-up biops ies). The slides a nd tissue b locks of all first di agnosis sp ecimens wer e s elected E-CAD, a semiquantitative assessment of the immunohistochemical data, the mean percentage of positive tumor cells was determined at \u00d7400 magnific ation for e ach section. Sections were graded on the basis of the percentage of stained tumor cells as: 0 (nega tive), 1 (<10%), 2 (10-49%) and The intensity of staining wa s graded as: 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (mod erate) and 3 (strong). The grades for percentage tumor cells and staining intens ity were multiplied to gener ate we ighted points for each tumor specimen (range, 0- 9) and evalua ted using the following scoring system: 0 (weighted points between 0 and 3) =wea k or no staining; 1 (weighte d points betwee n 4 and 9) =moderate/intense staining. The first group was defined as 'nega tive', the second as 'positi ve'. A grading score (0 or 1) was assigne d to each immunohis tochemica l staining and, for each patient, it was added to the grading score of the eight studied immunohistoc hemica l markers to obtain a score for assessing the progres sion s core. Results: After treatment with pat ients showed no recurren ce/pr a mean follow-up of 16.6 ( range, 12-34) months, 9 pa tients developed recurrence at mean follow-up of 14.7 (range, 2-48) mon ths and 4 patients underwent radical cystectomy for muscle- invasive bladder cancer at a mean follow-up of 14.5 (range, 2- 23) months. TOP -2, p16, CD44, survivin and galectin-3 demonstrated a strong statistical correspondence to recurrence and progression of urothelial carcinoma. Of the three remain ing mar kers (E-CAD, C D138 and HYAL -1), only CD138 s howe d a tr end for be ing s ignific antly correla ted with the recurrence or progression of urothelial carcinoma. The progression score was calculated by the addition of the grading score of each immunohistochemical marker, with a range from 0 (best prognos is) to 7 (worst prognosis). A score 5 corresponded to specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values of progression of 78.9%, 100%, 50% and 100%, respectively. The ROC curve at this cut-off gave a n area under the curve of 0.974 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.807-1.000 ( p< 0.001). Conclusion: The progression score applied to urothelial bladder carcinoma Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1921 demonstrated high specific ity a nd sensit ivity in predicting local recurrence and pr ogression, intrave sical treatment with B CG af ter TURBT. Th e progr ession score may help clinicians to foc us on patients who may need a close follow-up or early r adical treatment. The pre sent study should be considered a prelimina ry report and should be s ubstantiated by a larger patient series. 208 CONTRAST-ENHANCE D ULTRASOUND FOR CHARACTERIZATION AND FOLLOW-UP OF RENAL LESIONS Elena Bertelli 1, Feder ico L anzi 2, Livia Eleonora Qua ttrone 1, Claudia Giannes si 2, Saver taly aim of the study w as to ev aluate the usefulness of contra st-enhanced ult rasonogr aphy (CEUS) in the characterization and follow-up of renal lesions. Patients and Metho ds: From March to Septembe r 2010, we performed CEUS in 29 patients to e valuate 42 renal le sions . Of the m, 37 lesions (88%) were detecte d with previous contra st-enhanced CT (CECT) and CEUS was use d to bette r characterize them. In 4 patients (5 US-questionabl e lesion s) with initial renal failure, CEUS was directly performed after grayscale US to avoid contr ast-induced nephropa thy (CI N); in this set of patients, CEUS confirmed US -suspected s olid renal masses and the patients u nderw ent C ECT evaluation. CEUS was performe d by a single experience d radiologist (with more than 20 year s of practice in urologic ultra sound and more than one year in CEUS) using a commer cially avai lable scanner (Esaot e MyLab 70 Gold) with softwar e dedicated to the CEUS s tudy and with a c onve x multi-frequency broadband (3-8 MHz) probe . Lesions were first scanned with gray-scal e and color Dopple r US to obta in their loc ation and size and t he bes t imaging pla ne to obser ve the lesions and the normal a djacent renal pare nchyma. Thereafter, a contrast agent as a bolus (average flow, 2 .5 ml/s) of 4.8 ml do se fol lowed by 10 ml o f normal saline flush. Each examina tion la sted post-co acquir ed las ting approxima tely 1 50 s. If necessar y, the injection was repeate d 15 min la ter. Quan titativ e analysis of enhancement was perform ed using de dicated softw are for the quantification of by p). Th is so ftware elaborates color maps and process time/intensity (T/ IS) curves on a region of interest (ROI). CEC T studies (comp leted with Siemens SOMATOM Sensat imagi on average) blinded to the CEUS diagnos is. For the interpreta tion of both CECT and CEUS findings, we used the Bosniak scheme for the classification of cystic lesions. Resu lts: CEUS b etter defined the US features in all cases ( p= 0.001) and demonstrated a mat ching diagnosis wi th CECT in 38/42 lesions (90.4%). In the remai ning four cases, CT failed to show tumor blood flow in small lesions, while the ability of CEUS to quantify perfusion demonstrated the presence of subcentrimetrical renal mass es, discovered to be clear-cell renal carcinoma, hi stopathologically c onfirmed. The diagnostic value of CEUS was comparable to that of CECT. Moreover CEUS was found to have higher sensitivity in characterizing small renal lesions (<1.5 cm in the greatest dimensions) and suspected cysts (B IIF, B III) ( p< 0.0001). None of the patients suffer ed adver se reactions to the CEUS contrast agent, and no renal function worsening was su spected. Conclusion: CEUS a ppeared to be more sensitive in detecting slight tumor blood flow t han CECT, with an improved characterization of small renal tumors. CEUS allowe d better visualization of septa number, wall thickness, solid c ompon ent and enhancement of some renal cystic mass es than CECT. Moreover, the dedicated software (Qontrast) gave confirmation and detailed definition of the observed features by creating colorime tric maps and time-intens ity curve s. This safe, c ost- effective procedure may be useful to better define renal lesions in patients undergoing surgery, or to tailor an active surveillanc e of s mall mas ses or pos toper ative follow-up. 209 SEQUENTIAL TARGET SUNI TINIB+SORAFENIB F errari, Nicola Arrighi, Ser C rescia, B rescia, Italy Background: Sunitinib (SUN) is a targeted therapy mos t commonly us ed as first-line tre atment of me tastatic r enal cell carcinoma (mRC C), while sorafenib (SOR) is the treatment of choice in the second line. How ever, for different reasons (mainly the loc al availability of drugs or compassionate use), some patients have been treated with se quences of these dr ugs not c onsidered by the guidelines . The pr esent study re viewe d our experience in regard to the results of the sequences SUN+SOR vs. SOR+SUN. Patients and M ethods: Since 2005, 67 patients with mRCC ha ve been treated with a target therapy in our institution. Amon g them, 34 cases treated with the ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1922 sequence SU N+SOR (24 ) or SOR +SUN (10) were reviewed. Statistical analysis was not performed due to the small sample size and the disparity of the cases. Results: The following Table summar izes the featur es of the patie nts a nd the results obtained. Feature SUN+SOR SOR +SUN Mean age, (range) 64.1 (5.0+9.3) Median progression-free survival (months) 10.0 15.5 events 16.7%+4 .2% 0.0%+0 .0% Patients alive at end of study 33.3% 60.0% Discussion and Conclusion: Compar ing th e se quenc es SUN+ SOR and S OR+SU N for the two groups of pati ents with similar or s lightly unfa vorable clinica l features for the seque nce SOR+ SUN ( e.g. number of me tastat ic site s), a longe r survival time (bot h disea se-free and over all) and better respons e rates wer e observed for the seque nce SOR+SUN . This advantage is mainly due to th e good ac tivity of SUN shown b oth in th e first- and se cond- line tr eatment. These results are not in agreement with guide lines, whe re SUN should be employed excl usively in the fir st-line tr eatment and SOR in the se cond-line tre atment . Even though thi s conclusi on shou ld be caref ully regar ded due to the small numbe r of patients and the retrospecti ve de sign of the study , the possible use of SUN af ter failure of S OR c an be conside red. The need for a better and more indiv idualized selection of patients for target ther apy in mRC C is further emphasize d by this retrospect ive study. 210 FIVE- AND TEN-YEAR OUTCOM E IN PROSTA TE CANCE R TREATED WITH THREE DOSE LEVEL 3D-CRT Rocco P anaia 1, Elisabetta Ga ribaldi 1, Gius eppe Malinverni 3, Simone Mazzetti 2, Marco Ga tti 1, Elena De lmas tro 1, Angelo M aggio 2, aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of several clinical variables in a patient population with localiz ed prostate cancer treate d with a dose with hormonotherapy, and to determine the biochemica l and clinical outcome after the end of radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From January 1999 to Decemb er 2005, 1,004 patients with prostate cancer (mean ag e 72, range 47- 83 years) underwent external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) at the Radiotherapy Department of the IRCC in Candiolo and at Mauriziano Umberto I Hospital in Turin. Patients were treated with 3D-CRT ( 6 beam, 18 MV, MSKCC of New York modified technique), with three levels of dose (72, 75.6 and 79.2 Gy) to prostate vol ume an d semi nal v esicles wit h/without pelvic node s. The IC RU pr escription me dian dose was 46 Gy to pelvic volume (9% of the patients) and 76 Gy to prostate volume us ing standard fractionation (1.8-2 Gy/ fraction). Hormonotherapy was employed in 785 patients low- risk patients (13%) received neo-adjuvant hor monothe rapy for two to three month s befo re radiation t herapy; inte rmediate- risk patients (59%) received neo-adjuvant and concomitant hormonotherapy for a total of about 5 months; and, finally, high-risk patients (28%) received neo-adjuvant, conco mitant and adjuv ant hormonal therapy for a total of about two years. The distribution according to clinica l stage wa s T1: 21% , T2: d 8-10: hemorrhoids 5%, diverticulitis 2% and obesity 1%; 86 % of the no comorbidity. was 61.4 (range: 13.2- 127.9) months . Results: Overall survival at five and ten ye ars after the end of radiothe rapy was 93% and 88%, respec tively. Disease-free surviv at five ten ars wa s 92% and 72% , respectively (Kaplan-Meier method). Log-rank te st was performed to evaluate the survival function acro ss groups. The parameters significantly correlating with overa ll survival were Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1923 GS an d clinical stage. With regard to GS , we saw a statistically significant diffe rence between <7 an d >7 (p= 0.0002). With regard to clinical stage, there was a statistically signif icant diffe rence between stage II and III disease ( p= 0.028). The radiation dose to the tumor wa s not signif icantly cor related with overall survival. In univariate logisti c analys is (UV A), the over all sur vival had a trend in favor of age > 75 years ( p= 0.0585, OR I n UV p= 0.0274, OR=1.87). In multi variate logistic analysis, t strongly relat ed to GS >7. Conclus ion: 3D-CRT is a feasible modality allow ing for dose escalation. GS also correlates very strongly w ith the outcome as r eported in the literature. Our result s confirme d a series of studies which suggested that age plays a pro tective role in overall surviv al; in effect, we obs erved that patie nts over 75 ye ars of age survi ve longer than patients under 75 years of ag e. However, in our study the dos e increase fro m 76 to 80 Gy was not associa ted with better tu mor out come, perhaps because treatme nt dose was se lected accor ding to the patient risk leve l (most pa tients at low risk w ere tre ated at 72 Gy, intermedia te risk at 75.6 Gy and high risk patient at 79 .2 Gy). Furthe r investigations are warranted a iming to prov ide a better understan ding of the dose effect f or prostate cancer. 211 XANTHOGRANOLOMATOUS PYELONEP HRITIS: ATYPICAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOS IS OF ease, usually associated with urinary lithiasis, with ultrasou nd (U S) an d computed tomogra phy (CT) features similar to th ose of renal can cer. Exceptionally, it present s with venous throm bosis, emphas izing diagno sis a nd posing specific technical demand s at surge ry. Here, we p resent a case of X GPN with caval thrombos is. Case Re port: An 85-year-old female, otherwise healthy, pres ented with recurrent right- flank pain. At abdomin al US and CT, a 5-cm necrot izing righ renal mass with s ubdiaphr agmatic ca val thrombosi s was detected. The patie nt was submitted to righ t radical nephrecto my, cavectomy and extraction of the caval thrombosis filling the caval lumen. The clinical course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after eight days. At histological examination, XGP N with ve nous thr ombus w as diagnosed, having uniform cellularity. Discussion and Conclusion: This was only the fourth case of XGP N with caval thrombos is reported in the literature (1-3) over the last 30 years. The case had a particular surgical complexity related to the extension of the thrombus along the vena cava proximal to the overlying veins, the complete filling of the caval lumen and, moreover, a specific anesthesiologic al diffic ulty due to the patient's a dvanced age. Therefore, such a rare differential diagnosis should be taken into ac count. In vie w of the r ecent proposals of a neoadjuva nt role of targeted therapy in advanced renal cancer, the need for pre-the rapy biops y is furthe r empha sized. 1 Gupta G, Singh R, Ko tasthane DS et al : Xa nthogranu- lomat ous pyelonephritis in a mal e child with renal vein thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava : a c ase report.

Urol RECURRENT CYSTIC W OMAN AFTER CYSTECTOMY AND CONTRALA TERAL NEPHRECTOMY: A CASE andri Backgr ound: Cystic nephroma is an uncommon benign of the kidney, with unce rtain e tiology. Radic al ne phrectom y is the gold standard to treat this pathology (1). We present an unusual case of a 50-year-old woman with cystic nephroma, who had n ephrecto my and cyst ectomy in the past and was treated with partial right nephrectomy. Case Report: Left radic al nephre ctomy was perf ormed when the patient was two years old because o f recurrent pyelonephritis in a silent a nd dila ted kidney . Two yea rs later, an orthotopic and ips ilateral urete rocele was removed with a trans vesical technique . At the age of 18, the old right urete ral stenosis was treated in Switzerland with an unspecified endoscopic approach. In June 2009, cystoscopy revealed a smal l tumor around the right ureteral orifice and a pel vic minus mass was seen at retrogr ade pyelography. Therefore, a surgical approa ch was planned and an intra luminal polyc ystic lesion of the kidney was removed, together ureterectomy with ureteral re-implantation. The exami nation showed a benign polyc ystic le sion of the kidney and a poor ly diff erentiated squamous carcin oma o inf orthotopic neobladder reconstruction and colposac ropexy with no idence of carcinoma in the r emoved spe cime n. One year later, because of the ons et of persistent fever, lumbar pain and acute renal failure, two nephr ostomie s were tempora rily applie d and a recurrent polycys tic obstruc tive mass was found in the right kidney . The patient unde rwent parti al nephr ectomy in the middle of the kidney with removal of the entry of the lesion in a medium caly x. The tumor w as comple tely r emoved . The histological ma. Results: At 6-mont h follo w-up, the patient was f ree from disease, with a cr eatinine leve l of 1.43 mg/dl, a nd abdominal US showing mild dilatation of re nal ca vities and no sign of recurrence. Conclusion : In se lecte d pat ients, pa rtial nephrectomy can be a safe therapeutic option f or the removal of a cystic nephroma. 1 Kuzgunbay B , Turunc T, Kilinc F : Adult cystic nephrom a: a cas e report and a revie w of the literatur e.

Furthermor e, the index tumor lesion may be missed eve n by extende d trans (20-40% ) are notable r isks for error.

Based on the current lite rature, in this re port, we ha ve identified the indications for 3D-TTPSB in clinical practice; moreover, we descr ibe our up-to- date technique and report on our initial experience. W e descr ibe our initial experience based on six cases. Patients and Met hods: 3D-TTPSB w as used to obtain a definitive diagnosis in: (i) three men with a p ersistent clinica l suspicion of PCa despite previous ne gative TRUS Bs and (ii) three men with minimal cancer on initial biopsy who could have been suitable for AS or FT. In addition, we carried out a critical analysis of articles on 3D-TTP SB (Medline search). Results: We identified two groups with the indications for 3D-TTPSB: (i) Diagnosis: a persistent clinical suspicion of PCa (PSA doubling time <4 years, doubtf ul DRE, familia r history, PIN an d/or ASAP ) despite previous negative biopsies; and (ii) Staging: patients with low- or very low -risk cancer on initial TR USB who are cons idere d for AS or FT. With re gard to the 3D-TTPSB technique, the following are true: (i) Required equipme nt: bi- plane trans rectal ultrasound machine with a probe stabilization tool; stepwise linear movement; grid-mounting and imag ing capabilities. The setup is analogous or e quivalent to the bra chythera py or cryoa blation model. (ii) Light general anesthesia or, preferably, spinal anesthesia; the patient in the lithotomy position. A Fo ley catheter is passed to better visualize the urethra and to help avoid urethral injury during the biopsy. (iii) The prostate is divided into eight regions , with respect to the thr ee re ferenc e planes commo nly used, labeled as follows (1): left anterior distal, left anterior proximal, left poste rior proximal. Each octant is divided into three zones and midline biopsies are segre gated. (iv) 2-5 Cores are taken anywher e (1 core every 5 mm of distance) within each region plus 2-4 cores from the midline (a total of 50-124 biops ies, depending on prostate size), and the specime ns transferred to prela beled c ontainers. ( v) A c atheter is left indwe lling at le ast for one day. P atients a re pr escribed five days of oral antibiotics at home or two days i.v. in the hospital. A summary of our initial experien ce with 3D-TTPSB follo ws. In our diagn ostic group, we detected 2/3 PCa, both with small focus and Gleaso n pat tern of 4. One of the patients under went radical prostatectomy (final pathology: pT2cN0R0, volume<0 .5 cm 3, Glea son score: 4+3=7) an d the other underwent radiotherapy. In the staging group, we confirmed 3/3 PCa; disease in one patient was upgraded to G leason score 3+4 and he underwent surgery (final 0.08 3, Gleas on score: 3+4=7); the second pa tient is on AS and the last one is scheduled for cryoablation. Radical prosta tectomies after 3D -TTPSB were n ot perc eptibly more diffic ult than those without 3D-TTPS B and the re we re no major complica tions (such as sepsis or severe hematuria ), only retention). Conclusion: 3D-TT PSB is a safe and effective technique to detect PCa in high-risk patients whose cancer has been missed or is undete ctable by standar d TRUS B. It has an important role in mapping the location and the extent of PCa and, therefore, in cho osing the mos t appropriate treatment among several option, including radica l treatments, FTs and AS. To date, this procedure is considered the best in Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1925 minimizing the risks of unde rsampling, understaging and under grading. Ho wever, inc reased morb idity has al so been reported and long-term effect s on subsequent tr eatments are not yet known.

Th e latter proc esses include growth, progress ion and metastasis of cancer, as well as dys regula ted angiogenes is associated with the se events. The MMPs ar e secreted by all types of ce lls, and they also degrade the extrace llular matrix, allo wing c ancer cells to take root and metastasize. Endogenous inhibitors typically hold MMPs in check but in cancer, the balance shifts agains t the in hibitor s and in fa vor of M MPs, whic h ultima tely spill ove r from blood into urine. Patients and Meth ods: Thirty-eight patien ts were chosen for the s tudy and their first m orning urine w as collected before s urgical o r othe r therapeutic inte rvention. Of these pat ients had prosta te cancer, with Gleason sc ores of 6 (13 patients) , 7 (12 patie nts), 8 (2 patients) and 9 (3 patients ), while 8 patients ha d benign p rostate hyperplasia (BPH). MMP activity in con ients with prost ate diseas e was verifi ed by ge latin z ymogra phy. Results: Zymog raphy showed four dominant gelatinolytic bands of 240, 130, 92 and 72 kDa in prostate d isease. The mos t abundant lytic activity wa s at 92 kDa (MMP-9 ), wher eas MMP -2 was p resent in lesser quantities. M oreover, MMP-9 activity was enhanced in the urine from patients with BPH compared with that from can cer patients. No c orrelation between gelatinolytic activity and Gleason score or pathologica l findings was found. Discussion and Conc lusion: The results suggest that the inexpensive me asurement of MMP-9 in concentrated urine ma y serve as a suitable supplement ary tool to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and patients w ith BPH.

MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA OF TUNICA VAGI NALIS : MANAGEMENT, PROGNOSTIC FACTORS AND ADJUV ANT THERAPIES Girolamo S pagnoletti , Rita M arches Anna of pleura, pericardium and peritoneum are uncommon, testicular M Ms are extremely rare, accounting f or fewer than 5% of all MMs. They can be associated with a previous exposure to asbestos and usually occur in patients older than 45 years, with a median age of 60 years. Despite aggressiv e surgical procedures, prognosis remains poor. MMs have an expansive and infiltrative growth pattern and metastasis occurs via the lymphatic system to inguinal an d para-ao rtic nodes. Two thirds of recurrences occur within the first two years after diagnosis. Clinicians do not agree ab out adjuvant therap y: many of them report results following surgery alone; others report survival with postoperativ e ch emotherap y and/or radiotherapy even in advanced diseases. Case Report: In 2008, a 77-year-old man presented with a growing swelling of the left hemiscro tum. Ultrasonography revealed a l eft ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1926 hydr ocele. T he patient underw ent cytoanalysis o f th e hydr ocele flu id: many m esothelial cells with nu clear and cytop lasmic atypias we re found. P reoperatively, the patient was studied with whole-bo dy CT. He w as treated wi th left hemiscrotectomy in January 2009. Grossly, the test icle was filled with a whitis h pluri nodular, in places pseudocy stic the e pididy mis. His topatho logy demonstrated an MM arising from the Tunica is , Immunochemistry showed high cytok and No adjuva nt treatment was a dministered. Results: The patient lived without evidence of diseas e unt il October 2010, when left -groin ad enopathies dev eloped. Ultrasonography confirmed the pres ence of four metastastic nodes, the largest one of 4 cm, and also revealed a s uspicious node in the right groin. A nod al biopsy in th e left groin resulted in the diagnosis o f MM m etastasis. A su bsequent PET/ CT scan demonstrated r adioactiv e tracer fixation in bot h groins and in para-aortic nodes. The patient was enr olled i n a chemora diation therapeutic program. He has ju st comple ted three cycl es of pemetrexed-ba sed c hemother apy with pa ssable results and will undergo radiotherapy to all sites of t he disease. According to the literatu re, rad iotherap y can be even more eff ective than chemo therapy in patients wit h metas tatic disea se. Discu ssion and Conclusion: Our case rep ort underlines the importance o f a co rrect p reoperat ive d iagnosis and an accur ate stagin g because these tumors of ten pr esent as a hydrocele or an epidid ymal cyst. The diagnosis of MM of the Tunica vaginal is should be co nsidered in any patient presenting with a rapid ly gr owing hydro cele. Becaus e most cases of MM are found intra- o r postoperati vely, man y patients undergo s uboptimal re section and the diagnosis of malignancy is achieved late. Ins tead, the only useful treatment is rad ical or chiectomy t hrough an inguinal approach or hemi scrotectomy, in the cas e of initial in volvemen t of the scrotum. T here is no role for i nguinal o r iliac lymph-node dissection when there is n o su spicion of metastas is. Our patie nt was well- studi ed p reoperati vely an d und erwent adequate surgery . Unfortunate ly, in a considerable proportion of patients , risk of local recurrence is high: nearly 40% of patients present with negative prognosti c factors, such as local invasion to s ubtunical co nnect ive tissues and testicular parenchyma, and 12 % de velop r ecurrence af ter surger y. In the light of liter ature findings, surve illance after orchiect omy can be cons idere d a vali d pol icy for many patien ts. H owever, there are some conditions whi ch are predicto rs of rel apse and shou ld be taken into acco unt when co nside ring the opportunity for an immed iate adjuvan t treatment, as our case Mo reover ch emotherapy a nd/or radiother apy the sites of relap se can be a dopted as s alvag e treatment. Finally, this case report emphasizes the importance of oncologic follow-up after surgery. 1 Ashis G et al : Mal ignant mesothelioma of the Tunica vaginalis of the testis without exposure to asbestos.

Variables influencing upgrading/upsizing at the first repeat biopsy (one year after the beginn ing of AS) are analy zed here to identify patients with a higher proba bility of upgrading/upsiz ing after a short time in AS, and a preliminary nomogram is presented. Patients and Methods: The AS in stitutional protocol (SAINT) started in March 2005 and wa s accepted by 86 patients. Entry criteria were: iPSA10 ng/ml, T stageT2a, GPS3+3, pos itive biopsy cores20%, length containing was: PSADT3 years , PSA>10 ng/ml, upgrading/upsizing at re-biopsy or choice. In November 2007, the PRIAS protocol was embraced: 126 patients were enrolled until October 2010. PRIAS vs. SAINT differs on: maximum 2 positive cores and PSA density<0.2 ng/ml/cm 3. Multivariable log istic regression (MVLR) was used to a nalyze correlations between variables and upgrading/upsizing at first repeat biopsy and a nomogram was developed using R sof tware (www.r-proje ct.org). Results: Statistical analysis was performed on data for 109 patients (39 SAINT and 70 PRIAS patients) with complete records (one- Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1927 year min follow-up). A total of 20/109 patie nts had upgrading/ups izing after repeat r adical treatment. Age, iPSA , PSA density, number of positive c ores, percentage of positive co res, absolute biopsy tumor length (ABSm m) and T- stage w ere all considered factor s potentia lly influencing upgradi ng/ups izing. GPS was not considered (all patients had GPS= 3+3). Backw ard and forward MVLR resulted in a three-continuous variable best fit mo del (overall p= 0.24, OR=6.9). A nomogram (see the figure ) was built on this res ult. Conclusion: A nomog ram including biopsy details coupled to age and P SA de nsity can help ide ntifying patients who ha ve a higher probability of upgrading/upsizing after a short time in AS. Mo re data are required to strengthen the statistica l power of this prelimina ry an alysis. This study was RADIA TION THERAP Y FOR NODAL RECURRENCES OF PROSTATE CANCER Maria Grazia P etrongari 1, Gome llini fea sibility, tolerability and pre liminar y outcomes of s tereotact ic bod y rad iation therapy in patients with nodal r ecurr ences of pr ostate can cer. Patients and Methods : Between May 2006 and July 2009, 12 pa tients (10 with isolated nodal recurrenc es and 2 with multiple adjac ent adenopathy) under went ster eotactic bod y radiation therapy delivered by a linear accele rator (Linac 2100, Var ian). The patie nt age r anged f rom 51 and 87 (medi an, 70 ) years. Primary treatment was radical prostatectomy in 7 patients, prostatectomy and postop erative androgen deprivation and radiotherapy with rescue prostatectomy in 3 patients. The initial disease category according to the N ational Comprehensive Cancer Network 2011 was defined as intermediate, high, very high and me tastatic (pN1) in 1, 2, 5 and 3 patients, r especti vely (1 unkno wn). At the time of radia the rapy, 3 pa tients did not receive androgen deprivation, 7 patie nts received some forms of androgen deprivation and the remaining 2 patients were hormone-resistant. Ten patients underwent 11 C-choline ining 2 patients underwent a magnetic resonance imagi ng (MR I) and a CT scan, respectiv ely, for the diagnosis of the recurrence a nd in order to exclude the presence of other sites of disease. All patients had a CT scan with contra st centering; 10 mm we re added to the macr oscopic disease or gross tumor volume (GTV) to create the p lanning target volume (PTV) . Ten patients receiv ed a total dose of 30 Gy/3 daily fractio ns for lesions of dimens ions betwee n 1.2 a nd 2 cm (pelvic disease). Two patients received 35 Gy/5 fractions and 27 Gy/3 fractions , respectively, because of the large size of the adenopathy (5 cm) and its critical locat ion near the bone m arrow (para-ao rtic lymph nodes ). Results: There was no report of acute and la te toxicity. The me an follo w- up w as 38 (range , 18-58) months. Eight patients had a complete response to radiotherap y with negati ve imaging e xams ( 11 C-choline PET/CT, M RI and CT) with 3 of them n ever having received neoadjuvant or concomita nt/adjuv ant hormonal therapy; 3 patients had stable disease/partial response, and the remaining patient had progressive disease in the irradiated field. Clinic al progression was observed in 9 patie nts after a me an time of 11 (ra nge, 5- 24) months from the completion of the stereotactic body radiation therapy. On e patient had regional lymph node progression, while 3 patients had regional and dista nt nodal progression. Two patients experienced distant met astasis involving bone s, while 3had biochemical dise ase progre ssion. ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1928 Figure At the time of analysis (F ebruary 2011) , 10 patients were alive and 2 dead from disease progr ession. Discussion and Concl usion: In the single r egiona l lymph nodal r ecurrence of prostate cancer after prim ary treatment, locoregion al treatment may still play an impor tant role and prevent distan t metastas is, and may als o del ay the onset and duration of ac tion of horm onal therap y. Instead of surgical disse ction, which is not always feasible because of patie nt age and c omorbiditie s, irradiation o f isolated noda l recurrence by stereotactic techn iques is feasible, with e xcellent r esults in ter ms of local disease contro l and the a lmost c omplete absence of side- effects (3). ence, stere otactic body ra diation therap y be a safe, non-inva sive and eff ective treatment. It offer s excel lent tumor control in the field in the absence of toxicity and could pr obably be used as a n alternat ive to sur gery in selected patie nts with isolated, ear ly detected, nodal dis ease. 1 Chang BK an d Timme rman RD: S tereotacti c body radiatio sive review.

Men with at least one negative biop sy often have persistently increased serum ver, a s ignificant propor tion of (2.5\u00b1 4.0 ng/ml) eithe r have, or wi ll significant pr ostate cancer (1). Alth ough biopsy remains the gold st andard for prostate can cer det ection, more accurate tests with better specificity are needed to decide whether or not to biopsy the prostate. In recent clinical trials, the potential diagnostic val ue of the P CA3 urine test wa s established, as we ll as t he role of comb ined proton 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic ontrast-enhanced imaging mag netic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the management of prost ate cancer . The aim of our study w as to evaluate the ability of 1H-MRSI /DCE-MRI combined with PCA3 urinary test to im prove prostate cancer detection in ca ses of PSA i ncrease and precious negative prosta te biopsy. Patients an d Me thods: This was a prospective single-c enter study on patients w ith prior negative random transrectal ultrasound (TRUS )-guided prostate biops y and pe rsistent ele vated PS A levels. Inc luding criteria were: a first random TRUS- guided prostate biopsy negative for prostate adenocarci noma or high -grade prostate intraepithe lial neoplasia, persiste 6.37, range: 4-10 ng/ ml) and ne gative digital rectal examination (DRE) . Exclusion criteria for the study we re: previous hormonal, surgical or radiation therapies for p rostatic diseases, lack of urine sample collected after DRE and prior to prostate biopsy, inadequate prostate biop sy w ith fewer than 10 cores and cases where an MRI examin ation with 1H-MRSI and DCE-MRI was not possible. All patients were submitted to 1H-MRSI and DCE -MRI . Prior to that the patien t's urine was collected by an expert urologi st, following an attentive prostate massage (three compressions for each prostatic lobe), in order to perform PCA3 a ssay. All biopsie s were performe d according to a standard biopsy protocol: 10-core laterally directed random TR US-guided prostate biopsy (two cores from the basal portion lateral and paramedial, two from the mid-gland lateral and pa ramedic al, and one fr om the apex, on each side of the gland for each patient, plus ad ditional b iopsies from ot her areas suspicious for prostate can cer at MRI. Resu lts: 41/43 urinary samples (95.3%) were analyzed successfully. The performance of the PCA3 test wa s evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity by comparing the PCA 3 score to the biopsy results. The overall sensitivity and specific ity of a PCA3 s core >35 a lone for positi ve biopsy this 76.9% and 66.6% , respecti vely, with positi ve predictive values of 80% and 62.5%, r espectively. With regard to MRI, sensitivity and specificity were 92.8% and 86.6% , 92.8% and 86.6% , respectively. The se nsitivity and specificity of PCA 3, MRI ( 1H-MRSI/DCE- MRI) and their combination were explored using receiver operating character istic (ROC ) analys is. The area unde r the ROC curve was 0.755 for PCA3 , 0.864 for MRI and 0.92 for their combination. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results showe d that the combination of both diagnostic methods, PCA3 and MRI, may lead to a very high diagnos tic accura cy compare d to eithe r individua l test.

A clear dose-e ffect relationship has been shown in terms of biochemic al control and side-effects. Since 2003 , we have used a dos e escalation program i n localized prostate cance r with prog ressively increasing doses from 74 to 78 Gy . We h ave evaluated the effects o f esca lating dose accord ing to acute and l ate side- effects an d tumor control. Patients and M ethods: Between October 2003 and December 2009 , 92 patients with prostate cancer were treated . They were classified acco rding to D'Amic o risk groups. In the low-risk group , only the prostate and the basis of seminal vesicles were considered in the target volume ; in the interme diate- an d high- risk groups , the complete semina l vesicle s were considere d in the initial target volume. Patie nts in this s econd grou p received neoadjuv ant hormone therap y for three mo nths and adjuvant therapy between six mon ths and two years. No patient underwent wh ole pe lvic irrad iation. Acute side-effe cts were evaluated weekly an d graded according to the RTOG sc oring system. L ate side- effects a nd tu mor had been monitored every three m onths for at least tw o years. Results: Acut e side-eff ects were generally mild. Late effects were more pronounced regarding genitourinary toxicity, with four cases of urinary incontinence and two cases of patients experie nced gastrointes tinal toxicity gr ade 2. In the high-risk category, three patients developed metastatic diseas e and eight patients had biochemica l failure. In the low- and intermediate-risk g roups, f our pa tients deve loped High-radiation dose levels xcellent biochemical control in low - and inte rmediate-risk g roups, w ith acceptable radiation re lated side-effe cts. S ince 2010, patie nts in the high-risk group have being undergoing who le pelvic irradiation. 220 A CASE OF RENAL CARCINOMA METASTASIS SIMULATING A THYROID GOITER Attilio Ignaz io etta Giovia nto lermo, Background: Although the thyroid is a highly vascularized gland, it is not a co mmo n target of metastasis from extrathyroidal cancer. Clear-cell renal carcinoma to the thyroid, representi ng 2-3% of all adult tumor s, and more tha n 40% of pa tients present with metastases at diagnosis. The presence of cRCC thyroidal metastases makes the differential diagnosis f rom thyroid clear- cell carcinoma extremel y difficult. Patients and Meth ods: A 70-year-old woman presented with a mild compressive symptomatology due to a recent multinodular thyroid goiter with a 'simple' multinodular ultrasound pattern, in the absence of signs of malignancy and with normal findings for hormonal and immu nological assessmen t. Clinical history presented chronic renal failure unde r hemodialy tic treatment subse quent to a right nephrectomy carried out 2 years before for an unspecified cause. A volumetric increase of the whole gland was evident, w ith absence of laterocervical adenopathy. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Results: Histological examin ation showed an enlargement of the thyroid with a distorted shape; the cross-section showed multiple nodules, some with firm appearance and others wi th colloidal appearance. Th e sec tions showed n odules wit h firm appearance surrounded b y a complete fibrous capsule and ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1930 character ized by prolifer ation of large ce lls, with abunda optically clear cytoplasm a nd we ll-defined ma rgins, arranged in an alveolar- tubular patter n (nests and cords). Th e nucle i exhibited mild to mode rate atypia and single or multiple nucleoli. Few mitoses were observe d. Within the nodules, severa l dilated vascular structures were visible, some of which showing angiolymphatic in vasion. The neopla stic cells wer e strongly 10 only expr essed (TTF-1), thyroglobulin a nd C K7 wer e not found in tumor al cells and this ruled out a primary tumor of t he th yroid . On the groun nd , a dia gnosis was ma de. Conta cting the patient's relatives for m ore information about his renal disease, they revealed that t he ne phrec tomy had be en due t o cRCC, whic h had been concealed f rom the patient. This cla rification confirmed the histo logica l diagnosis of thyroid metastasis of cRCC, of low-risk and under hemod ialytic treatment, the pat ient w sent for ologic follow-up. Discussion and usion: Many patients om thyroid metastases present a local symptoma tology which is not easy to disting uish f rom that caused by pr imary patho logies of the thyroid. In the case we desc ribed here , the di fficulty o f diagnosis was not only due to the rarity of this c ondition, but was als o complicated by the lack of infor mation about the cause of the previous n ephrectomy . In seco ndary thy roid lesions, it is n ecessary to ens ure the total eradication of the gland (e ven fo r suspected ma lignant pa thology) in or der to guara 221 LIDOCAINE-PRILOCAINE CREAM COMBINED WITH LIDOCAINE-KETOROLAC GEL PROVIDES BETTER PAIN RELIEF THAN WHEN COMBINED WITH PERIPROSTATIC NE RVE BLOCK DURING TRANSRECTAL rsity of Foggia, Italy Aim: To compare the efficacy and safety of perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine (PILP) cream wh en combined with lidocaine-ketorolac (LK) gel and with periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) in relieving pain during transrectal prostate biop sy (TPB). Patients and Methods: A total of 200 patients were randomized to receive PI LP cream combined with L K gel (group 1), or combined with PPNB (group 2) before TPB. Th e 0-to-10 point visual analog scale (V AS) was used for assessing pain at probe insertion and movements (V AS-1), periprostatic infiltration (V AS-2) when applied and at prostate samplin g (V AS-3), as well as maximal procedural pain (MPP). Complications occurring up to 20 days after the proce dure were recorded. Results: The groups were comparable for patient age, serum PSA, prostate volume and cancer detection rate. All patients tolerated the procedure well. The two anesthetic regimens provided almost equal mean V AS- 1 (0.33 vs. 0.37 for groups 1 and 2, respectively; p= 0.701) and V AS-3 (0.52 1 and 2, respectively; p= 0.954) scores, but patients in group 2 reported significan tly greater MPP scores (0.68 vs. 1.53 for groups 1 and 2, respectively; p< 0.0001), as periprostatic infiltration was the most painful part of the procedure (mean V AS-2=1.33). The complication rate was simila r in th e two groups (1% vs. 2% for groups 1 and 2, respectively; p= 0.38). Conclusion: The novel combination of PILP cream and LK g el provide d the same probe- and sampling- related pain relief as the combination of PILP cream and PPNB. Moreover, by preventing the non- negli gible periprostatic infiltration pai n, it provided significantly better overall patient compliance with the procedure. It also was safe and easy to administer. 222 A LONGITUDINAL DEFINITION OF LATE FECAL INCONTI NENCE AFTER 3D-CR T FOR telli, R oma, I taly Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1931 Aim: To evaluate the relation ship between clinical/dosimetric factors and late fecal incontine nce (linc ) after hi gh-dose radiother apy (RT) in pros tate cancer patie nts (patients) accr ued in doses: 70-80 Gy, 1.8-2 Gy/fraction). Toxicity wa s de fined u sing a long itudinal parame ter (mlinc) which to ok into account both the severity and duration of s ymptoms. Patients and Methods : Self-r eported questionnaires of 5 86 patien ts enrolled in the AIROPR OS 01 02 trial with a minimum follow-up of 36 m onths were analyze d with respect to linc. Only p atients with a G0 basal linc were included (550/586). mli nc was defined as the mean score for fecal incontinence calculated ove r the whole follow-up period. G1 l inc was scored if unintentiona l stool dis charge was sometimes experienced; G2 linc exper ience d ofte n or if patie nts used sanitary pads sporadically ; G3 linc was scored if pa tients reported daily uni ntentional s tool discharge or use of sanitary pad more twice/we ek. pretreatment rapy, drug prescription, presence of diab etes or hyper tension, abdomin al surgery pri or to RT, pr esence of acute lowe r gas trointes tinal tox ation of rectal dose, constrai nts mlinc iable (range, 0-2.7 in this popul ation).

A nomogr am was developed for the pr ediction of mlinc 1 (Figure 2). Conclusion: The use of a lon gitud inal defini tion of linc w as useful fo r taking both the duration and the s everi ty of symptoms into account. The u se of mlinc provided additional information which was not seen by anal yzing l inc, as peak toxicity (corresponding to the maximum grade of linc) and a stronger relationship betw een dosimetric (V40Gy) and clinical risk factors (use of antihypertensives, presence of colon mo rbidity before RT and previous abdominal surgery) were revealed. 223 IMPACT OF TRANSRECTAL PROSTATE BIOPSY ON ERECTILE FUNCTION: A PROS PECTIVE STUDY THE FUNCTION (IIEF) Lorus so Foggia, Italy Background: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a r are, although possible, complication after prostate biopsy. Nevertheless, only few st udies have prospectively analyzed this issue through validated questionnaires. The aim of this study wa s to evaluate the impact of transrectal prostate biopsy (TPB) on erectile function through the use of the Internationa l Index of Ere ctile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Patients and Methods: Betwee n June 2008 and J une 2010, all patients scheduled for TPB in our Department completed the IIEF-5 questionnaire before the procedu re. A total of 200 among them who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled for retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) were asked to complete the IIEF- 5 questionnaire again befor e RRP. Results: The mea n patient age was 56 ye ars, mea n PSA wa s 6.3 ng/ml a nd me an prosta te volume was 47 cm3. The mean IIEF-5 score was 21 before TPB and 20 before RRP, and this difference was not significant. However, while in patients 65 years of age, the mean IIEF-5 score was 19 before TPB and before RRP, in patients <65 years of age, the mean IIEF-5 sc ore decreased from 22 before TPB to 19 RRP ( RRP, where as ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1932 Figure 1 Figure 2 39 and 54 patients (19.5 and 27% , respective ly) unde rwent unilateral and bilateral ner ve-spar ing RRP, r espec tively. Of the 104 pat ients <65 years of a ge, 33 (31.7%) we re not considere d eligible f or a nerve-spa ring R RP because of tumor charact eristics (27) or IIEF-5 score befor e . If we had used IIEF-5 bef ore R RP, another 14 (19.7%) out o f the 71 patients who under went ner ve-sparing RRP would have been excluded because of IIEF- 5 <17. Discussion and Conclusion: The present study s howed tha t in patie nts <65 ye ars of age, a TPB yielding the diagnosis of prostate cance r may lead to a significant redu ction in the IIEF-5 sc ore. Since this index is currently us ed to decide a patient's eligibility for nerve-s parin g radical pros tatectomy, it should be tter be eva luate d before TPB rather than befor e RR P. 224 PREDICTIVE VALUE OF CYSTOSCOP IC FINDINGS IN MUSCLE-INVASIVE BLADDER CANCER Frances co Ior i 1, Antonio Luigi Pastore 2, Giova nni Pa lleschi 2, Andrea Ripoli 2, Dome Anto a Universit\u00e0 di Roma Roma, Italy Background : The definiti ve diagno sis of bladde r cancer is possib le only through cystoscopy. Urinary c ytology, performed on the bas is of clinical suspicion (micro- and/or macroscopic hema turia, d ysuria in the absence of obstruc tion), or the presence of a bladder n eoplasm on ultrasound, a lthough it can help to assess the degree of tum or aggressiv eness, does not provide information about the pathological stag e. In this study, we tried to assess how and whether it is possible t o pre dict the infiltration of muscle c ancer on the ba sis of persona l experience and data obtaine d with c ystoscopy c arried out and M ethods: From Janua ry 1998 to December 2007, 453 pati ents with histologically confirmed primar y bladd er cancer were evaluate d in ou r depa rtmen t following endoscopic treatme nt. The patie nt age ranged from 32 to 83 (mean, 66.4) ye ars; 386 were men , with a mal e-to- female ratio of 5.8:1. Pa thologica l staging was re assessed according to the UIC C classific ation (2002) , and the the WHO c riteria (2004) . Before endoscopic surgery, all patients underwent renal and bladder ultrasonography an d urinary cytology. The cytol ogy was p ositive in 291 patients (54.3%). Prior to tra nsureth ral resection, the operator e xpresse d an opinio n, based on personal exper ience, on th e possibilit y tha t the cancer wa s invasive or not, paying particular attention to the following tumor characteristics: number of tumors, size (in case of multiple tumors , the large st lesion w as assesse d), appeara (papilla ry or ry), the stalk of the tumor (sessile or pedunculated). All patients were at the first manifestation of disease. Mu ltivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine whic h variables signific antly predicted muscle pathological results after endos copic resection are shown in Table I. Most bla dder tumor s were transitional cell carcinomas, with the presence of squamo us-cell type in a smal l number of cases. Of the 71 patie nts with invasi ve cancer (15.7% radic al cystectomy.

T he results indicate that the no n-papi llary form, sessi le stalk of tumor and tu mor size >1 cm a re the most representative characteristics significantly associ ated with a hig her risk of muscle infiltration. Discussion and Concl usion : The treatm ent of bladder canc er was co rrelated with the pat hological stage of the pr imary cancerous le sion. Our ex perience confirmed that the appear ance, stalk a nd size of the tumor are independent r isk variables assoc iated with musc le infiltr ation. If these independent risk fac tors ar e assoc iated with each other, there is a statistically significa nt increased risk of muscle invasion. The f inding of a tum or with a diamete r greater than 1 cm in combi nation with a sessile form and a non-papillary configuratio n is associated with an increased risk of detrusor inf iltrat ion a nd an estimated 54% chance of muscle invasion. Al though the majority of da ta reported in the literature su ggest that cystoscop y is the most accurate exami nation in the diagnos is of bladde r cancer, it is not yet clear whether tumor musc ular invasion may be diagnosed based on cystoscopic findings. Our results may confirm the experie nce of urologists in as sessing the mus cle invasion of bladder cancer through cystoscopic findings . 1 Herr HW, Donat SM and recurren 168(3) 978-980, 2002. 2 Satoh E, Miyao H and Fujisa wa Y: P rediction of muscl e invasion of bladd er cancer by cystoscopy.

Various PSA- based paramet ers, such as PSA d ensity, PSA velocity and free-to-total PSA ratio, have been suggested to play a role in indicating PBx, but none has reached high levels of accura cy. The present s tudy aimed to deter mine the role of urodynamical parameters, such as the maximum flo w (Qma x) rate and the post-void residual (PV R) in predicting the outcome of PBx. Patients and Methods: From December 2005 to October 2009, all non-catheterized patients scheduled for first PBx because of elevated PSA (>4 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination underwent uroflowme try before PBx. The value of PSA, prostate volume, PSA de nsity (PSAd ), Qmax , and PVR in predicting or excluding the diagnosis of prostate cancer was then analyzed. Results: Of 1004 patients, 10 were excluded because they were affected by prosta tic intra epithelial neopla sia (PIN, 5 c ases) or atypical small ac inar proliferation (ASAP, 5 cases). Of the re maining 994 patie nts, 373 (37.5% ) were . an alysis inical nd namical parameters were cancer; In multivariate analysis, howev er, PVR w as th e mo st important factor ( p< 0.0001). Discussion and Conclusion: PVR correlated inversely with the diagnosis of prostate cancer, res ulting in it being the best predic tive factor in the multivariate analysi s. Being simple and non-invasive, PVR should be used routinely in the de cision-ma king process for PBx. The identificat ion of reli able cut-off values and t he possible inclusion of this paramete r in ad hoc nomogr ams could he lp prevent a numbe r of unnece ssary PBx. 227 UPPER IRCCS M I Patients w ho rgone radical cystec tomy for urothelia l cance r are at risk for recurrence of tra nsitiona l cell carcinoma (TCC) on the up per urinary tract. Previous studies identified several risk factors for TCC recurrence, although the predictive value of each factor still remain s controversial. Both Eu ropean an d Ame rican urological guidelines lack these topics, referring only to isolated works with large causative studies. Materials and Methods: A bibliographic search covering the period from January 1970 to July 2010 was conducted on PubMed, MEDLI NE a nd EMBASE. The analysis was based on 27 studies that fulfilled ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1934 the predefined inclusion criteria. Data were analyzed in two ways: a fixed- effect l ogistic regression appr l of 13,185 patie nts were included. Follow-up was described in 22 studies, ranging from 0.36 to 349 .2 months. T he ove rall pr evale nce of recurrence of the upper u rinar y tract after cystec tomy ranged from 0.75 to 6.4%. TCC recurrence evidence appear ed after 0.4 to 164 month s. The pr esent ation was in a tions had poor survival rates. Patients affected by low-grade disease showed a strong significant diff erence in TCC recurrenc e compared to those having higher g rade dise ase. The same differ ence in TCC recurrence w as report ed between patients with carcinoma in situ or superficial disease and those with muscle -inva sive disease. Patients with a hi story of carcinoma in situ did not have statistically significa nt different re currence r ates from those presenting with solit ary bla dder TCC. Mor eover, there was no statistically signifi cant di fference i n TCC r ecurrence rates betw een the different ty pes o f diversion adopted . In 24 studies , follo w-up was ca rried out through perio dic radiological assessment of the upper urinary tract, while in 20 studies , urinary cytology was used in the follow-up. In 14 studies , 166 r ecurrences were , the uppe r urinary tract recurrence was diagnosed due to the f ollow-up. The othe r recurrences ( 62%) were diagnosed after the appearance of sympto ms. A mong the 5537 patients wh o underwent the fol low-up pathway with a urinary cytological examination, recurre nces were diagnosed in 1.8. This rate rose to 7.6 with a follow-up perf ormed with periodic upper urin ary trac t imaging. Conc lusion: The recurrence values appear low conside ring the panur othelia l field defect theor y, but these values reflect the morta lity related to the initial bladder cancer. A group of patients at high risk does exist, considering their anamnesis and the ir definitive pathological examination ta ken from c ystectomy specimens.

These models have been internally validated and they still require external validation. Our aim wa s to externally validate the pre- and postoperative model developed by Karakiewicz predicting cancer-specific survival in patients affected by RCC . Patients and Methods: Our multicenter retrospective study consisted of a total of 2570 cases from 7 European sites. Patie nts who unde rwent either radica l or partial nephrec tomy were en rolled. For each patient, prognostic sco res w ere calculated according to two models: the preoperative Karakiewicz (2009) mo del and the postoperative Kara kiewicz (2007) mode l.

Discrimina ting ability was assessed by the Harre ll C-inde x for censore d data stratified by center and with 95% confidence intervals (C I). Results: A total of 2046 patients were eligible for the analyses (mean age at diagnosis: 61\u00b111 years; male 5.7\u00b13.1 cm) . Lo cal and systemic symptoms were present in 383 (18.7%) and 181 (8.8%) of the patients , respective ly. T he media n follow-up w as 46 months.

Both models disc riminate d we ll. stratified C-index for CSS was: 0.776 (95% CI=0.741- 0.811) for pati ents) and 0.840 (95% CI=0.811-0.868) for the postoperative o ne (on 1997 patients). Conclusion: Our study better defined the general applicability of these pr ognostic models for predicting survival in patients with RCC treated with nephrectomy. Our results suggest that the postoperative model discriminates substantially better than the preoperative mo del.

Within th is context, the use of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA- 3) tes t is growing p rogre ssively. T he prima ry endpoint of this pragmatic study was to assess the c urrent indication for performing the PCA-3 test in a consecutive patient population from So uth Italy. Seco ndary endpoints wer e to assess the adequacy of the results with su bsequent clinical decision s and the perform ance of the assay. Patients and Methods: A total of 1100 patients who underwent PC A-3 test betwee n September 2009 and December 2009 were interviewed. The following data were collected: physician who prescribed the PCA- 3 test, pretest total serum PSA (tPSA), PCA -3 score, possible performance of prostate biopsy after test and histopathological findings. Sensitivity and specificity of the test at different PCA3 cut-off values were also eval uated. Resu lts: To date, complete data on 207 patients have been collected. Patients treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors were excluded from the study (n=122). In 206/207 (99.5%) cases, the P CA-3 tes t was prescribed by the urologist. A tota l of 63/207 (30%) patients had rostate biopsy a nd 144/207 (70%) had undergon e r more biopsy sets for tPSA>3 .0 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examin ation before the PCA-3 test. The (44.5% ) patients under went prostate biops y, with a mean P CA-3 score of 70 (ra nge: 6-253) a nd a mean tP SA of 9.2 (r ange : 1.45-34) ng/ml. In 115 patients with a mean PCA-3 score 29 and mean tPSA 9.3 ng/ml, a pros tate biopsy was not performed. Prostate cancer was found in 29/92 (31.5% ) of patients who unde rwent biops y after the PCA-3 test. In this patient group, the mea n PCA-3 score was significantly higher than in the patients with negative prostate biopsy (93.5 vs. 54.7, respectively; p< 0.01). We found the best results at a PCA-3 score cut-off of 50; specifically, positive predictive value, sensitivity, specific ity and clinica lly significant cancer missed were 48%, 86% , 58% and 13.7%, respectively. Discussion and Conclusion: The preliminary results of this study demonstrated the enthusiasm of the urologists for this new biomarker, but also their desire to use it as a screening test for prostate cancer. Moreover, we found a tendency not to perform prostate biopsies after the test: Blind faith in a new biomarker that is still under investigation? 231 LONG-TERM COM PLICATIONS IN NON- SURGICALLY TREATED PATIENTS: SINGLE-CENTER Simone Crivella M aria Abbinna te Santa Maria della Misericordia, Udine , Italy Background: Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplas m in ma les and the incidence is increasing every year.

This registry was designed to prospectively document early results of LESS procedures in ur ology among a l arge group of clinical cases. The aim of this study was to present the periope rative outcome s in an observational cohort of patie nts who underwent LESS surgery at advanced laparoscopic centers for upper urinary tract diseases. Three cen ters from three countries were approved to participate in the study. LESS surgery was clinically applie d in 162 patients. Intra- and postoperative paramet ers were prospectively documented. Patients and Methods: Demographic data including age, body mass index, operative variables, estimated blood loss, operative indications, complications and postoperative visual analog pa in scale scores were accrued. Patient s wer e follow ed postoperatively for ev idence o f adverse ev ents. Results: Between September 2007 and Decem ber 2010, 162 patients underwen t LES S sur gery of t he upper urina ry tract. The mean patient age w as 54 year s and the mea n body ma ss inde x was 27 kg/m 2. Specifically, the accounting overall construc tive proc edures. intra- and perioperativ e data were consistent with publi shed data. the overall mean operative time was 170 min ( 177 min for renal extirpa tive proce dures and 211 min for pyeloplasty), with a mea n blood loss of 157 ml . The me an scar size w as 3.8\u00b11.1 cm. In 57 cases, an additional 2- or 5-mm port was added. Eight patients required conversion to standard lapar oscopy. No ma jor intraope rative complic ations occurred, but three cases with intraoperative bleeding required conversion to open surgery; the overall conve rsion rate was 6.7%. A postoperative complication rate of 11.7% w as recorded (19 events), with Clavien I-II complications representing 89% and III-IV 11%. The pain scale score at discharge was 1.4/10. The mean length of stay was 4.3\u00b11.7 days. Conclusion: The LES S surgery for the upper urinary tract is technically feasible for a variety of ablative and reconstructive applications. With proper patient selection, conversion and complication rates are low. Fu rther clinical research is warranted to determine selection criteria, to fully prove the benefits of LESS surgery over conventional laparoscopy and to define the role of LESS in the field of minimally invasive surg ery. Impro vement in instru mentation and technology is likely to expand the role of LESS in minimally in vasive urological surgery.

Material s and M ethods: A PubMed search wa s performed for all relevant ur ological litera ture regarding LESS and adrenal surgery. In nce gaine d at the Authors' own institu tions was considered. L aparoscopi c adrenalectomy i s considered the standar d surgical procedur e for patients with benign adrenal aden omas. L ESS adrenal surg ery can be effectiv ely performed for a ll patients e ligible for laparoscopic surgery and has the same indic ations a s standard laparoscopy (1). LESS adren al surgery c an use both transperitoneal and retro peritoneal approaches. The most c ommon position for access is the umbilicus, for esthe tic benefits. Nevertheless, umbilical ac cess can be extrem ely challengi ng due to the angle of approach, the long distanc e from the entry por t to the target organ and difficult organ retr action. Differ ent approaches, such as a subcos tal or retroperit onea l appr oach ging LESS surgery to obvia te the se proble ms. The sur geon faces t he same s urgical ste ps constr aints and limitations related to LESS, mainly arisin g from ins trumen t crushing an d the lack of true triangul ation. T he use of artic ulating instrume nts can resolve the problems of triangulation but the y are encumbered by difficult use, poor ergo nomic s and th e lack of suff icient h to provide r suc as cross- or one- handed manipulation. This may contribu te to an increase in tissue r e-grasping and suboptima l angle f or a precise and safe dissection and can ult imately tr anslate into prolonged operat ive time. Sp ecific access de vices al low m ultiple instruments to be p assed through them at t he same t ime. Numer ous types of p orts have bee n described for LES S adrenal ectomy, suc h as Tri Port, SILS, and OCTOport. Over the las t two year s, several groups ha ve reported their early outcome s of LESS adrenalectomy. The se series are all limited by a small sample size and mostly a ddress the f easibility of the procedur e. Jeong et al . (2) com pared the out comes of 9 LESS adr enalectomies w ith 17 conventional were similar between the two groups. No differences were found in terms of mean operative time, blood loss and postoperative hospital stay. Postoperative pain was significant ly lower in the LESS group. In a study compar ing the outcome s of 19 LESS adrenalectomie s with 38 re trope ritoneosc opic adrenalectomies, the authors found no difference in terms of the estimated blood loss, postoperative h ospital stay and postoperative complications. The LESS group had a longer median operative time, whe reas the in-hospital use o f analgesics was significantly less. Ishida et al . found no significan t differe nces in operati ve time, estimate d blood loss or resumption of ora l intake b etween 10 co nsecutive transumbilical LES S adrenalectomies and 10 co nventional l aparoscopic adrenalectomies for benign adrenal tum ors. In the LESS group only, time wa s needed to adjust the roticulator. After subtracting the time needed for adjustment, the operative t ime between two groups was mor e comp arable. In the largest comparative matc hed-control study (3) (50 single-access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies vs. traditional retroperitoneoscopic three-port approach), the operative time was longer for the LESS group. In the LESS gr oup, pain medication was less frequently administered and the mean hospital stay w as also shorter. Results an d Conclusion: Despite promising early outcomes, the benefits of LESS are not obvious at present, with the only claimed advantage being cosmet ic. Further clinical research studies, including those with a long-term follow-up, are warranted to determine selectio n criteri a, to elucidate the cost effectiveness and the benefits over conventional laparoscopy and to define the oncologic safety of LESS adrena l surgery . 1 McCauley LOW-UP IN WITH ISOLATED ATYPICAL SMALL ACINAR PROLIFERATION ON P ROSTATE NEEDLE BI Galos i 1, Vito Lacetera 1, Luca Leone 1, Rodolfo M ontir oni Roberta M azzucchelli 2, Alessandro Conti (2011) 1938 Aim: The aim of this retro spective stu dy was to evaluate the incidence of pr ostate canc er with a medium term follow-up in patients with isolated at ypical small acinar p roliferation (ASA P) results on init ial prostate biopsy. Patients and Metho ds: A total of 124 out of 140 ASAP only cases wer e selected. Selection criteria wer e: ASAP o nly in biopsy, central review of all slides , clinical follow-up of at least s ix months with at least one re -biops y. Sixteen cases were exclud ed: ten cases were lost to follow-up a nd six de clined re-biops y. From 1998 to 2010, 14 0 pat ients with ASAP were select ed from our pr ostate biopsy databas e, composed of 3360 uns creen ed who underwent tra nsrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Clinical par ameter s (age, digital rectal examination fin dings, total and fr ee PSA and prostate volume) an d biopsy parameter s (site, s ide and number of cores per b iopsy set ) were available for all cases. Indications for re-b iopsy and follow-up s trategies were d iscussed on an individual patient basis, depending on pati ent age, serum PSA values , imagi ng (trans rectal ultra sound or MR I), digital rect al ex amination findi ngs and urologist preference. Follow-up was considered from the initial biopsy wit h ASAP to the last follow-u p visit or di agno sis of cancer. S urgical specimens were anal yzed a ste acco rding s lides (includi ng initial and follow-up biopsies) and surgical s pecimens was carried out by a si ngle uropathologis t. ASAP di agnosis was obtained by perfo rming 6 to 24 rando m biopsies (m edian: 12 biopsies). The m ean patie nt age w as 64.8\u00b17.4 (co nfidence interval (CI)=52-76 ) years; the mean PSA was 7 .0 \u00b14.8 (CI=2-1 5.9) n g/ml and mean pr ostate volume was 5 3\u00b121 cm 3. Results: Isolated ASAP was identified in 140/3360 cases (4.1%): 124 selected cases with isolated A SAP un derwent at l east one fol low-up biopsy; 35, 11, 5, 2 and 1 patient had a second, third, fourt h, fifth and sixth follow-up biopsy, resp ectiv ely. Can cer was f irst, seco nd, third and fourth fo llow-up biopsies, respectively. T he mean follow-up was 32 (range=6- 131, CI=6-80, median= 24) mo nths. A total of 21/124 patient s (16.9 %) had biopsy befo re ASA P diagnosis. All clinical parameter s were assoc iated w ith cancer, with statistical relevance. Can cer was tre ated with ra dical pro statectomy in 21 patients; re-biops y of thes e cases reve aled 10 insignific ant cancer cases and 11 re levan t cancer cases. Extracap sular disease or semin al vesicle invasion (5 patients) and/or positive margins (3 pa tients) w ere o bserved in 5/2 1 patient s with sm all volume cancer located in the subcapsular anterior or apic al gland, or the medial sub urethral g land. Conclus ion: In patients with isolated A SAP, the overall cancer detecti on rate was 45.2%. N early all canc er cases (98%) were detecte d with the third biopsy after 24 months of fo llow-up. C ancer detected after initial ASAP is still curable; however 5 out of 2 1 cases (23%) submitted to surgery had adver se path ological features. Such cases, with small volume tumor and unusual cancer locatio ns (anterior, su bcapsular o r suburethral), m ay be undersampled by standard biopsy approaches, increasing the risk of extracapsular extension, early seminal vesicle inva sion and positive margins. We suggest that the first repeat biopsy using a saturation strategy could reduce the need for fu rther biopsies; however a differen t biopsy strategy should be considered in order to detect a potential ag gress ive can cer located in unusual sites. 235 HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS AND NON-M USCLE INVASIVE UROTHELIAL BLADDER CANCER: POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP FROM A PILOT STUDY Daniele Tiscione 1, Tomma so Cai 2, Sandra Mazzoli 3, Background: between urothelial bladder cancer and high-risk human papillomav iruses (HR -HPV) is still poorly understood, even though some studies hav e suppos ed a possible cor relation.

Materials and Me thods: The Testut and Jacob \"Traite d e Anatomie \" published in 1904, the up -to-date version published by U TED in 19 50, the review of 11300 PubMed papers from 1951 to 2010, and our perso nal experience since 1968 were used f or a cr itical and objective evaluation of germ cell testicular tumors in the last centur y. Results: The fi rst step in underst anding the natural histolog y of testicular ger m-ce ll tumors wa s the finding of lymph node metastasis t o para-aortic lymph nodes, upward to cis terna chyli. Initial progre ss in the manage ment of retroperiton eal metastases was due to ra diothe rapy and retroperiton eal lymph node disse ction (R PLN D) in combination with an unders tanding of the different natural sensitivity to r adiotherapy of pure seminoma and non- semino ma, even if some n orthern European coun tries w ere reluctant to use RPLND for a long time .

A cumulative survival curve was d rawn using the Kaplan-Meier method (lo g-rank test). Results: From Januar y 200 2 to O ctober 2010, 147 pa tients (mean age: 68.8\u00b110.0 years, mea n follow- up: 25.2\u00b122.8 months) wer e enrolled in the study. At first TUR, 103 patients had a solitary tumor and 44 had multiple lesions; 3 patients showed concomi tant carcinoma in situ (CIS). At R eTUR, residual cancer was detected in 65 (44.2% ) patients. There was no significant statistical association between primitive tumor focalization and evidence of r esidua l cancer at ReTUR: 43.7% (45/103) of patients wit h solitary tumor had residual cancer compared with 45.4% (20/44) of patients with multiple lesions ( p= 0.85). Of the patients with residual cancer at ReTUR , 27 (18.3%) presented identical stage and grade, while 24 (16.3%) were upstaged to T2. Histological outcomes of the other patients with residual cancer were: 4 patients with TaG1, 1 patient with TaG 3, 2 patients with T1G1, 1 patient with T1G2, 2 p atients with T1G2 associated with newly diagnosed C IS and 4 patients with C IS. There were signific ant differe nces in the follow-up period (33.6 vs. mont 0.008) and nce rate 0.05) between NR T and NM IRT patients, respectively. Progression of the disease occurred in 13.4% and 14.6% of NRT T1G3 TC C is a safe procedure that allows a considerable number of residual and understaged tumors to be identified (44.2% a nd 16.3%, respectively). However, the foremo st finding in our study is the statistically significant difference in recurrence rate between patients with and without residual cancer on ReTUR.

Patients and Methods: In 35 patien ts (tumor group; age: 63.9\u00b110.6 years) with SBC, sample s from the bladder tumor and disease-free bladder mucosa were obtained. In the control group of 23 healthy individuals (age : 65.3\u00b110.1 years), samp les from the bladder mucosa were collected. In all samples, TL was detected by Southern blot, while the expression of hTERT a nd of several TBP ( TRF1, tern blot. Histological examina tion w as carrie d out on all samples. The patients underwent immuno- or che mothera py, and for all of them, cytoscopy was performed at 3, 6 and 12 mont hs. Statistical analysis of the results was performed u sing the parametric ANOV A test and the post-hoc Bonferroni test. Statis Resu lts: The histological nation in the tumor group revealed 15 (42.9%) high-grade (HG) SBC and 20 (57.1%) low-grade (LG) SBC. The stage varied betwee n Ta and T1. A statistically significant difference w as found betwe en the control and the tumor group (LG and HG) for a ll paramete rs tested (TL, hTERT, TRF1, TRF2 , PARP1 and TANK). No statistically significant difference was found within the tumor group between LG and HG f or TRF 2. In the biopsies performed on the appare ntly healthy mucosa of the patients with LG and HG SBC, a statistically significant difference was observed for TBP and hTE RT but not for TL. Compa red with the c ontrol s amples , the samples of healthy mucosa of patients with SBC were found to be significantly different for all parameters analyzed. At the cystoscopic follow-up, a total of 11 tu mor recur rences were obser ved: 8 of them in the previous Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1941 HG (2 at 3 months, 4 at 6 months a nd 2 a t 12 months) and 3 in the LG (2 at 6 months and 1 at 12 months ).

It is used to palliate disease symptoms and prolong the time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression after standard hormonal therapy. This study described our ongoing experience with a ketoconazole-based treatment for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) . Patients and Method s: Of 25 patients enro lled in this study, 7 were in treatment, while 18 completed the treatment (stopped due to progression). The latter were evaluated in this analysis. All patients had HRC P and were previously treated with LH/RH ag onist (plus two concomitant lines of peripheral anti-androgens) and afterwards th on (600 mg/ day), dutasteride, hydrocortisone, gastric protection liver with Monoselect Sylibum (Silybum marianum L. Fruits ES, fitosomia l, slow r elease, 210 mg standardized in sylima rin). Three patients did not take sylima rin and dutasteride. Every month, clinica l examination, CBC, PSA and hepatic function were recor ded to verif y pos sible toxic ity. PS A wa s use d as a surrogate endpoint for response to treatment. Results: All patients regularly took ketoconazole. With regard to PSA response (change from baseline), decline was recorded in 9 patients (50%), stabilization in 3 (17%) and increase in 6 (33%). With regard to the duration of response (time t o progression), the average was 5.3 (median: 4, range: 3-16) months. T he average tim e to reach PSA nadir was 2. 1 mon ths. Among the three patients who did n ot take sylima rin, o ne had drug acute hepatitis, whe reby the treatment was ended and another had an increase of transamin ases (\u00d72.5). Only one patient treated with sylimarin had ic increase of transaminases (\u00d72) and bilirubin (\u00d72). Conclusion: A schedule, blocking multiple steps in androgen synthesis and activity, was used in this study, namely ketoco nazole t o inhibit CYP1 7A1 a nd dutasteride to inhibit type I and II 5alpha- reductases. Moreover, liver protection was used to increase tolerance to treatment. Sylimarin (especially, its component sylibinin) appeared to be suitable for this purpose, also considering its antineoplastic activity (it inhibits cell growth and induc es apoptos is in human pr ostate ca ncer cells).

Surgery is the most common among radical treatm ents but has certain adverse effe cts. The purpose of this study was to ev aluate the oncol ogic l d at the Department of Urology, Un ivers ity of Bologna. Patients and Methods: This retrospe ctively analyz ed a cohort of 297 patie had unde rgone la paroscopic radical prostatectomy betwee n 2002 and 2008. All data were collected from questionnair es and me dical records comple ted dur ing hosp italization , o utpatient pr ocedures and tele phone inter views. The surgical techni que ad opted was, initia lly, a tsouris appro ach a nd, subseque ntly, . Patients with PSA<4 ng/ml ha d a BRFS of cases, while those with preop erative PSA>10 ng/ml, had a B RFS rate of 23%. At 42 months, the f ollow ing functional resul ts were ob served: urinary e : 89% sexua l pot ency (sa tisfac tory se xual inter course with or wit hout ora l the rapy): 83%; average intraoperati ve blood loss: 200 ml (ne ed for transfusion: 3% ); average du ration of surg ery: 125 90) ca thete r: 11 days; orphine. Discussion and Conc lusion: Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy outcomes are simila r to those of open sur gery, particularly regarding the onset of biochemi cal relapse and disease progression. Moreover, regarding the fu nctional results, the technique has also proven its effectiveness, both in terms of continence and potency (when a nerve-sparing approach is taken) . Laparoscopic radical p rostatectom y should be proposed as a first-choice surgical treatme nt in centers where laparos copy is performe d routine ly. 1 Guillonneau B, H, B aumert H, Cathelineau X, et al : Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: oncological evaluation after 1000 cases at Montsouris J Urol 169(4) : 1261-1266, 2003. 2 Lepor H: A review o f surgical techniques for radical prostatectomy.

PCa c an be accurately detected only by prosta te biop sy (PBx), while i s not clearly detectable using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and other diagnos tic methods such as measureme nt of PSA level. For this reason, guidelines for PC a diagnosis suggest ra ndom tissue sampling (at least 8-12 cores, depending on gland volume) be p erformed when PCa su spicions arise from standard diagnos tic methods . The P Bx sampling procedure is TRUS- guided and roughly costs 20\u20ac /core, including the cost of the subsequent histological analysis. Even though a ccuracy grows with the number of PBx cores taken, the cost, pati ent discomfort a nd the a dvers e-event probability grow a s well. It is thus desirable to reduce the number of PBx cores without having a negative impa ct on dia gnos tic accuracy. Patie nts and Methods: This w ork describes the follow-up of a re trospective study aiming to evaluate the feasi bility of a reduction in the number of PBx cores through the application of a custom-bu ilt real-time computer-a ided biops y (rtCAB) tool. The technique Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1943 enhances T RUS video strea ms with a live false-color overla y image. Relativ e organ-to-tra nsduce r movem ents are tracked and co mpensated in ord er to provide a stable classification map, which is useful to guide the phy sician during tissue sampling. The recorded signal is split into re gions of intere st (ROIs) and s tatistical para mete rs are estimated with an optimized algorithm. Finally, a nonlinear su pervised classification mod el discrimi nates between PCa ri sk levels and the res ults are superi mposed on the T RUS im age. The monocentr ic, single-opera tor p rostate gland aden ocarcinoma database built to train rtCA B was expanded to enlist 129 patients (50 of them with pathologica l dise ase) for a total of 1303 PB x cores and 26060 R OIs. F or ea ch core, several data were collected, in particular the ultrasound imag e intensity and the histological outcome , making it possib le to estim ate the corres pondence between the patholog ical state the its ultr asound signat ure. Results: The sy stem was optimized for reducing the numbe r of false p ositives while preservi ng an acceptable n umber of false negatives. Motion trackin g improved the stabi lity of the classification between frames. I n addition, the exten ded database a llowed us to better estimate the pos itive predic tive value of the classical double - sextan t PB x (23.6 %) an d the r tCAB method (38.9%). Discu ssion and Conclusion: Thanks to i ts real-time i mage processing capabilities, the proposed method ma y increase t he detection rate and may be helpf ul in finding regions sufficiently r epresenting the cancer. As a con sequence, if used to guide biops ies, the method ma y provide a si gnificant (>30%) reduction in the nu mber of biopsy cor es requ ired to obtain the same d etection rate achieved by the standar d double sextant biopsy, wi th red uced healthcare costs. The reduction in the numbe r of bio psy c ores may also reduce the prob ability for post-mapping complications and, even mor e importantly, improve patient compliance . 1 Ferlaya J, Par kinb DM and S teliarova-Fouche E: Estima tes of cancer incidence and mortality in E urope in 2008.

The Prostate C ancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol was embraced in Novem ber 2007. Here, we present results on the first 150 patients who were enrolled in PRIAS up to February 2011. Patients and Methods: PRIAS entry criteria were as follows: informed consent, initial prostate-specif ic antigen (iPSA) 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T2, Glea son pattern score (GPS) 3+3, maximum 2 positive cores and PSA densi ty <0.2 ng/ml/cc. Foll ow-up was schedu led with PSA measurement every 3 months, digital rectal examination (DRE) every 6 months, re-bi opsy after 1 year of AS. Whe n PSA doubling time (PSADT) was between 3 and 10 years, a yearly repeated biopsy was scheduled. Whenever during the follow-up the P SADT wa s less than 3 years, the cl inical stage was >T2 or the repeat b iopsies showed more than two positive cores or a GPS >3+3, the protocol advised a change to active treatm ent. Th e quality of life (Q oL) o f patients participating in the PRIAS protocol was also evaluated. QoL data were collected through two questionnaires: the mini mental adjustment to cancer (MINI-Mac) and the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-prostate (FACT-P ). QoL evaluation was planned for a 5-year p eriod, throug h 8 screening ph ases. We present a prelimina ry eva luation of QoL evolution between AS e nrolment and 15 months after PR IAS acceptance. Results: A total of 150 patients were enrolled in PRIAS (February 2011). At a me dian fol low-up of 18 (range: 3.2-44.6) months, 119/150 patients rem ained under observation. Th ree patients dropp ed out du e to comorbiditie s, one due to personal choice (anxiety), tw o due to lack of compliance w ith the PR IAS protocol and one due to n on- PCa-related death. A total of 24/150 (16%) patients dropped out be cause of cancer progre ssion: e ight due to PS ADT, three due to upgrading (first re-biopsy), five due to disease upsizing (four at first and one at second re-biopsy ) and eight due t o both upsizing and upgrading (six at first and two at second re-biopsy). The actuarial treatment-free survival was 86.3% and 72.9% at 13 and 25 months, resp ectiv ely (all cau ses). When considering biopsy-related drop-out, the respect ive rates were 90.6% and 86.8% (25 months), while th ey were ANTICANCER RESEARCH 31 : 1807-1956 (2011) 1944 99.1% en conside date, no unfa vorable ou tcome has b een o bserved. The follo wing parameters were no t significantly ass ociated with PCa pr ogres sion: iPSA, age, stage, GPS, number of positive cores at biops y, maximu m co re len gth containing can cer, PSADT and DR E. The QoL investigation showed an improvement with time i n co ping with the d isease. Specifically, the perc entage o f patien ts 30% (at AS enro llmen t) to 18.2% (at tance); preoc red uced from 11 .5% and 3.4 % (a t AS enrollme nt) to 2 .3% and 0% ( at 15 month s), respectively. s ocial and funct ional well-b eing was h igh and showed no releva nt changes d uring the investigated screening peri od. Conclusio n: AS i s feasible in selected men with early p rostate can cer. Ongoing studies are tryin g to optimize AS protocols in order to become ef ficient at det ecting patients wi he one-y ear repeat biopsy is an imp ortant examination which can be used as a diagnostic clar ification point. Further follow-u p is necessary to detect the effect of deferred treatment on dis ease co ntrol. Desp ite the lim ited numb er of patients, the re sults of the QoL study s howed that exhaustive inf ormation, good communication between patients and clin icians, and on-deman d psychological support can help patients cope with a nxiety a nd unc ertainty rela ted to AS acceptance. 247 PROSTATE CANCE R UNITS IN EUROPE: F ROM UTOPIA TO DREAM TO REALITY? Riccardo Valdagni 1, Peter Alber s 2, Chris Bangma 3, Lawrence Drudge- Coates 4, Tiziana M agnani 5, Clare Moynihan 6, Chris Parker 7, Kath y Redmond 8, Cora N. Ster nberg 9, Loui s Denis 10 and to arch and the Royal Marsden NHS Ita ly The mul tidisciplinary approach is particularly important in prostate cancer (PC), where, a ccording to the clinic al state of disease, there are multiple treatment options, as wel l as observational strategies, to choose from. Mu ltidisciplinary, multi-professional manage ment facilitates admini stration of high-quality med ical procedures, co llaboration am ong dedicated specialists, and tailoring of treatment and observational strategies to the patients' needs. Ac cess to specialist counseling, supportive care and rehabilitation are also fundament al. Prostate cancer units (PCU) are places where men with PC can be cared for by specialists working within a multidisciplinary team and these app ear to be the most suitable structures for the care of patients at all stages, from n ewly diagnosed to advanced disease, including preventing and mana ging disease-induced or treatment- induced comp lications, whether physical, emotional or psychologic al. Following the German PC mode l, the British example with urological malignancies and the examp le of European breast cancer units , genera l recomm endations and mandatory requirements for a PCU were identified. General recomme ndations include: European certification process based on the fulfillment of mandatory requirements, a focus on research and clinical trials, teaching for junior staff and students, and manag emen t include: a critical mass of a mi nimum si ze to serve a population of 300,000 people that is capable of attracting 100 newly diagnos ed PC patients (at all age s and stages) wh o are willing to accept all treatme nt and observational strategy protocols conducted under the direction of the Un it's Multidisciplinary team; document ation/audit recording of data on diagnosis, pathology, radical , adjuvant and palliative treatments, observational strategies, clinical outcomes, follo w-up, side-effect s audit meeting once a year with written prot ocols for di agnosi s and manageme nt of PC at all stages.

All core team m embers should attend weekly M DM to disc uss at least 90% of the cases referred to PCU. Decisions should be d ocumented in patient charts. The PCU s hould off er all treatment options (radical prostatectomy, external ra diother apy, b psychologic al support and pa lliative c are) and en sure the patient's right t o in formation and s elf- determination . Patients sh ould be pr ovided with a detailed written record of the trea tment and follow-up plan. PC pa tients should have access to a weekly multidis ciplinar y clinic with a urolog ist, a radiation oncol ogist and a medical oncologist, synch ronously or in rapid succ ession. If possible, a psychol ogist should participate. PC patie nts should be offered follow-up super vised by one core member responsible for the treatm ent.

Priorities in clinical activity were sharing diagnostic, therapeutic, and observatio nal guidelines as a w orking methodology to manage PC patients and setti ng up a MD clinic for PC patien ts. Patients and Meth ods: After determining institutional guidelines, the following MD c linics started in March 2005: (i) a clinic for newly diagnosed, untreated patients and for patients in all states of disease who seek a second opinion: a u rologist, rad iation oncologist, medical oncologist and ps ycholog ist simultane ously meet ten patients once a week; after recording the anamnesis, digital rectal examination and evalu ating co-morbidities, possib observational, and or resear ch protocols are p roposed if the case i s univoca lly interpreted, if the case is complex and no shared decision is reached, it is referred to the multidisciplinary c ase discussion; patients may request psychological support for the decision- making and individual, couple, family or group counseling, with supportive, rehabilitation and palliat ive care g iven on demand; (ii) a follow-up clinic for patien ts on active surveillance (AS) and watchful wait ing: a uro logist an d radiation oncologist meet eight and 6 patients once a week , respectiv ely; (iii) a case discussion (once a week, CME activ ity): speciali sts working in the MD and the prostate program (urologists, rad iation oncologists, and a dminis trative personnel) discuss cases seen multidiscip linaril y plus complex cases examined monodisciplinarily, share decisions taken in the clinic, tailor strateg ies to individual patients whenever possible, include patients in trials and check adherence to institutional guidelines and quality assuranc e. Results: From March 2005 to Decem ber 2010, 2150 MD clinics were run. The disease distribution was analyzed fro m 2006, when an electro nic chart was introduced. While the number of patients with high-risk and metastat ic PC decreased, the number of patients with low-risk PC increased constantly, with a peak in 2009 (61%). This is probably due to the anticipation of diagnosis and to the fact our Institute is one of the few Italian centers where AS is routinely proposed within a research protocol (PRIAS study). Considering the distribution of therapies in a low-risk group population, while in 2006, only 44% of low-risk patients acce pted AS, this increase d to 81% in 2009. This is probably due to the change in patients' attitude s towa rds observational strategy and the credit of our Institute as a referenc e cen ter for AS. Considering the small number of patients with metast atic, advanced and recurrent disease (5.5%) and of no shows, a nurse coordinator was introduced in September 2010 to collect basic i nformation on the cases to be seen and reorganize the clinic lists according to the state of disea se, thus optimizing human reso urces an d having the medical oncologist o n call fo r select ed p atients.

In the literat ure, bra in met astase s are reported t o occur in 2-17% of patien ts with me tastat ic rena l ce ll carcinoma. T he ai m of this study was to ana lyze the incidence and characteristics of pa tients with brain me tastases from RC C treated with targeted thera py. Patien ts and Methods: From March 2007 to October 2010, 43 conse cutive patients affected by metastatic r enal cell c arcinoma w ithout analyzed. Patient 8 females ( 18.7%) , with a me dian a ge of 54 (range 35- 76) year s, KPS 100 (range 60-10 0). A clear renal cell histolo gy w as observed in 41 patie nts patients (72%) p atients were treated as first-line, and 12 (28%) we re pre-trea ted. Results : With a medi an follow- up of 3 2 (range 1-43) months, 6 pa tients (13.9 %) progressed wit h bra in me tastase s. Media n time of treatment was 10 (range 5-27) mont hs. The m edian age was 55 (range 46-70) years, KP S 100 (ra nge 60- 100), clear renal cell histology w as obser ved in 5 pa tients (83 gy in 1 pati (16.7%) Of this gro up, tw o patie nts (33.3%) experienced relapse in an extra cerebral site. No difference was observed in the two groups as regard s ite of metastasis and no patients changed ongoing tr eatment because of onset of brain meta stasis. In 3 patients (50%), brain metastases wer e symptomatic. Th ree pa tients (50%) underwent gamma- knife treatmen t, one patient (16.7%) external radiotherapy and two patients (33.3%) anti-edema therapy. Conclusion: The occurrence o f brain metast ases i n the course of treatment with targeted therapy is a significant event. The ass essm ent of these pa tients requires systematic evaluation of the brain with CT scans and specific local treatments. Th is aspect should be in vestigated wit h a broade ning of the s eries through a ly Adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC) diagnostic criteria (>3/9 Weiss parameters) do not apply well with special variants, including oncocytic (OACC ) and myxoid tumors. A review of 194 ACCs showed that the oncoc ytic variant (20 pa tients: 14 pure OACCs with oncocytes >90% of the tumor; 6 mixed, with clear cell component ranging from 10 to 50%) can hardly be classified using the Weiss system s ince cytoplasmic eosinophilia , atypia and diffuse grow th are intrinsic ally pre sent (thus requiring a h igher diagnostic threshold). The mitochondrial DNA profile of OACCs was analyzed by means of real- time PCR and F ISH, detecting in 5/20 cases the so- called '4977 bp common deletion', which was previously identified in man y oncocytic tumors of other organs ( e.g. kidney, thyroid and salivary gland). Myxoid tumors (17 patients: 14 pure myxoid, of which 1 borderline an d 13 malignant tumors ; 3 with focal myxoid cha nges in othe rwise conventional ACCs) are characterized by cords or nests of medium-size scanty atypical cells in a myxoid background, with a peculiar neurofilame nt expression. The Weiss system might be inade quate to reliably de tect malignanc y in myxoid ACCs because a few crite ria are hard to assess or are poorly represented in myxoid a reas (such as small vessel invasion, diffuse growth pattern and nuclear atypia). The prognosis of patients with these ACC variants seems more compara ble to conven tional ACCs regard ing the myxoid, and more favorable as compared to pure oncocytic ACCs, whe reas this does not hold true f or ACCs having a n oncocytic component.

The aim of this study w as to e valua te the corre lating factors of IPC after catheter remova l. Patients and M ethods : Betwee n July 2002 and Novem ber 2009, 373 pa tients were treated for localized prostate cancer. Among them, 130 patients underw ent brachythe rapy and 243 The follow-up of the RRP group w as limited to 202 p atients , prospectively evaluated , who resid ed in the local geographic region. RR P was performed by a single surge on (MM) following W alsh's procedure and pr eserving the urinary sphincter. On the fifth postoperative day, the ca theter was removed afte r fillin g the bladder with 100 ml of sali ne to te st the immediate continence. Contine nce was considered to be preserved if the pat ient was dry. A multiv ariate analys is was performed to eva luate the association between I PC and preoperative, operative, clinical, hormonal, and pathological variables. The l ong-term contine nce was also ev aluated at on e, three, six a nd twe lve months according to Catalona's c riteria. The sexual poten cy was evaluated at one year postopera tively. Resu lts: The m ean pa tient age was 63.8 (range 49-75) years, 52.5% o f the patients had a Gleason score 6, 80.7% of patients had T1c stage disease a nd 82.7% of patients had P SA 10 ng/ml. Th e IPC rate at catheter removal w as 69%. The logistic multiv ariate regression analysis show ed statistical association between IPC a nd age less than 65 years ( p= 0.02) and sexual pote ncy ( p= 0.02). N o statistic al association w as shown for othe rs factors , such as pr eoperative (biopsy Gl eason score , clinical stage, PSA, D 'Amico risk group, and prostate weight), operative (ner ve spar ing procedure), hormonal (testosterone, LH, FSH, and extraca psula r pT, ason score) variables . At 12-mon th follow-up, 85% of patients were complete ly dry, 12.5% with only occ asional drops of urine and 2.5% were incontinent. Conclusion: Age is a factor correlating to r emoval af ter RRP . Patien ts less than 65 years old have a 2.6- fold increased likelihood o f being continent on the fifth postoper ative day, and IPC patie nts are 3.6-fold more likely to be sexually potent within 12 months. 254 EFFICACY OF USE OF CRANBERRY (GIS OMA) IN PATIENTS WITH SUPERFICIAL BLADDER CANCER Rita M arino , Peppina Lame zia Terme, Ita ly Aim: This work aime d at investigating the efficacy of cranberr y on prevention of urinary tract infection in patients with intravesical instillation of chemo -/immun otherapeutic agents . Patients and M ethods : We evaluate d 82 patients with papillar y tumor fr om October 2009 to Fe bruary 2011. Results: According to the treatment protocols, 38 patient s (28 male an d 10 female) with non-in vasive papillar y carcinoma (T a/TIS) or minimally invasive (T 1) were treated with intravesical chemot herapy induction, week ly schedule with mitomycin (eight weeks), or gemcitabine (six weeks) in tumor recurrence or BCG-refractory disease. A total of 44 patients (37 male and 7 female), with high-grade superficial lesion or multifocal lesion wer e treated with BCG (s ix week s). After we ekly therapy and negative cystoscopy, patients co ntinued wit h monthly maintenance therapy (12 months with BCG, or schedule of one weekly dose for three weeks every six months for two or three years, and eight months with mitomycin and 11 mo nths with gemci tabine). Repeat cystoscopy was performed after the rapy and urinary cytologica l examin ation. Urine culture after TUR a nd cystoscopy, and urine test were carried out be fore inserting a c athete r. During antibiotic thera py (Floxac in, pr evious day a nd two days after intravesical instillation), patients received cranberry: two times a day for three days for weekly the rapy; for monthly the rapy two times a day for seven days , then one time a da y for seven days. At the time of writing, 76 patients had completed the treatment without any evidence of urinary infection. Six patients stopped treatment; two patients died of other comorbidities: three patients due to systemic disease progression, one patient due to infection during instillation with BCG. We retrospectively evaluated 198 patients with papillary tumor, from January 2007 to September 2009. Out of 80 patients treated with intravesical immunother apy with BCG, urina ry infection with symptoms of frequency , urgency and dys uria (especially dur ing wee kly thera py) was observe d in 37 cases and therefore the trea tment was postponed. After the first few months' therapies, 17 patients (age 65 years) stopped the treatmen t due to infectio n. Of 112 patients with intravesical instillation with mitomycin, it was obser ved that treatment was postponed due to infection in 53 patients. Conclus ion: Treatment with cranberry a ppear s to be e ffecti ve in the prevention of urinary tract infection.

Patients and M ethods: After at least s ix weeks from prostate biopsy, 46 c onsecutive patie nts with b iopsy-proven inter media te- or high-r isk P Ca were pr ospectively evalua ted with MRI i n association with DCE-M RI within two w eeks be fore radical pr ostate ctomy (RP). Conventional clinica l staging methods included digital rectal examination (DR E) and tr ansrec tal ultr asound ( TRUS). Asses sment RP spe cime ns were perfo rmed p rostate into 14 regions: 12 prostatic locations (base, inter mediate and a pex, on the left/r ight side and in the a nterior/poster ior position) and two s eminal vesicle locations . T1- and contemporarily by tw o exper t radiolog ists (in agreement) who sco red the likelihood of extracapsular extension (ECE) an d sem inal vesicle invasion (S VI) on a 5- point scale in each of the 14 re gions. We a ssessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predict ive value (PPV), nega tive pr edictive value (N PV) and accuracy with R OC analysis of MRI , DCE- MRI and conv entional st aging methods using pathologic al findings as reference standa rd. Results: The me an age was 65.7 years, the mean PS A was 7.9 ng/ml, the m ean prostate volume was 65.7 ml and th e mean pathological Gleason score was 7.45. At histopathology, 11/46 (24%) patients had pathological ex traprostatic involvement: 5 patients wit h unilateral ECE, 2 patients with bilateral ECE and 2 patients with uni lateral SVI (with concomitant bilateral ECE) a nd 2 patients with bilate ral SVI pr ostatic regions and 92 seminal vesicle regions were evaluated. Table I show s results of diagn ostic accuracy of the different staging methods. DCE-MRI did not improve the diagnost ic accura cy of T1- and T2-weight ed MRI in the evaluation of ECE or SVI. Conclusion: Endorectal T1- and T2-weighted MRI adds important information regarding the preoperative local staging of PCa. With regard to individua l patient analysis, T1- and T2-weighted MRI provides higher values for diagnostic accur acy, i n par ticular, fo r the evalu ation of ECE. The region-by-r egion analys is shows a high negative predictive value, which can be helpful before choosing a nerve-sparing approach. DC E-MR I does not improve the diagnos tic accura cy of M RI in the local staging of PCa . 256 PROGNOST IC SIGNIFICANCE OF POS ITIVE SURGICAL MARGINS AFTER RADICAL PROSTA TECTOMY ccini, Marco Ga rofalo, Italy Aim: We evaluated the impact of positive surgical margins (PSM s) on biochemical relapse (B CR)-free survival after radical prostatectomy. Patients and Methods: We evaluated 837 consecutive patien ts submitted to RP between October 1995 and June 2009. Exclusion criteria were: (i) a follow- up period <12 mont hs, (ii) neoadjuvant or adjuvan t therapy, Abstracts of the 21 st Annual Meetin g of th e Italian Society of Uro -O ncology (SIU rO), 22-24 June, 2011, Naples, Italy 1949 Table I.

B CR was defin ed as a PSA le vel higher than 0.2 ng/ml. Results: The median follow-up was 54.0 ( range 12-159) mont hs. A total of 614 patients (73.4% ) had nega tive surgical margins (R0), while had a single PSM a nd 77 (9.2%) had a multiple PSM s (R1 ). Among the 837 patients, only c-stage, p-stage and p-Gs had an independent s multiv ariate a sig nificant predictor of BCR only in pT2 patients (Table I). In pT 3b pa tients, there were n o signif icant f actors correlated with BCR.

At Cox analys is, pT3b patient s (group 5) had a highe r BC R rat e than the other groups and pT2 pa tients with R0 (group 1) had a low er BCR rate th an the other groups ; there were no significa nt differenc es in the BCR rate among groups 2 to 4. Conc lusion: In our series, the pres ence of PSMs i nfluences the BCR rate only in patie nts with pT 2 dise ase. Mo reover, in men with no semin al vesicle i nvasion but a PSM and/or extracapsular extension, the presence of both pathological features did not portend a worse prog nosis than the presence of either one alone.

Patients and Me thods: We evaluated 872 consecutive patients (pT2-4 NX/0/1) who underwent RP between October 1995 and June 2009. Exclusion criteria were : (i) a follow-up period <12 mont hs, (ii) neoadj uvant or adjuvant therapy, (iii) incom plete follow- up data, (iv) pT0, and (v) incomplete clinical and pathological data. BCR was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >0.2 ng/ml. The patients were divided i nto three groups according to the clinical risk of LNI: low-ri sk group (cT1a-T2a and 8-10 or PSA >20 ng/ml). The patients were also divided into two groups according to the numbe r of LNs removed: group 1, with 0 to 9 LNs removed, and group 2 with 10 LNs removed. The primary endpoint was BCR -free survival. Resul ts: The Overal l, 305 patients (35%) ha d pNx tumor and 567 patients (65.0%) pN0/1. In the 567 patients who underwent PLND, the mean number of LNs dissected was 10.9; 49 of these patients (8.6%) had pN1. In the 402 patients at low-risk of LNI, the number of LNs removed was not a significant predictor of BC R at the univariate analysis. On the contrary, in the 470 patients at intermed iate- and high-risk of LNI , patients in group 2 (10 LNs removed) had a significant ly lower BCR- free survival at the univariate and multivariate analyses ( p= 0.021) (Figure 1). In the 33 pN1 patients with 2 LN metastasis, patients in group 2 had a significantly lower BCR- free survival at the univariate and multivariate analysis ( p= 0.006) (Figure 2). Conclusion: In our study population, a more extensive PLND positively affected BCR-free survival, regardless of the nodal status in patients with intermedia te- and high-risk pr ostate cancer.

Orsola -Malpighi, University of Bologna, I taly Background : We evaluated the association s be tween the number of lymph nodes re trieved during radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer (BC ) and the ca ncer-spe cific survival (CSS). Patie nts and Metho ds: We evaluated 229 consecutiv e patients who had undergone RC for BC between November 1995 and Octob er 2009 with complete f ollow -up data . Exclusion criteria were: (i) neoadj uvant or adjuvant therapy, (ii) palliative RC, (iii) pNx, and (iv) incompl ete clinical and pathological data. A total of 167 patients wer e evaluated, divided into tw o LN groups according to the numbe r of LNs retrieved: group 1 (n=56, 33%) h ad 1 to 12 LNs removed, while group 2 (n=111, 67%) had 13 LNs removed. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of CSS. Results: The mean follow-up was 52.6 (range: 1-172) months. Overa ll, the CSS rate wa s 67 .1% an d 57.7% at f ive an d ten y ears, respectively. Cancer-specific deat h was o bserved for 51 (30.5%) patients. The mean number of LNs removed w as 16.5 (range: 1-43); in pN+ patients, the mean numbe r of positive LNs was 5.6 (range: 1-19). Figur e 1 shows the Ka plan-Me ier curves for CSS f or the two groups of patients, divided according to the numbe r of LNs remove d. Table I shows the univariate and multivariate Cox analysis for clinical and pathological characteri stics correlat ed with CSS. Patients with lower pathological stage, negative LN st atus, conventional transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and large number of LNs retrieved had better CSS.

From December 200 9 to March 2011, 118 patients from seven Italian centers entered the study; the mean patien t age was 66. 5 years, 75% patients had an iPSA b etwe en 3 and 8 ng/ml, and 20% iPSA < 3 ng/ml (Figure 1); 104 patients are still on protocol, while 14 discontinued active surveillanc e based on protocol or personal decision. The actuarial treatment-free survival is represented in Figure 2. Active surveillance is an important option in the spectrum of treatme nts for low-risk prostate cancer, is well-acce pted and some times requested by the patients themselves; moreover, it provides the opportunity to avoid overtreatment and treatment-related toxicities in patients with a high proba bility of harboring an indolent tumor.
