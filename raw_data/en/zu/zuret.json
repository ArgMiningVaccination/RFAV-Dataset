People are suffering physically and psychologically more than ever before. There are many factors that contribute to this\u2014with financial pressures and work being the most widespread. People have to work harder to have the things they desire and, sometimes, just to make ends meet. Often people do not actually enjoy the work they are doing and simply do it out of necessity. They have no peace of mind, and they do not have the ability or the time to enjoy life; this usually generates a large amount of stress and, as a result, diseases. These diseases are another major contributor to the constant suffering we see\u2014whether from stress or the toxins in our food\u2014and they usually lead to the consumption of medications. Mainstream medicine, however, only seems to treat the symptoms and does not get to the root cause, so those suffering will often continue to suffer. Though acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine can help, a lack of recognition by the medical industry and Canadian government makes it impossible for those seeking alternative medical treatment to receive their treatments free. Individuals who purchase health benefits or receive benefits through their employer have a very limited amount of funds that their insurance will allocate to acupuncture in comparison with other more widely recognized alternative health practices (ex. physiotherapy and chiropractic sessions). As a result, acupuncture and similar alternative health practices have less of a reach and cannot do much to help those who could benefit from it. In China, I studied both alternative and Western medicine for over eight years and have practiced both for fourteen years. I have practiced alternative medicine in Canada for over sixteen years. In all my experience, I have found that Meridian Meditation, originating in China, is a great way to help alleviate the physical and psychological issues that plague so many people today. Meridian Meditation treats almost all diseases better than mainstream medicine, and can even treat some diseases better than acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. This is because these medical practices cannot successfully treat every issue. With modern medicine, prescription drugs force the body to rely on them by weakening the body's systems. Acupuncture does not have the ability to correct energy deficiencies, which can lead to diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome and can lower energy stores even further if used. It is often difficult for Chinese herbal medicine practitioners "}
