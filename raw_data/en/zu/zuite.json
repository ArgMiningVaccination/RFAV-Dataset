My Experience Overall Takeaway Where to Buy CBD Photo: Cara Cormack I've been burned by a lot of wellness fads in the past. Indeed, it's been my job for over a decade to embrace what companies say will be the new \"revolution\" in health and personal care and make myself a guinea pig. I've tried many products, diets, or even retreats to determine if they have hope (probiotics) or belong at the bottom of the bin (rocker bottom shoes). One of my favorite test drives was trying Daily Harvest for a month. So naturally, with the rapid proliferation of CBD shops across the U.S., my nature brought me to the point where I had to try this much-hyped and ballyhooed product\u2014and write about it, so you'll know if it's right for you or not. Are you someone thinking about trying hemp tea or CBD oil for the first time? I encourage you to let my experience be your guide. But before we get into my story, let's go over some basics. What Is CBD? Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of several dozen active compounds found in cannabis. CBD's popular first cousin, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is the compound that's associated with marijuana's \"high\" or psychoactive effects. CBD has zero psychoactive effects. However, research shows that CBD has some positive health benefits. For example, studies show: CBD may help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.It can help treat or prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.CBD can regulate vomiting and nausea in cancer patients.It even holds promise as a treatment for anxiety and sleep problems. So CBD Isn't Marijuana? No, it's not. Some people confuse hemp with marijuana because they're both types of cannabis. Indeed, both hemp and marijuana are different varieties of the same plant species, Cannabis sativa. But marijuana typically has between three and 15 percent THC, and hemp has less than one percent. CBD products, by law, cannot have more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. In December 2018, the U.S. Congress removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. It is no longer illegal to possess hemp-derived products in all 50 states. That's why you've likely seen so many stores popping up in your town, or even found your local spa or health food store selling CBD products. My CBD Tea Experience There's a stigma, for better or worse, associated with marijuana that may be deterring people from trying CBD. I will be the first one to tell you that, as a rule, I'm no fan of the sensation of being \"high\" or stoned. I do, however, like and am always curious about, alternative treatments to health issues I face, whether it's essential oil diffusers for headaches, acupuncture for low-back pain, or probiotics for regular tummy troubles. Because research shows CBD may help ease symptoms of anxiety, I decided it was a good option for me to try. Dosage I started by using half a dropper of a 500-milligram tincture in a cup of green tea in the morning and a cup of herbal tea before bed. I did this every day for one week. Each half dropper delivers about 8 milligrams of CBD; a full dropper would be 16. Typical recommended doses for people trying CBD for the first time are between 20 and 40mg per day. However, research shows much higher doses are well tolerated. The First Dose My first experience with CBD was at night, after a long day of work. I was exhausted but decided to go ahead and give it a try. Many brands recommend you take CBD oil sublingually, or under the tongue, for a faster-acting effect. I chose tea in order to mask the bitter oil flavor of the tincture. I don't know if I can fully credit the CBD\u2014I was very tired already\u2014but I found myself quite relaxed within 15 minutes of finishing my cup of tea. I was asleep shortly after, and I had a very deep sleep that night. My sleep tracker recorded 100 percent sleep quality, with very little movement. That's unusual for me, but again, it was a long, taxing day. My body could have been responding to the exhaustion, not the CBD. But I was certainly curious. Over The Next Week The next morning, I repeated the amount and felt nothing, not even a hint of relaxation. That's OK. I'm typically more relaxed and refreshed in the morning as is, so it could be that I didn't have any \"symptoms\" to alleviate. Over the course of the next four days, I only noticed mild effects when I would take the CBD with my tea before bed. During the day, I felt nothing. I decided to up my dosage to a full stopper for the three remaining days. That's when I began to notice some differences. Upping The Dosage On my first day with two full droppers (32mg), I felt incredibly relaxed, almost too relaxed. I struggled a bit to find motivation for work. Thankfully, it was a Saturday, so I could afford the luxury of laziness. I didn't experience any \"head\" symptoms, like dopiness or feeling spaced out, as some people with higher doses report. But I did certainly feel a bit disconnected from my sense of drive. That night, when I used another whole dropper in my tea, I fell to sleep rapidly and slept harder than I had slept in some time. The next day, the effects of my first higher-dose day weren't as strong. I was able to accomplish my work and felt productive, but a certain \"edge\" was taken off my mind. When I work, I typically feel crunched or pinched by deadlines, even when I'm not late. The higher CBD didn't fully erase the \"urgency\" I feel with my work, but it helped me feel calmer, less frantic. Final Impression For what it's worth, my week with CBD counts as a win, and I will likely keep taking it, especially during periods of high stress or anxiety. I may also venture to try other options, like gummies. Other brands have different formulations that may make the effects of CBD more or less powerful, too. Though my total dose, even on the \"high\" dose days, was well within the recommended limits for a first-time user, I would be curious to see the impact of a higher dose. I'll just be sure to do it on days when I don't have deadlines. Overall Takeaway It's important to note that CBD use and products are still in their infancy, and newer, better products will probably be available in the next few years that will make these initial products look silly. Indeed, a study mentioned earlier suggests CBD is really, truly only beneficial in large doses (over 300 milligrams), so it's possible the impacts people like myself do experience are minimal compared to what's possible. As studies increase and products improve, the CBD landscape may change dramatically. Is CBD Worth It? My initial impression is a positive one. I fully believe people can have positive results after taking CBD for a variety of issues. In my experiment, I was only trying to treat anxiety, and I found it to be moderately helpful. It did not eliminate the anxiety or associated stress, but it felt as if it took the sharp edge off the running worries and constant stream of thoughts that I frequently experience. I felt calmer, though not at all \"high.\" Where Should I Buy CBD? If you are interested in trying CBD yourself, be sure to source high-quality CBD products. Unfortunately, CBD products have been dropping in quality in recent years, and they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That means you cannot know for sure, just by looking at a bottle, if you have a good product. Look for third-party lab tests\u2014reputable companies will proudly promote them\u2014and read a lot of reviews. Websites like Leafly provide extensive reviews on effectiveness and potency.
