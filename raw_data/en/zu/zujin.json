Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue dona- tion shall require that the patient, or appropriate person able to consent on behalf of the patient, be made aware of the option to donate as well as of the option to refuse donation and the ability to revoke consent once given. a.Hospitals shall be familiar with the uniform anatomical gift law, Iowa Code chapter 142C, and shall develop policies and protocols for consent to organ donation by either the patient or an appropri- ate person to consent on the patient's behalf consistent with that law's provisions. b.Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue donation shall set forth the responsibilities of the attending physician or physicians, nursing staff, and other appropriate hospital staff persons inthe organ donation process. At a minimum, the policies shall set forth who in particular is authorized to make an organ or tissue donor request and that all such requests shall be made only when authorized by the attending physician or in accordance with clearly delineated written protocol approved by the hos-pital's medical staff and governing board. c.Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue donation shall provide that the attending physician inform appropriate family members or others of impending death or that death has occurred prior to an organ or tissue donor request. d.Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue donation shall set forth those situations in which donation shall not be made including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: (1) Where the patient is not medically suitable;Ch 51, p.6 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 3/30/94, 7/30/97 (2) Where the hospital lacks technical capability and expertise for determining medical suitability and for maintaining the patient or the organs for the time and in the manner necessary to facilitate ap- propriate procurement of the organ; (3) Where the medical examiner has refused to release the body, except a donor request may be made where the medical examiner indicates that the body will be available at a time where the patient remains medically suitable for organ or tissue donation; (4) Where the hospital has actual knowledge that the patient or the appropriate person to consent on behalf of the patient does not want to consider the donation option or that donation violates or isotherwise contrary to the religious beliefs of the patient or of the appropriate person to consent on be- half of the patient; (5) Where circumstances surrounding the patient's care and death are such that appropriate hospi- tal personnel, in consultation with the patient's attending physician, determine that the request itselfwould be unduly burdensome or otherwise exceptionally insensitive to the family's particular needs and situations. This paragraph shall not be construed to routinely avoid making organ and tissue donor requests. e.Hospital policies and protocols for organ donation shall require documentation in the patient's medical record of the fact that a donor request was made and either accepted or refused, stating towhom the request was made and who accepted or refused; or that a donor request was not made, stating the reason why no request was made; or that a consent previously given was subsequently revoked. f.Method and manner of consent, where consent to organ or tissue donation has been given, shall be noted in the patient's medical record. Where revocation of consent occurs, the manner and methodof revocation shall also be noted in the patient's medical record. g.Where the patient has validly executed a donation prior to death, attempt will be made to notify appropriate family members, if reasonably available, of the donation before the procurement processbegins. h.Hospital policies and protocols for organ donation shall provide for ongoing communication with the patient's family or other appropriate representatives regarding the donation process, the pres- ent status of that process and unexpected delays in the process, and family rights and responsibilitiesfollowing organ or tissue donation. 51.8(2)Determination of death. a.No organ or tissue shall be removed from a donor until death has been determined according to the requirements of Iowa law and generally acceptable standards of medical practice. b.Death is defined by Iowa Code section 702.8 as a condition determined by the following stan- dards: A person will be considered dead if in the announced opinion of a physician, based on ordinary stan- dards of medical practice, that person has experienced an irreversible cessation of spontaneous respira-tory and circulatory functions. In the event that artificial means of support preclude a determinationthat these functions have ceased, a person will be considered dead if in the announced opinion of two physicians, based on ordinary standards of medical practice, that person has experienced an irrevers- ible cessation of spontaneous brain functions. Death will have occurred at the time when the relevantfunctions ceased. c.The surgeon performing the organ removal shall not, except in unusual and necessary circum- stances, participate in the determination of brain death. d.The patient's medical record shall include documentation of the date and time of death and identification of the physician or physicians who determined death. IAC 3/30/94, 7/30/97Ch 51, p.7 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 3/30/94, 7/30/97 51.8(3)Determination of medical suitability. a.No organ donor request shall be made until the patient has been determined to be medically suitable for organ or tissue donation. b.At or near the time of imminent death, the attending physician or other physician assigned re- sponsibility shall determine the patient's suitability for organ donation on the basis of established med- ical requirements. c.Each hospital shall consult with a recognized organ procurement program or programs in es- tablishing medical requirements for organ and tissue donation and, where necessary, in evaluating a particular patient's suitability for donation. Where required by federal law, hospitals shall only work with organ procurement organizations designated by the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS). Organ procurement programs maintain guidelines for determining medical suitability andgenerally will provide a hospital with a copy of those guidelines which may be incorporated into the hospital's own policies and protocol for organ donation. 51.8(4)Organ and tissue procurement. a.Hospital policies and protocol for organ and tissue donation shall set forth the process to be used for contacting an organ procurement organization (OPO). b.Hospitals with agreements with one or more OPOs shall take into account the terms and condi- tions of those agreements in developing their policies and protocols.

A hospital shall be familiar with its financial obligations, if any,in the procurement process and with cost accounting/reporting responsibilities it bears, if any, under Medicare and Medicaid. In situations, if any, where the patient or the patient's family may be liable for certain costs associated with organ donation or procurement, the patient or person able to consent forthe patient shall be fully informed of the potential financial obligations at the time of request and beforeconsent is either given or refused. d.When an organ or tissue is retrieved for transplantation purposes, the hospital shall ensure that the medical records of the donor and, if applicable, the recipient fulfill the requirements for any surgi-cal inpatient medical record. Medical record documentation shall include the method of maintenanceof the patient while awaiting organ or tissue retrieval and operative report documentation (including an autopsy if an autopsy has been performed) regarding the removal of the organ or tissue. e.The procurement process shall not occur until necessary consent by the patient or appropriate person to consent on behalf of the patient is received and documented. Also, in cases requiring theinvolvement of the medical examiner, release of the body must be authorized in writing by the medical examiner and documented in the patient's medical record. f.Where a donor specifies to whom the organ or tissue donation is to be made, the hospital shall first contact the named donee to determine whether the donee accepts the donation. Where the doneerefuses the donation or is unable for other reasons to accept, then the hospital shall document in themedical record the fact that the donation was not accepted. The hospital shall then notify the appropri- ate consenting party that the donation was not accepted and determine whether the consenting party desires to make further donation. A hospital shall make good faith effort to cooperate in the donation/procurement process where a specific donee has been named but shall not be required to participate inthe donation process where procurement for a specific donee would result in undue burden or unrea- sonable cost to the hospital; in such situations, the hospital shall notify the appropriate consenting party and determine whether the consenting party desires to make further donation.Ch 51, p.8 Inspections and Appeals[481] IAC 6/7/95, 7/30/97 g.Where consent has been given to organ or tissue donation, revocation of that consent shall be consistent with the current guidelines set forth by Medicare and Medicaid programs. Revocation of prior consent shall not be effective once surgical procedures have begun on either the donor or the re-cipient. 51.8(5)Informed consent. Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue donation shall be consistent with informed consent provisions of the current guidelines set forth by Medicare and Med- icaid programs. 51.8(6)Confidentiality. Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue donation shall pro- vide that donor and recipient patient-identifying information shall be kept confidential except and only to the extent necessary to assist and complete the procurement and transplant processes. Hospital con- fidentiality policies for organ donor and recipient patients shall be consistent with the current guide- lines set forth by Medicare and Medicaid programs. 51.8(7)Training of hospital personnel. Hospital policies and protocols for organ and tissue dona- tion shall include provisions for initial and ongoing training of hospital medical, nursing, and other appropriate staff persons regarding the various aspects of the organ donation and procurement process. The type and extent of training will vary from hospital to hospital, based on factors such as likelihood of medically suitable donors, capabilities for maintaining organ donors/patients, referral sources for potential organ donor candidates, and overall participation in organ and tissue procurement and trans- plants.
