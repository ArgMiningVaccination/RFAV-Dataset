Acupuncture has been used in China for over 3000 years to correct imbalances and promote health. When our bodies are out of balance, symptoms occur. Chinese Medicine connects symptoms to underlying patterns of disharmony. These patterns are treated with very specific acupuncture points and sometimes with Chinese herbal prescriptions. Chinese Medicine treats the underlying cause of illness to alleviate symptoms as well as prevent future illness by promoting harmony and balance within the body.
