According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), energy medicine (or biofield therapies) is the act of channeling and manipulating the energy that courses through your body in order to heal it. Healers who work with energy are typically focused on removing any physical, spiritual, or emotional blockages, typically through modalities like Reiki, tapping, or more intensive shamanic rituals. The cost of these visits can range from $195 to $2,000 per session, with some stars willing to pay even more for more intensive sessions. Some forms of energy medicine such as acupuncture and Reiki are backed by research to help improve pain, anxiety and depression. However, for many energy therapies, scientific evidence is still lagging. Here, FEMAIL takes a look into the latest craze to sweep Hollywood's A-list and the celebrity healers leading the charge.

His father, David, was an engineer of African-Haitian descent; his mother, Veruschka, Indian-Norwegian. His aunt Shirley was a noted opera singer, an African-American mezzo-soprano. He calls on members of his family who have died - his father, his aunt and his grandmother - to help him during healing sessions.

'I teach people how to live harmoniously with each other, on a planet that we all share,' Durek explained to Harper's Bazaar. Durek also claimed to help provide 'behind-the-scenes insight on how to navigate your life in a way that supports your highest growth.' His 'soul sis' Gwyneth Paltrow is quoted on his site, saying: 'Shaman Durek has a lot of knowledge that can touch the world in a way I haven't seen before. He is a light on Earth!' In his sessions, the shaman assesses the client's energetic field and physical, spiritual and mental health. The aim is to help not only improve physical healing and wellbeing, but also aid with balancing emotions, cutting generational behaviors, and increasing self-worth and motivation, which can lead to more success and happiness.

Sat Hari Khalsa: The holistic healer who has worked with Brad Pitt and the Red Hot Chili Peppers Brad Pitt is 'close friends' with Sat Hari Khalsa who has been helping the actor on his spiritual journey following his split from Angelina Jolie in 2016 The holistic healer worked as the touring nurse for rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers and famously used to give the musicians with 'ozone' injections Brad Pitt and Sat Hari Khalsa were seen together in September 2018 at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music Gala in Los Angeles, after his acrimonious split from Angelina Jolie in 2016. It was revealed at the time that the pair had become 'close friends' and that Sat Hari had been helping the actor on his spiritual journey. 'She's providing him with some guidance and has been a welcome breath of fresh air and spirituality in his life,' a source told E! 'He feels like he has a lot to learn to better himself.' Sat Hari now provides 'wearable blessings' through her fine jewelry range, Amrit Jewelry Sat Hari was born in America, but moved to India at a young age to attend boarding school, and remained there until she was 18. She has said that her time in India was deeply formative, and it was during that time she connected with Yogi Bajan, 'who raised her as his own child in many ways'. The holistic healer spent much of the early-2000s as the touring nurse for rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers. She famously used to give the musicians with 'ozone' injections. Bassist Michael 'Flea' Balzary was the first to experiment with the alternative therapy, before singer Anthony Kiedis became a big fan. He wrote in his autobiography, Scar Tissue: 'Sat Hari is a nurse, an American Sikh, a sweet, incredibly sheltered, turban-wearing young lady. She looks like a female version of Flea, with the same gap-toothed smile, the same shape of face, the same color eyes, the same little pug nose. 'She's maternal and she's warm and she's loving and she's unassuming, a complete breath of fresh air and female energy, and I don't mean sexual energy, at least not for me. For me she's like a sister and mother and caretaker and nurse all in one.' He continued: 'The substance that she injects into my bloodstream is ozone, a wonderful-smelling gas that has been used legally in Europe for years to treat everything from strokes to cancer. I immediately researched the topic and found a herbal regimen that would cleanse my liver and eradicate the hepatitis.' These days Sat Hari is more focused on providing 'wearable blessings' for the masses through her fine jewelry range, [Amrit jewelry](https://amrit.jewelry/). Her bracelet between $2,224 and $4,900. Sat Hari's friendship with Brad has blossomed into a business partnership after the duo launched their luxury cashmere line, God's True Cashmere in October - pictured on Goop Elsewhere, her friendship with Brad has blossomed into a business partnership after the duo launched their luxury cashmere line, God's True Cashmere in October.

The shirts all have 11 snaps, seven down the front and four on the pocket and cuff which are made out of gemstones that have been hand-carved in India. 'We have seven chakras in our body,' Sat Hari stated, 'so why not put seven down the front of the shirt, so that all of your chakras are activated?' Each shirt has different gemstones including tiger's eye, moonstone, amethyst, rose quartz, emerald, and more\u2014with the different hues representing different qualities including wealth, love, and wisdom. The line, which is stocked by Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop website, ranges in price from $1,600 to $2250. The comments below have not been moderated.
