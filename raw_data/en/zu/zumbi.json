One of them is ReNoo - an all-in-one, everyday supplement made specifically for a woman's constitution. ReNoo transforms strong-tasting, often bitter Chinese herbs into a light drink that Tan describes as \"barley meets green tea\".

She continued to take them until she fell pregnant with her second child during the pandemic. At that point, she made the decision to stop. \"I didn't want to take over-the-counter pills like I did in my first pregnancy, so I thought I should try to rediscover alternative solutions. That is when I rediscovered TCM herbs,\" Tan says. \"I have grown up with TCM as part of my life and, growing up in Hong Kong, my grandmother would make me TCM soups and teas every time I was a little sick, but I never really understood TCM herbs.\" When Tan began her research, she found that \"the entire modality was confusing\" and realised that there was \"a lack of transparency around the herbs\". As a result, she decided she had a good opportunity to use science to make TCM easier to understand - and easier to swallow. \"We wanted to make something that can be taken daily without a prescription and also the bitter taste from TCM herbs could be minimised,\" Tan says. Enter Nooci - a brand that embraces an East-meets-West ethos, from team structure and ingredients to principles and techniques.

Tan says there has, in recent years, been a new wave of TCM fervour among Hongkongers.

I want to make it modern and make it cool.\" The Matchali x Nooci crossover Tan recently partnered with Hong Kong tea brand Matchali to create two special herbal drinks. Both Tan and the founder of Matchali share a belief in the effectiveness of all-natural herbal remedies. The two seasonal \"HK Classics Reimagined\" drinks featuring TCM ingredients and Nooci's ReNoo are available at Matchali's flagship store at 5 Moon Street in Wan Chai.

The natural sweetness from the fresh ingredients is balanced with a hint of green tea. The addition of ReNoo helps reduce bloating, promotes digestion, reduces sugar cravings, promotes metabolism and provides a natural energy boost. Hojicha Coix Seed Lemon Tea (US$7) This is a healthy twist on Hong Kong-style lemon tea and is made by brewing coix seed and lemon with roasted hojicha tea. Coix seeds, which can be found in ReNoo, are a popular ingredient in many TCM recipes, as they are subtle in taste and are packed with many benefits. The addition of lemon is inspired by the changing of seasons as we head into spring and summer, as the fruit can help dispel heat and detox the body. "}
