Modern science has only begun to understand this [subtle energy](https://biocharger.com/subtle-energy/). The BioCharger can enhance and balance subtle energy in multiple ways to improve cellular function, energy levels, and overall wellness. Several different types of subtle energy affect the functioning of your body and mind. The [BioCharger](https://www.cutlerintegrativemedicine.com/services/integrative-treatments/biocharger/) uses low levels of these energy types that work safely to address imbalances and correct low energy levels. The BioCharger uses: The BioCharger generates light by exciting molecules of noble gasses like neon and argon. These harmless gasses emit light energy that can rejuvenate the body, improve skin health, boost mood, and reduce inflammation. Electromagnetic energy moves in waves, and the BioCharger produces waves that harmonize with your body's natural energy. These harmonic frequencies speed healing, ease pain, and boost energy levels for improved vitality. Using very low voltage, this type of subtle energy stimulates cellular functions, improving metabolism and energy. It can also improve cognitive functioning and help the body absorb nutrients more effectively. This pulsed energy field improves circulation and oxygen levels, boosts energy levels, and enhances the immune system. Electromagnetic fields from the Earth affect the body at all times, and these low-energy pulsed fields can ground and balance this connection. You will stand three to five feet from the source of the subtle energy so your body can absorb the maximum amount. These energy levels remain low and cause no injury to the tissues. You will not feel any discomfort during your 5 to 20-minute treatment. Many people benefit from focusing on a healing intention to harmonize body and mind into a healing state. [Subtle energy treatment](https://www.cutlerintegrativemedicine.com/blog/what-does-a-biocharger-do/) uses low energy levels that act at a cellular level. Almost anyone can benefit from the BioCharger. Since these situations have not been scientifically tested, the BioCharger may not be recommended for those who are pregnant, have electronic devices like a pacemaker, or are under twelve years of age. Since subtle energy therapy works with your body's natural energy systems, most people have no side effects. Because the BioCharger can trigger cellular detoxification, you may experience minor effects as your body removes toxicants. We recommend staying well-hydrated before and after treatment.
