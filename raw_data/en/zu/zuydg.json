It's caused a whole host of health issues such as eczema, bloating and acne, SIBO, just to name a few. I tried every pill and potion you can think of, with varying levels of success. After years of experimenting, I have finally found the three best things that keep my gut super healthy and that continue to boost my immune system every day. Our gut is responsible for about 85% of our immune system, and it's home to more than 100 trillion bacteria (yep, trillion). When things are functioning well, it's easy to forget about how important your gut is. But when things start to go wrong, you sure as hell know it. Gut issues have been linked to everything from autoimmune disease to depression to allergies. On a less extreme level, they can result in gas, bloating, fatigue, lethargy, yucky skin, weight issues and generally feeling... 'blah'. So you can see that it's pretty important to make sure your gut is doing its job and that you are keeping it strong and robust! Here are the 3 things I swear by to heal my gut, make my skin sing and get my glow on each day... 1. Bone Broth Bone broth is essentially homemade stock, and it helps restore a healthy mucosal lining in the gut. It's jam-packed with gelatine and collagen and is also high in proline (a super-important amino acid). You can drink it before your meals to warm your digestive system, use it as stock or even saut\u00e9 your veggies in it. What you need: - Bones from your local butcher (organic and grass fed is best). These can be beef, lamb, chicken, whatever you like. I like to make a big batch, using around 2 -3 kgs of bones. - Filtered water: 4 litres for every 1kg of beef bones, or 3.5 litres for every 1.5kg of chicken bones. - For every 1kg of bones, add 100g each of chopped veggies e.g. carrots, onions, leeks, celery, parsley stalks. - 2Tbs of apple cider vinegar (this helps extract the juicy minerals from the bones). - \u00bc teaspoon of Celtic sea salt for every 1 litre of water What you do: - Add everything into a large pot or a slow cooker, and pop the lid on. - Simmer for up to 6 hours. If you're using beef bones, you can simmer for up to 10 hours. I leave my slow cooker on overnight so it's ready in the morning. - Pour through a strainer into glass bottles or a large glass bowl. - When the broth has cooled, the fat will solidify into a layer on top. You can easily scoop this off. - Freeze the broth in batches or in ice cube trays for easy access. - Drink 1-3 cups per day... the more the better! Your gut is incredibly important for good health. It's where we absorb nutrients. 2. Cultured Vegetables These guys are the ultimate superfood, and contain much higher levels of good bacteria than any probiotic supplements you buy (not to mention it's a heck-load cheaper!). Cultured (or fermented) veggies are ideal for optimising your gut flora, and for detoxing heavy metals and other toxins from the body. You can use them to heal any gut issues or for 'gut maintenance', which will lessen your chances of developing any issues in the first place. Want to try this at home? Check out Dr Mercola's super-useful article on [how to make cultured veg at home](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/12/15/caroline-barringer-interview.aspx), plus his cultured veg equipment checklist. If you don't want to make your own, you can buy them from the shops. Just make sure you read the ingredients - they can be laden with sugar and vinegar, which you don't want. Look for raw, organic options with all natural ingredients (I love the [Peace, Love & Vegetables](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peace-Love-Vegetables/242928825786110) range of fermented goodies). They are delish! 3. Meditation Surprised to see meditation on this list?! It's actually my go-to weapon. Meditation decreases stress and stress causes leaky gut, so it makes sense to try and live as angst-free as possible. Do yourself a favor, remove common everyday stresses and start meditating.
