The Tridium Niagara with Distech controller's platform is an open platform design based on the Tridium JACE (JAVA Application Control Engine) and the Niagara N4 framework. The JACE is a compact, embedded controller/server platform. It combines integrated control, supervision, data logging, alarming, scheduling and network management functions with Internet connectivity and web serving capabilities. Niagara AX framework software applications and tools are designed to integrate a variety of devices and protocols into unified, distributed systems. The Staefa Talon Niagara supports a wide range of protocols including Staefa-Smart II, LonWorks, BACnet, Modbus, oBIX, and Internet standards. The CCMS group has adopted the use of Distech controls as the primary application controller using the BACnet protocol under the TN framework. The Distech pre-engineering programming tools provides a fully integrated solution providing full controller programming capability through Niagara AX framework. B. The ALC system is an open platform that employs native ALC controllers are used under its Web Control server architecture. The architecture is such that all the ALC campus building databases and graphical user interfaces are routed through a single server. The Web Control system also provides integrated control, supervision, data logging, alarming, scheduling and network management functions with Internet connectivity and web serving capabilities. The ALC Web Control integrates a variety of devices and protocols into unified, distributed systems including BACnet, Modbus and Internet standards. C.

Building- and system-level controllers shall be capable of operating independently, in stand-alone fashion, with no communication to other devices on the network while performing their monitoring and control routines using programs and operating parameters stored in the controllers' memory. All points and functions that make up a functional system (typically that shown on one control schematic) shall be included in one controller to qualify for this stand-alone functionality B. Where control sequences depend on global variables such as outside air temperature, the controller shall have the capability of either using the last value or a default value. The design professional shall specifically indicate point groupings for stand-alone capability. Examples of required functional point groupings are as follows: 1. All points and functions required to control an air handler with all directly associated supply, return, and exhaust fans. This excludes the terminals that may be associated with that air handler. Values that may be received across the network include humidity, emergency power source indication, terminal based reset parameters, and smoke modes. In a lab environment, any 100 % outside supply AHU with associated exhaust fan systems must be hardwired interlocked for safe shut down. a. If the exhaust system fails then supply shall stop through hardwired interlock. b. If supply fan fails the exhaust system shall remain operational 2. All points associated with the supply side of a hydronic system such as pumps, flow meters, temperature and pressure sensors, proof indications, valves etc. This excludes the terminals on that hydronic system. Values that may be received across the network include outside air temperature and humidity, emergency power source indication, and terminal based reset parameters. 3.

Software safeties shall be the exception, not the rule and require approval. D. Controllers must include sufficient memory for all required operations, backups and all required trending. Where control system operation is hindered by the shortage of memory, contractor shall, at no cost to the Owner, either upgrade the memory or provide multiple controllers. The mix of points for multiple controllers shall not violate the stand-alone requirements. E. Volatile memory is required to be backed up in the event of power loss. Software stored in non- volatile memory will not have to be downloaded from the central server after an interruption of power occurs F. Controllers used for time-scheduled operations must be equipped with a battery backed internal real-time clock function to provide a time base for implementing time-dependent programs. Provision shall be made for the routine updating of the controllers' clocks via a time master G.
