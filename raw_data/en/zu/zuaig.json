I work primarily with patients with end-stage heart diseases, which may be the result of other cardiac problems such as coronary artery disease, valvular disease, autoimmune process, infections and other conditions. Some of my adult patients have serious heart failure that is the result of congenital heart diseases. Others have already had a prior heart transplant and now need a second heart. I also perform cardiac procedures to implant artificial heart pumps to help patients recover from their heart failure and get them to a heart transplant. When I meet a patient for the first time, they are often quite ill. I spend all the time necessary with them to hear about their challenges and answer all of their questions. My favorite part of my work is witnessing patients who were once gravely ill get better. It's truly magical to see their recovery and help them to be able to resume the lives they once had. Sometimes, because of the severity of an illness, patients may not recover as we would hope. Even in these cases, I believe we provide comfort to the families, who know that every measure was tried and every option considered. Patient and family happiness is easy when everything is successful. Achieving this satisfaction when the outcomes are not as planned is a completely different, and yet, a true measure of the success of our care. In addition to providing patient care, I also write, publish and lecture about cardiac surgery and transplantation. I serve on the editorial board for Annals of Translational Medicine, and am a reviewer for Annals of Thoracic Surgery and Innovations: Technology and Techniques in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery Innovations, and the International Journal of Artificial Organs.

My current research interests span the range of clinical trials of new ventricular assist devices, anticoagulation protocols, to new donor heart preservation methods. Prior to joining Memorial, I had a translational science lab looking at the roles of stem cells in heart transplant and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).
