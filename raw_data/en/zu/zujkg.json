The dose is based on the dog's body surface area and is ca lculated using 1 mg of medetomidine per square meter (m2) of body surface area (BSA) or by using the dosing table provided in the labeling. The drug is administered once by intramuscular (IM) injection and the average duration of sedation is 38 minutes. Medetomidine and dexmedetomidine (which is in the same class as medetomidine) are already approved for sedation and analgesia in dogs over 12 weeks of age to facilit ate clinical examinations, clinical procedures, and minor surgical procedures not requiring muscle relaxation. Proprietary NameEstablished NameApplication Type and NumberSponsor Zenalpha\u00aemedetomidine and Drug Application (NADA) Medetomidine is a potent, non -narcotic, alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist which produces sedation and analgesia. These effects are dose dependent in both depth and duration. Within the central nervous system, medetomidine inhibits sympathetic neurotransmission and causes the level of consciousness to decrease. Respiratory rate and body temperature can also decrease. In the peripheral vasculature, medetomidine stimulates alpha 2-adrenoceptors within vascu lar smooth muscle which induces vasoconstriction and hypertension. This causes a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output. Medetomidine also induces a number of other alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated effects, including piloerection, depression of motor and se cretory functions of the gastrointestinal tract, diuresis, and hyperglycemia. Vatinoxan is an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist that selectively acts on the peripheral nervous system. Because vatinoxan's effects are limited to the peripheral nervous system , it prevents or attenuates the negative cardiovascular and other effects of medetomidine outside the central nervous system when the drugs are administered together. Vatinoxan does not alter the central effects of medetomidine, but it does reduce the dura tion of the sedation and analgesia, mainly by improving cardiovascular function which increases the clearance of medetomidine. Safety and Effectiveness Field Effectiveness Study The sponsor conducted a field effectiveness study comparing Zenalpha\u00ae to dexmedetomidine in client -owned dogs that presented to the veterinary clinic for examinations or procedures that required restraint and sedation. The examinations or procedures were non -invasive and were either non -painful or mildly painful. The study included dogs of both sexes and various breeds and breed mixes. Enrolled dogs represented a range of weights and ages (all were at least 16 -weeks old) and were in good general health. Dogs in the treatment group received one IM injection of Zenalpha\u00ae and dogs in the control group received one IM injection of an approved dexmedetomidine injectable solution. Dexmedetomidine was used as the control Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 3of 28 drug because medetomidine was not commercially available when the field study was conducted. There were two primary v ariables for effectiveness: 1) Zenalpha\u00ae must be non -inferior to (not worse than) dexmedetomidine for the ability of the veterinarian to complete the planned examination or procedure while the dog was sedated. The success rate for completing the examination or procedure was 94.5% in the treatment group compared to 90.9% in the control group. Therefore, Zenalpha\u00ae was non -inferior to dexmedetomidine for the ability of the veterinarian to complete the planned examination or procedure . 2) Zenalpha\u00ae must be superior to (better than) dexmedetomidine at causing less severe cardiovascular adverse effects, specifically less bradycardia. The mean heart rate of dogs in the treatment group remained within the normal range (defined as 60 to 140 beats per min ute (bpm)), while the mean heart rate of dogs in the control group was below normal from 5 to 180 minutes post - treatment. Fewer dogs administered Zenalpha\u00ae experienced bradycardia (< 40 bpm) during sedation compared to the control group. Therefore, Zenalph a\u00ae was superior to dexmedetomidine at causing less severe cardiovascular adverse effects . Several secondary variables were evaluated, including time to onset of sedation, duration of sedation, level of analgesia, respiratory rate, body temperature, and reactions at the time of injection. Overall, dogs treated with Zenalpha\u00ae had a faster time to onset of sedation and a shorter duration of sedation (a faster recovery) than dogs administered dexmedetomidine. The level of analgesia was asses sed by using a handheld algometer that allowed a force to be applied at a controlled rate until either a pre-determined threshold point was reached or the dog responded to the force. Zenalpha\u00ae provided comparable analgesia to dexmedetomidine, and in both g roups, the waning of the analgesic effect was associated with the waning of the sedative effect. The mean respiratory rate in both groups decreased compared to pre -treatment. The mean respiratory rate in the treatment group decreased earlier and recovere d faster than the control group. Following administration of the treatment and control drugs, the mean body temperature in both groups decreased. The treatment group reached its lowest mean temperature (99.1 \u00b0F) at 120 minutes post -treatment and returned to pre-treatment levels by 360 minutes. The mean temperature in the control group reached its lowest level (98.2 \u00b0F) at 240 minutes post -treatment and was still below pre-treatment levels at 360 minutes. Fewer dogs in the treatment group experienced hypothe rmia (< 99 \u00b0F) or hyperthermia (> 103.5 \u00b0F) compared to the control group. More dogs in the treatment group had moderate to severe reactions to the injection of Zenalpha\u00ae compared to the reactions to injection in dogs in the control group. The most common adverse reactions seen in dogs treated with Zenalpha\u00ae were diarrhea, muscle tremors, and colitis. Compared to dexmedetomidine, Zenalpha\u00ae had an improved physiologic safety profile and did not cause prolonged sedation in dogs. Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 4of 28 Atipamezole Reversal Stu dy The sponsor conducted a laboratory study in adult, male Beagle dogs to determine if atipamezole was effective in reversing the sedative and cardiovascular effects of Zenalpha\u00ae. Atipamezole is a specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist used to reverse the effects of dexmedetomidine and medetomidine in dogs. All dogs received Zenalpha\u00ae at the labeled dose, and then 30 minutes later, half of the dogs were administered the approved dose of atipamezole. Atipamezole reversed the sedation caused by Zenalpha\u00ae within 10 to 20 minutes, and the dogs' heart rate and blood pressure returned to baseline within 20 to 30 minutes. Target Animal Safety The sponsor conducted a laboratory study in young Beagle dogs to evaluate t he safety of Zenalpha\u00ae when administered intravenously (IV). The drug was administered IV to minimize potential issues with administering large volumes of the drug IM. Previous pilot studies indicated that IV administration would adequately assess the safe ty of IM administration of Zenalpha\u00ae in dogs. The dogs were administered Zenalpha\u00ae at 0X, 1X, 3X, or 5X the labeled IM dose once daily for 4 days. Zenalpha\u00ae caused sedation, decreased blood pressure, hypothermia, and initial sinus bradycardia and later s inus tachycardia that all resolved within 24 hours (before the next scheduled dose). Dogs in the three Zenalpha\u00ae groups were often provided supplemental heat support. Two dogs in the 5X group had decreased serum blood glucose, and two dogs (one in the 1X g roup and one in the 3X group) had decreased serum potassium. Several dogs in the three Zenalpha\u00ae groups had mucoid, soft, or watery feces. Clinical observations in dogs administered Zenalpha\u00ae included salivation, trembling, tremors, vocalization, pinpoint pupils, protrusion of the nictitating membrane, defecation or vomiting after dosing, injected sclera, struggling after dosing, and skin that was cool to the touch. These clinical findings are due to the drug's mechanism of action. The high plasma -to-cereb rospinal fluid ratio (36:1) for vatinoxan indicates that it has little appreciable activity in the central nervous system. Overall, Zenalpha\u00ae did not produce systemic toxicity and had an acceptable margin of safety in dogs. Safety Warnings The labeling fo r Zenalpha\u00ae includes detailed safety information for people who handle, administer, or are exposed to the drug. The labeling also includes a note to physicians in case a person is accidentally exposed to the drug via absorption through the skin, eyes, or m ucosa or via oral intake or self -injection. Symptoms after systemic absorption or self -injection include dose -dependent sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypotension. People with cardiovascular disease and pregnant women sh ould take special precautions to avoid any exposure to Zenalpha\u00ae. Uterine contractions and decreased fetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure. Veterinary staff should be careful when handling sedated animals, as handling or any other sudden stimuli, including noise, may cause an animal to react defensively even if it appears to be heavily sedated.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 5of 28 Conclusions Based on the data submitted by the sponsor for the Zenalpha\u00ae, FDA determined that the drug is safe and effective when used according to the labeling.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 6of 28 Table of Contents I.

Indication Zenalpha\u00ae is indicated for use as a sedative and analgesic in dogs to facilitate clinical examination, clinical procedures and minor surgical procedures.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 9of 28 II. EFFECTIVENESS The effectiveness of Zenalpha\u00ae (medetomidine and vatinoxan hydrochlorides injection) for use as a sedative and analgesic in dogs to facilitate clinical examinations, clinical procedures , and minor surgical procedures was evaluated in a field study in client -owned dogs that presented to the veterinary clinic for a planned examination or procedure. Vatinoxan hydrochloride was referred to as MK -467 in early product development. A. Dosage Characterization A dose of 1 mg medetomidine/m2 BSA and 20 mg vatinoxan/m2 BSA (1:20 ratio) administered by IM injection for sedation in dogs was selected based on two laboratory studies and a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling study. Dose Determination with Medetomidine Fol Dogs . (Study No . 14-410-02) The laboratory study was conducted with a crossover design in 8 (4 male, 4 female) Beagle dogs, approximately 7 - 8 months of age, fitted with radiotelemetry devices. Dogs were randomized t o treatment group order with a 3 - 7 day washout period between treatments. Group 1 was administered 1 mg/m2 medetomidine, and groups 2 - 4 were administered 1 mg/m2 medetomidine with vatinoxan hydrochloride at 15, 30, or 50 mg/m2, respectively. All doses were administered by IM injection. All dogs were considered clinically sedated after dose administration for all dose groups . The medetomidine and vatinoxan combination provided a dose and time dependent attenuation of decreased heart rate, decreased respiratory rate, and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias compared to medetomidine alone. Medetomidine and vatinoxan combinations also resulted in dose dependent decreased arterial blood pressures and decreased time to standing (quicker recovery fr om sedation). The attenuation of the adverse cardiovascular effects in the groups administered 15 mg/m2 and 30 mg/m2 of vatinoxan supported further evaluation of the dose of 20 mg/m2 vatinoxan. Plasma C oncentration, Cardiovascular and Sedative Effects of Intramuscular Medetomidine With Three Doses of the Peripheral Alpha-2 Antagonist MK -467 in Dogs. (Study No. 14 -410-01) The laboratory study was conducted with a crossover design in 8 (6 male, 2 female) Beagle dogs approximately 1 year of age. Do gs were randomized to treatment group order with at least 14 days between treatments. Group 1 was administered 20 mcg/kg medetomidine, and groups 2 - 4 were administered 20 mcg/kg medetomidine with vatinoxan at 200 mcg/kg (1:10 ratio), 400 mcg/kg (1:20 rat io), or 600 mcg/kg (1:30 ratio), respectively. All doses were administered by IM injection. All dogs were considered clinically sedated after dose administration for all dose groups . The combinations of medetomidine and vatinoxan did not prevent the immedi ate cardiovascular depressive effects of medetomidine, which occurred within 5 minutes post dose. There was a time and dose dependent recovery to baseline for the cardiovascular parameters (heart rate and cardiac output) within 20 minutes post dose in the medetomidine and Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 10of 28 vatinoxan combination groups. Sedation scores in dogs in the medetomidine and vatinoxan combination groups increased earlier and returned to baseline earlier compared to dogs in the medetomidine group. Seven dogs in group 1 required revers al of medetomidine with atipamezole; none of the dogs in the medetomidine and vatinoxan combination groups experienced prolonged sedation. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Modeling Report: PK Interaction and of Dose Ratio . (Study No. 14-322-06) A PK/PD model was developed to relate the plasma drug concentration data to the sedation and heart rate data collected in Study 14 -410-01 and another PK study . Simulations with the PK /PD model were conducted using combination s of 1 mg/m2 medetomidine and vatinoxan, with medetomidine to vatinoxan 1:15 to 1:50. The medetomidine to vatinoxan ratio that maintained the mean heart rate closest to 70 beats per minute over a 2 -hour period post dose was 1:20. Based on the result s of the simulation, the 1 mg/m2 medetomidine and 20 mg/m2 vatinoxan dose (1:20 ratio) was selected for further evaluation in an effectiveness field study. B. Substantial Evidence 1. Field Effectiveness Study Title: Field safety and efficacy study of a fixed co mbination MK - 467/medetomidine product when used as a sedative in dogs. (Study No. 14 - 420-01) Study Dates: August 2017 to September 2018 Study Locations: Six veterinary clinics from the following locations participated in the study. Canandaigua, NY Fort Collins, CO Catonsville, MD Quakertown, PA Decatur, IL Zachary, LA Study Design: This was a multicenter, double -masked, randomized , active - controlled field study. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zenalpha\u00ae for use as a sedative and analgesic in dogs to facilitate clinical examinations, clinical procedures , and m inor surgical procedures in client -owned dogs. Study Animals: The study enrolled 223 client -owned dogs that presented to the veterinary clinic for examinations or procedures that required sedation. There were 107 females and 116 males of various breeds an d breed mixes, aged 5 months to 14.5 years, and weighing 5.1 to 154 lbs. (2.3 - 70 kg). Experimental Design: Dogs were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive Zenalpha\u00ae or dexmedetomidine (control group). There were 110 dogs in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 113 do gs in the dexmedetomidine group. The field study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 11of 28 Treatment Groups: Table II.1. Treatment area Inclusion Criteria: Dogs at least 16 weeks old, in good general health and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II (healthy or mild systemic disease), that required a non -invasive, non -painful, or mildly painful procedure or examination which required restraint and sedation. Owner consent was provided prior to study enrollment. Exclusion Criteria: Male dogs intended for breeding or female dogs that were pregnant or lactating; dogs less than 16 weeks old; or dogs that had marked systemic disease or hypovolemia, had marked cardiovascular or respiratory disease, had a known hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or excipients, were ASA class I II or above, or were administered any medication which may have affected sedation, analgesia, or cardiovascular parameters. Drug Administration: The Zenalpha\u00ae group received the final market formulation of medetomidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/mL) and vatino xan hydrochloride (10 mg/mL). The Zenalpha\u00ae dose was calculated based on the medetomidine in the combination at 1 mg/m2 BSA or by using the dosing table below. The control group received an approved 0.5 mg/mL dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injectable soluti on and was dosed at 0.5 mg/m2 or by using the dosing table provided with the product.

Respiratory rate, body temperature, analgesia, and adverse reactions were evaluated as secondary variables for the safety assessment. Dogs were evaluated at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after drug admini stration. Baseline physical examination and clinical pathology were conducted to confirm the dog was healthy and suitable for inclusion in the study. Analgesia was assessed by using Mechanical Nociceptive Threshold (MNT) testing. The assessment was conduc ted using a handheld algometer (Prod, Topcat Metrology Ltd) equipped with a 2 mm probe tip, which allowed a force to be applied at a controlled rate of 2 Newtons/second (N/s) until a response from the dog was seen. If no response was seen before the predet ermined 20 N threshold, then the stimulation was stopped. MNT assessments were conducted at pre -treatment, and 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes post -drug administration. Statistical Methods: Two variables were considered primary for demonstration of effec tiveness: Non -inferiority (NI) of Zenalpha\u00ae (compared to control) was assessed for 'Ability to complete the procedure (yes/no)' using the generalized linear mixed effect model including the treatment group as the fixed effect and site and treatment by site interaction as the random effects. NI was established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was less than the NI margin of 25%. Superiority was assessed for 'Heart Rate' during the first 3 hours after treatment, using the linear mixed -effect model including fixed effects of treatment group, time and treatment group by time interaction, subject as a random effect, and baseline value as a covariate. Statistical significance was evaluated at a two -sided alpha equal to 0.05. The p -values were adjus ted using the Holm -Bonferroni method. Other variables were assessed as secondary or for evaluation of safety. Results: Effectiveness was evaluated in 208 dogs (109 in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 99 in the control group). Ability to complete procedure: The success rate for the ability to complete the procedure was 94.5% in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 90.9% in the control group. Zenalpha\u00ae met the criteria for success because it was no n-inferior to the control product for the ability to complete the procedure while the dog Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 13of 28 was sedated. The p rocedures in the study included: radiographic examination or diagnostic imaging, ear examination and treatment, eye examination and treatment, anal sac treatment, dermatological examination and procedures, dental examination, dental biopsy, dental minor extraction, fine needle aspiration/superficial biopsy, minor surgery to remove dermal masses, drain seroma or abscess, nai l trimming, coat grooming, venous blood draw , and intravenous catheter pl acement. Many dogs underwent more than one procedure while sedated. Heart rate: The Zenalpha\u00ae group mean heart rate remained within the normal range (normal range defined as 60 - 140 bpm), while the control group mean heart rate was below normal from 5 - 180 minutes post -treatment. The mean heart rate in the Zenalpha\u00ae group was lowest at 15 minutes (64 bpm) and the mean heart rate in the control group was lowest at 90 minutes (45 bpm). Individual heart rates in the Zenalpha\u00ae group ranged from 24 - 240 bp m, and in the control group ranged from 22 - 180 bpm during sedation. There were 9 dogs (8.3%) in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 54 dogs (52.4%) in the control group that had heart rates < 40 beats per minute (bpm) during sedation. The difference in heart rate between the Zenalpha\u00ae and control group was clinically relevant. Zenalpha\u00ae met the criteria for success for heart rate because it was superior to the control product for group mean heart rate (reduction in bradycardia). Table II.3.

Rebound tachycardia has been reported in dogs administered an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist and occurs after the cardio vascular suppressive effects have abated. Data on heart rate was not collected past 360 minutes (6 hours), and therefore post-sedation rebound tachycardia in the control group may have been missed because the dogs were still sedated and experiencing cardio vascular suppression . One dog in the Zenalpha\u00ae group had tachycardia (HR of 160 bpm) that was noted at the Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 14of 28 5-minute timepoint and lasted approximately 10 minutes; the tachycardia did not require treatment. Time to onset of sedation and Duration of sedatio n: The group mean time to onset of sedation was 14 minutes in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 18 minutes in the control group. The mean duration of sedation in the Zenalpha\u00ae group was 38 minutes (maximum of 90 min.) and in the control group was 90 minutes (maximum 5 hrs. 28 min.). Overall, the dogs in the Zenalpha\u00ae group had a faster time to onset of sedation and shorter duration of sedation (faster recovery). Table II.4. Time to Onset of Sedation Five dogs from the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 6 dogs from the control group were excluded due to missing data. Table II.5. Duration of Sedation (hrs:min) Seven dogs in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 9 in the control group were excluded due to missing data. Analgesia: Analgesia assessments were similar in the Zenalpha\u00ae and control groups at pre -treatment, and at 15 and 30 minutes post treatment. From 60 minutes post treatment the pressure applied to elicit a response was significantly lower in the Zenalpha\u00ae group, indicating that the dogs were recovering from the analge sic effects of the sedative at these time points. At 4 hours post -treatment the mean MNT measurement in the Zenalpha\u00ae group had returned to pre -treatment levels. The results demonstrate that Zenalpha\u00ae has a comparable analgesic effect to the control produc t, and that the decrease in analgesic effect is associated with the waning of the sedative effect.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 15of 28 Table II.6.

The definition of normal respiratory rate was 10 - 30 breaths per minute (bpm). Following treatment, the mean respiratory rate in both groups decreased compared to pre -treatment. The group mean respiratory rate in the Zenalpha\u00ae group decreased earlier and recovered faster than the control group. The group mean respiratory rate in the Zenalpha\u00ae group was lowest at 30 minutes post -treatment (14 bpm) and in the control group w as lowest at 90 minutes post -treatment (15.5 bpm). Individual respiratory rates in the Zenalpha\u00ae group ranged from 2 - 102 bpm, and in the control group ranged from 2 - 96 bpm. Thirty -nine dogs (35.4%) in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 33 dogs (29.2%) in the control group had respiratory rates < 10 bpm during the study. Eight dogs in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 4 dogs in the control group had respiratory rates of 4 bpm. One dog in each group had a respiratory rate of 2 bpm at a single time point. One dog in the control group had apnea and received supplemental oxygen, and the event was reported as an adverse rea ction. None of the other dogs in the study required supplemental oxygen. All dogs had normal respiratory rates ( 10 bpm) at 240, 300, and 360 minutes post -drug administration. Table II.7.

One dog in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 13 dogs in the control group had hypothermia that required use of an external heat source and were reported as adverse events. There were 5 dogs (4.5%) in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 13 dogs (11.5%) in the control group that had a body temperature 103.5 \u00b0F. The instances of hyperthermia were limited to a single timepoint in 4 of the Zenalpha\u00ae dogs and were over 2 timepoints (at 60 and 90 min) in one Zenalpha\u00ae dog. The instances of hyperthermia occurred at a single timepoint for 5 dogs in the control group and over multiple timepoints in the other 8 control dogs. Mucous membranes refill time: Mucous membrane color and capillary refill time were normal in all dogs in both treatment groups throughout the study. Reaction to Injection: Tolerance to the administration of Zenalpha\u00ae or control was assessed using the scoring scale below. To maintain the masking of personnel that conduct clinical observations and pain assessments, the injection reaction assessment was conducted by the treatmen t administrator. The summary data for injection reaction is based on the safety population. There was no reaction to the administration of treatment in 56.4% of Zenalpha\u00ae dogs and in 71.7% of control dogs. There was a mild reaction in 18.2% of Zenalpha\u00ae dogs and in 20.4% of control dogs. There was a moderate reaction in 11.8% of Zenalpha\u00ae dogs and in 5.3% of control dogs.

Some dogs received additional analgesia as the effects of the sedation and analgesia was evaluated in 223 dogs (110 in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 113 in the control group). A total of 45 dogs experienced 51 adverse reactions during the study. Sixteen (31.4%) of the dogs were in the Zenalpha\u00ae group and 35 (68.6%) were in the control group. One serious adverse reaction was reported during t he study. One dog in the control group experienced severe bradycardia at approximately 28 minutes after treatment administration and became apneic about 14 minutes after the bradycardia developed. Atipamezole reversal was administered and the dog recovered within 5 -10 minutes. The most common adverse reactions in the Zenalpha\u00ae group were diarrhea (3.6%), muscle tremors (1.8%), and colitis (1.8%). The most common adverse reactions in the control group were hypothermia (11.5%), vomiting (5.3%), prolonged sed ation (1.8%).

The combination of the alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist medetomidine and the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist vatinoxan had an improved physiologic safety profile and absence of prolonged sedation compared to the control product dexmedetomidine. 2. Atipamezole Reversal Study A laboratory study in eight adult male Beagle dogs was conducted to determine whether atipamezole was effective in reversing the sedative and cardiovascular effects of Zenalpha\u00ae. The study was a 4 -period cross over design with a 7 -day washout period between treatments. Both treatment groups received Zenalpha\u00ae at the labeled dose and one treatment group was administered the approved dose of atipamezole hydrochloride (5 mg/m2 IM) 30 minutes after administration of Zenalpha\u00ae. Dogs were monitored for 90 minutes after atipamezole hydrochloride administration. Administration of atipamezole hydrochloride resulted in reversal of sedation within 10 - 20 minutes and return to baseline values for heart rate and blood pressure within 20 - 30 minutes. Rectal temperature increased following atipamezole hydrochloride administration but had not returned to baseline within 90 minutes (end of study). Atipamezole hydrochloride administered at 5 mg/m2 IM was effective in reversing the sedative a nd cardiovascular effects of Zenalpha\u00ae.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 19of 28 III. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY Zenalpha\u00ae was administered IV in the laboratory multi -dose safety study to minimize potential issues with administering large volumes of the product IM.

Results: Mortality and Morbidity: There were no deaths or clinically significant illness during the s tudy. Clinical observations and examinations: Unscheduled clinical observations that were noted included mucoid, soft, or watery feces reported in all groups during acclimation. There were no reported abnormalities for feces in the control group post-dose. Dogs administered Zenalpha\u00ae had reported mucoid, soft, or watery feces in the 1X (1 dog), 3X (2 dogs), and 5X (3 dogs) groups post -dose. One 3X female had explosive diarrhea 1 h our after dosing. One 5X female vomited once 4 hours after dosing. Observations that were not noted in the control group but occurred in the dogs in the Zenalpha\u00ae groups included observations of salivation, trembling, tremors, vocalization, pinpoint pupils , nictitans protrusions, defecation after dosing, injected sclera, struggling after dosing, and skin cool to touch. Body weight: There were no clinically relevant effects on body weight for any of the groups during the study. Physical Examination1: Heart rate The mean heart rate (beats per minute, bpm) in the Zenalpha\u00ae groups decreased shortly after dose administration and was lowest 1 -hour post dose when compared to pre -dose and control group mean heart rates.

There w ere periods of sinus bradycardia that peaked 30 to 60 minutes post -dose that were followed by an acceleration of the heart rate (shortening of the RR interval) and instances of sinus tachycardia that peaked 1.5 hours (1X group) to 4 hours (5X group) post-dose. The heart rate changes were accompanied by physiologically appropriate changes in the PR and QT intervals. There was also evidence of QRS duration widening and QTc interval prolongation that corresponded to the intervals in which the heart rate was slowed. Second -degree atrioventricular (AV) block occurred infrequently (5 instances in 3 dogs) and was not dose related.

Two male dogs in the 5X group had serum blood glucose less than 65 mg/dL on Day 3 at 3 hours post -dose (56 mg/dL an d 62 mg/dL). Blood glucose was normal at acclimation and other study time points for these two dogs. Two dogs had slightly decreased serum potassium post -dose, a 1X female (4.1 mEq/L, reference 4.2 -5.2 mEq/L) and a 3X female (4.0 mEq/L).

There were no treatment related effects on histopathology or organ weights. Toxicokinetics: Plasma, urinary, and CSF concentrations of dexmedetomidine, levomedetomidine, and vatinoxan were spectromet ry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method. The maximum observed concentration (C max) and estimated concentration at time zero (C 0) were less than dose -proportional for vatinoxan, and approximately dose -proportional for dexmedetomidine and levomedetomidine after one dose on Day 1. The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to 8 hours (AUC 0-8h) was approximately dose-proportional for vatinoxan and was more than dose -proportional for both dexmedetomidine and levomedetomi dine after one dose on Day 1. The systemic exposure was similar among male and female dogs. Following administration of the 1 X dose for 4 consecutive days, adjusted for plasma protein binding, the plasma unbound fraction: CSF ratio was approximately 36:1 for vatinoxan, and close to 1:1 for dexmedetomidine. It was considered that the plasma: CSF ratios showed vatinoxan would be unlikely to exert appreciable CNS effects; therefore, CNS tissue levels were not determined.Freedom of Information Summary NADA 141 -551 Page 27of 28 Urine drug analysis between the Day 3 and 4 doses showed that vatinoxan was excreted in low concentration (ng/m L) and variable amounts in the urine . Taking into account the urine volumes collected and total dose of vatinoxan received in each dog, the amount of the Day 3 dose detected in the u rine was approximately 2% (1 X group) to 5% (3 X and 5 X groups). Conclusion: Zenalpha\u00ae administered as an intravenous injection once daily for 4 days at doses of 1 mg medetomidine and 20 mg vatinoxan/m2 BSA, 3 mg medetomidine and 60 mg vatinoxan/m2 BSA, or 5 mg medetomidine and 100 mg vatinoxan/m2 BSA did not produce systemic toxicity and had an acceptable margin of safety. The administration of Zenalpha\u00ae resulted in sedation, decreased blood pressure , hypothermia, and initial sinus bradycardia and later sinus tachycardia that all resolved prior to the next scheduled dose. Clinical observations during the study were related to the mechanism of action of the product. Toxicokinetic analysis showed approximately dose -proportional systemic exposure to the active ingredients and very low levels of urinary excretion of vatinoxan. The results of the plasma: CSF ratio analysis suggest that vatinoxan lacks appreciable activity in the CNS. This study supports the safe use of Zenalpha\u00ae when administered intramuscularly, according to the label, as a sedative for dogs. IV.
