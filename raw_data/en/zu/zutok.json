Chiropractic and acupuncture are often conflated as being part of the same holistic, natural medicine family. While they both have non-invasive healing origins, their distinctions run much deeper. Despite what some people believe, the two techniques are in fact very diverse from one another. They both work with the nervous system and have an impact on health, but there are a lot of other differences between chiropractic vs. acupuncture. Let's explore chiropractic vs acupuncture in more detail to understand their key differences. What's Chiropractic Care? Chiropractic's history started with the development of an alternative medical practice by Daniel David Palmer in 1895. This is where he discovered that misalignment in the spine would create health problems for patients who had no previous issues. He called this subluxation or vertebral subluxation complex, now known as the Chiropractic Subluxation Complex (CSC). He believed that once a CSC was relieved through spinal manipulation it could lead to improved health for his patients. Chiropractors treat patients with a variety of health issues including neck and back pain, arthritis, sports injuries, and other maladies. They use their hands and specialized equipment to execute these therapies. They may manually modify the spine or extremities (such as arms or legs) to enhance joint mobility and restore correct movement sequences in the body, which can help reduce discomfort caused by these sorts of problems. What's Chiropractic Treatment? Chiropractors receive extensive education on how to manipulate bones and joints which allows them to provide treatment for those patients who have been injured doing everyday activities such as gardening, playing sports, etc. They become very familiar with a wide range of injuries and how to treat them effectively using spinal manipulation techniques. In addition to these treatments, chiropractors also offer nutritional counseling, lifestyle advice, and exercise therapy. Chiropractic Vs. AcupunctureIs It for You? Chiropractic is for you if you are having discomfort with your muscles, joints, or bones as a result of misalignment. It has been proven to help those who suffer from illnesses such as: - Scoliosis - Migraine headaches - Dizziness/balance issues - ADD/ADHD - Fibromyalgia - Arthritis and Carpal tunnel syndrome. - It can help with these conditions as well as others that involve the musculoskeletal system. If you're someone who prefers a more natural approach to healing then chiropractic medicine is for you. Chiropractors will be able to provide pain relief and even restore your normal daily functions so that you can go about your day without being in discomfort. They have been known to help people get out of wheelchairs or off of crutches after they have suffered an injury, whether it's work-related or during recreational activities. What's Acupuncture Treatment? Acupuncture's history starts with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It was believed that an energy flow, called Qi, needed to flow freely through the body to maintain health. If there were blockages in this Qi or if it was flowing too fast it would cause pain and disease. So, acupuncture needles are inserted into specific points on the body to help regulate this energy flow and improve blood circulation. Acupuncture is a procedure that involves placing thin needles at specific points on your skin. The idea of acupuncture was discovered by ancient Chinese physicians who observed that people who had injuries or trauma would have certain parts of their body become numb at the site of the injury. Benefits Of Acupuncture Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to promote health and healing. Acupuncture can help with a variety of ailments, including migraines, neck and back pain, arthritis, muscular pains from sports injuries or vehicle accident trauma. Stress infertility in women and men, menstrual issues such as PMS and menopausal symptoms, even addictions like smoking may all be treated with acupuncture. Acupuncturists are educated in how to insert needles into the acupuncture points that lie along the body's twelve meridians, which are known as \"energy lines\" or \"meridians.\" These energy lines run throughout our bodies and connect spiritual and physical health. Is Acupuncture for You? Acupuncture is best for people who are searching for a holistic approach to their health and wellness. Acupuncture is often effective in treating symptoms such as: - Neck pain - Back pain - Stress and Anxiety - Headaches or Migraines - Menstrual problems/painful periods - Arthritis and Joint pain Many people find acupuncture to be relaxing as well as beneficial to their overall health because it can relieve stress, promote good sleep, and ease muscle tension. While not every treatment works the same on everyone, acupuncture provides many benefits that you may not get from an antibiotic or other traditional medicine. Acupuncture is also much less invasive than surgery so those who want to avoid drugs and surgery should consider it as an alternative treatment method for chronic pain or health conditions.
