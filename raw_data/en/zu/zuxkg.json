The COVID -19 pandemic is a public health emergency that has affected every country in the world. The COVID -19 vaccines are an important way to protect people from COVID -19, including the risk of going to hospital or death. We need a very high percentage (up to 80%) of people vaccinated for protection of the community, but n ot every one plans to get the COVID -19 vaccine straight away . To support the COVID -19 vaccine program, the Victorian Government funded this research to find out if Victorians were planning to get the vaccine , what concerns people had, and what information they needed to make this decision . Who carried out this study? This study was supported by the Victorian Government. Researchers from five different research and medical institutes (Murdoch Children's Research Institute, the University of Melbourne, The University of New South Wales, Monash University, The University of Sydney) worked together on the study. The researchers have expertise in vaccines and vaccination, general practice, pharmacy, and understanding people (social sciences). In addition to the research team, a project Advisory Group included representatives from government, medicine , nursing , pharmacy and the public . When did the study take place? The study took place from February to May, 2021. What did we do? We used three different research methods. We did the research with Victorians prioritised in Australia to receive the vaccine due to their higher risks of COVID -19 (people in the Phase 1a and 1b groups as determined by government); healthcare workers, people aged 70 years or over and people aged 18 - 69 years with a chronic health condition. Step 1 ONLINE SURVEY Completed by 3,224 health care workers 85% were female 55% aged between 18 -49 years 67% nurses 57% working in hospital 1,828 members of the public 57% were female 36% culturally or linguistically diverse background 50% aged 70+ years, 50% aged 18-69 years with chronic health condition Step 2 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS We interviewed 20 healthcare workers 19 members of the public 75% were female 25% born outside Australia 10% spoke a language other than English at home 12 healthcare workers and 12 members of the public were uncertain about or not planning to get or recommend the vaccine Step 3 FOCUS GROUPS We held 2 focus groups , each with a mix of 6 participants 6 healthcare workers (2 allied health, 3 nurses, 1 medical doctor) 6 members of the public (4 with chronic health condition, 2 aged 70 +) 10 were female , 6 were born outside Australia and/or non - English spoken at home COVID Vaccine Preparedness study Summary of report for the Victorian Government, 14 May 2021 COVID VACCINE PREPAREDNESS STUDY - REPORT SUMMARY | 2 What did we find out from people completing the online survey? Most people planned to get a vaccine , with some groups more or less likely to get it Intention to get vaccinated was high (more than 75%) among nurses, doctors, allied health professionals, and those working in hospitals, community or private practice However, only 58% of personal support workers and 66% of those working in residential aged or disability care facilities planned to get a COVID -19 vaccine 84% of members of the public aged 18 -69 with a chronic health condition and 90% of those aged 70 year s or more planned to get vaccinated Among both healthcare workers and the public, m en, older people and those living in metropolitan areas were more likely to get vaccinated Information from clinical trials about vaccine safety and how well the vaccines work was an important factor influencing the decisions to vaccinate for both groups People in both groups said they were more likely to vaccinate if the vaccine was required to travel overseas Healthcare workers were more likely to vaccinate if the vaccine was recommended by their professional society or if it was available at their workplace 51% of healthcare workers thought the vaccine should be required for all healthcare workers For those who were unsure or did not plan to get a vaccine, the main concerns were about vaccine safety, long -term effects and serious reactions Of those who were n ot definitely planning to get a vaccine, 73% of healthcare workers and 62% of the public participants were concerned about vaccine safety About 60% of both groups had concerns about long -term effects, and about half were worried about serious reactions Most people trusted the vaccines and felt the vaccines were important for their health and protecting others Over 75% of both groups trusted the COVID -19 vaccines, thought that they will be safe, and believed they w ere important for their health and protection of others Most healthcare workers wanted to get the vaccine at their workplace 66% of the public wanted to get the vaccine through general practice Most people reported not having enough information about the COVID- 19 vaccines Only 27% of both groups felt that they had enough information about 5 vaccine topics: how they work, their safety, how well they work , their side effects and how they should be delivered (number of doses, time between doses , etc) When people had enough information about the vaccines, they were nearly 7 times more likely to accept a COVID -19 vaccine than those with no or not enough information For both groups, most people preferred information to come from their health care provider, or government website s and sources Healthcare workers wanted printed information for patients, with training modules to support discussions about the COVID -19 vaccines with patients Healthcare workers Public (70 and 18-69 with health conditions ) Overall intention to vaccin ate Have at workplace or at GP Vaccine required to travel COVID VACCINE PREPAREDNESS STUDY - REPORT SUMMARY | 3 What did we find out from people in the individual interviews? Since the COVID -19 pandemic , everyone had made changes to their daily lives. People reported many difficulties but some positives Every aspect of li fe changed - home and family life, socialising and working all impacted Most people were less concerned about COVID -19 now, but some were still fearful Many people found it difficult to keep up with the amount of information about COVID -19 People thought there were important benefits of the vaccines Protect them selves and loved ones from COVID -19 Wider benefits for the community such as people being able to work, to see their family and friends, and to travel Help the wider community to stay safe They also had some safety concerns about the vaccines Some c oncerns were about minor side -effects, particu larly for those with underlying medical conditions Long-term effects were also a concern Blood clots were mentioned, but not everybody was concerned despite the media attention (Note: most interviews were held before the April change in AstraZeneca recommendations) Not all participants preferred one vaccine over another . Some people didn't mention a specific brand, but said they wanted a vaccine that was made in Australia, or safe for allergies. People identified a number of influential s ources of information Personal : friends, family or their own GP Public : public figures like Norman Swan and Brett Sutton or scientists, researchers, epidemiologists, Chief Medical/Health Officers Organisations : particularly with a medical or health focus, like the Australian Medical Association or the Cancer Council Those with a perceived vested interest in promoting the vaccine were not trusted (such as pharmaceutical companies, media organisations, individual politicians) Some people expressed misinformation, a lack of information and unrealistic expectations of the vaccines People were frustrate d and confused by practical issues Some of those who wanted the vaccine said they did n ot know who was eligible, how to book or where to be vaccinated Some healthcare workers mentioned inconsistent supply and burden on GP practices Information about vaccines should be personalised and easily accessible Information provided about the vaccines should be personalised to consider people's age and gender, any health conditions , or medication s they may be taking Information about each step of the vaccination process should be provided, from who is eligible , when they can receive the vaccine, booking details, to reminders for second doses Healthcare workers need information for themselves and t o support their patients I would stop worrying about the risk of getting sick...I'm only in my early 60s, I would like to kick around for a few more years! (Public, f emale, 60-69, respiratory condition, no/unsure to vaccine) We just don't know. There hasn't been enough information on any long-term trials to say, \"Hey, these are the complications down the track.\" (Healthcare worker , aged care nurse, male, 50 -59, no /unsure to vaccine) I haven't received any information that it was available at all. I haven't even seen it on the TV. (Public , female, 70 -79, yes to i) COVID VACCINE PREPAREDNESS STUDY - REPORT SUMMARY | 4 What did we find out from people in the in -depth focus groups? People were looking for personal information related to their medical condition, medications, age or background. Many of the benefits identified were about a sense of freedom or feeling free Freedom from lockdowns, particularly snap lockdowns for small case numbers Freedom from school closures and long periods of home -schooling for kids Freedom to travel locally, within Australia or overseas - seeing family or friends, visiting those in aged care without worrying about disease risk or border closures Financial security with the return of overseas students and opening interstate and international borders Knowing what an expected side effect is , and when to see a doctor Information about minor and severe side effects should be provided , along with evidence- based information about risks and benefits for individuals There were varied preferences for comparing the risk of clots Some wanted to compare the risk of clots to the risk of COVID -19 disease Others wanted to compare the risk to everyday events , like car or plane crashes or risks from other medications Numbers could be difficult to understand, but were needed to explain risk Explaining risk in simple terms and illustrating with images were important (Note : both focus groups were held after the April change in AstraZeneca recommendations , but before the June change ) People knew that change was likely and wanted those speaking about vaccines to be open about uncertainty and to say things may change. They said this would build confidence in the information being provided. Brochures and written information are important, but more dynamic methods such as interactive websites or videos which can be easily shared were preferred. How does this research help? By doing this research, we found out what Victorians in phase 1a and 1b of the vaccine rollout think and feel about the COVID -19 vaccines and the vaccination process. We also found out what people want to know and how they want this information provided. These details can be used to help support Victorians in deciding to get a COVID -19 vaccine (or not) and how to go about it. Using this information , we came up with 11 recommendations for the Victorian Government to support Victorians with decisions about COVID -19 vaccines. The recommendations cover communication content, delivery and context. The report and recommendations have been given to the Government to consider when communicating about the COVID -19 vaccines, the vaccination program or COVID -19. We will present the information from our research on our website, at conferences, and in academic papers so that others can also have this i nformation to help communicate with their communities. A special thank you to everyone who participated in the survey, interview s and focus groups . Your time and input contributed to these recommendations.
