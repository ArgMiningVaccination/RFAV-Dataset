Chemotherapy (chemo) is a type of treatment that includes a drug or combination of drugs to treat cancer. Sometimes these medications are called \"anti-cancer\" drugs. Chemotherapy treatments may be given in many ways: Intravenous (IV) : Through a catheter tube in the vein, normally placed in the arm. Sometimes, your doctor may recommend having an IV infusion device. The two most common are peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines and ports. Both of these devices stay in longer than an IV catheter placed in your vein at the time of your infusion visit. Talk to your health care team for more information about what's best for you. Orally: Taken by mouth as pills, capsules or liquids that you swallow. Intracavitary: Given directly into a body area. Topically: Placed on the skin where it is absorbed. Intra-arterial (IA) : Given directly into an artery. Biotherapy (biological therapy or targeted therapy) is treatment that uses the body's own immune system to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. Some biotherapies work by stopping the blood supply to a tumor or by interrupting signals within the cancer cell. Types of biotherapy include: Monoclonal antibodies, cancer vaccines and growth factors. Monoclonal antibodies kill cancer cells. These drugs do not cause harm to healthy cells. Cancer vaccines help the body fight to keep cancer from coming back. Growth factors help your own body renew and make blood cells. INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK12 PREPARINGYour oncology doctor will decide which medication(s) to give you and how they will be given. Information about your treatment will be given to you by your oncology team. This handbook will focus on information to support you through treatments given intravenously (IV) in the infusion areas. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) provides information to those who are undergoing infusion treatment, too. Visit: www.cancer.gov . You may want to review the booklet from NCI, Chemotherapy and You . You may obtain a copy of this booklet by contacting the Cancer Education Program either by phone (734)647-8626 or by email CCC-PERC@med.umich.edu. Use the Chemotherapy and You booklet if you have questions about your treatment. There are many helpful sections to read as you move through your treatment. Please review the section: Questions and Answers about Chemotherapy.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK13 PREPARINGWhat Can I Do to Get Ready for Treatment? You can prepare for treatment by reading these tips: Learn about the chemotherapy your doctor has prescribed for you It is helpful to review information and know your resources before treatment starts. Materials to review may include: Options for clinical trials, informed consents, drug information sheets, and nutrition information. While it is great to have so many resources available, we understand that it may seem overwhelming. You may want to choose a caregiver who can partner with you as a support person and information-gatherer. It is also helpful to think about your questions and write them down before you visit your oncology team. You will find blank pages in the back of this handbook to use for questions, appointments, or other notes. Get a thermometer to use at home It's important for you to check your temperature on a regular basis. An elevated temperature is a sign that you may need medical attention. Buy an oral (mouth) or ear thermometer. Check to make sure it works and that you can read it. Take precautions against pregnancy It is very important that you or your partner do not get pregnant during chemotherapy treatment. Use two forms of birth control to avoid pregnancy while you or your partner is being treated. Continue using birth control for at least six months after your last treatment. If there is any chance that pregnancy has occurred during your course of treatment, call your oncology team right away.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK14 PREPARINGFertility Some men and women who get chemotherapy become infertile. This means that they will face challenges when trying to conceive a child. If you plan to have children in the future, talk to your doctor before your treatment starts. The University of Michigan Center for Reproductive Medicine offers fertility preservation interventions for men and women with cancer. You will need to have a referral from your doctor to go to this clinic. Talk with your oncology team if you have any questions. Schedule a dental checkup before treatment starts, if time allows Your mouth can be a source of infection during some types of chemotherapy treatment. For this reason, it is helpful to have a check-up and complete any needed dental work before you start treatment. If it is not possible to see your dentist before chemotherapy, talk with your oncology team. If you have had a checkup with your dentist in the last six months, and you do not have any new problems, you do not need to see your dentist again before starting treatment. Some treatments may cause mouth and or throat changes. Your health care team will talk to you about the chemotherapy drugs that are most likely to affect your mouth or throat. If your health care team suggests mouth rinses, follow the instructions for mouth rinses that are described in the Mouth and Throat Changes section in the Chemotherapy and You booklet, unless instructed differently by your health care team.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK15 PREPARINGManaging the stress of cancer Psychological stress is used to describe what you may feel when you or a loved one are under mental, physical, or emotional pressure. Stress can be caused by daily activities and routine events, as well as by more unusual events, such as a serious illness. When people feel that they are unable to manage or control changes caused by cancer or normal life activities, they are in distress . If extra support is needed, talk with your oncology team. They will help you by making referrals for supportive care and services. Learn to accept help from others It is important to focus on your own needs during this time. This may mean learning to accept help from others. Allow someone to help with routine things like doing laundry or going to the grocery store. Learning to accept help from others can be hard, but may be necessary so that you can get the rest you need.Techniques to Manage Stress Everyone responds differently to stress. Below are some tips that may help reduce your stress: Training in relaxation, meditation, stress management or guided imagery Counseling or talk therapy Social support in a group setting Listening to soothing music Journaling Engaging in physical activity For more information on stress management, contact the Cancer Education Program by phone (734) 647-8626 or email CCC-PERC@ med.umich.edu or visit: www.RogelCancerCenter.org.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK16 PREPARINGPlan ahead Stock up on items you may need at home after treatment such as: Dressing supplies, medications and easily prepared foods. Make a list of your medications with dose and frequency and bring it with you to your appointments. Update the list if medications are changed. Hair loss Hair loss is common with many cancer treatments. Ask your oncology team if the medications prescribed for you may cause hair loss. Hair loss can begin as soon as your first treatment is given. Hair may come out slowly or in clumps and this can be an emotional experience. Some people choose to shave their heads rather than lose hair over time. Some choose to wear scarves while others may choose to purchase a wig. If hair loss is expected, and you would like a wig, let your health care team know. You will need a prescription for a \"hair prosthesis.\" Check with your insurance company to see if it is a covered benefit under your plan. To match your natural hair color, shop for your wig before hair loss occurs. The Patient Assistance Center (PAC) provides wigs and wig fittings. Call, (877) 907-0859 for more information. The Cancer Education Program can provide resources regarding wigs, scarves and other head coverings. For information, call (734) 647-8626 or email CCC-PERC@med.umich.edu.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK17 PREPARINGBe flexible with your appointments Your oncology team will schedule your chemotherapy. We ask that you be as flexible as possible with treatment days and times. Unexpected events regarding your treatment and/or the treatments of other patients can often cause changes or delays. Determine if your health insurance covers chemotherapy treatment costs It is important to talk to your health insurance plan about what costs are covered before you start treatment. The Chemotherapy and You booklet gives suggested questions to ask your health insurance plan in the Questions and Answers about Chemotherapy section. Staff members of the Rogel Cancer Center Billing and Customer Service Office are available to talk with you if you have questions about chemotherapy costs and billing. You may call them at (734) 232-2621 or (877) 326-9155. Support services and resources There are numerous support services and resources available to help you through treatment and recovery. Some of these include: Chemotherapy information, along with management of side effects Complementary Therapies: Art, Music and Guided Imagery Families Facing Cancer Grief and Loss Life Images Nutrition Services Cancer Education Program Physical Therapy (PT) and/or Occupational Therapy (OT) INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK18 PREPARING Patient Assistance Program: Wig Bank, Financial Assistance, etc. PsychOnc Clinic Social Work Spiritual Care Support Groups Symptom Management and Supportive Care Voices Art Gallery For more information on these services, call: (877) 907-0859 or visit: www.RogelCancerCenter.org.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK19 TREATMENTTreatment: Day of Infusion What information should I know for the day of infusion? Parking Parking choices will depend on where you are treated. There is a charge for parking at the main medical campus in Ann Arbor. Bring your parking ticket with you to infusion check-in and ask a staff member to stamp your ticket for a reduced rate. If you have questions about parking, call the Michigan Medicine Operator at (734) 936-4000 . Michigan Medicine blood drawing facilities Lab results are usually needed on the day of, or within one to two days before your infusion. Each infusion location has a blood draw area on site. Blood draw appointments are usually scheduled one-two hours before your infusion appointment time. There are many Michigan Medicine facilities that offer blood drawing services. Lab results drawn at these facilities will be available to your oncology doctor within 24 hours (one day). Information and directions to these centers can be found at: Factsheet located in the pocket of this handbook (MLABS Department of Pathology). https://www.uofmhealth.org/patient-and-visitor-guide/mlabs/locations If you would like to have your blood drawn before the day of your infusion at another Michigan Medicine facility, you may plan this with your health care team. Your doctor will need to give you a referral for the tests needed and the clinic staff will need to know the name and telephone number of the lab you choose.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK20 TREATMENTIf you have a port, specially trained phlebotomists will be able to draw blood from your port at the Rogel Cancer Center, Children's and Women's Hospital, Canton Health Center, West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Center for Specialty Care, and Northville Health Center. Otherwise, expect your blood to be drawn from your arm when getting labs drawn from other blood draw facilities. Also, you can check with your preferred location to see if the blood draw station staff will draw from your port. For more information on blood draw stations, look for the factsheet: MLABS Department of Pathology in the pocket of your handbook. Clinic appointments Many times your oncology doctor will want to see you before you start another cycle of chemotherapy. If you have an appointment with your doctor on the same day as treatment, please check-in at your clinic after your blood draw appointment and before your infusion appointment. Once your clinic appointment is done, go to your infusion appointment at the time on your appointment schedule and check-in with clerical staff at the desk. As a matter of safety, and to make sure that orders to the infusion staff and pharmacy have been completed, you should not check-in to infusion until you are checked-out of the clinic.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK21 TREATMENTInfusion centers Infusion chemotherapy is given at the Rogel Cancer Center, Children's and Women's Hospital Outpatient Adult Infusion Center, Canton Health Center, West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Center for Speciality Care and Northville Health Center. Each center varies in its amenities, but all centers are staffed by trained and caring health professionals. The medications prescribed for you may decide the location where you get your treatment. The clerical staff member who schedules your appointment will tell you the location of your infusion appointment. Maps to the infusion centers will be given to you as a handout. Many of these handouts are included in the pocket of this handbook. Staff members in each infusion center have the same level of specialized training. All infusion nurses who give chemotherapy are highly trained and certified, which means they get added training to give chemotherapy safely to patients. Your infusion appointment Please note your appointment time for infusion is not the time you will start your treatment. You will not be taken to an infusion chair upon your arrival. When you check-in at your appointment, this signals infusion and pharmacy staff to check your orders and lab results to make sure they are all right before starting to prepare your medications. If you need blood products, your arrival signals staff to talk with the blood bank for the preparation and release of the needed blood product. Once you come for your appointment, the infusion and pharmacy staff are checking: The orders for your treatment. Results of laboratory values. Communication from your oncology health care team. Other information needed for your treatment.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK22 TREATMENTThere are many things that affect your wait time, such as: The complexity of your treatment. A white blood count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) level which are very low. WBC and ANC levels can take up to two hours to process before a result is available. The WBC and ANC must be at acceptable levels before any chemotherapy is given. The need for some medications to be thawed or dissolved. The process of testing the type of blood you have and donor compatibility may take many hours. We know that the amount of time spent waiting for your treatment to start can be frustrating. It is always our goal to treat you as safely and quickly as possible. During your wait, you may ask for a pager from the infusion check-in staff so that you can move around the cancer center. You will get a page to return to the infusion center when the infusion team is ready for you to begin treatment. There are a few ways you may be able to lessen your wait time: You may think about having your blood draw on a day before your treatment. Blood draws may be able to be done a day or two before your infusion. You may ask for an appointment during early morning or evening hours when there are fewer patients getting treatment. You may ask if you can have your infusion on a different day from your clinic appointment. If you are interested in any of these options, please talk with your oncology health care team to be sure that it is right for you.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK23 TREATMENTWaiting times for chemotherapy infusion Wait times for infusion appointments are sometimes long. We understand that this can be stressful. How long you wait to be seated in the infusion area depends on many factors. When you checked in with our clerical staff, we began a series of checks to ensure the safety and quality of your treatment. Once your doctor or his/her team has written and processed your order, we confirm your lab values or other important information to begin preparing your treatment. Your order is then placed in a \"queue, or line\" in our pharmacy. While you are not physically standing in line waiting for a spot in the infusion room, your order is in line for you and is prioritized within the pharmacy. Chemotherapy or medications are generally not prepared ahead of time because they are made specifically for you. Because of this, your medication is not likely to be ready when you arrive. Some medications are quickly and easily prepared, while others may take longer. Some of the most serious safety double checks occur during this time period and cannot be rushed. We understand that it can be very frustrating to have to wait. Please be assured that we are working as fast as we can, taking your safety into account. We encourage you to check with the clerical staff for your estimated wait time after you have been waiting 30 minutes. Things to consider: Wait times can also be d+riven by the number of patients in the infusion area at one time. You may want to consider coming earlier or later in the day to avoid times when the most patients are receiving treatment.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK24 TREATMENT You may also want to consider talking with your doctor or his/her team to see if you can come on a day separate from your clinic appointment. While this is not always possible, it would eliminate your wait during order writing and processing. Your lab work can also be done a day ahead of time, if this is approved by your doctor. You may request a pager at the check in desk. A pager allows you to leave the infusion waiting area. While you would still need to stay within the hospital, you could go get something to eat or visit the gift shop. We thank you for giving us this opportunity to partner with you for your care.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK25 TREATMENTDuring your treatment The infusion areas have recliner chairs, beds and stretchers. Please note that bed space is not guaranteed even if it is requested by your oncology team on your behalf. The beds and stretchers are assigned based on the medical needs of the patient and the type of treatment they are receiving. You may ask for your treatment to take place in a certain infusion area; however, such requests may hold up the start of your treatment. You will need to wear a wristband when you are in the infusion area. Patient identification is a top priority for safety. Throughout your visit, you will be asked to say your full name and birthdate many times. The infusion staff will compare this to your wristband, medical orders and medication(s). You may also be asked to confirm your height and weight before getting treatment. These are quality measures that ensure safe care. A Medical Assistant (MA) will greet you in the waiting area. They will measure your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, height and weight. INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK26 CONTINUOUS HOME INFUSION THERAPYSome patients may get continuous home infusion chemotherapy. This section of the handbook is for you. You will also get more detailed information about your particular kind of continuous home infusion chemotherapy from your clinic nurse. What is continuous home infusion chemotherapy? Chemotherapy given slowly over one or more days is called continuous infusion chemotherapy. This type of treatment is given with an infusion device that is attached to your intravenous catheter or port. The device will make sure that the chemotherapy is given at the proper speed and that the right amount is given. A nurse will connect you to the continuous infusion treatment in the infusion area. You will carry the device, in a pouch, wherever you go while the chemotherapy is infusing. What's involved with continuous home infusion chemotherapy? Home Care: HomeMed will ensure that you have all of the needed supplies and equipment. When your continuous infusion is finished, it will be disconnected by a nurse either in your home or in the infusion center, or you can be taught how to self-disconnect at home. Education: Patients getting continuous infusion are taught how to care for their infusion and how to manage problems that may occur at home. A clinic nurse will work with you and your family to make sure you have the tools needed to care for yourself during home infusion. Continuous Home Infusion ChemotherapyINFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK27 CONTINUOUS HOME INFUSION THERAPYSpecial considerations: continuous infusion of chemotherapy agents On a rare occasion, chemotherapy may leak into your tissue which can cause problems. Signs of a problem include: A burning feeling at or around your IV site. Pain at your IV site. Your infusion pump alarm says \"occlusion.\" Redness, swelling or tenderness at or around your IV site. Drainage or a wet IV dressing. If you notice any of these problems, call HomeMed at (800) 862-2731 right away for more instructions. Early identification and treatment is important. Depending on the type of medication infusing, a nurse will check for blood return in your central venous catheter once a day while your medication is infusing. This is a short, but very important, home visit. HomeMed should also be contacted for any other problems with your home infusion pump or if you require additional supplies at (800) 862-2731. INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK28 CONTINUOUS HOME INFUSION THERAPYThe University of Michigan cannot take your waste containers for disposal. To find out if there is a needle/sharp collection program in your area, contact the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) at (800) 662-9278 or visit the Medical Waste Regulatory Program's Web Site at www.michigan.gov/deqmedwaste .Hazardous waste container - for collecting needles and other chemotherapy equipment A hazardous waste container will be given to you by HomeMed if you receive continuous home infusion chemotherapy. You will receive education on how to handle the materials used for home infusion of chemotherapy. Place all needles, IV tubing, chemotherapy bags, syringes and lancets in this container. Hazardous waste containers should be made of heavy, puncture-proof plastic, have a lid and be marked \"Hazardous Waste\" for safety. Store it out of reach of children and pets. INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK29 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSFrequently Asked Questions Can I drive? We suggest that you plan to have a driver for at least your first chemotherapy treatment. After that, whether or not you can drive depends on the medications you get, your response to them, and your overall health. The effects of some medications may make it unsafe for you to drive. If you have a driver, but the driver is not staying with you during treatment, it is best that they are easily reached and flexible about the time of pick-up. We will be happy to call your driver 30 minutes before you are finished with your treatment. If there are any transportation issues, please talk with your oncology team before your first infusion. On the day of treatment, let the infusion nurse know of any unresolved issues before your treatment starts. How long will I be in the infusion center and what should I expect? It is best to plan to spend most of the day at the infusion center for your treatment. The staff can give you approximate lengths of treatment, but there are many unexpected things that can add time to your stay. You will get treatment designed specifically for you. Treatment times differ between patients. Many times there are other medications given to manage and prevent the side effects of chemotherapy. The nursing staff will check to see how you are doing before you start treatment and during and after treatment. If you are doing okay, you'll be released to go home. The nursing and MA staff will make every effort to see that you are comfortable and your needs are met during your treatment. Infusion staff will answer questions for you and call your health care team as needed. INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK30 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSCan I eat before and during treatment? Many patients worry about eating before their treatment. We suggest that you eat according to your schedule. You may find it best to eat a light meal and to avoid fried, spicy, or acidic foods before your treatment. Do not skip meals before your treatment, unless your doctor tells you to. Be sure to drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids the day before and the day of your treatment. Well-hydrated veins are usually easier to access with an IV catheter. You are welcome to bring a food and beverages to your infusion appointment. A refrigerator and microwave are available for you to use. If you want a larger meal, we also offer a low-cost meal tray delivery service for patients and family members. We offer cold or warm breakfast, lunch and dinner options at standard delivery times. We have a large menu from which you may choose. Michigan Medicine does not approve of, or sell, sugar-sweetened beverages such as regular soda pop. There is a patient supply of regular soda pop in the infusion area for the management of certain symptoms. Regular soda pop cannot be given to anyone other than the person getting treatment.

INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK37 AFTER TREATMENTYou will be able to go home once your infusion is done. When you first discuss your treatment plan, your oncology team will review what is normal to experience after treatment. The Chemotherapy and You booklet from the National Cancer Institute is a great resource during and after chemotherapy. It is normal to be worried about the possible side effects from your treatment. It is important to discuss your concerns with your oncology team. Remember, not all patients get side effects. The severity and type of side effects that may happen will depend on your treatment. Even though certain treatments have expected side effects, call your oncology team and let them know what side effects you are experiencing. Your oncology team will review the side effects linked to your treatment plan. They will also give you suggested ways to manage them. The section, Side Effects and Ways to Manage Them in the Chemotherapy and You booklet, gives more information about preventing and managing side effects. Your oncology team will continue to give you information as you progress through your treatments. Remember, each chemotherapy treatment is different, and every patient experience is unique.What to Expect: After Chemotherapy Treatment Notify your doctor or nurse if you experience a side effect, even one that might be expected.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK38 AFTER TREATMENTWhen should I call my health care team?

You may get additional instructions about when to call your health care team. What precautions do I need to take in my home? You will need to take precautions in your home after chemotherapy. These precautions will protect you and those around you from coming in contact with chemotherapy by-products. Chemotherapy may be present in blood, mucus, sexual fluids, stool, sweat, tears, urine, and vomit. Most chemotherapy medications will be out of your body in less than 48 hours (two days). INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK39 AFTER TREATMENTAlways wash hands with soap and water after coming into contact with chemotherapy or body waste, even if you wore Nitrile\u00ae gloves.We have outlined general precautions that you should follow during your infusion and for 48 hours (two days after you complete your chemotherapy. In general, these precautions help avoid all bodily fluids that may have trace amounts of chemotherapy. Your oncology provider may have different guidelines for you to follow. You should talk to your oncology provider if you have questions about chemotherapy precautions. You can buy needed supplies such as gowns and Nitrile\u00ae gloves from the Home Care Services Retail Store in the Taubman Center located on the first floor in Reception F or from a medical supply company. Laundry Take these precautions when doing laundry contaminated with chemotherapy: Use Nitrile\u00ae gloves to handle laundry soiled with chemotherapy, vomit, or stool to keep it from touching your skin. If bed linens or clothing become soiled, do not wash them with other household clothes, towels, etc. Use hot water, soap and bleach. Run them through the washer twice. If you cannot wash your bed linens or clothing right away, double-bag them in plastic garbage bags and keep them separate from other household laundry. After your clothing or bed linens have been washed, throw the plastic bags away in your regular trash - right away. Wear a gown when there is a chance for splashing of, or exposure to, body wasteINFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK40 AFTER TREATMENTBody waste Small amounts of chemotherapy are present in your body fluids and body waste. You should wash the area with soap and water if you are exposed to any body fluids or waste. Others in your household may use the same toilet as long as you flush all waste down the toilet twice with the lid down. Consider using a plastic blue pad to cover the inside of the lid during flushes and replace this after each use. If you use a commode, bedpan, urinal, or a basin for vomiting, wear Nitrile\u00ae gloves when cleaning out the waste. Rinse the container with water and clean it at least once a day with soap and water. If you do not have control of your bladder or bowels, use a disposable, plastic- backed pad, diaper, or sheet to soak up urine and stool. When it becomes soiled, change the protective item right away and wash the skin with soap and water. Diapers, pads, and gloves soiled with body waste should be placed in a securely fastened plastic bag, then double bagged and placed with your regular trash. If you have an ostomy, wear Nitrile\u00ae gloves when emptying and changing the ostomy appliance for 48 hours (two days). A disposable gown should be worn if there is any chance of splashing during disposal of body waste, or exposure while handling soiled linens. If body waste splashes into your eye(s), flush eye(s) right away with water for 10 to 15 minutes and call your oncology provider.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK41 AFTER TREATMENTPregnant and/or breast-feeding caregivers Pregnant or breast-feeding women should wear Nitrile\u00ae gloves and a gown when caring for a person who is getting chemotherapy. Sexual activity and pregnancy During treatment with chemotherapy, some of the side effects may decrease your interest in sex. If you are feeling well, it is usually safe to have sex with certain precautions in place. Talk with a member of your health care team before engaging in sexual activities in case there are concerns for your condition. Things to consider: Take extra measures to avoid pregnancy, such as using two forms of birth control. Chemotherapy can have poor effects on a developing baby. Tell a member of your health care right away if you become pregnant during chemotherapy treatment. Use barrier protection, such as condoms or dental dams (for oral sex). Chemotherapy can be found in semen or vaginal fluid. A barrier protection will keep your partner safe. Sex can be a problem if you are bleeding from the genital area, have recently had surgery, or if your immune system is very weakened. Hand washing Because your immune system is weakened, it's much easier for you to get sick. Hand washing is one of the most important things you can do to stop infection. Wash your hands: After using the toilet. After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK42 AFTER TREATMENTProper Hand-Washing with Soap and Water Wet your hands and wrists under warm or cold running water and apply soap. Work lather between fingers, under nails and over palms and backs of hands and wrists. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Rinse hands and wrists well under clean running water. Dry your hands using a clean paper towel or air dry them. Proper Hand-Washing with Hand Sanitizer - Lotions and Gels Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a concentration of 60% to 95% ethanol or isopropanol alcohol when choosing a hand sanitizer . Apply the lotion or gel to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount). Rub your hands together. Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry. Do not use hand sanitizer gels or lotions after using the toilet. Use soap and water, only. After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. After touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste. After handling pets, pet food or pet treats. After touching garbage. Before, during, and after preparing food. Before eating food. Before and after caring for someone who is sick. Before and after treating a cut or wound.INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK43 AFTER TREATMENTSkin care Skin can become irritated from chemotherapy. You should wash the area well with soap and water if your skin comes in contact with chemotherapy or body waste containing chemotherapy. Call your oncology doctor if there is redness or irritation on the skin that lasts longer than one hour. Managing physical and emotional challenges The end of cancer treatment is often a time of mixed emotions. Most likely you are thankful to be finished with the demands of treatment and are ready to put the experience behind you. In addition, you may also worry about cancer recurrence. This is normal, especially during the first year after treatment. Your physical and emotional state at the end of your treatment is unique. Many people who have completed treatment are so focused on getting through the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, that once the treatment is finished they are just not sure what is next. Those who have gone through cancer treatment describe the first few months as a time of change. It's not so much as \"getting back to normal\" as it is finding out what's normal for you now. People often say that life has new meaning or that they look at things differently. You can also expect things to keep changing as you move through your recovery. You can't change the fact that you have had cancer. What you can change is how you live the rest of your life; making healthy choices and feeling as well as possible, physically and emotionally. These topics and more are discussed in Facing Forward , a booklet written by the National Cancer Institute . This booklet is available to all patients of the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer INFUSION THERAPY HANDBOOK44 AFTER TREATMENTCenter. You can obtain this booklet by contacting the Cancer Education Program by phoning (734) 647-8626 or emailing CCC-PERC@med.umich.edu. for more information.
