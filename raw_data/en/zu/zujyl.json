In a moment of reflection on the path to wellness, there is often remembrance of that moment of realization. The day the shift toward the positive resolution of a disharmony began in a moment of clarity or truth. The energy assessment can be part of that memory. Working with clients offers repeated opportunities to witness that ah ha moment through viewing through the lens of realization. The discovery was made and the healing began. In case studies, an imbalance can shift immediately upon the discoveries made during an energy assessment. The connection between an accurate illumination of an imbalance and the awareness that follows, is truly a fulfilling experience that is hard to match with any other human endeavor. To be a small part of another person's healing is the reward that makes the effort worth every challenge found with the process personal transformation. At the IEL Institute for the Spiritual Arts, we take pride in helping others with this key ingredient to healing by helping those interested in performing an accurate energy assessment of human systems. Through this single act of service, awareness is discovered. Intention The intentional act of creating sustainable movement toward the positive realization of dreams cannot be overstated. Many people are unfamiliar with setting an intention, which is often confused with setting goals. Intentions are the energy that creates the state of mind needed to overcome a challenge. Intentions are the energy behind the goals. The intention sets the energy internally and externally, by creating a message to the Universe. The Universe responds to the establishment of an intention in the most supportive ways beyond what can be imagined. The result is the release of limitations based in thoughts, beliefs, negative emotions, attachments, and sometimes people. A teacher once said to his group of seekers, Going through a process of healing without an intention is like getting on a bus with no idea where it's going. Intentions make the individual the master of ceremonies of their own life force, forging a vacuum that nature will always fill. The collective support from every source, lifts the individual like a wave that carries the surfer toward the beach with increasing momentum on a natural continuum. Every healthy resolution of an imbalance, starts with an intentional expression on some level of human consciousness. Gratitude Gratitude is the energy that provides a boost to the collection of ingredients. Gratitude demonstrates an abundance of the resource known as kindness and appreciation. The way a person expressed their gratitude can vary, but conveyance of gratitude establishes energetic stability. This is why the importance of exchanging for energy sessions is emphasized. In case studies, it becomes obvious that people do not find the highest levels of benefit from free energy healing. Those that give the most gratitude, experience the greatest results from energy healing. Some feel that spiritual work should be offered for free. This is merely ego creating a spiritual bypass of the truth. The truth is that both the healer and client find balance in the expression of gratitude as an essential ingredient to healing. Even when there is no monetary exchange for healing work, there are numerous ways that gratitude can be conveyed. The avoidance of addressing the issue of exchange, indicates a block in the energy that is ultimately influencing the creation of limitations. Love The energy of love is what facilitates the energy of healing. The energy of love is found in an external source, such as God, Universal Consciousness, Oneness, Nature, family, animals, and any organized system that serves to fill the heart with a connection to grace and divinity. Without love, the human energy system experiences deficiency on some level. Healing is a form of ascension in the body. As each person incarnates to learn lessons of love on the return to sovereignty, small doses of that source of live-giving energy creates the lift needed on that journey. Dr. Marcel Vogel once stated through his laboratory studies as a spiritual scientist, Love is the glue that bonds all matter. He also discovered that Love is the primary unit of life and Hatred is the negative unit of life. Illness and disharmony is the spirit's inability to handle the negative emotions. As we learn more about the mind/body connection, it becomes clear that almost every disharmony can be traced to a metaphysical aspect around negative expression of emotions. In the highest act of creating healing, it is obvious that we must let love the lead the way to open the door to the healing energy of the heart. Ceremony This is possibly the most overlooked element of energy healing or the process of healing. The ceremonious act seals the light around healing by creating the bond within the providence of Divinity. The structure of the ceremony is irrelevant. It's the act of the spirit connecting to a power greater than the self, that provides the foundation for organizing the complex structure around healing or the healing architecture. Ceremony brings into alignment the core values of individual vibration. Civilizations and various cultures have engaged in ceremonious offerings since ancient times, as a way to connect with what lies in the hidden realms. The ceremony creates ancient stirrings within, as a way to remember who we are and why we came to Earth. In that remembrance, there is illumination on the path in the return to personal sovereignty. Energy assessments are the path. Intention is the key that unlocks the door. Gratitude opens the door. Love is the magnetic force that draws you through the door. Ceremony is the fire that warms the heart beyond the doorway to the healing energy within. "}
