And if you are awake for it, the actual memory from this experience might be a bit groggy. Let us help! We'll look further into why you may be feeling this way and what methods are available to you. Without the freeing feeling of rejuvenation, living your life in the way you want might be put to the sidelines. And we don't want that to happen! So let's look at some symptoms and causes of chronic fatigue together, along with what actionable steps you can take to recharge your body... and your life! What is Chronic Fatigue? This condition is best known by medical professionals as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). It's a disorder that can be characterized by the feeling of extreme tiredness with no feeling of refreshment after sleep. Imagine going to bed at night only to wake up feeling as if you didn't go to bed at all. Doesn't sound like \"sweet dreams\" now, does it? Plus, the symptoms and signs only worsen if you take part in strenuous physical or mental activities, and they don't improve after rest and relaxation either. It's a slippery, downhill slope! Symptoms of Constant Fatigue If you feel as if fatigue is something you're facing each waking day, then you might be experiencing some of the following symptoms. From a [sore throat](https://yourdoctors.online/strep-throat-treatment/) to extreme dizziness, there are many variations of these symptoms that indicate you're constantly tired. These are a few of the \"red flag\" signs that may reveal that you have CFS: - Extreme feelings of fatigue - Issues with memory or concentration - Sore throat - Headaches - The appearance of enlarged lymph nodes in your neck or armpits - Muscle pain or joint pain - Dizziness feelings that increase from lying down, sitting or standing - Feeling tired after sleeping (no feeling of rejuvenation) - Extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exercise Have you experienced any of the above symptoms? If so, there's a possibility that you may be chronically fatigued and should seek a health care professional for medical treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Should a Doctor Be Involved? Now that you know the majority of symptoms, should you seek the help of a health care provider? Yes, absolutely--you should always partner with a medical professional if you're experiencing uncomfortable or intolerable symptoms to see if you can be fully diagnosed with an issue and explore your treatment options. Plenty of the aforementioned symptoms can occur in other disorders such as fibromyalgia, so your condition should definitely be looked at by a medical professional with the expertise to help find out what's actually going on. Plus, if you're experiencing a more serious illness or disorder, a medical team can quickly work to get you the aid you need before your condition changes or worsens. What's Making Me Tired? The cause for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome isn't really known, but there are other reasons and rationales for feeling tired for long periods of time. In fact, here are four potential triggers to watch for as you go about your daily routine. Viral Infections When a viral infection hits, it's normal for the body to feel extremely overwhelmed and exhausted. A virus has the potential to really wipe out your immune system, and as a result, your body will need time to recover and may even need an antiviral to help it along. Some viruses are more prominent than others. So if you've been feeling ill for a while, there is more potential for this to occur. Immune System Issues Your immune system itself may be impaired or weakened. If this is the case, your body will need adequate time and energy to recover and get your immune function back in working order. To keep from falling ill again and give your body the boost it needs, additional sleep may work as a beneficial healing mechanism. [Immune boosting supplements](https://wthn.com/collections/immunity) can also help! However, if your immune response is permanently impaired, it could be a cause for a separate disorder all its own, bringing us back to the importance of getting examined by a doctor if you have unusually prominent symptoms. Hormonal Imbalances Do you always seem to suffer from hormonal imbalances? This can be one of the greater causes of you feeling so tired all the time. Hormonal imbalances, especially in women, are quite common. Sometimes, there might also be abnormal blood levels like in the case of anemia, which could also play a major role in your fatigue. In women, this can occur especially during the monthly menstrual cycle or around the time of pregnancy and postpartum. As always, make sure to partner with a medical professional to better diagnose your unique situation. Physical and Emotional Trauma If you feel that you've experienced physical and emotional [trauma](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/ptsd-trauma/coping-with-emotional-and-psychological-trauma.htm) in your life, there is the possibility that extreme fatigue may occur as a side effect. This could be a way for your body to cope after the fact. Definitely consult a doctor to see if this could be one of the reasons for your extreme fatigue. If this is true, there may be a way for your condition to be improved with different therapies along with the aid of [all-natural mental health supplements](https://wthn.com/collections/stress-relief) - we'll go over these in just a bit! Other factors thought to contribute to the cause of chronic fatigue include mitochondrial dysfunction which affects the production of ATP needed to fuel your body's cellular processes - but again, there's so many possible causes it's hard to nail even just a few down. Have you experienced any of these causes that may have brought about feelings of extreme fatigue? If so, you may need to seek medical guidance and make some slight adjustments and additions to your daily routine. What Factors Pose a Risk? Are there really any heightened risk factors for people to constantly be more tired than others? Unfortunately, the short answer is YES! There are actually two main factors to take into consideration when looking deeper into CFS. Unfortunately, the following two factors can't really be controlled. Sex Most women never stop, and thus, they are more likely to be diagnosed with this type of medical dilemma and appear more tired than men. However, it is also speculated that women tend to be better communicators and might just be reporting these symptoms more than men. Therefore, CFS patients could be pretty equal in terms of prevalence between genders. Age Of course, CFS can happen at any [age](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health#:~:text=Common%20conditions%20in%20older%20age,conditions%20at%20the%20same%20time.), but it's especially common in individuals who are middle-aged. As you get older, it's harder to sustain your energy as in your younger years. Do you find that you fall into both categories and that it's harder to feel refreshed after a good night's sleep? These factors may be the reason why you're more susceptible to tiredness and feel like you can't escape your feelings of exhaustion. Plus, as our bodies grow and change, there's the heightened possibility that people will experience more fatigue as they age. However, there are some clear signs that indicate that there is more of a problem than the regular signs of aging or gender. The Complications CFS Can Create If you feel tired more often than not, this can create complications you might not be used to. In fact, it can put quite the damper on a normal daily routine. Don't worry, a normal life is still possible. Here are a few different lifestyle changes that may result from fatigue: - Lifestyle restrictions - More work or school absences - Isolation on a social level - Lack of motivation - Increased feelings of sadness What Supplements and Vitamins Can I Take to Help My Tiredness?
