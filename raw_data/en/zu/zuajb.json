(First Class), whose given name is Peter Hecks, is a legendary [superhero](/wiki/Superhero), the founder and leader of the [S.M.S.B.](/wiki/S.M.S.B.), the most renowned [superhero](/wiki/Superhero) of his age, and the main protagonist turned deuteragonist of [The Super Babies Saga](/wiki/The_Super_Babies_Saga). He was known for his legendary wisdom, incredible power, and skills in [sword](/wiki/Sword) combat. After his parents abandoned him, he was adopted by the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army) and trained to harness his incredible power. Finally, he became a superhero under the monikr of Baby Intelligence and led what would become the S.M.S.B. He founded, led, and taught the group before and during three devastating wars - the [Second](/wiki/Second_NoHead_War) and [Third NoHead Wars](/wiki/Third_NoHead_War), and the [Shadow baby, his archenemy was [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead), and as an adult it was [the Dark Flame](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer), both of whom were eventually killed, neither directly by his hand. During a [clash](/wiki/Unity) with his old friend [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen), he was left ravaged by an explosion at the end of their battle. Encased in a suit of life-sustaining navy-blue armor and grateful for Sebiscuits' help, Baby Intelligence allowed him to rejoin the organization. He also became the youngest [Crodela](/wiki/Crodela) Brightener of all time. Although he loved all the members of the group equally, he was close friends with [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and he eventually married [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen). At the age of six, he took the name of Master Intelligence, respectively. He had exceptional skills in swordplay, most commonly employing whirling and acrobatic Stil II techniques. Baby Intelligence was a master of all forms, though he disliked using Stil VIII immensely. He was idolized by thousands of people and some of them considered him a sword master. Despite this, he believed most firmly in peace and knowledge. Master Intelligence continued leading the organization until [his dying day](/wiki/Showdown_in_the_MBH). Four decades later, his spirit came to [Matthew](/wiki/Matthew) through unique supernatural means, remaining a significant influence on Matthew's foundation of the [New Order](/wiki/New_Order). Roles[ ] Master Intelligence is the main protagonist in [Baby Intelligence](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence), the deuteragonist in [Sebiscuits: Dawn of Transcendence](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Dawn_of_Transcendence), in [Sebiscuits: Apocalypse](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Apocalypse), the protagonist in [The Super Babies: Ended Generation](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_An_Ended_Generation), and [The Super Babies: The Final Chapter](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_The_Final_Chapter). He is all but absent from [Part Three: The Growing Universe](/wiki/Part_Three:_The_Growing_Universe), but he does serve as a pre-natal hero in [Before The SMSB: The Dominion of the Dark Lord](/wiki/Before_The_SMSB:_The_Dominion_of_the_Dark_Lord). His role in [Part Four: Truth Eternal](/wiki/Part_Four:_Truth_Eternal), however, is crucial. He is the tritagonist in [S.M.S.B.: Where Are You Now?](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_Where_Are_You_Now%3F), [S.M.S.B.: The Return of the Verasect](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_The_Return_of_the_Verasect), [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The Latest Threat](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat); the deuteragonist in [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The Inferno Relit](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Inferno_Relit), and the posthumous overarching protagonist in [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The New Order](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_New_Order), as well as serving as a pre-natal hero in [Before The SMSB: The Legacy of Mae](/wiki/Before_The_SMSB:_The_Legacy_of_Mae) and [Before The SMSB: The Legacy of Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Before_The_SMSB:_The_Legacy_of_Sheriff_Bladepoint). Biography[ ] Family lineage[ ] The Hecks' were an old and wealthy neurotypical family, descended from their founding patriarch Wilfred of Wales, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Hell Hoarder', became corrupted in time to 'Hecks'. Wilfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Fobble neighbors often called upon his medicinal services. None of them realized that Wilfred's wonderful cures for pox and ague were [mutated](/wiki/Mutantry); they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants. His reputation as a well-meaning eccentric served Wilfred well, for behind closed doors he was able to continue the series of experiments that orchestrated the genocide of the kingdom. Historians credit Wilfred as the originator of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used to this day. His sales of such cures to fellow mutants enabled him to leave a significant pile of gold to each of his seven children upon his death. Wilfred's eldest son, Derwin, married a beautiful young mutant by the name of Ariel Foulle, who came from the village of Albany. Because she was the great-niece of Valarie Lethletera, the Hecks' were related to the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads) as well (and by extension [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead)). At some point before 1724 members of the family immigrated to England. Samuel Hecks was one of the original twelve Knights trained and appointed in England. It can be assumed that he was educated at [Commonwealth School of Mutantry](/wiki/Commonwealth_School_of_Mutantry). Sam's distant relation to Baby Intelligence would not be uncovered until centuries later. Two members of the family also held positions on the Mutamon. They were Ralphie Hecks and Tom Hecks, Hecks](/wiki/Rotta_Hecks). [[1]](#cite_note-DITW-1) Pre-natal history and earliest weeks[ ] A voice from the future[ ] Centuries before his birth, Baby Intelligence appeared to the Knight Drims\u00e9 Ur in a [vision](/wiki/Vision). The vision also included the instructor Steven Grande, Baby Intelligence's apprentice [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman), and his friend turned enemy [Thomas Meyer](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer); all four of them would be destroyed by the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads). This vision proved untrue, as the NoHeads never ended the lives of any of these four individuals, though it could be referring to their destinies being changed forever by the Dark Order. [[2]](#cite_note-2) Similarly, at an unknown period of time, Baby Intelligence was also foretold by Caesar Revanen to put an end to the world's darkest faction imaginable, and to set down the first few bricks for a world made free. [[3]](#cite_note-3) Birth[ ] Peter Hecks was born on June to [Rotta](/wiki/Rotta_Hecks) and [Greg Hecks](/wiki/Greg_Hecks) in [NYC Hospital](/wiki/NYC_Hospital). A few months after his birth, he would be able to recall flashbacks of squelching guts around him and an earsplitting cry, but nothing else, leaving him to wonder if his memory would leave him the way it did to the majority of infants. Three days after his birth, he was taken home and laid in his new crib by his mother. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Discovering his mutantry[ ] In the morning, Peter made an attempt to escape his bed by climbing out of his crib, unwittingly displaying a prodigious amount of agility in the process, most notably the ability to lift his head. This did not work out the way he expected it to, however, because he fell off the railing and hit the carpeted floor, making him cry loudly and causing Rotta to come after him, being alarmed at what had happened. Over the next few days, he pondered over finding a way to speak, and quickly found the way how. As his parents were having a conversation, Peter used a [magnifying glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnifying_glass) and studied their lips. He tried to follow, and quickly succeeded. His parents were unkind yet cautious throughout his first week alive as he learned to stand and speak at an incredibly young age - he had also taught himself to stand when he was four days old and took his first steps, despite falling over three times and not crying once. At one point, they also took him with them to a party, where he demonstrated his telekinetic powers for the first time by crushing the seatbelt to his booster and telekinetically hurling balloons at other guests, mostly children. Terrified, Rotta dragged him home. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) The Perpetual Seer[ ] The next day, Peter Hecks was asked by NASA's leading officials to attend a space mission. Before leaving, they were visited by Colby Doge, who featured Peter on television upon meeting him and ensured he was featured on the front page of the Perpetual Seer. Doge even went so far as to say he was \"the latest news flash.\" Word soon spread about the latter; everybody wanted to meet him. Unbeknownst to him, Rotta and Greg were both plotting a way to get rid of him, which was why they uncharacteristically allowed him to train with NASA. Throughout his training, he irrationally thought everyone was acting too professional to want to be his friend at all, and he realized just how badly he wanted to help people who weren't blessed with the sheer mutation coursing through his young brain. He also had a recurring monarch butterfly as an imaginary friend. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Dogfight over Earth[ ] At long last, Peter blasted into the sky with the other astronauts, and was amazed by pretty much everything. He even said he liked the way the levers were shaped. After skimming the moon, the ship stopped and Peter took a spacewalk. The astronauts asked him how he felt, and he replied loudly that he missed his parents. Rotta told him then that he wasn't allowed to come back, and Peter let out a glass-crushing scream. Rotta left the sanctum after that, followed by Greg. Just then, a UFO showed up. Attempting to intervene, Peter fought back and attacked the UFO with a barrage of laser blasts. He was then able to blow up the UFO by deploying a missile. Astronauts and police by saving their ship from the UFO in a heated battle. He was then able to land the wrecked ship in the parking lot at NASA. The astronauts fired seismic charges to deal with the threat, but this attack proved fertile. Peter insisted he could help, and had to blast the astronauts aside before they agreed. With that, a fierce dogfight occurred between Peter and the alien. Peter gained the upper hand, and blew up the alien's ship with a tracking missile. When he came inside, he collapsed from exhaustion and misery. At that moment, a police officer named Zett arrived, who told him the police were going to adopt him, since his parents were still stubborn about their decision. He followed Zett, and was then beckoned by someone else to follow him inside a closet. Curious, Peter went inside to find a mutant baby who looked very much like himself. The baby, whose name was [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen), wished him luck, but before anything else could be said, Zett beckoned him out of the closet. Peter followed him to the police car, and they went to the [Jade Sanctum](/wiki/Jade_Sanctum), where Peter would undergo vigorous training for the next month. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Arrival at the Jade Sanctum[ ] - \"As Peter headed off for breakfast, he realized just how much he liked Annabeth Black. She never asked him for anything, he'd learned things from her, she could laugh at herself, and he'd never heard her complain before.\" - Description [[src]](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence) On his first day at the sanctum, Peter met [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), an insurgent who was pretending to loyally serve the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army) while harboring fluctuating plans of her own all in spite of being sincerely excited to meet him, upon tripping on her arm while she was reading. He hastily apologized, but rather than being angry, she introduced herself to him and he fell under her thrall almost instantly. She showed him how to get to the cafeteria, where he met [Jason](/wiki/Jason), whom he took to almost at once, promising he'd be his best friend for all eternity. She showed him how to get to the cafeteria. After dinner, he went to sleep at 5:23 p.m. Annabeth briefly lurked outside of his door to wish him good night. On the second day, he was disturbed to see a vision regarding the evil [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead), surrounded in shadows, having who had marked his name since before his birth. The Dark Lord was telling him he is, as of now, not only disinherited but also a marked man, and that the more he tries to escape, the worse he will make things for himself. He awakened in a panic, thinking NoHead was really there as this is the first dream he has ever had. Annabeth, who had just walked in intending to wake him herself, was able to comfort him and remind him of the cafeteria's whereabouts. Subsequently, he met and made a rival of Lori during breakfast. He and Black got into a fight with her, something the latter broke up by pinning her to the chair with her sword. As Peter and Annabeth left the room, Lori warned Peter he'd \"better keep that [cocky attitude] under control\". Jason told him Lori had been salty since she quit smoking and that he agreed with Annabeth that Peter had nothing to regret, adding that this applied to any category period. He then meets his master, [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint), who begins his training in earnest. Having a huge tangle of mixed-up feelings, he went down to his room, unrealistically hoping no one would bother him for days on end. To his surprise, Black arrived to wish him good night and play with him. Growing increasingly tired, Hecks began copying her when she stuck her tongue out, but when she began playing with a fidget spinner, Hecks defecated in his [diaper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaper). After she changed his diaper, Peter gave her a passionate hug, but while they both seemed well-pressed to remain at the Jade Sanctum for several years, Hecks had the strangest feeling they would be parted forever, which actually reduced him to tears. Softly discouraging such a line of thought, Black kissed him on the cheek and left him to go to sleep. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Apprenticeship to Sheriff Bladepoint[ ] Sheriff Bladepoint decided to pair Peter with an opponent; though Peter would have preferred to learn swordplay from the Sheriff himself, Bladepoint believed Peter's social skills and swordsmanship could only approve by competing with other trainees to gain a position on the scoreboard. He was paired with two opponents, causing his relationships with both of them to strengthen as his master had predicted \u2014 his rivalry with Lori intensified, while he grew even closer to Jason and Annabeth Black. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) A flashback prior to the [Battle of the Golden Gates](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Golden_Gates) reveals that Peter came upon Black cooking in the kitchens of the Jade Sanctum. She shared some of her food, which was very unconventional, with him. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) A friendly police officer named [Dexter](/wiki/Dexter), who was in his twenties, joined Peter Hecks and assisted largely in his training. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) First brush with scum[ ] It seemed that Peter's training had proven difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct. Nevertheless, on July 2, when he was three weeks old, Bladepoint told him that they were not doing the usual \u2014 he was assigning him and Dexter to protect a politician from pirates who were kidnapping powerful figures for ransom. Pirates attacked the vessel, exploiting weaknesses in the design, and the politician was kidnapped despite the actions of the two Grand Army members. Although Dexter had met his former friend, Son Cornelly, who had come to forgive him, he did not tell his friend that he knew the former police. Like Dexter, Peter came to suspect that the security weaknesses and malfunctions on the senator's craft during the battle has been deliberate sabotage, since the craft had recently undergone a security retrofit. He traced the sabotage of the senator's ship back to the responsible factory in the snowy state of Maine. With help from Hecks, Dexter discovered that the factory was owned by Caravan, a corporation that used secretive slavery on its assembly lines. While they were investigating further, Son Cornelly arrived. Telling the two police that he'd found a worker willing to talk to them, he lured the pair into an ambush. There, local battle robots suddenly appeared and threatened the two police. Cornelly had betrayed Dexter for good, as he formerly worked at the factory. Dexter and Peter were forced to surrender in order to avoid collateral damage to the factory's numerous slaves. They were injected with toxins that paralyzed them and rendered them unconscious. The incapacitated officers were subsequently transported to Son Cornelly's headquarters. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Skirmish in Maine[ ] The two police woke up in an unfamiliar room some time later, restrained by stun cuffs. They had been captured by Cornelly, who spoke to them and said he planned to hold them until the state Senator was ransomed. Unfortunately for Son, the senator died from a sudden heart attack. This panicked Son's assistant, who rushed into the room where the officers were held and began to argue with the pirate leader. During their quarrel, Peter broke free from his restraints and telekinetically summoned his sword through the door the assistant had opened. Peter then dueled with Cornelly, intending to kill him. Only Dexter's objection stopped him from slaying his overmatched foe. Instead, Peter arrested the two pirates and returned to New York with his friend. The failure of their mission was coupled with Peter only being allowed to watch while attempting to survive any stray blasts. As such, he felt this was not truly his first battle he fought in. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) The NoHeads beacon[ ] Five days later, Peter was turned loose on the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads) of his own free will. While training, he had become distracted when he heard the alarm signal. A police attempted to tell Bladepoint of the trouble, but had been cut off before he could finish the explanation. Bladepoint had offered Peter the chance to go, who had accepted it. He quickly found the NoHeads' robot, who was already dueling four police at once. A heated battle followed between Peter and the robot. Peter used both his sword and telekinesis exclusively to defeat the foe. After dispatching the robot, Peter was confronted by [Kenzie Walters](/wiki/Kenzie_Walters), a servant of the Qisheng, who almost killed him. Thankfully, Sheriff Bladepoint rescued him and they returned home. As the world came back into focus, he found himself being congratulated, and [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint) deemed him a true [Super](/wiki/Super). They began building the [Mutant Baby Home](/wiki/Mutant_Baby_Home), known to all as the MBH, and Peter publicly took the alias of Baby Intelligence. He gave a live speech from inside 89.1's radio station \u2014 his personal choice \u2014 about his new rank and new name, and mentioned his promise to find other superheroes. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) As the Inferno[ ] Becoming the Inferno[ ] Baby Intelligence continued his quest to purge the NoHeads. While Baby Intelligence is stressed by everything that is happening, he was comforted by Black's presence. He gets used to the life outside the [Jade Sanctum](/wiki/Jade_Sanctum) and began to like it. After watching a news report regarding three Krosse attacks in one day, he ran off to a supply closet and hid there alone until Black entered. The two talked about the situation, and that is when he decided that he would be the \"Inferno\", a symbol of the war against the NoHeads. In exchange, he demanded for ample opportunity to kill [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead). He also asked for them to help him build a laboratory in the MBH. Returning to the MBH, Baby Intelligence fell asleep in the middle of the living room. However, Lizzy Karl woke him via comlink and told him several members of the Grand Army were ready to help build the lab. Baby Intelligence greeted the team and told them he wanted his workspace underground. He telekinetically lifted the would-be mansion while they fired several Blasting Beams into the ground under it. Baby Intelligence lowered the structure, and once inside, they dug a hole to use as a trapdoor. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) More adventures and lessons[ ] Baby Intelligence sent a Greg a letter, asking for help in getting rid of the dragon. Greg agreed to help, much to Baby Intelligence's shock, and arranged for some of his friends to pick up Macey and deliver her to the dragon sanctuary in Norway where he worked part-time. Two days after the MBH was finished, Baby Intelligence installed an alarm to alert him of any dangers that may lurk nearby. Roughly an hour later, the alarms alerted Baby Intelligence to a criminal who had robbed a bus. Baby Intelligence tracked him down and located him hiding in an alley, under the pretense of apprehending the villain. Baby Intelligence immediately confronted him, leading to a fierce fight between Baby Intelligence and Bomb Man. Baby Intelligence finally disarmed him and took him to jail in a cage attached to the Pinewood Derby. The jail guard thanked him, but also told him he couldn't just bring people to prison and hope for their arrest. Baby Intelligence digested this and left, victorious. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Hotel bloodbath[ ] Baby Intelligence headed down to the [Jade Sanctum](/wiki/Jade_Sanctum), where he ran into Lori, who asked him why he joined the Grand Army, and if he didn't know, he should find out. He proceeded upstairs, looking for no one in particular, when he found and met Natalie Hone. She invited him to go to Wellington Hotel with their fellow members of the Grand Army, as they intended to use it as a base while they attempted to recruit [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan) to the Grand Army cause. During his visit, the hotel was attacked by the NoHeads. The Grand Army forces fought back and ultimately defeated them, but the hotel was destroyed. During the skirmish, Baby Intelligence threw his sword at NC-442, killing him, though he had to leap for his sword as he failed to telekinetically summon it. After the attack, the group decided to send Baby Intelligence back into combat as soon he felt up to it. Baby Intelligence ate dinner with Spark and Fizz in the docking bay. The Kebloians comforted him. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Brandon's warning[ ] - \"Everything's been hurting way too much. It always has, but now there's a war and the pain's in the open for everyone to see for themselves.\" \"Yeah, I know. I know.\" - Annabeth Black and Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Dawn_of_Transcendence) Baby Intelligence returned to the MBH, where he was surprised to find Annabeth Black at the front porch. He and Black hugged as they were both in pain. He returned to the Jade Sanctum with her, and they hung out in the kitchen. Suddenly, officer Brandon warned them of an attack, only to be killed. Shocked, Baby Intelligence backed up Percival's theory that it is a warning of an attack, and the inhabitants of the sanctum retreated underground while others dealt with the threat. Baby Intelligence wanted to intervene, but Black forced him not to. When the attack ended, Baby Intelligence left to the office of Sheriff Bladepoint, only to learn he was abroad. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Mission to Venus[ ] Subsequently, Baby Intelligence, eager to see [Venus](/wiki/Venus) for himself, agreed to accompany the convoy there in a strange ship. Just after they arrived on the acidic world, everyone was blown into space. Finally, Baby Intelligence fell unconscious, but an ancient [superhero](/wiki/Superhero) called the [Ruby Eidolon](/wiki/Ruby_Eidolon), who had noticed him earlier and wondered if he was a [Saturnian](/wiki/Saturn) teenage midget. Baby Intelligence, having suffered intense internal damage and half in delirium, watched the woman as she healed him, speaking aloud of her beauty (to himself, as though believing himself to be in a dream) and wondering whether she could possibly be real, and the man held his hand, promising he would be all right, and then he disappeared and he regained consciousness. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Unbeknownst to him at the time, the woman that had healed him as an ancient [superhero](/wiki/Superhero) named the [Ruby Eidolon](/wiki/Ruby_Eidolon), and she was actually a woman. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) To her utter relief, two of them were not badly hurt and the mysterious boy, while suffering from deep internal damage, had a good chance of surviving. She began chanting in the Ancient Language, hoping to save him, though terrified that something was going to go wrong, her faith was restored when the child's breathing became more consistent, giving her the much-needed drive to finish. She then introduced herself to the other two, one of whom happened to be the son of the Baron of Darkrock, a major Venusian country. Although she didn't know it, the heir admired her and expressed his preference for her, and he never forgot about her. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) That night, he received a phone call from Francis Cardarphen, who claimed that his son [Sebiscuits](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) desperately wanted to form an alliance. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Duel in Central Park[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | - \"If you want to kill me, I'm yours. Go on, make the Dark Lord happy. We're all New Yorkians who want him dead, right? Our only fight is the one he provided us with.\" - Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Dawn_of_Transcendence) In their final battle, Baby Intelligence desperately attempted to save Minister Maggot. He successfully saved his life. He was subsequently arrested for his crimes. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Dawn of the S.M.S.B.[ ] Discovering Sebiscuits Cardarphen[ ] Soon after his promotion, young [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) came to the MBH, requesting to train with him. Baby Intelligence tested him, but these tests were unsuccessful for Sebiscuits. Baby Intelligence believed that the baby was clearly affected by his temper and that he still clung too tightly to his passion to be trained safely. Hours before this event, Mayor [Katie Black](/wiki/Katie_Black) was kidnapped by Galfalor of Eris and taken onto his base, the [Wasp](/wiki/Wasp). As he was wrapping up his meeting with Cardarphen, Baby Intelligence was quickly called in from the police to rescue the captive leader of New York City. Baby Intelligence ordered Sebiscuits to leave, then rushed in to rescue the Mayor. However, Sebiscuits pursued, something Intelligence learned when Sebiscuits attempted to rescue his ship from pieces of burning metal that would have otherwise ruptured Baby Intelligence's wing. Sebiscuits succeeded, and they landed onboard the Wasp, where Intelligence deduced that it was too late to escort Sebiscuits home. They ran into Annabeth Black, who Baby Intelligence realized, much to his horror, was false. After Black killed the officer [Ray](/wiki/Ray), Baby Intelligence found himself unwilling to kill her and the babies fled. As a team, the two fought their way to where the Mayor was being held captive by Galfalor of Eris himself. Baby Intelligence warned Galfalor of Eris that he would never trust him again, since he had promised to leave society. Together, he and Cardarphen engaged the NoHead in battle. Initially, the two babies used lesser styles to lull Galfalor of Eris into a false sense of confidence, before suddenly switching to their more advanced styles. NoHead was caught off-guard and pushed Baby Intelligence off to the side to deal with Sebiscuits exclusively. While Sebiscuits clashed with NoHead, Intelligence dealt with the F-8 robot soldiers that NoHead had brought to distract the two. However, once he did so, NoHead immediately kicked Sebiscuits aside and strangled Baby Intelligence before hurling him to the side of the room and slamming him into a balcony, rendering Intelligence unconscious and injured. Consequently, he did not witness NoHead's escape. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) When Baby Intelligence recovered, he found himself upside-down, in an elevator shaft, staring at Black hanging on the shaft with Cardarphen. Quickly righting himself, he asked where Galfalor of Eris was, and Sebiscuits replied that he had escaped. After exiting the elevator, Intelligence suggested they make their way to the hangar to hopefully find another escape vessel. However, he and his allies were confronted by more robots. Sebiscuits was separated from Intelligence and the Mayor by a ray wall, but they rendezvoused a little while later. Baby Intelligence's comlink then received a distress call from another police who's cruiser was being brutally attacked. Sebiscuits and Intelligence then mounted two of the Wasp's cannons to attack the NoHead ship that was attacking the cruiser. They shot the vital sections of the ship, and destroyed the battleship. When they got back into the hallways, however, they got caught in a ray shield. Brought to the bridge, they were gloated at by another NoHead, but Baby Intelligence telekinetically threw back her hood and was shocked to find his mother was alleged with the NoHeads. Despite this, Intelligence remained confident and retrieved his sword from Rotta and cut his and Sebiscuits' bonds. Engaging and defeating Rotta's bodyguards, they moved to corner the NoHead. However, Rotta climbed aboard her escape vessel and deserted the fight. Having no other escape, Intelligence asked if Sebiscuits could pilot this cruiser. Sebiscuits managed to crash-land the remains of the ship, and they walked away relatively unscathed. After the fight, Sebiscuits was dubbed a superhero by Baby Intelligence, who had long had a change of heart. Still, he was overwhelmed knowing that his best friend and his mother were both evil, reducing his confidence that he knew who could be trusted. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) Shortly afterwards, Katie Black made an amend for the Grand Army to come directly under Baby Intelligence's control. However, Baby Intelligence would not have it. Sebiscuits Cardarphen's training[ ] - \"There's \"What's in Something must never go there, Sebiscuits.\" - Sebiscuits Cardarphen and Baby Intelligence discuss Baby Intelligence's secret laboratory [[src]](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Apocalypse) Sebiscuits' training immediately began after the Battle of the Wasp. Baby Intelligence also allowed him to pick out his dormitory, out of a line of ten bunkers with beds and dressers. He later put a nametag on the top of it. Sebiscuits was required to study all of the known Ten Stils for a time. Because there was little Baby Intelligence could still teach him about swordplay, he was allowed to study his preferred form of Svarna after a week of studying the other Stils (most members had to wait an entire month before doing the same). He also learned to control his powers of telekinesis and lightning, and limit his use of shooting fire. Later, Cardarphen came across a chamber downstairs, but security measures prevented his entry inside. When Sebiscuits asked Baby Intelligence what was in the chamber downstairs, Intelligence warned him not to go there. He also discouraged excessive television, but Sebiscuits was more than happy to comply as the only movies he knew were ones he had deemed \"babyish.\" [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Participating in the war[ ] - \"This burden you carry, I'm impressed at how well it's done. But I'm warning you now, Baby Intelligence, you make one reckless choice, one forced move, and all is lost to the Dark Lord.\" - Carol Wilcox [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Pride_of_the_Super_Babies) While acting as an extension of the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army), Baby Intelligence embarked on his quest to conquer the NoHeads. Meanwhile, he took several mutants under his wing. Though he loved all his members equally, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) was easily his most trusted ally. Although relatively new to the scene, he and his pupils quickly established themselves as the essential backbone of the [U.S. Government](/wiki/U.S._Government), personifying the nobility of the government cause and defending the [Eight Worlds](/wiki/Eight_Worlds). The S.M.S.B. were larger-than-life heroes whose impossible feats garnered awe from many of those involved. It quickly became apparent to Baby Intelligence that the limited number of members and no amount of civilian soldiers could provide the kind of military support that the Police Grand Army could. Many throughout the nation believed Baby Intelligence was too young to protect them and he was responsible for starting the war in the first place. Yet as the incredibly young mutant and his fellows continued to risk their lives for the citizens they had sworn to protect and the government leaders they followed with faith, public sentiment for the babies grew, and many liberal reforms were introduced so that their defenders could be treated like men and not average infants. At the height of the war, they proved that while they were an army of few, it was \"the right few for the job\". The people loyal to the government saw them as a symbol of hope, high-ranking beings such as President [Aaron Clinton](/wiki/Aaron_Clinton) and Mayor [Katie Black](/wiki/Katie_Black) both cared for them and saw them as comrades-in-arms. At the forefront of the public eye were the dynamic duo Baby Intelligence and [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman), who often worked together to direct campaigns. These two became the poster boys of the government war effort. Throughout the war, sensationalist television reports lauded and exaggerated their achievements. Wherever Baby Intelligence went, the government inevitably won the battle, or so the news claimed. He was especially popular with children, who followed the exploits of their peers as if they were following the records of athletes. Discovery of Paige Nelson[ ] About a week after Cardarphen joined the group, Baby Intelligence received a phone call from a teenager named [Paige Nelson](/wiki/Paige_Nelson), who told him of her powers, reminded him of her [victory](/wiki/NoHead_Cataclysm) at [Golgolod](/wiki/Golgolod) in 2023, and requested she become an S.M.S.B. member. He invited her over and told her she would receive more information once she came. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Prior to Paige's arrival, he had acquired a sample of her DNA by unknown means. When Paige arrived, she was tested on her abilities. Baby Intelligence took note of her strong connection, as well as her politeness and accomplishments. After Paige exited the testing chamber, she patiently waited for Intelligence to fill out the results. Afterwards, Baby Intelligence decided to train her, adding that her passing the tests wasn't a rough decision. Following this, Baby Intelligence introduced Paige to Sebiscuits and revealed that several NoHeads had once existed, before either of them were born. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) After this, Baby Intelligence dismissed Sebiscuits and then took Paige downstairs and showed her his laboratory. He also revealed that he was working on a car, more skyfighters, and a robot army to counter that of the NoHeads. He had also acquired a three-dimensional printer, and told this to Paige. She said he was a genius in her eyes. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) With that, the training began. Baby Intelligence was a stern teacher, but only because he felt Sebiscuits and Paige were still rebellious and conflicted, to an extent. He still did not allow television or video games, fearing they would get addicted to them. Because he knew the [Internet](/wiki/Internet) was important, he blocked all the non-educational websites. (However, Nelson hid an [iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPad) with games and videos, and secretly shared it with Sebiscuits when Intelligence was not around.) Baby Intelligence also kept them in perfect shape. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Discovering Baby Strength and Force Baby[ ] When Baby Intelligence discovered the NoHeads were building a new base in nearby town Palmyra, he took off with the others to stop them. On the way, they landed in the office, and there they found two orphan babies. They introduced themselves by their well-worn alliances, [Baby Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby). Baby Intelligence asked them if they wanted to come, after Sebiscuits explained where they were going. The babies obliged, and they all took off together. The battle initiated when Paige, aboard her ship, encountered the NoHead construction site. Baby Intelligence thanked her and they landed. Baby Intelligence climbed out, and everyone on his front engaged the enemy. They faced enormous opposition from tanks, DSD robots and Heavy Missile Platforms. They did their best to hold the line, and eventually moved to the edge of the lake to lead an attack on approaching NoHead forces. As the S.M.S.B. members were being beaten back on several fronts, Baby Strength and Force Baby intervened, and attempted to cut a path through the fleet. Destroying the central tank with a bomb, the two leaped off and joined the others. Finally, Baby Strength leaped off and sabotaged the inside of another crucial ship, destroying the command bridge, doorway, and engines. Amazed, Baby Intelligence turned to a squad of robots and eliminated the group. The battle seemed to go back and forth until, despite the best efforts of the combined S.M.S.B. defense, the NoHeads were overrun. Baby Intelligence's pupils had been beaten back by NoHead forces. Attempting to rally, Baby Intelligence leaped headlong into the main lines, followed by Paige and Force Baby. With that, the tide of the battle turned in favor of the S.M.S.B. With the foiling of this crucial mission, the NoHeads began to retreat from their half-built base. Force Baby let Baby Intelligence borrow one of his bombs, which he used to blow up the half-finished base. Afterwards, Baby Intelligence offered them ranks in the S.M.S.B. Although Baby Strength was initially hesitant, Force Baby could not resist the opportunity. Shortly after the battle, Baby Intelligence was approached by [Darren Slade](/wiki/Darren_Slade), who came to him for help. Less than a month after he joined the NoHeads, Slade had felt terrible for his actions, but he realized [Annabeth](/wiki/Annabeth_Black) could not help him, which the superhero found himself able to relate to. In response, Baby Intelligence told him that if he betrayed them, he would probably die. He instead advised Darren become an insurgent under the government, which he did. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Becoming more powerful[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | The serum had incredible effects on Baby Intelligence. He was physically transformed, acquiring the features and abilities of a fully trained adult [superhero](/wiki/Superhero). Only after this transformation was he able to beat Lori in a duel and earn her respect, an event which had also allowed him to experiment with his newfound powers for the very first time. Because of his new prowess, Baby Intelligence was able to cast much more powerful telekinesis. His hearing, strength, and speed were all greatly increased and he was now as healthy and physically fit as the fittest superhero in the [Sol System](/wiki/Sol_System). However, as both Zett and Sheriff Bladepoint pointed out, he still needed to obtain better balance and grace. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) The dark times[ ] Decline of Sebiscuits Cardarphen[ ] Fearing he was being neglected, Sebiscuits Cardarphen began distrusting Baby Intelligence. Upon realizing this, Baby Intelligence urged Sebiscuits to spy on Mr. Stupid NoHead. Believing he was trying to keep him away from the MBH, Sebiscuits began to slowly lose his respect for the Grand Master. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) At the MBH, Baby Intelligence prepared for a search for the NoHeads' new base of operations. However, a distraught Cardarphen arrived and confirmed it was in neighboring town Palmyra. Baby Intelligence thanked him and summoned the others; then they boarded their Pinewood Derby along with Sebiscuits. [Paige Nelson](/wiki/Paige_Nelson) flew in her personal fighter. They departed to destroy the new base. As the fight began, Baby Intelligence disabled an NBV vehicle and decided to ride it to the base, along with another one Paige ended up riding. They arrived at the front gate, but the five robots guarding the gates spotted them there and alerted the entire army. The S.M.S.B. retaliated, fearlessly engaging the army. After clearing the squad, Baby Intelligence led the others in the base itself. As the battle raged in the hangar, Sebiscuits and Paige left. Baby Intelligence fought on, and they made their way for the control room. Eventually, Baby Intelligence sensed Paige was in danger. Worse yet, he sensed Cardarphen's descent into Mr. Stupid NoHead's Dark apprentice. Distraught by the turn of events, he took off in a speeder and arrived upon the scene as his friend was in free-fall. Catching Paige in his open-top airspeeder, Baby Intelligence went to rejoin the battle. While the battle raged, Mr. Stupid NoHead ordered his replicas to execute Operation: Purge, which meant the extermination of all police. Baby Intelligence sensed his police brethren being killed all around and, coming to the only logical conclusion for so many concurrent deaths of his fellow police, he suddenly realized, in an instant, that the NoHeads were responsible. Worst of all, before the attack began, he felt Sebiscuits' ascension into NoHead's new apprentice. Despite being filled with grief, he was still able to defend himself. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Operation: Purge[ ] They then went to the conquered Jade Sanctum so they could rescue any survivors. As they clashed with a legion of robot soldiers, Paige rejoined them via speeder bike, her mechnohand now installed. Together, they infiltrated the base, and saw the sanctum littered with the bodies of fallen police, who had been slaughtered with a sword. They fought their way through to the control room and came across recordings on a security camera that showed his former apprentice cutting down several police, and bowing before NoHead and being proclaimed his new apprentice. Although Baby Intelligence was heartbroken, Paige managed to rouse him to action. Just then, Cardarphen entered the room and challenged the entire group. Baby Intelligence could only watch as he blasted Force Baby, electrocuted Paige, and cut Baby Strength across the shoulder. Baby Intelligence came face to face with the traitor and attempted to reason with him, to no avail. Left with no choice, he drew his sword and dueled with him. As they fought, the battle progressed throughout the State Capitol building. In the end, Baby Intelligence managed to defeat Sebiscuits by telekinetically shattering both of his weapons. Before he could act on this, however, Mr. Stupid NoHead intervened and blasted him away from Sebiscuits, before picking him up. Baby Intelligence threw a homing beacon on the ship. Despite this, the beacon failed to deliver, and Greg Hecks was killed soon before. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Travels[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject.

He rushed off to continue the battle, leaving Christensen completely awestruck. In the aftermath of the battle, Baby Intelligence approached Christensen's parents, who agreed to let their son speak with him. Believing that Christensen could be of great benefit for what was to come, Baby Intelligence sat next to the boy and decided to officially recruit him into his own team. However, Christensen refused, claiming he had work to do, but he promised to consider it, which Baby Intelligence did not consider comforting. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Meeting with the Mystic[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Protecting the Kellermans[ ] Later, Baby Intelligence learned of a prophecy foretelling the death of the NoHeads. He was surprised to learn that Mr. Stupid NoHead had concluded that the prophecy was about Lindsay Kellerman, the daughter of Zach and Bridgett Kellerman. Along with [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint), Baby Intelligence made arrangements to ensure the safety of the three; he advised them to stay hidden in their house, which was protected by a Taboo. However, a woman named Amarone Chalsey betrayed them, resulting in Zach and Bridgett's deaths at NoHead's hands. However, as NoHead attempted to murder Lindsay, she turned invisible and his lightning backfired. Mr. Stupid NoHead left in a rage, and Lindsay's fate was sealed. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Baby Intelligence learned of his failure the day after it happened. Along with Paige and Fizz, Baby Intelligence returned to the Kellerman House around the same time that Chalsey did. After heated discussion and the arrival of Amos, Chalsey was attempted to redirect the blame to Mr. Stupid NoHead, but when Baby Intelligence pointed out they already knew what both individuals had been found guilty of, she appealed for mercy to each person in the house. Each of them was disgusted by her disregard for human life, and the fact that she would dare ask them for mercy after trying to slash Fizz in the face infuriated them even more. Fizz and Nelson planned to kill Chalsey, but Baby Intelligence intervened, claiming that slaughter was too bad for the likes of Chalsey, as she was defenseless and had killed no one. After a brief argument, Nelson and Fizz drew their swords and killed her. This grieved Baby Intelligence and started a conflict between him and Fizz. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Mission to Planet Ten[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | - \"If Baby Intelligence is indeed the great warrior you believe him to be, allow him to prove it. Allow me to send my best troops to capture him. If he escapes, join the government. But should my soldiers defeat Baby Intelligence, consider an alliance with the NoHeads.\" \"I did not request Baby Intelligence's presence here to test him in battle.\" \"I accept her challenge, Your Majesty. I will come in the night.\" - Annabeth Black, Xener, after which Baby Intelligence accepts the terms of the competition [[src]](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Apocalypse) The following day, Baby Intelligence was selected to lead diplomatic relations with the Planet Ten King Xener, as the government wished to build a base in his system to further combat the Order. However, the Order somehow intercepted communications between the king and the government and, hoping to derail the negotiations, Annabeth Black \u2014 currently unbeknownst to Baby Intelligence, a woman named [Walter](/wiki/Walter) in disguise \u2014 went to the neutral city of Iseville where the negotiations were scheduled to take place. When Baby Intelligence's warship arrived at Iseville, it was immediately set upon by several NoHead cruisers; however, Baby Intelligence refused to be deterred, and escaped the frenzy via escape pod along with FOX and his remaining pupils, Force Baby and Baby Strength and landed safely on the planet's surface. Once landing on the moon, the S.M.S.B. Grand Master contacted Xener, and after becoming aware of Black's presence, agreed to a wager; should Baby Intelligence defeat Black's best troops, Planet 10 would join the government, however, should Black's forces overwhelm Baby Intelligence, then the king would ally his system with the NoHeads. Xener insisted that the Dark mutant ensure Baby Intelligence be given a fair fight, to which she agreed. After returning to her base, Walter contacted Sebiscuits Cardarphen and stated that her forces were being deployed. She did not intend for Baby Intelligence to get his fair fight and dispatched the recently promoted RC-4 with the task of leading the robot forces, and the war robots prepared to ambush the government's diplomatic squad. Led by RC-3 in his tank, the main column of NoHead forces advanced into the tundra. Baby Intelligence and his men made their way to the rendezvous position on a different path, as the superhero was certain that their enemies were already heading toward them. The robots began to go through the branches of the tundra, but the dense foliage prevented the tanks from advancing. Baby Intelligence split up with his friends, meaning to use their surroundings to their advantage. Baby Strength and Force Baby engaged a squad of F7 war robots from the north and managed to defeat them, but F8 war robots then came to attack the babies, and the two were forced to flee. Baby Intelligence, meanwhile, was able to defeat an entire squad of robots on his own without even using his sword. FOX was hit by a whip projected by a Bratpro and was wounded in the leg. Baby Intelligence appeared and aided his allies, telekinetically turning around a robot and destroy the rest of the squad. More Bratpros appeared, however, and the government forces fled. Baby Intelligence, clinging onto Baby Strength's back, [deflected](/wiki/Shield) the lasers at a nearby tall formation of land branches, causing the robots to be squashed and the four escaped to a cave to rest. Baby Strength realized FOX was low on ammunition, and Force Baby was tiring considerably, but the S.M.S.B. Grand Master comforted the quartet to further inspire their efforts. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Victory in Iseville[ ] Baby Intelligence exposed \"Annabeth Black\" as [Walter](/wiki/Walter) and forced her to flee cowering. With the NoHead threat over, Baby Intelligence was able to enter into negotiations with Xener. The king stated that discussions were unnecessary, however, as the superhero had already proven his worth. Xener presented his ceremonial nail to Baby Intelligence and entrusted him with his planet's protection while pledging Planet 10's support to the government, declaring that it would be an honor to fight on their side. Baby Intelligence and the others returned home, personally escorting the President with them, not knowing they were being followed by Doat, who wanted to know how to get to [Earth](/wiki/Earth). Baby Intelligence later called a meeting, and said they needed to strike back. They boarded their ships and began their flight to the [Fourth Dominion](/wiki/Fourth_Dominion). [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Battle of the Fourth Dominion[ ] Arriving at the fortress, the S.M.S.B. engaged the NoHead fleet in orbit near the Fourth Dominion, beginning a vicious sky battle. His piloting talents and leadership skills led to a victory. [A mysterious vessel](/wiki/Bloodlust) caught his eye, and he was drawn from the battle after determining that the pilot was Mr. Stupid NoHead. As the others descended to the base, Baby Intelligence and NoHead engaged in a dogfight. NoHead finally headed back to base, and Intelligence followed the enigmatic skyfighter through an intense chase through the halls of the base. Finally, Baby Intelligence deserted the fight. Meanwhile, the others revealed themselves to the NoHeads. At the same time, NoHead had left to a balcony with his comrades. Baby Intelligence met up with the others, only to deal with an army of Rockets. With that, a heated but short battle followed, during which the Rear Guard intervened. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Losing his mother[ ] Mr. Stupid NoHead, who was personally overseeing the battle, turned his rage on Rotta, believing the entire war was her fault. After electrocuting her and smashing her into a balcony, NoHead prepared to murder her. Yet as NoHead cast lightning, Rotta simultaneously cast her own lightning, and their streams locked together. NoHead won the battle of wills and tortured Rotta before knocking her off the balcony. Baby Intelligence witnessed this and was horror-struck. He began to cry as he hugged Rotta's corpse. NoHead goaded him from the balcony. With that, Baby Intelligence's rage exploded. Climbing to NoHead's position, Baby Intelligence tapped into the dark side and used his hate and anger to boost his physical prowess. He then attacked NoHead with such intensity that their swords' energy shells began to short out. NoHead, taken completely off guard by Intelligence's sudden increase in power and aggression, was forced onto his back foot and quickly driven into the balcony's adjoining hall. Baby Intelligence continued to hammer NoHead with vicious power attacks until NoHead lost his footing and collapsed against a railing on the side of the bridge. After a few more blows, Baby Intelligence drove NoHead's sword aside with an undercut, causing him to collapse onto the floor. As Baby Intelligence held his defenseless enemy at bladepoint, NoHead fired lightning, blasting him aside. Baby Intelligence righted himself and knocked NoHead off the balcony. There, he snatched the Verasect. Mr. Stupid NoHead attacked Baby Intelligence with a jet of lightning, which Baby Intelligence countered with a cord of red light. As both attacks collided producing a heating effect, the two bolts connected. After an intense battle of wills, the Dark Lord broke the connection and quickly breathed fire and conjured a huge, fiery cord (possibly Igniferno or a little-known variant). The fire, which was not corporeal, realized the presence of Baby Intelligence, but he countered with the Verasect and gathered the flames for himself, whirling them into a fiery ring-like mass, and sent them hurtling towards NoHead. The Dark Lord took the hit and essentially died with sparks pouring from his screaming form. This action deactivated the robot army and caused Burnbottom to flee to Wyoming with his brothers. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Return to the MBH[ ] Baby Intelligence and the others returned home, though neither Baby Strength nor Force Baby seemed to know where Paige Nelson was. At home, Baby Intelligence refused to talk to either of them while he spent the next day obsessing and brooding over his mother's death where he hardly left his room and skipped all three of his meals. At the end of the night, however, he heard his mother's disembodied voice asking to speak with him. Baby Intelligence went into a panic, believing himself to be hallucinating. While he had a full medical checkup at the place of his birth, [NYC Hospital](/wiki/NYC_Hospital), his doctor, [Donald Howell](/wiki/Donald_Howell), assured him nothing was wrong with his mind, he was just suffering from depression. When he returned home that night, his mood had not improved at all, but then he heard the same voice again. He bade the source of it enter his office, and the [ghost](/wiki/Ghost) of Rotta Hecks immediately filled the chamber. She apologized for what she put him through and explained why it was done so he could become the hero he was destined to become. They agreed to have a consistent training session, since Sheriff [Bladepoint](/wiki/Bladepoint)'s lack of involvement during the battle two days prior proved their relationship had indeed become strained. She also said that Mr. Stupid NoHead was being brought back to life. Before anything else could be said, Baby Strength entered the room with Force Baby tailing him. He told them of Mr. Stupid NoHead's plight and expressed his newfound confidence they were getting closer to the Chosen One as they now knew of the scroll containing the information. However, they also had no idea where to find it. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Search for the Chosen One[ ] The quest begins[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Upon returning to the MBH, Baby Intelligence confirmed that they needed to seek out the scroll, and the trio bade FOX goodbye and prepared for the journey that lay before them. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) Arizona[ ] Somehow, their search led them to Arizona, where the trio was attacked by savage birds called Falgamas. However, a giant blast unexpectedly killed the animals, and when Baby Intelligence awoke, he climbed out of a small crater and confirmed that Baby Strength and Force Baby had survived the blast and was then introduced to a mysterious mutant wearing a violet cloak. The trio went to Hotel Valley to spend the night, where Baby Intelligence stayed up all night researching information about their quest. The information he found implemented the idea that Sydney, a city in [Australia](/wiki/Australia), would be their next stop. They arrived in Sydney and slept at a motel for the night. Before they all went to sleep, however, he saw a vision of [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black) arguing with a strangely familiar, gothic-looking man (later identified as [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom)), confirming that the enemy was on their tail yet remained ignorant of their mission. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Ambush in Australia[ ] While in Sydney, Baby Intelligence and company rescued an old man from a net that was holding him bound, and he revealed himself to be the second apprentice of [Merlin](/wiki/Merlin) himself. In return, he gave the baby a Platinum pencil which would require the wizard grant two wishes to the baby. Baby Intelligence immediately asked for his first wish, but wisely opted to save the second for later. On the baby's request, the wizard told him everything he knew of the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads). He told of the threat Mr. Stupid NoHead is posing from within his fortress, explained that he had been there, and presented a fragment of the hull of RC-3 as evidence. When Baby Intelligence asked him about his [magic](/wiki/Magic), he referenced the [Fobble](/wiki/Fobble) fairy tale Beauty and the Beast, noting the difference between this fairy tale and [mutant](/wiki/Mutant) children's stories: that instead of being in the origin of the heroine's troubles, in said mutant books [magic](/wiki/Magic) is seen as a tool that must be used properly not to cause as many problems as it fixes. [[12]](#cite_note-POTSB_7-12) On their way back to the motel, Baby Intelligence, Baby Strength, and Force Baby were led by a stuffed bunny into a pool. Once they dived inside, the trio was attacked by Annabeth Black and NoHead Recruit [Walters](/wiki/Kenzie_Walters), smashing Baby Intelligence into a coral reef and smashing his oxygen tank. Baby Strength pulled Baby Intelligence to shore while Force Baby repelled Walters, but then Black hit Baby Intelligence in the head, knocking him out. When he woke, he learned that the trio had managed to escape. [[13]](#cite_note-13) Obtaining the first scroll[ ] Baby Intelligence led his followers to a cave, which they entered through a hole Baby Intelligence assumed was created by a mine. The trio walked uphill, before taking a turn down a slope. Suddenly, Force Baby realized that they were heading straight for a flood. In response, Baby Intelligence shouted at everyone to turn back and flee. But then Force Baby shouted to Baby Intelligence that he had found a cave-in. At that very moment, Baby Intelligence was engulfed by a gigantic torrent of water engulfed him and he found himself hurtling into a dark hole. He called for help, but then he fell into Baby Strength's arms. He revealed that he and his cousin had just fled into an alcove to escape. He found two bullets, making him realize a vicious gunfight had transpired in there. He deduced that they dated back to the mid-fifteenth century, a reasonable estimate for when Sir Edgar would have hidden his scrolls. Baby Strength questioned Baby Intelligence's estimate, but he threw him off by joking cryptically. Peering deeper in, they found another canister wedged under the remains of a statue. Baby Intelligence realized that it was the first scroll. In response to a faint, ominous whisper daring them to touch the canister, Baby Intelligence raised [Might](/wiki/Might), but then he wondered how he could get the scroll without destroying the statue. Before he could decide, however, it fell out and rolled against his foot. Despite being puzzled as to how this happened, he later deduced that a creature had felt Baby Strength's mutated vibes and surrendered it on his behalf. Baby Intelligence picked it up, victorious, absently lamenting that it was [Mr. Stupid NoHead's](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead) job to destroy works of art just because they were there. At that moment, a gust of water brushed the canister away and against a wall. Baby Intelligence rushed for it and grabbed it, but then another gust of water enveloped the scene. Baby Intelligence began flailing wildly, clutching the canister dearly, telling everyone to flee, but then another gust of water pushed him against a wall. Looking around, coughing, he suddenly noticed Force Baby, who was frantically pointing to an opening. Deciding it was their only bet, Baby Intelligence grabbed Force Baby by the wrist and they both plunged into the hole. He began searching desperately for Baby Strength, and upon finding him, attempted to break open the canister. Baby Strength impatiently offered to break it apart in his stead. This caused words to appear, along with a line of mysterious runes, making Baby Intelligence realize, much to his horror, that there was more than one scroll. They decided to sleep in the cave, as it only erupted in the daytime. However, Baby Intelligence realized at this point, much to his dread, that there were three scrolls to find, not one. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Looking for answers[ ] - \"So the Dark Lord's as elusive as a hawk, as he clearly isn't ready to keep fighting the government until his army extends itself.\" - Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Pride_of_the_Super_Babies) After that venture, Baby Intelligence took the Pinewood Derby to be repaired at a shop. While inside, Force Baby realized that a storm was brewing. They stepped outside, where the storm ravaged the trio and threatened to reach a life-threatening peak. Just as Baby Intelligence was wondering where to go, he found a girl beckoning him from inside a tent. Initially reluctant to enter until Baby Strength persuaded him to, Baby Intelligence was introduced to the woman who had offered them shelter, [Carol Wilcox](/wiki/Carol_Wilcox), and her dog, Gobbles. Wilcox made them supper while telling Baby Intelligence what his archenemy, the Dark Lord Mr. Stupid NoHead, had been up to according to the news, while Baby Strength joined in the conversation. Baby Intelligence deduced that his nemesis was being very elusive because he was not ready to keep fighting the government until his army expanded. While Baby Intelligence reflected on the impossible actions of his nemesis, Wilcox recalled a tale from her high school experience in order to explain to Baby Intelligence what leads men to do evil and how some men could not be understood, and only see power as an end in itself. He also learned that she had been looking for him since she had learned he was in Germany from New York. Before they left, Wilcox gave Baby Intelligence her phone number and told him that if he didn't know why he felt the lives consumed in the war were worth it, he should find out for himself. Baby Intelligence asked how he could repay her, and she said that finishing his quest would be payment enough. It revealed that Baby Intelligence and the others had been invited to a party. Baby Intelligence was initially reluctant to go, but he agreed with Force Baby that they could use come cheer. During the event, Baby Intelligence learned from a guest that the second scroll was probably in the fabled [Dancing Dorm](/wiki/Dancing_Dorm). When the party was over, they headed outside. While they waited, Baby Strength proposed making cushioned seating out of the leather, which Baby Intelligence agreed to do. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) The Dancing Dorm[ ] The guards, one of whom was Patrick, refused to admit them. However, Wilcox, who had just earned a formidable reputation within the dorms, arrived in the nick of time and, much to Baby Intelligence's bewilderment, brought them in with her as friends. Baby Intelligence was probed by the Varlarien, this, however, caused Mr. Stupid NoHead to find out about their mission. The two proceeded to dance fluently, earning them a boulder that contained the second scroll inside. They also earned a room for the night, where they met Bash and his family. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Alliance with Bash[ ] Leaving the Dorm, they were assaulted by a monster. Baby Intelligence climbed on top of a rock to gain high ground, but then Baby Strength shouted at it, prompting it to go away, stunning Baby Intelligence. [[14]](#cite_note-14) They arranged to make camp, but before anything could be set up, they learned that the Burans had placed wards on the great rock to prevent the scroll from being accessed, especially by any \"meddling superhero trout\". When the Burans realized they were being overheard, they confronted Baby Intelligence and escaped, but not before throwing a dagger squarely into Force Baby's ankle. [[15]](#cite_note-15) On the road again, Baby Intelligence and Baby Strength got into a physical fight whilst debating what to do with the boulder with Baby Intelligence wanting to hurry and Baby Strength insisting that with his cousin's leg wound they could not go anywhere. Their brawl ended, thankfully, with Force Baby breaking it up by pinning them under wards of Kraft energy before it could get fatal, who proceeded to force them to apologize. When Annabeth Black arrived with the NoHead Recruits, Baby Strength helped Baby Intelligence, who knew they could not fight all nine Recruits for longer than a few seconds, dig a hole to hide in until Black left, continuing her search elsewhere and in vain. The two ultimately decided to make camp for the night, during which time they continued contemplating how to get the second scroll out of the boulder. [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17) Baby Intelligence suddenly received a call from Force Baby, who reported that Bash had been beheaded. He returned forlornly to his master, but with the second scroll in his hands. The trio pored over it together, but could make no sense of it. [[18]](#cite_note-18) Climbing a mountain[ ] In the mix, Baby Intelligence also met Carol Wilcox a third time, who told him about her life and generally what it was like to be a [Fobble](/wiki/Fobble). She proceeded to tell him a story about seven sisters. He also gleaned from her that he needed to climb Mount Everest in Nepal to obtain the last scroll. He was introduced to Natalie K. Wagner. Baby Intelligence awoke in the care of Riley Bell and [Abram van Dukas](/wiki/Abram_van_Dukas), and opened the last scroll and lined up the runes to read \"Descendant of McCallin\". Ambush at the McCallin House[ ] - \"Now, how might I be of service, young man?\" \"Well, it's about the Chosen One who's supposed to stop Dark mutantry from dominating the universe.\" \"Can I see your scrolls? Oho! Listen, the robots' massing, the Sagesse returning, the implosions in Louisiana, it's all happening because of you!\" \"So we're to blame?\" \"Not remotely! You in fact have my gratitude. Why do you think the Chosen One is hanging around now?\" - Lucy McCallin and Baby Intelligence converse [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Pride_of_the_Super_Babies) Their next stop confirmed, the three superheroes traveled to [Lucy McCallin](/wiki/Lucy_McCallin)'s home to question Lucy about the prophecy. Lucy remembered the prophecy bequeathed to her by [Sir Edgar Caravan](/wiki/Sir_Edgar_Caravan), and asked for the three scrolls. When Baby Intelligence pulled them out, McCallin explained that the subject's involvement was already imminent, for a prophecy stated that a mysterious and highly gifted child was destined to defeat the [Dark Lord](/wiki/Dark_Lord). Baby Intelligence immediately expressed that he was born on the tenth of June, and that ironically, it may be him. Unfortunately, they then learned that Lucy had summoned [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads) because she feared she would be punished for harboring the S.M.S.B. Grand Master. Immediately afterwards, the room they were in exploded, rent apart by Dark mutantry. Baby Intelligence was blown against what was left of the rooftop as NoHeads [Nolan Giles](/wiki/Nolan_Giles) and [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom) entered the ruined house a floor below. Thinking quickly, he whistled into his comlink for the Pinewood Derby, which had been left in Nepal. At that moment, Lucy fired a taser at him, but Force Baby tripped her. Baby Intelligence chose to sacrifice the precious bomb on his utility belt, throwing it downstairs and causing a huge explosion that allowed Baby Strength to jump into the Derby. It flew into the house to pick up Force Baby, and once they blasted [Mean King](/wiki/Mean_King) out of the way, they flew away to safety. - \"That's who he's looking for. That's why he hasn't found us yet. He's multitasking.\" - Baby Intelligence reflecting [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Book_I:_Pride_of_the_Super_Babies) Baby Intelligence saw a vision of Lucy being taken into custody, which was the complete opposite of what she intended to accomplish by initiating the ambush, and he asked Force Baby to wake him. The trio then discussed the Chosen One. Baby Intelligence also realized that Mr. Stupid NoHead was seeking the second apprentice of [Merlin](/wiki/Merlin). Having heard from their late the S.M.S.B. fled for [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire), where they heard from their now deceased friend Bash that there was an unusual concentration of mutantry in [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire), they flew there. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Fighting the Lunch Money Bandit[ ] At [New Hampshire](/wiki/New_Hampshire), the S.M.S.B. briefly took refuge at a homeless shelter. Finally, they climbed onto a rooftop and began conversing there when Annabeth Black and Kenzie Walters Teleported onto the roof and kidnapped Baby Strength before vanishing again. Utterly disheartened, Baby Intelligence told off Force Baby for wanting to continue the chase, calling him delusional and, in his irritation that quickly turned to fury, going so far as to say Force Baby betrayed him. Furious, Force Baby left, but then Baby Intelligence noticed a robbery going on below. They cornered the [Lunch Money Bandit](/wiki/Lunch_Money_Bandit), who had just barely stolen lunch money from Percy and [Stephanie](/wiki/Stephanie), two [Fobble](/wiki/Humans) children. They pounced on the mugger and managed to shake the stolen money off of him, which lands before Percy and Stephanie's feet. The bandit reacts by launching a grenade. However, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman), who was an orphan in the same alleyway, made the grenade disappear. Baby Strength grabbed the crook and, with Force Baby's help, threw him into Officer Walltalker's patrol car. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Discovering Lindsay Kellerman[ ] Believing he has found the baby he had foreseen would join them, Baby Intelligence brought Kellerman with them and he finally decided they would return to the [MBH](/wiki/MBH). Kellerman arrived at Baby Intelligence's office, where Baby Intelligence introduced himself and told her he has identified her power of mass teleportation. He asked her if she will join, and Kellerman extended her hand to shake on it. However, this was interrupted by a recently-installed alarm. Together, they made for the Pinewood Derby to stop a bank robbery. On the way, Baby Intelligence introduces her to Force Baby, reduced from Cardarphen and Nelson. [[19]](#cite_note-POTSB_25-19) They arrived at the bank, but they were too late to prevent the robbery. However, Baby Intelligence did realize that Mr. Stupid NoHead was most likely the culprit, as Annabeth Black had sent them a letter. Kellerman babbled in fear. Baby Intelligence thought she was asking who Mr. Stupid NoHead was, and he told her. They then mounted to their car and headed off to face the Dark Lord. [[20]](#cite_note-POTSB_26-20) [Battle of Tsala](/wiki/Battle_of_Tsala)[ ] They arrived at the fortress, where Baby Intelligence rescued Aegii with help from Kellerman and Force Baby, who flatly refused to wait outside. Aegii hid and they began searching for Baby Strength. Thanks to an [Arcanus](/wiki/Arcanus) named [Son Wan](/wiki/S%C4%93on_Wan), their arrival was detected immediately. Mr. Stupid NoHead arrived and captured them, but then the Romans, whom Force Baby had contacted, converged on the scene and beat back hordes of NoHead forces. Baby Intelligence prepared to join the fight, but when he realized his sword was missing, much to his bewilderment, he ducked into a corner, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, he heard Mr. Stupid NoHead telling Annabeth Black to leave with him, around the time he found Kellerman. Along with Force Baby, he pursued the Dark Lord and cornered him inside an antechamber. Angered, Mr. Stupid NoHead confronted the group. Baby Intelligence seized a log for defense. During the fight, NoHead nearly knocked Kellerman into the fireplace; however, Baby Intelligence leaped forward and pushed her away. However, he accidentally tumbled to the edge of a window. Seeing his chance, NoHead tried throwing some logs at the baby in order to knock him out the window, only to have the hero knock one back at him with his own log. However, when Mr. Stupid NoHead tossed a wagon at his opponent, Baby Intelligence was successfully knocked out the window. Baby Intelligence rolled away into a trap beginning with a savage waterfall made entirely of [tomato juice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomato_juice). He was then knocked into a vast chamber, where a pack of hungry sevlows awaited. Fearful, Baby Intelligence did not revert to telekinesis, believing there were too many. At that moment, the other members arrived, and together they engaged the sevlows and came out ahead. Thanks to a vision he glimpsed, Baby Intelligence nearly fell into a vat of fire, but Kellerman Teleported everyone back into the dark fortress, leaving herself for last. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) The Voice of Sir Edgar Caravan[ ] Upon arriving, the babies located a machine Mr. Stupid NoHead had created. When Baby Strength saw the controls were in German, he thought they were done for, but Baby Intelligence said it wouldn't be a problem. He told it to self destruct in the foriegn language, and it blew up moments later. The explosion woke Mr. Stupid NoHead, and he left his private quarters to learn the S.M.S.B. had returned from the abyss. As this occurred, Muggles began to gather in the fortress, now that the defenses had been lowered. Baby Intelligence briefly acknowledged them, then he leaped forward and pulled NoHead's cap over his eyes, infuriating the latter. Seizing a log, Intelligence took a stance and silently called Lindsay back. With that, silence fell abruptly and completely as Mr. Stupid NoHead and Baby Intelligence stared at each other and began to circle each other. Baby Intelligence called to the crowd that he didn't want anyone else to help, that it had to just be him and Mr. Stupid NoHead, though NoHead hissed that Baby Intelligence truly wanted someone to use a shield, to sacrifice themselves for him. Baby Intelligence responded that neither of them could live amongst each other, and that one of them was going to leave for good. Mr. Stupid NoHead jeered at the proposal that Baby Intelligence would survive, the baby who survived by accident and because Sheriff Bladepoint was \"using him to dispose of [NoHead's] enemies\". The crowd retreated and watched then as the two great enemies, Mr. Stupid NoHead and Baby Intelligence, bantered and circled each other. Baby Intelligence then asked if it was accident when the Mystic made that prophecy, when he decided to use his powers for good, if it was an accident when he recruited Lindsay and returned to fight again. Mr. Stupid NoHead screamed that these were accidents, but he still did not strike, will the hundreds watching in the chamber were petrified. Mr. Stupid NoHead proclaimed that it was accident and chance, and that Baby Intelligence hid in the MBH while people were in the war dying for him. Baby Intelligence replied that Mr. Stupid NoHead wouldn't be killing anyone else, as they stared into each other's eyes, blue into red. Baby Intelligence said that Mr. Stupid NoHead wouldn't be able to kill any of them ever again, because Baby Intelligence was ready to die to stop him from hurting them. Baby Intelligence told Mr. Stupid NoHead that he knew lots of important things that his adversary didn't, and offered to tell him some of them before he made another big mistake. Mr. Stupid NoHead did not speak but continued prowling in a circle, and Harry knew that he had kept him temporarily at bay and mesmerised, held back by the possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. His deformed face jeering, Mr. Stupid NoHead suggested that the secret was love, his enemy's favorite solution that he claimed conquered everything else, but Mr. Stupid NoHead said that love did not stop him from killing all the police, and that nobody seemed to love Baby Intelligence enough to run forward and take NoHead's blade. Mr. Stupid NoHead then declared that if nobody sacrificed themselves for Baby Intelligence, that nothing would save Baby Intelligence. As they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret, Mr. Stupid NoHead suggested that, if it wasn't love that would save Baby Intelligence, Baby Intelligence must believe he possessed mutantry that Mr. Stupid NoHead didn't, or a weapon more powerful than Mr. Stupid NoHead's. When Baby Intelligence said he believed both, shock flitted across the mutated face, but it was instantly dispelled as Mr. Stupid NoHead began to laugh at the possibility that Harry knew more magic than he did, than Mr. Stupid NoHead, the mutant who performed mutantry no officer ever dreamed of. The laugh was humorless and insane, a sound more frightening than his screams, which echoed around the silent chamber. Baby Intelligence contradicted this, saying that the police did indeed dream of it, but that he himself was more intelligent than NoHead and knew enough not to do what Mr. Stupid NoHead had done. NoHead screamed that this meant Baby Intelligence was weak and afraid to use the power God had provided him with. Baby Intelligence again disagreed, saying that he was a better mutant and a more decent person. Mr. Stupid NoHead said that he had brought about two police purges and the control of the solar system and beyond, but Baby Intelligence said he had been backfired and this was in the past. NoHead said Baby Intelligence's demise would allow him to rearrange this, but he still did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Baby Intelligence's. Baby Intelligence responded that NoHead did not learn from his mistakes, even if he could acknowledge them. Mr. Stupid NoHead had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter as he said that none of this mattered. It didn't matter whether his machine was gone, or what petty obstacles they had tired to put in his path. Mr. Stupid NoHead said that he crushed them, that it all made sense, in ways that Baby Intelligence was too young to understand. Mr. Stupid NoHead said that Bladepoint's last plan went wrong, which Baby Intelligence agreed with, but he advised Mr. Stupid NoHead to think about what NoHead had done. Baby Intelligence told him to try for some remorse, and of all the things Baby Intelligence had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Mr. Stupid NoHead more than this. The skin around Mr. Stupid NoHead's eyes whitened. Baby Intelligence said that trying for remorse was Mr. Stupid NoHead's last chance, that he had seen nothing else left. Mr. Stupid NoHead was furious at this, and Baby Intelligence revealed that Bladepoint's last plan hadn't backfired on him at all, that it would still succeed. Mr. Stupid NoHead, whose hand was trembling on his sword, asked what would become of the surviving police once Baby Intelligence was gone. Baby Intelligence gripped his sword very tightly, knowing the moment was seconds away. Baby Intelligence said that Mr. Stupid NoHead's inability to understand love would negate this possibility. NoHead's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Baby Intelligence could feel the blade coming. He added that every moment either of them had lived, had led to this. Baby Intelligence twitched this sword, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the chamber upon it. Baby Intelligence then whispered that it all came down to this and the angry Dark mutant attacked. Baby Intelligence fought back against the Dark Lord, but it quickly became clear that his skills were no match for Mr. Stupid NoHead. Thinking he had Baby Intelligence cornered, Mr. Stupid NoHead prepared to fatally zap him, but trapped within a field of ice Baby Intelligence used his second wish on the platinum pencil to implore Merlin's second apprentice for aid, and was subsequently saved by the wizard's sudden arrival. Mr. Stupid NoHead bore down on them both, along with Sergio Mattarella and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby), but a mysterious binding energy connected Baby Intelligence with Lindsay Kellerman. They easily cast away the Bratpro illusions as they engaged Mr. Stupid NoHead in a duel of wills with the latter trying to assert his power. Baby Intelligence, however, proved himself unyielding and declared Mr. Stupid NoHead as \"Worthless, Loveless, Devoid of all Goodness\" and Kellerman that he returns to the [underworld](/wiki/Underworld) \"where [he] belongs\". Ultimately the two babies overpowered Mr. Stupid NoHead, who was flung into the Fire Room headfirst. The encounter sapped their energy, however, and they fell unconscious. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Aftermath[ ] Hospitalization[ ] Baby Intelligence had been severely weakened by the sheer power of the Voice of Sir Edgar Caravan, and before long, he was near [death](/wiki/Death). The [ghost](/wiki/Ghost) of [Sir Edgar Caravan](/wiki/Sir_Edgar_Caravan) worked rigorously to keep him and Kellerman, who was experiencing the exact same ordeal, alive. In a strange meditative trance he experienced during this time period, he struggled to fight appeared to Kellerman, who was struggling to fight off flashes of red light and tormenting memories that came with the after-effects of the Voice. It is unknown what words were exchanged, but Sir Edgar finally left her subconscious and proceeded to Sir Edgar appeared and comforted Baby Intelligence, thanking him profoundly for the effort he put into finding the three scrolls. He forbade Baby Intelligence from using the Voice against anyone else and asked him not to speak of their mental encounter. With Sir Edgar gone, Baby Intelligence woke on a bed in the Rome American Hospital, where Baby Strength and Force Baby assured him that Mr. Stupid NoHead had been destroyed and Kellerman, like himself, had almost made a full recovery. [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen), having arrived there, also ended up as an unofficial member of the [S.M.S.B.](/wiki/S.M.S.B.) Thanking the Prime Minister, Baby Intelligence, Christensen, Force Baby, and Kellerman all returned to the Pinewood Derby, which was still parked outside the base. On the way home, Baby Intelligence declared that they had found a keeper, clearly referring to Kellerman. Everyone cheered [[21]](#cite_note-POTSB_29-21). Being that Hell Burnbottom still existed, Baby Intelligence believed that a NoHead must still remain.[ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)] The ceremony[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | The day after being discharged from Rome, Baby Intelligence returned to Tsala and, with Kellerman's aid, took the surviving wolves to a rescue organization that took the wolves. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Throughout the next week, Baby Intelligence taught Lindsay Kellerman the basics of swordplay, and also designed and sewed her supersuit. As a result of Mr. Stupid NoHead's demise, the S.M.S.B. received medals of honor from [Mayor Ai Chiou](/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_(Mutantry-2001)) on the eighteenth. Baby Intelligence chose this point and time to give Kellerman her supersuit. [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) Training his pupils[ ] Baby Intelligence continued refining his technique with his practice swords while he began building a new one. To his surprise, he learned from Ammon Dorber that he had made the team, something Kellerman congratulated him for. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Baby Intelligence began practicing to play the sport on tackling dummies in the backyard, often watched by Kellerman or Achilles. In the mix, Baby Intelligence also met Wesley the Worm, who became excited and offered to help him become a celebrity. Baby Intelligence turned him down. Baby Intelligence composed a poem titled [A Hard-Won Peace](/wiki/A_Hard-Won_Peace) to present at a celebration of his victory, as several prominent guests were expected to present works of art or [mutantry](/wiki/Mutantry). Because Baby Intelligence and Lindsay Kellerman were the guests of honor, they were expected to give a gift to everyone in the party as an oath that they would continue fighting for them. Before logging on to [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen) that he had been in regular correspondence with Kelly Hughes ever since the initiation of [Operation: Purge](/wiki/Operation:_Purge). The officer had been providing him with moral support for the last two months. Providing the honest criticism he knew his friend desired, Hughes told him the poem was passable but \"no masterpiece\", although Baby Intelligence, meek as he was, had never expected it to be one. Early on in the party, Baby Intelligence gave in to Dante Christensen's urging and submitted his name for the Divinator Grand Prize Dollar Draw through The Divinator, a local newspaper, for a chance to win ten thousand dollars. He insisted on paying to get his name in, but the man at the booth, William, told him he didn't need to pay a cent. However, Baby Intelligence then realized who was revealed to be William's girlfriend had been recording them, making him realize he \"wanted to be seen of other men\" and annoying him. When the time came, Baby Intelligence presented a song titled A Hard-Won Peace, and Lindsay Kellerman constructed what she called a Bestowal Bomb and unleashed it, showering the partygoers, young and old, with gifts. Baby Intelligence would later learn she got help from the keeper of Quality Crodela Amenities, Bruce Wright, who couldn't afford to come to the party. Other people presented gifts as well; Cyrus presented a wooden ecosagon of interlocking pieces, Johanna Barr a forged metallic likeness of the solar System and Uk a formation of rock, making him the laughingstock of the party, which was something Baby Intelligence wasn't paying attention to. There was much singing and dancing and the partygoers often showed off their powers, much to Baby Intelligence's chagrin. The Fobbles and mutants alike celebrated in frenzy and madness, seeming to temporarily lose their sanity. Baby Intelligence was almost lost in the thick mutation in the air, as if he had been drinking heavily. During the celebration, Baby Intelligence also tried Rainbow Raisins after a guest named Millicent recommended them and Dante Christensen encouraged him to take her up on it. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Crodela[ ] As the Crodela season began Baby Intelligence became increasingly nervous. The first match of the season was against the [Galloping Grenades](/wiki/Galloping_Grenades) of [Canada](/wiki/Canada). Baby Intelligence was under increasing pressure to show that he had made the team through more than his [superhero](/wiki/Superhero) status. The first Crodela match began the very next evening. Baby Intelligence's job as the Brightener was to flash opposing Brighteners and score them out. Baby Intelligence tried to stay out of sight, but then he was flashed by Grenade player Brianna Taylor, who was then pushed out of the way by [Indiana Shaffer](/wiki/Indiana_Shaffer), whom he had met just before the match. As if out of nowhere, an obstacle called a Golgoball knocked him unconscious mid-match. When he recovered eight minutes later, he met Carol Wilcox's best friend, [Bailey Dennings](/wiki/Bailey_Dennings). Wesley was in love with fame and kept bothering Baby Intelligence. But he was not the only one who paid him special attention: Shaffer had developed a crush on the S.M.S.B. Grand Master. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) The 2030 pandemic[ ] - \"More and more people are being infected by the day. Yesterday, I had to take in someone who lived near the Acquisition District that had been selling amulets online, he was all like, 'With this amulet, you can go anywhere'.\" \"Well, that's a good thing, right?\" \"Well, they really just caused wearers' fingernails to engorge. As if NYC Hospital wasn't busy enough already!\" - Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Revenge_of_Hell_Burnbottom) Baby Intelligence and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby) both proved to be essential to spending a lot of time in public dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in ways no one else could. This was because [Baby Intelligence](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence), being an enhanced warrior, and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby), being a Kraton, were immune to most sicknesses, and therefore had nothing to fear leaving their homes. One of their most important duties was shutting down unscrupulous people who sought to take advantage of the international isolation, or prey on the widespread terror for personal gain. This included confiscating scam tailsmans from a man trying to sell them online that had gone so far as to create a website about them. [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen), on the other hand, being just as vulnerable as anyone else, often stayed in the [MBH](/wiki/MBH) alone, giving Christensen the responsibility of watching over Kellerman, leading to the two bonding. Aside from his duties outside of the house, Baby Intelligence would on occasion stay up at night putting together his scientific genius and vast resources to develop a vaccine or antiviral treatment, as none was known to the world. Ultimately, he never succeeded to this end. However, primary treatment was symptomatic and supportive therapy. Being fully aware of this, Baby Intelligence had a list of measures he expected of his pupils to take on a regular basis to prevent constricting or spreading it. This included hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, and maintaining distance from other people. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) When [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen) was strongly suspected of being infected, Baby Intelligence took to monitoring him more closely and enforcing absolute isolation for him. Worried that Kellerman could not be left at home alone, he was able to convince Bruce Wright to come over and babysit her. Wright brought a sleeping bag and several comfort items from home for his stay at the mansion. Eventually, the taxing job of monitoring Kellerman for hours at a time prompted Wright to seek assistance. This resulted in [Bailey Dennings](/wiki/Bailey_Dennings) and [Kamille Trinity](/wiki/Phoenix) to also live temporarily at the [MBH](/wiki/MBH), with Trinity only coming as Dennings' condition for coming over. Trinity tried to invite her boyfriend Dakota over so they could spend more time together, but Baby Intelligence had to put his foot down. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Performance of Rocken Role[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Suspicious, but deducing it was not time to give answers, he hushed her. Days later, he realized he had falsely assumed babies and toddlers were particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic, presuming their immune systems to be underdeveloped and therefore weak. As a result, he profoundly apologized to Christensen, to the extent of almost becoming hysterical, though he had to yell at him before he could embrace [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman). Searching for answers[ ] Merchant Park[ ] Baby Intelligence also agreed to buy all his pupils a treat from Sugara. Baby Intelligence was then confronted by Hell Burnbottom. Wishing to shut him up and take him into custody, Baby Intelligence furiously slashed at Hell Burnbottom, only to notice that he had parried his power attack without effort. Burnbottom then responded by angrily smashing Baby Intelligence into a wall. They had a brief fight where Burnbottom showed off his prodigious telekinetic capabilities by knocking Baby Intelligence to the ground before Baby Intelligence was able to snap his throat with his own telekinesis.

[[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) First mission to Yellowstone[ ] Upon arriving, everyone climbs out and begins a search. With the help of Lindsay, Baby Intelligence discovers the entrance to the NoHeads' base of operations. Once they ride the chute inside, they quickly find the entrance to the chamber, but are cut off by a cadre of Rockets. They cut them down, but they are cut off by a heavy blast door resistant to swords. Luckily, Baby Intelligence is fluent in German. He says \"open up\" in the foreign language, and the door opens and lets them inside. Now more determined than ever to rescue Role, locate the new base, and destroy the NoHeads, Baby Intelligence, accompanied by Lindsay, Baby Strength, and Force Baby, was able to locate and open the Chamber using his fluency in German. Once they got down into the Chamber, it was not long before they encountered Hell Burnbottom, Brute Gunray, and Mean King.Mean King quickly took down Force Baby. While Burnbottom engaged Baby Strength and Lindsay, Baby Intelligence slipped away, but not before seeing Baby Strength go down. During the battle, Baby Intelligence ventured down into the corridors, intent on locating the blabberish voice box. However, Black intercepted him and, being fair, challenged him to a formal duel before offering him directions to the control room in return for his word he would find the box, destroy it, and come right out. When he agreed, Black told him to be who he was instead of who he was expected to be, and that way he could slowly learn to trust again \u2014 information he would initially disregard before later rolling it over in his head. After Baby Intelligence arrived in the control room and destroyed the box, he was almost killed by a ring of fire that formed as a result of the box's destruction, which was felt by both Hell Burnbottom and Rocken Role. However, he was able to escape, and the flames burst through the exit and aside the baby. Baby Intelligence returned to confront Hell Burnbottom, after he had grievously wounded Lindsay Kellerman, where Black silently congratulated him and told Burnbottom to enjoy his fight, much to Baby Intelligence's understandable confusion. After deflecting Burnbottom's powers, among which was lightning by use of [Zamora](/wiki/Zamora), Baby Intelligence resorted to swordplay. A sword duel began between the two and Intelligence almost managed to defeat Burnbottom, however the NoHead telekinetically dropped a pillar over Lindsay and Baby Strength. Baby Intelligence had to turn and push them away. As the pillar crashed, Burnbottom made his escape. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Returning home[ ] After that skirmish, the S.M.S.B. returned to the [MBH](/wiki/Mutant_Baby_Home). Baby Intelligence deduced that the NoHeads had already made an attempt to breach the MBH, but the defenses around it had proven too strong. Baby Intelligence realized he did not know whose loyalty he could trust, and the S.M.S.B. would be insufficient to topple the Dark Order. They also pondered the unbreakable nature of Force Baby's blood oath, and the group all takes a solemn vow. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) Baby Intelligence's morale increased on 12 April, 2030, which was the very first Easter any of the S.M.S.B. members (minus Dante Christensen) had been alive for. Because of this, he relied on Christensen to explain what individuals typically did on Easter. Kelly Hughes sent a package of [Easter eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg) and enclosed it to [Baby Intelligence](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence) and his pupils. They all received large eggs full of homemade taffy. However, Hughes did not send anything to [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen), angering him until Baby Intelligence explained that he probably had no idea Christensen existed. When they received their gifts, Baby Intelligence wisely assured his pupils that even if they doubted the reality of Jesus Christ and his alleged resurrection millennia past, the holiday still symbolized regrowth and appreciation of both the old and new. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Yellowstone Offensive[ ] Dispatching intruders[ ] Baby Intelligence realized that [someone](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom) was in the MBH when a system that activated toxic gas in the training chamber, a measure made to prevent any intruders from entering and damaging it, was nearly hijacked. The S.M.S.B. Grand Master was about to go deal with it when [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) cleared her throat dramatically and insisted that he did not need to fight off the intrusion alone. She suggested splitting everyone into pairs, but Baby Intelligence pointed out that they had an odd number of members. Baby Strength suggested that Kellerman accompany him while he, [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby), and [Dante Christensen](/wiki/Dante_Christensen) split into their own searching party. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Baby Intelligence agreed and took off with Kellerman. Emerging from a tunnel, they were confronted by a squad of Rockets led by R-7102 that had been dispatched to raid the MBH. Baby Intelligence and Kellerman quickly destroyed the patrol and made for the top floor, as R-7102 had let slip that the NoHeads were waiting there. Fighting their way to the hallway upstairs, Baby Intelligence sensed Hell Burnbottom and Mean King were behind the door leading to it, and he and Kellerman made for them. Kellerman realized the door was locked and the keys were downstairs. Left with no choice, Baby Intelligence began to reluctantly cut through the doors to the bridge with [Might](/wiki/Might), while Kellerman defended him from oncoming Rockets. He noticed the NoHeads on the other side and stepped through, but then Bratpros rolled in, which were more formidable than Rockets, and Baby Intelligence joined Kellerman in fighting them. Together, they closed the distance before using a special technique to pierce their shields, leaving them vulnerable to the babies' decapitating strikes. Surprised and angered, Hell Burnbottom ordered Mean King away, and the latter complied. Baby Intelligence lamented that they were cowards. Baby Intelligence and Kellerman found the others, who had failed to find anything thanks to Christensen getting his leg stuck in a crevice, and they all agreed that it was getting way too easy for the NoHeads to get to them. They decided they need to contact President [Aaron Clinton](/wiki/Aaron_Clinton) in [Maryland](/wiki/Maryland), but had no way of reaching him as their phone had been hijacked during the infiltration. Kellerman asked Christensen how he got stuck, but she accidentally offended him leading to a row Baby Intelligence chose to desert by leaving and going on a walk. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Meeting Lisa[ ] - \"No, I stay with ya. You save me life. Now I is yo servaunt.\" - Lisa to [Baby Intelligence](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence) [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Revenge_of_Hell_Burnbottom) During the walk, Baby Intelligence was shocked to find a small [creature](/wiki/Tsurb) named Lisa in a net and cut her free. She explained that she had been out foraging for food when she stumbled across a hunk of meat tied to a stick and unwittingly sprung a trap for herself. Baby Intelligence headed off, but as a result of this life-saving act, Lisa adhered to the Decarine principle of a life debt and insisted on following Baby Intelligence, much to the infant's annoyance. Both Intelligence and his apprentices, [Lindsay Aaron Clinton](/wiki/Aaron_Clinton) in [Maryland](/wiki/Maryland), but had no way of reaching him. Lisa suggested that they go to her camp, where she had left her cell phone behind. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) The group raced to Lisa's campsite, only to find that the cell phone was somehow broken, meaning they still could not contact the President. The two S.M.S.B. members escorted Lisa past twenty robot soldiers and a half-built robot camp. Lisa panicked and ran off, leaving the S.M.S.B. members to leap up mushrooms to reach the top of the tree and the nearby plateaus, which they traversed, eventually moving into a cave, where they faced a snake who seemed \"more hungry than helpful\". Baby Intelligence reluctantly ended its life, and after he and Lindsay lamented over the way of the food chain, they rejoined Lisa at the base of the hill the cave was on, where Kellerman seemed livid about Lisa's actions. Lisa tried to defend herself, claiming that her memory was not what it used to be. Kellerman, however, tried to attack her, until Baby Intelligence threw up a [Shield](/wiki/Shield) with his powers. Lindsay stormed into the tent. After fetching her, Baby Intelligence loaded everyone aboard the Pinewood Derby and they returned to the MBH. Lisa was allowed to sleep on the couch. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Leaving for Yellowstone[ ] Baby Intelligence was very disturbed by the assault, yet he chose to take it up in the morning instead of discuss it immediately. Late at night, he was chatting merrily with the other members when he encountered a NoHead probe watching them. Baby Intelligence sensed the intrusion and struck the robot down, yet the damage was already done. He immediately called a meeting with the others that Lisa stood around during the course of. They decided to go to the [Yellowstone Base](/wiki/Yellowstone_Base) to silence the NoHeads and initiate a rematch, thus preventing an oncoming invasion. The NoHead Hell Burnbottom had been trailing the S.M.S.B. and recovered his destroyed probe during the night. The next morning, everyone boarded the Pinewood Derby, Baby Intelligence and Kellerman, who had to wake Lisa, taking up the rear. As they approached, they were intercepted by Burnbottom who nearly knocked down Lindsay with his speeder. Baby Intelligence fought the [Dark mutant](/wiki/Dark_mutant) in a vicious duel as the ship took off behind him. As they dueled, Burnbottom sensed that Baby Intelligence was growing tired and decided to press the attack. Jumping high, the baby managed to land on the boarding ramp as the ship soared away, leaving Burnbottom behind in their garage. However, the Pinewood Derby was nearly out of fuel. Baby Intelligence landed in the back of a junkyard. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Discovering Telekinibabe[ ] Hoping to find some fuel, Baby Intelligence entered the shop, where he encountered the junk dealer Albert Herrington and his slave, a mutant baby named Tyler. The boy possessed incredible power. Baby Intelligence agreed to help Tyler, who was building a skyracer. In the junkyard, he acquired necessary machine parts\u2014a mass coupler and a servo control system for the racing vehicle. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Albert agreed to hold a skyrace, and promised that if Tyler won, he would get to join them. Shortly before the race, Baby Intelligence then headed down to the starting line, and met with Tyler. When he arrived there, someone had stolen the ignition key from Tyler's racer. Baby Intelligence tracked down the thief around the bottom of the arena and removed a loose block in the wall, which took him to another room where he encountered the scavenger, who refused to return the key and attacked Intelligence. Mechanized blasters appeared and fired at Baby Intelligence during the clash. Baby Intelligence was forced to kill the scavenger and destroy the guns; he then brought the key back to Tyler. [[23]](#cite_note-ROHB_Comic-23) Ultimately, Tyler won the race. Later, Baby Intelligence was able to release him from slavery as planned, when he bet Albert on the boy's victory at the Great Skyrace. The wager also resulted in obtaining fuel for their ship. Baby Intelligence applied the fuel, then returned to free Tyler. Outside of the junkyard, Baby Intelligence sold Tyler's racer to Whammo, then went to find Tyler. He found him saying goodbye to an old friend. As they left, Baby Intelligence handed Tyler the money he had acquired by selling the plane. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Baby Intelligence and Tyler returned to the junkyard, where he revealed that the baby had been freed from slavery. Excited, Tyler said goodbye to Albert and agreed to go with Intelligence to train as an S.M.S.B. member. His new name would be Telekinibabe. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) With their means to return to the NoHeads' base of operations secured, Baby Intelligence and his new charge headed to the backyard to meet up with their companions. Both mounted the Pinewood Derby, and everyone took off at last. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Escape from Snake Island[ ] - \"I make grave mistakes all the time. It's what being a little child is all about. But I doubt I'll learn from this one. As for your opinion, it matters, just not to me.\" - Baby Intelligence to Niranda the Thrice-Cursed [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Revenge_of_Hell_Burnbottom) As if out of nowhere, Baby Intelligence collapsed and had a dream about a hag named [Niranda the Thrice-Cursed](/wiki/Niranda_the_Thrice-Cursed) holding his old friend, Kelly Hughes, prompting the S.M.S.B. Grand Master to travel to Ilha da Queimada Grande \u2014 also known as Snake Island, where he then politely requested permission to land. When the personnel answered, they told him they knew who he was and pretended to let him land safely, only to capture him when he exited the Pinewood Derby. Knowing he would be brought before Niranda, whom he intended on tricking into assisting him in his search for an explanation for all of these horrific dreams of bloodshed seemingly unrelated to the NoHeads, he surrendered to the soldiers without a fight. He had made a huge mistake, however \u2014 he had left the rest of the S.M.S.B. inside their tent. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Having learned something valuable from a fellow prisoner that allowed him to understand Carol Wilcox had developed strong feelings for Ammon Dorber, Baby Intelligence was granted an audience with Niranda himself, as Baby Intelligence was then dropped from his cell via crane and left dangling by a chain before the lord of evil. While they initially exchanged niceties with each other, Baby Intelligence demanded for Niranda to turn over Kenny, to which he revealed that Kenny had escaped custody while the S.M.S.B. Grand Master was imprisoned. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Niranda revealed that she was enthralled by Baby Intelligence's arrival, as he would be the perfect test subject for his new weapon, the Emancipator. He claimed that with it, he would overthrow [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom) and initiate the apocalypse. Baby Intelligence continued mocking Niranda before summoning [Might](/wiki/Might) and easily busted out of his electric restraints, although he struggled to get his timing quite right. While Niranda insisted that Baby Intelligence had made a terrible mistake in coming into Snake Island in the first place to challenge him, Baby Intelligence coolly said that his opinion mattered, just not to him. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Baby Intelligence engaged the hordes sent to destroy him. More children advanced and Baby Intelligence cut many of them down. He bellowed another challenge and more and more advanced. The battle took on a strange quality as Baby Intelligence accumulated many injuries, but he continued to stand high, dealing out death to all that reached him. He became exhausted and found it increasingly difficult to concentrate, but continued his pace anyway. Finally, there were only twelve children left. He smashed them into the ceiling with his telekinesis, but found his strength flagging greatly. Seeking to take advantage of his weakness, one of Niranda's bodyguards piloted the Godrider and fired at him. Baby Intelligence blocked with a Shield. Gaining the upper hand against Niranda's protectors, Baby Intelligence then overpowered Niranda in a brief duel before successfully driving his own projectile back at him. The effort sapped most of his energy, however, and he fell unconscious. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) After Niranda fell, the prisoners got ahold of the keys and liberated each other. They were all extremely grateful to Baby Intelligence as the powerful being that saved them all and in their gratitude, one of them, Merek, rent their clothes and fashioned a blanket for him to lay on when he recovered. When he did, Baby Intelligence left the island. However, he realized that the prisoner he had conversated with was still incarcerated, and went to extract him. The two departed in the Pinewood Derby and he dropped off the old man at a nearby port and recommended someone for him to see. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) The separation of comrades[ ] As soon as the old man was dropped off, Baby Intelligence resolved to return to his friends and apologize for his abrupt departure. However, he realized, to his horror, that could not find them as they had already relocated. With no aid afforded to him, and the [MBH](/wiki/MBH) still occupied by [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads), Baby Intelligence was left to wander about the wild. He went to sleep and was woken by the sound of footsteps. Baby Intelligence was briefly chased by Hell Burnbottom and Annabeth Black, and escaped in a bush. Burnbottom tried to blast the bush to pieces, but Baby Intelligence cast Shields around it that Burnbottom found himself unable to break. The NoHeads realized that Baby Intelligence had cast himself out of their reach, so they decided to wait for him to come out. Upon waking, Baby Intelligence used his loudspeaker and impersonated a water demon. While he made Black suspicious, Burnbottom still fled with her. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Traveling with Lindsay Kellerman[ ] - \"Why are you crying?\" \"Because I don't deserve you, Lindsay.\" - Lindsay Kellerman and Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_Revenge_of_Hell_Burnbottom) Eventually, Baby Intelligence found Lindsay Kellerman. The girl guilted him for leaving and claimed that Telekinibabe had been particularly frightened and Force Baby had felt utterly defenseless and had been more quiet than usual. The two began bonding as they searched for the others. Kellerman's recent exploits with her friends proved to be an extremely valuable source of information for Baby Intelligence, but they could make little of the babies' trajectory. Baby Intelligence left camp to collect firewood, and in the process stumbled across a procession of masked sentient creatures through the trees and were puzzled as to who they were and the intent of their actions. That night, Baby Intelligence and Kellerman witnessed burrow grubs and owl like creatures. These animals were infected by the mutations in the area. A small pack of endofrans attacked Baby Intelligence and Lindsay Kellerman. They gunned them down and ate them for supper. Later in the night, Baby Intelligence was awoken by Kellerman, who used the Pinewood Derby's mounted gun to blast apart a small pack of giant worms, later identified as endofrans. Baby Intelligence used his cell phone to help him and they cooked the endrofrans for supper that night. The two of them began bonding over their meal, as they realized just how much they relied on each other now. They decided to go to Woodbury, where they hope to not only make it in time for the big game, but also to find a trace of where the others could be. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) As the [Crodela](/wiki/Crodela) match against the Conniving Cows drew nearer, tensions mounted throughout the [world](/wiki/Earth), as people feared victory for the [Holy Mackerels](/wiki/Holy_Mackerels) would be impossible with Urquhart subbing for [Ammon Dorber](/wiki/Ammon_Dorber). Prior to the beginning of the match, Kellerman confessed to her master that she supported the Ancient Abominations, as she felt that they had an exciting and complicated background, and she considered the [Holy Mackerels](/wiki/Holy_Mackerels) an amateur team. After guiding Kellerman to the booth, he played against the Cows and proved himself instrumental to their victory by flashing four players simultaneously, providing fellow Brightener [Jason](/wiki/Jason) an opening to end the game within four minutes of its beginning. After the game, he was shocked to rather literally run into [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe), who had expected to find him at the game. Telekinibabe led him to the others and he apologized for leaving them. They took off in the Pinewood Derby afterwards. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Discovering Optica[ ] After finding his friends, Baby Intelligence learned that Christensen was considering resigning from the S.M.S.B. in order to pursue a \"real\" education. He was then introduced to [Optica](/wiki/Optica), whose [power](/wiki/Power) was Hyper Vision. The others explained that she had been with them for a while, and asked if she could become an S.M.S.B. member as they had become quite attached to her. Baby Intelligence said it was a possibility and proceeded to pull her aside to question her. Her answers proved to be satisfactory, so he accepted her companionship for the time being. The group decided to take up the fight with the NoHeads in the flesh. However, he quickly deduced from past experiences that they could not defeat Hell Burnbottom without some help. Telekinibabe convinced Baby Intelligence to take them to the police to form an alliance. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Approaching Sheriff Bladepoint[ ] Upon their return to the Jade Sanctum, they landed in the swamps. While Baby Strength went to find the police, Intelligence waited with the others, discussing on whether the police could be swayed. He also told Telekinibabe what was to happen. Baby Strength emerged from the swamp, stating that the city had been abandoned, so he led the S.M.S.B. to the now disused [Blackwing Sanctum](/wiki/Blackwing_Sanctum). On the way, they battled many NoHead troops, who were sometimes already fighting policemen. The laser cannons proved especially essential to sink a NoHead Ocean Transport and to travel up the lake. After that, they encountered five more Aqua Rockets guarding a bridge, along with more regular Rockets. Past the bridge, the Derby swerved past a set of ruins. After the ruins, they faced seven more Rockets. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) They soon arrived at the Sanctuary, where Baby Intelligence attempted to convince Sheriff Bladepoint to unify with them and oust the NoHeads for good. Bladepoint agreed, and the two warring groups hastily put an end to their dispute to concentrate on a more pressing issue: the common foe. As a token of his gratitude, Bladepoint presented him with the ancient Cloak of Peace for his very own. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Recruiting Professor Ruth's colleagues[ ] Baby Intelligence and the other members spent the next few days growing accustomed to the Grand Army way. Baby Intelligence was contacted on When he saw Sheriff Bladepoint again, he explained that he had just personally aided in freeing several captured horses and virtually eliminating the NoHead presence in [Nevada](/wiki/Nevada). The two began mapping out a battle plan together. The Sheriff also tested him by subjecting him to a series of exercises, expressing awe at how much he had progressed on his own after witnessing the baby's own moves for himself. He also made Baby Intelligence realize that his guilt and love were so strong that he would assume all of his suffering for him were it possible. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Baby Intelligence was allowed to check his e-mail afterwards, where he learned from [Carol Wilcox](/wiki/Carol_Wilcox) that she had kept her promise and told [Ammon Dorber](/wiki/Ammon_Dorber) via cell phone that she had chosen to join the fighting after all. Afterwards, Baby Intelligence tried to call Professor [Anthony Ruth](/wiki/Anthony_Ruth), but when he was forced to leave a message, he asked him to summon all his colleagues, including Wilcox and Dennings, and take up arms at the Golden Gates since the Professor knew the area so well. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Iowa[ ] A Grand Army member named Joel pulled Baby Intelligence aside and spoke for Sheriff Bladepoint, telling the S.M.S.B. Grand Master that the Sheriff suspected the NoHeads had routed officers as far off as Iowa. He asked him to go to the state and verify this. Baby Intelligence agreed to do this, on the condition that Bladepoint could find a way to prove that the Grand Army was still trustworthy. For the mission, he borrowed a Generation-class cruiser Baby Intelligence chose to name the Seeker since the Pinewood Derby was being repaired. Baby Intelligence brought Telekinibabe with him for the mission. They arrived on the plains and saw the remains of a campsite where Baby Intelligence deduced that Grand Army members had broken free and fled. Picking up a cracked cell phone, he uncovered a text message that said whoever sent it was on his way to [South Dakota](/wiki/South_Dakota) to free what was left of the prisoners captured during the invasion. Baby Intelligence felt satisfied at the completion of their mission, but then the two were confronted by a NoHead lieutenant, a Klemm named Juliah Dophane, and a band of F7 war robots. The two babies bolted, but they were all distracted by a band of [Arboc](/wiki/Arboc) who had somehow escaped, tearing through the field and inadvertently drawing the robots away and killing them while Baby Intelligence ran behind a rock, where he met up with Telekinibabe. Suddenly, a robot approached the rock and called for Dophane, only to be cut down by Baby Intelligence. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Just as Dophane and her robots were going to strike Baby Intelligence and Telekinibabe in their hiding spot, several members of the Frontal Guard of the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army) arrived, led by Chris Cera, and killed many of the attacking Arboc. Baby Intelligence saw Dophane fall out of her hovercraft and attempt to flee, prompting him to lunge at her, leaving a gash on her leg. He prepared to kill her on sight, but then she [Deteleported](/wiki/Teleportation) from the woods. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) The skirmish over, Baby Intelligence thanked the Frontal Guard and introduced himself to them. The rescue effectively served as the proof Baby Intelligence wanted that the Police Grand Army could still be trusted. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Battle of the west ridge[ ] Immediately after the skirmish, Telekinibabe made Baby Intelligence realize that the great battle to come would transpire any minute. Horrified, Baby Intelligence wondered how in the solar system they would get back in time, but Cera assured him that their ships could merely jump into hyperspace, much to his relief. They boarded Cera's ship, the Scooper, but Baby Intelligence had a fierce argument with Daniel Murrell and another male colleague that they had no time to go to [Idaho](/wiki/Idaho) for a briefing. However, Ruth agreed with the latters and insisted that he had come too far obtaining their help to forsake them, and they could not join the fighting if they were ignorant of the situation. They reluctantly went to the west ridge, which the Grand Army had taken over. The traveling party arrived, where they were briefed on the situation and fed a hearty meal. After the meeting, the S.M.S.B. made their way through the clearing back to the Scooper. However, Baby Intelligence suddenly saw a [Deaforma](/wiki/Deaforma) Chieftain blocking their path. He shouted at everyone else to get on board while he drew [Might](/wiki/Might) and challenged the Chieftain, [Dipoma Chipeutain](/wiki/Dipoma_Chipeutain). During the fight that ensued, Wilcox was struck in the head by a [Deaforma's Lash](/wiki/Deaforma%27s_Lash), leaving Baby Intelligence to sadly presume her dead, as no one had survived the Lash before. He tried, but failed, to stop her dog Gobbles from running off. Goaded beyond endurance, Baby Intelligence smashed Chipeutain against a stone pillar, frightening the other Deaformas into retreating. Kellerman said they should inform Dorber of this, but Baby Intelligence said it could wait. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Arrival in California[ ] Saddened deeply by Wilcox's disappearance, Baby Intelligence gave Chris Cera the go to lift off and jump into hyperspace. The Scooper reappeared near California, where Baby Intelligence located [Bailey Dennings](/wiki/Bailey_Dennings) and learned that thanks to having to chase down a dog she could have sworn was Gobbles, she had been unintentionally left behind by her associates. Baby Intelligence promised that if she and Telekinibabe stuck with him in the upcoming battle, no harm would befall them. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) [Battle of the Golden Gates](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Golden_Gates)[ ] Baby Intelligence, along with his disheartened forces, led the charge during the [Battle of the Golden Gates](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Golden_Gates). Initially, Baby Intelligence was intensely reluctant to participate in the fight, not wanting to risk the lives of Telekinibabe, who was inexperienced, and Dennings, who he felt owed him nothing. However, after Ford told him he should fight and Professor Ruth forced him to realize that it was madness to not fight the robots, he relented - jumping into the fray, telling Telekinibabe to find what cover he could, encouraging his friend Bailey Dennings to rain down death, and he himself wielded his sword skillfully against the forces of evil. During the battle, he managed to open the gates, meet up with [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and [Optica](/wiki/Optica), and place gauntlets on the gates one-by-one. Eventually, he deserted the fight and successfully captured a tank, Transport 714. As the fighting continues, Baby Intelligence quickly comes up with a ready force of police, along with Baby Strength and Lindsay Kellerman to capture a NoHead tank, Transport 509, to approach the Yellowstone Base without being detected by NoHead forces. The group navigates the transport to the entrance of a secret passage at the base of the cliff face. To their utter shock, Carol is there, very much alive. Baby Intelligence apologizes for losing Gobbles, but Carol reveals that he is with them. She reflects on the state she and the S.M.S.B. are in, on how their story may yet come to have a happy ending, even when so much bad had happened. Kellerman is doubtful of this, but Wilcox insists that they must still hold on to what they are fighting for each other and the fulfillment of their quest. The ready force disembarks. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Aftermath[ ] Baby Intelligence made camp with his pupils. While there, he and Sheriff Bladepoint then formed a plan to bring the NoHeads to justice. The plan would consist of him leading a strike team into the NoHeads' base of operations and capture the NoHeads, while at the same time the Police Grand Army, led by Dexter and Force Baby, would lead a ground assault to distract the Rocket army. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Baby Intelligence returned to his tent, lost in thought. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) While they awaited word from the Grand Army, Baby Intelligence began instructing the others on the rudimentary basics of subtraction. Their lessons were disturbed when [Optica](/wiki/Optica) burst inside. Baby Intelligence saw that she had been forced to bunny hop back to camp, as she'd accidentally gotten her legs stuck inside a spring. Telekinibabe rushed over and pulled the spring from Optica's legs, earning him a smile of approval from Baby Intelligence. [[24]](#cite_note-24) Battle of Yellowstone[ ] Baby Intelligence was reunited with Carol Wilcox and Gobbles when he returned to camp in Los Angeles, learning to his utter relief that they lived. After Sheriff Bladepoint joined them, Baby Intelligence and Lindsay Kellerman started out aiding Bladepoint and his group after they infiltrated the city. The babies were walking along the deserted streets of the base when they were attacked by a Rocket on an NBV vehicle. They reflected its bullets back at it, destroying the Rocket and causing the platform to crash, intact. The two babies decided to ride it and another one they found through the streets, destroying numerous Rockets and Bratpros before they eventually dismounted at the cliffs surrounding the base. They then proceeded to track down the base. Lindsay suggested they use the latch, but Baby Intelligence said they were surely removed by now. When they found it, they rejoined the Sheriff's strikeforce outside of the Yellowstone Hangar. Baby Intelligence and Lindsay led the team inside, where they faced resistance from Rockets, which were quickly eliminated, but not before the robots alerted the NoHeads themselves. The strike force was discovered, and with Rocket reinforcements on the way, Lindsay was asked to assist the resistance in securing the hangar by destroying the four power cells powering the doors. A policeman individually lowered the shields on the power cells, and Lindsay sliced through each one when its shield was down. The others provided covering fire, and in Baby Intelligence's case, sword cover while Lindsay was disabling the power cells. They faced several Rockets, along with robotic fighters in walker mode which rose up from below the hangar. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Duel with Hell Burnbottom[ ] Lewis ordered the police to regroup, and the strike force moved toward the third floor. Then the doors opened, revealing the familiar warrior wielding his double-bladed sword Baby Intelligence had engaged twice. Burnbottom ordered Gunray, who was flanking him, to make an example out of [Lisa](/wiki/Lisa) by killing her, and Gunray fired a [Death beam](/wiki/Death_beam) at Lisa right in front of a horrified Baby Intelligence, who failed to prevent him from Deteleporting. Parting from Baby Strength, the two babies moved to attack Burnbottom. After Hell Burnbottom appeared, Baby Strength and the police continued the long way. Telekinibabe, taking refuge in a local skyfighter, accidentally took off and headed to the Necrehulk. The babies and NoHead engaged in a duel that waged on into the Generator Complex while everyone else left the hangar through a separate door. While the Sheriff and his posse went to stop Brute Gunray and Mean King, the two babies engaged Hell Burnbottom. The sword duel was frenzied and brutal, moving through the hangar and into the Generator Complex, where they fought on the precarious catwalks. When Burnbottom kicked Lindsay over the edge of the catwalk they were fighting on, Baby Intelligence was forced to continue the duel alone. While his student rushed to catch up, Intelligence and Burnbottom moved on, passing through an impenetrable force field system to a bottomless pit. The fields closed between them, separating the combatants momentarily, but also separated Lindsay from Baby Intelligence, nine shields apart. Baby Intelligence took advantage of the break in the duel to crouch down and meditate. When the shields deactivated, Intelligence immediately attacked Burnbottom while Lindsay rushed to help her Master. However, the shields closed again, preventing Lindsay from aiding her mentor. Although Baby Intelligence was one of the best duelists of all time, his preferred practice of Stil II proved disadvantageous in the confined space of the cooling pit, as Svarna required a wide, open space for its energetic acrobatics and multi-angular bladework. Also, Burnbottom had the advantage of experience and pure strength, while at the same time recognizing his opponent's weariness. The end result was Baby Intelligence being hit in the face with Burnbottom's hilt, leaving him stunned and slashed. Thinking quickly, Baby Intelligence faked mortal agony from the blow. Meanwhile, Burnbottom turned his attention to Lindsay and taunted the baby, saying that he had found her Master somewhat disappointing. Lindsay rushed to face Burnbottom as soon as the shields opened, and as she continued to duel Burnbottom, Lindsay succeeded in slicing the NoHead's double-bladed sword hilt in half, but was then knocked into the pit. Though Lindsay managed to hold onto the edge of the pit, she lost her sword, leaving her defenseless. Ultimately, Lindsay defeated Burnbottom when she apparated from the pit, called her Master's sword to her hand, and as Baby Intelligence took a shot at him, they together felled the villain. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Age of Karkamel[ ] Rendezvousing with governors[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Baby Intelligence rented a Dark Horse named Flame from Owen, the shopkeeper. He promised he would return to pay him in full once America was free of the NoHeads. Baby Intelligence went to intercept the government convoy in light of Hell Burnbottom's demise, where they deduced that the misogynistic [Brute Gunray](/wiki/Brute_Gunray) had assumed control, something [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black) would not be okay with. But the telephone conversation which a worried Maurice was having soon caught his attention, so Harry listened to what they were saying about Karkamel's escape, and what connection it had to Baby Intelligence himself. According to Maurice, Karkamel had escaped from [Egrevond](/wiki/Egrevond) along with a legion of dark wizards. The government feared that the killer's motive was to use Baby Intelligence to return to full strength, as the walls of a prison in Egrevond read \"Something...Baby Intelligence\" and \"The S.M.S.B. scum can die in my, well, something\", among other crude graffiti. This shook Baby Intelligence, while Telekinibabe assured him that the MBH was too well-protected to be breached, even by sorcery, but Baby Intelligence feared that if Karkamel could break inside if he could break out of the void called Egrevond. Maurice moved Baby Intelligence aside to tell him not to go looking for Karkamel, but Baby Intelligence claimed that the sorcerer would come to him. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Ambush at Sioux Falls[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Baby Intelligence had everyone return to the Sanctuary in pairs, with him accompanying Force Baby. As the assembled enemies prepared to attack the babies, Force Baby panicked and had teleported them away via [the Kraft](/wiki/The_Kraft), much to Baby Intelligence's horror, who ordered Force Baby not do it as he feared he was leading the metallic figure, who was too close in proximity to them, directly to the Sanctuary. However, this was not Force Baby's intent as he quickly thought of a different location while an injured Baby Intelligence shoved the metal man out of the beam, separating the pair while he fled back to [Nevada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada). Narragansett[ ] Baby Intelligence awoke to realize something was wrong. Force Baby had used the Kraft to heal his neck while he was unconscious. He eventually deduced that they were in the belly of a giant monster. They managed to escape the beast's belly, realizing they had been inside a Basilisk that had been terrorizing [Rhode Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island) for some time. The enraged snake gave chase, destroying much of [Narragansett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narragansett) in its rampage. Briefly joining the townspeople in fleeing for his life, Baby Intelligence realized Force Baby was missing. Frantic, he turned to a girl he realized was contesting the basilisk and attempted to curry her aid. She claimed that she was too busy fighting a superhero's battle, angering him and prompting him to turn and fight. Several unsavory-looking men came running in to aid the woman, and Baby Intelligence joined in a brief skirmish in which the Basilisk attempted to take them all simultaneously. Suddenly, Force Baby came stumbling out of its maw. As the Basilisk reared on Force Baby, the woman pointed out to Baby Intelligence that a particular spot near the snake's jaw had been penetrated by the bullets. Making a split-second decision, Baby Intelligence shouted at the mystery woman to throw him at the wound. She did, and he stabbed its bruised patch. Blood began spilling from the basilisk, hurting it, and Force Baby fired one last shot into the beast, killing it. After it collapsed, Baby Intelligence ran to Force Baby, who was delirious and potentially suffering from frostbite, and healed him. While he worked, he taught the mystery woman, who identified as [Dean Rattvisa](/wiki/Dean_Rattvisa), a lot about First Aid. He learned that Rattvisa was the leader of a gang, the Rattvisa Gang, scaring him until he learned that their hideout was destroyed by the Basilisk. He promised to get her and her gang to safety, just as several nervous townspeople approached them. A town official shouted them out as heroes, causing some to applaud, while others still fearfully regarded the Rattvisa Gang. Baby Intelligence promised to get Rattvisa and her gang to safety, and she agreed to accompany him. A disheveled-looking man piped up and told them the fastest way to get to the [Sanctuary](/wiki/Sanctuary) would be passage through the [Devil's Armpit](/wiki/Devil%27s_Armpit). Surprised at the name, Baby Intelligece and the others worked out a plan to best cross it in a brief period of time. Returning to the Sanctuary[ ] Baby Intelligence took off with the unlikely group to reach the Sanctuary, meet up with the other S.M.S.B. members, and receive further orders from Sheriff Bladepoint. Upon leaving, they ventured through the Devil's Armpit, during which time Baby Intelligence got to know the members of Dean's gang as they made for an ancient gateway. They arrived at the Sanctuary and the gang made camp in a discreet spot outside. Baby Intelligence entered the complex with Force Baby, where he contemplated how to tell Sheriff Bladepoint about Dean. Suddenly, Force Baby pointed out something fishy and Baby Intelligence followed his pointer finger to a familiar face: Wesley the Worm. Wesley claimed to be at the [Sanctuary](/wiki/Sanctuary) \"on official business\" as he knew where the Western Field was and that he intended to tell this to a Grand Army member. Having learned that Wesley had been accused on spying for Annabeth Black, Baby Intelligence gave him the benefit of the doubt and asked him why. At this point, Wesley admitted the truth about his position as a pirate and furiously revealed that he really was a spy, prompting Baby Intelligence to knock him out by telekinetically smashing him against the floor. He asked Bruce Wright to inform Sheriff Bladepoint of Wesley's duplicity and headed off to his room, only to find two people working on it prompting him to go to the kitchen. Dinner was a festive affair. Sheriff Bladepoint was there, and he commended Baby Intelligence for 'approrpriately' dealing with Wesley. He told him that with Owen's passing, he would have to take Flame as his own, something the superhero agreed to. He voiced his suspicions that the Ninth Guard was at the Western Field ready to expose the Sanctuary to [Brute Gunray](/wiki/Brute_Gunray) and announced that someone needed to deal with the threat. Realizing the Rattvisa Gang was still around, Baby Intelligence volunteered to counter the NoHead threat, despite a few people contradicting him because of his obvious fatigue. Force Baby said he would be honored to interfere, but [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) walked in and claimed Force Baby's unstable connection to [the Kraft](/wiki/The_Kraft) would endanger him on such a wide space. Baby Intelligence agreed and ordered Force Baby to seek out his cousin while he went with Kellerman. Battle of the Western Field[ ] Baby Intelligence finally agreed to accompany the gang. They proceed to the Western Field, where they were ambushed by the Ninth Guard. Upon slashing out a single war robot five times, Baby Intelligence noticed [Cassidy](/wiki/Cassidy) stabbing Rattvisa G to death with a needler, but then a skytrooper throws him to the ground. Noticing this, Cassidy chased him and would have struck him in the heart. Fortunately, Baby Intelligence countered with a telekinetic repulse. Getting to his feet, he called off the surviving gang members, finding to his dismay that several of them were dead. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) As if out of nowhere, a stave was thrown into her neck by Cassidy, who Kellerman killed in retaliation. Baby Intelligence heard several loud noises and saw Shaffer hit the ground with a thud. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Keeping a promise[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Baby Intelligence then returned to Nepal to keep the promise he had made to Natalie K. Wagner, accompanied by [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and [Optica](/wiki/Optica). His instincts to come exactly when he did were correct, as Wagner was mere hours from going into labor. Along with Lindsay Kellerman, Optica, and several of Wagner's friends, Baby Intelligence helped her through it, to the best of his abilities. Wagner was so grateful that she named her newborn son after him, after Baby Intelligence confirmed what his given name was. When they made their leave, Optica finally confessed to how she had found her way to the S.M.S.B. by impulsively and foolishly fleeing the hospital. Baby Intelligence forgave her impulse and claimed she was not responsible for callously deserting her parents, though Optica claimed he had never met anyone he had not shown mercy to. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Slaying of Karkamel[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Baby Intelligence met [Hardy](/wiki/Hardy). Karkamel succeeded in altering the [reality](/wiki/Mutantry-2222) to one where a legion of Dark sorcerers dominated the [Eight Worlds](/wiki/Eight_Worlds) and rampaged wherever they pleased. Later, Karkamel arrived to confront Baby Intelligence and Force Baby on the streets. However, Bruce Wright, [Hardy](/wiki/Hardy), [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe), Carl Steele, and Logan had [time-traveled](/wiki/Time_Travel) back to when Karkamel escaped and ambushed and killed him, so the Karkamel standing before Baby Intelligence suddenly began fading away as he demanded to know the meaning of it until he disappeared in a flash of light. Subsequently, he saw a series of destroyed buildings seemingly repairing themselves and a series of corpses seemingly being reincarnated. He was initially horrified until [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe) came rushing to him and explained that Bruce Wright had just brought the S.M.S.B. Grand Master into his time slip where the reverse effects of Karkamel's reign wouldn't affect either of them, nor would it affect Hardy, making Baby Intelligence realize how Karkamel had died. Impressed, Baby Intelligence told Telekinibabe to keep going. He then asked Hardy how he felt about registering, but he could hardly remember what had happened during the time loop. Victory in sight[ ] Skirmish at the Bench Store[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | As [Mean King](/wiki/Mean_King) waited for word from [Brute Gunray](/wiki/Brute_Gunray), Baby Intelligence and Force Baby entered the office. Quickly dispatching Mean King's Rocket guards with his sword, Baby Intelligence confronted Mean King, who dueled them both. He managed to knock out Force Baby, then attacked Intelligence with lightning. His disgust soon turned to delight as he realized his wish to fight Intelligence had come true. Baby Intelligence quickly fought back and pulled out his sword. Mean King then drew his sword and the duel began. The duel moved into the store itself, where the two mutants engaged in a saber duel on the desk. The two fought until Mean King leaped away. The fight tore apart most of the Bench Store as Mean King was trying to crush the S.M.S.B. leader by throwing benches at him. The S.M.S.B. leader and the last NoHead son were counterpoised. As the duel progressed, and Mean King continued his telekinetic assault, Intelligence managed to catch one of the benches and flung it back at Mean King, who leapt out of it's path. Baby Intelligence took the chance to engage the distracted marauder at close quarters once again, but Mean King disarmed him. The diminutive baby was forced to use [Zamora](/wiki/Zamora) to withstand Mean King's lightning. Mean King's power was great, but Intelligence was able to resist his might, and he attempted to redirect the lightning. As the two duelists attempted to overpower each other, the energy between Dark mutant and relic suddenly exploded. The blast hurled them apart, ending the battle. Mean King was able to grasp the edge of a nearby bench, while Intelligence crashed into the desk and fell down to the floor of the Bench Store. Mean King leaped after, only to be decapitated when Force Baby directed the blade at him from downstairs. After disposing of Mean King, Baby Intelligence rides the desk back upstairs, where he finds Force Baby had recovered and is waiting for him. He tells him that Mean King is dead, and they have won. Just then, the comlink beeped. Baby Intelligence took it out and answered. Baby Strength's voice came on and announced Brute Gunray's death. Baby Intelligence tells him that Mean King is gone too, meaning that the NoHeads are extinct now.

The Mackerels defeated the Erutuls, and other results went their way, meaning that, in the final game of the season against the Grenades, if they could win the climactic game of the season, they would win the Cup. In the aftermath of the game, Baby Intelligence noticed Dorber embracing Wilcox openly and supressed a snort after Dorber giggled girlishly when Wilcox called the Grenades \"accursed\". Dorber pulled Baby Intelligence aside and told him to watch himself throughout the intervening days, to which he revealed that the Police Grand Army was finally ready to make their run on the Eastern Field, much to Dorber's shock. He immediately asked if Wilcox had anything to do with it, and he confirmed she would be fighting and nothing could change her mind. [[26]](#cite_note-AEG_24-26) At Baby Intelligence's insistence, Kellerman deposited Hardy's unconscious form in an alleyway a good distance from the clearing. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Encounter with Olocron[ ] After the devastation caused by the Battle of the Western Field, Baby Intelligence returned to the [Sanctuary](/wiki/Sanctuary) with Hardy. He went to the lobby to settle down for the night, only for a mysterious figure to attack him in fit of rage and transform [Might](/wiki/Might) into a glob of green goo. Baby Intelligence and his opponent were both trapped under an informal indoor tent when he realized he was being assaulted by none other than [Olocron](/wiki/Olocron). Baby Intelligence was bewildered and demanded to know the meaning of their scuffle, to which Olocron finally stopped attacking. The ancient humanoid angrily told that the S.M.S.B. was never supposed to enter the [Dancing Dorm](/wiki/Dancing_Dorm). Baby Intelligence was horrified to learn [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead) had punished Olocron and his guests by destroying the facility, for which Olocron had narrowly made it out alive. Moved by the realization of just how much his actions impacted innocent people, Baby Intelligence profusely apologized, but Olocron, despite consenting to mend his [magma sword](/wiki/Magma_sword), refused to forgive him. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Bailey Dennings' words[ ] In the morning, Baby Intelligence made his way to [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint)'s office, where he requested that at long last, the Sheriff complete his training. Bladepoint refused, however, insisting they had a much more pressing affair \u2014 the upcoming [Battle of the Eastern Field](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Field). He ordered Baby Intelligence to give his speech he had been preparing, claiming it was \"now or never\". Despite disagreeing with Bladepoint's lack of concern with how capable he was of taking down the [Lord of the North](/wiki/Lord_of_the_North), Baby Intelligence tried giving a speech of encouragement to the disheveled Grand Army alongside Wilcox, and at the latter's insistence, Dennings as well. He expressed his honor, more like intimidation, at being thrust back into the spotlight of the Grand Army, but then lost his train of thought, but Dennings suddenly yanked the microphone out of his hands and told them it was time for them to build character individually through proving themselves in battle and reminded them of what Baby Intelligence had sacrificed and endured to bring about their chance to topple the NoHeads while they were vulnerable. She told them to raise their flag and demanded to know if they were ready to fight. The audience chamber erupted with cheering and applause to her speech. Baby Intelligence followed his friends into the back. Confronting the Lord of the North[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Following Dennings' oration, Baby Intelligence accompanied the rest of the Police Grand Army during the [Battle of the Eastern Field](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Field). Once they arrived at the outskirts of the Eastern Field, Baby Intelligence left the others to meditate in preparation for the chaos ahead. However, before he could do this, he encountered [Bartholomew Gales](/wiki/Bartholomew_Gales) and the [Lord of the North](/wiki/Lord_of_the_North) and overheard them arguing about their failure to end the S.M.S.B. Grand Master. The Lord of the North accused [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), who was apparently in very close proximity, of refusing to honor her word. The Lord of the North fired a [Death beam](/wiki/Death_beam) at Gales to shut him up, utterly enraging Baby Intelligence at his utter disregard for human life, prompting him to reveal himself. The baby thought he would lead him to Annabeth Black, but he heard her [Deteleport](/wiki/Teleportation) upon this implication. Baby Intelligence stepped out and confronted the Lord of the North, citing that he was \"the being he'd heard so much about\". The Lord of the North summoned his bodyguards to kill him. Baby Intelligence drew his sword and managed to strike down all of them, but the Lord of the North threw him to the ground and pinned him there. As he was about to kill Baby Intelligence, he felt his [NoHead Sign](/wiki/NoHead_Sign) burn and took off to answer the call. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) [Battle of the Eastern Field](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Field)[ ] Still having time to meditate, Baby Intelligence focused his thoughts and, upon the ringing of a ten-minute timer, returned to the masses and helped lead them to their position before the opposing army. He eventually encountered Carol Wilcox, whom she began yelling at until he came closer to her. After he projected a [Shield](/wiki/Shield) behind her, she asked him where Dorber was, but the superhero had no idea. He in turn asked her where the [Lord of the North](/wiki/Lord_of_the_North) could be found. She said he was last seen firing recklessly at enemy troops with his mutantry. As a rock glanced off the Shield protecting her, Baby Intelligence thanked her and continued fighting. Suddenly, Bladepoint yelled at Baby Intelligence to flee from his position. Baby Intelligence obediently ran out of the way. As if out of nowhere, an explosion of Dark energy manifesting itself into tiny fireworks ravaged Bladepoint's body and killed him. Baby Intelligence was burned by the explosion, but his grief over Bladepoint's death kept him conscious long enough to crawl over to him in front of hundreds of staring people, his body broken from the energies. Baby Intelligence started to cry over Bladepoint's corpse as well as wiping a trickle of blood from the dead Sheriff's mouth with his (Baby Intelligence's) own sleeve, but then he fell unconscious. Fortunately, he received medical attention. Realizing it was time to part with the horse Flame, Baby Intelligence left him in the hands of the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army). [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Funeral of Sheriff Bladepoint[ ] - \"I'm really sorry, Baby Intelligence. I know how much he meant to you.\" \"He's the one who taught me. And yet his corpse, it disappeared pretty quickly. There's nothing left of him, which is a good thing.\" - Carol Wilcox and Baby Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/The_Super_Babies:_An_Ended_Generation) Following the death of Sheriff Bladepoint, his funeral was carried out. He sat alone, even rejecting [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe)'s attempts to comfort him, which he soon came to regret, for he felt very lonely. Wilcox eventually walked over to comfort him during the cremation, which he reluctantly allowed her to do. He told her he was glad there was nothing left of Bladepoint's corpse, and in response, she spotted a wishing star and revealed to Baby Intelligence just how badly she wanted the Police Grand Army to win the war. When the sun rose, Dorber resolved to return to Woodbury, and Baby Intelligence promised to follow him within half a week's time. His pupils heavily protested against this, but Baby Intelligence insisted upon his decision, claiming there needed to be balance and there was more to life than war. Nevertheless, he did not leave for another three days. He also laughed when Wilcox joked that she would go so far as to get on a [Skater](/wiki/Skater), play against Dorber, and win. Upon his return home, Baby Intelligence, in his sleep, entered a strange meditation, where he met Sheriff Bladepoint, overcome with a mixture of grief and joy. Bladepoint smiled and hugged him back, though he puzzled him by showing alarm by how dramatically his apprentice embraced him. He told Baby Intelligence to continue fighting and that because life was not living if he lost what he loved, to guard it most dearly. He then Deteleported, leaving Baby Intelligence lost and confused, but also confident and once again motivated. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Fight for Sebiscuits Cardarphen[ ] Sheriff Lewis[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | After getting the article, the S.M.S.B. immediately went to stop the Lunch Money Bandit. When they finally found him in [Golgolod](/wiki/Golgolod), they were forced to bypass several exhausting barriers and they were picked off one-by-one, leaving only Baby Intelligence and Force Baby to locate him in the main chamber. They engaged Cygnus in a fierce duel. The Lunch Money Bandit finally had to relinquish, and faked his own death. Satisfied, Baby Intelligence called the group away. The S.M.S.B. members left, thinking they had won. Shortly afterwards, Baby Intelligence was contacted by the Police Grand Army, who insisted he come to see them. He initially hesitated, as he had already been spending far to little time on Crodela, but he finally obliged after an argument with Baby Strength, at which point he called them back. He left Hardy under Telekinibabe's charge and Force Baby under Optica's while he took Baby Strength and Lindsay Kellerman with him. As per Sheriff Bladepoint's request, his being deceased left Baby Intelligence the new leader of the Police Grand Army. He felt this was too much of a burden as he did not think he was strong enough to take on the NoHeads or to duel Annabeth Black, privately dreading not knowing what to say to her when they met. However, he was able to reason with them that Lewis would make for a far better leader than he, which the council reluctantly acquiesced to. Lewis was extremely touched upon learning the true extent of Baby Intelligence's confidence in him, and he promised that he would do anything he asked of him, knowing Baby Intelligence would not abuse this oath. The journey to the Lake of Tears[ ] With Lindsay Kellerman watching over his shoulder, Baby Intelligence was reminded of Sebiscuits Cardarphen's existence by a newspaper article. He rallied his companions and pursued him, hoping he would lead them to [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black). He believed that if he were to bring Black into custody and either kill or redeem Cardarphen (preferably the latter), the Solar System would finally be safe. On several occasions, the S.M.S.B. lost their way. Much to the surprise of the S.M.S.B. Grand Master, they were found by [Pythoman](/wiki/Pythoman), who at first tried to torture Baby Intelligence for the whereabouts of [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), but was captured by Kellerman (with Baby Intelligence's help) and cornered. Baby Intelligence decided not to slay the child, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the enemy of Annabeth. Pythoman then began leading them to the [Lake of Tears](/wiki/Lake_of_Tears), where he told them Cardarphen was according to rumor. Baby Intelligence is the only person save two others known to have shown kindness towards Pythoman, who is hated instantly by everyone he meets. The two had a strange sort of bond from both having been orphaned; in Pythoman, Baby Intelligence saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Unbeknownst to Baby Intelligence, they had a common goal, for entirely different reasons: find a much-hated baby who would lead them to Black. He did not know he and his friends were being manipulated. When the President of the [United States of America](/wiki/United_States_of_America) was kidnapped, Pythoman convinced them not to finish their trek to the lake, insisting that Black and Cardarphen would catch them off-balance and slaughter them. Pythoman said he would lead them to a construction tower. Baby Intelligence complied in spite of [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby)'s suspicions. Betrayed[ ] At the break of dawn on June 1, Baby Intelligence flew to Woodbury, in spite of Baby Strength's protests, to \"finish what he started with the Holy Mackerels\" in Crodela. The game was the final game of the year and very important because it would be the decider of the winner of the [International Crodela Cup](/wiki/International_Crodela_Cup). The Holy Mackerels ultimately lost the match. During the post-game meeting, Coach Dorber's last monologue was extremely grim, but Baby Inteligence, remembering [Bailey Dennings](/wiki/Bailey_Dennings), stepped in and pointed out that mistakes and failure were important lessons, if not the most important lesson, for a Crodela player. Ultimately, he helped the others come to terms with their failure to win the Cup, and to realize they still had their entire lives ahead of them. This heartfelt meeting between the fourteen friends bolstered their cheerfulness, and everyone filed out, at which point he went to find his friends so they could complete their mission. Assured by the others that the game had been rest enough, Baby Intelligence met with Pythoman outside the stadium, who shocked them by killing eight-year-old [Stacy Nelson](/wiki/Stacy_Nelson), who had unfortunately encountered them. At the base of the tower, Pythoman deserted the S.M.S.B. following a heated argument between himself and Telekinibabe. Disappointed, Baby Intelligence and company fall into slumber. In his sleep, Baby Intelligence was disturbed by a vision of Pythoman speaking with [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), pledging himself to the NoHeads and planning to betray the S.M.S.B. Upon awaking, Baby Intelligence sees Pythoman has returned and harshly accused the tenacious boy. The former learned that Pythoman came to respect Black deeply during the [Second NoHead War](/wiki/Second_NoHead_War), though he envied her power. Pythoman fled to the construction tower, but Baby Intelligence jumped into his Pinewood Derby and pursued. The defector outmaneuvered them, and the Pinewood Derby landed atop the tower. Here, Baby Intelligence saw Pythoman firmly standing by Black and Cardarphen. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Volcanic showdown[ ] After a chase, Sebiscuits drove them into a volcano. Once Sebiscuits climbed inside, Baby Intelligence attempted to reason with the NoHead. Sebiscuits refused to be swayed, and Intelligence resultedly drew his sword. With a murderous battle cry, Sebiscuits drew his and leaped at Baby Intelligence, and a great battle began. Sebiscuits viciously drove Baby Intelligence back through the complex with his mastery of Svarna, however he was unable to penetrate Intelligence's mastery of the same form. Their bout in the control room of the volcano deactivated the energy shield protecting the settlement, so when their fight spread to the collection arms of the facility, they were forced to dodge a rain of fire. While Cardarphen killed Baby Intelligence here, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and [Baby Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) used a [Time Machine](/wiki/Time_Machine) to rescue Baby Intelligence and ultimately allow him to resume fighting. As he leaped onto a jutting platform for balance, Kellerman Teleported with him and told him about what had happened, although he refused to hear the whole thing. In the ensuing duel, the lava caused the collection arms structure to weaken and eventually collapse and break loose. Cardarphen and Baby Intelligence fought an intense duel throughout the artificial complex and down the river of lava outside. Baby Intelligence and Sebiscuits continued to fight on the collection arm as it floated down a lava river, but remembering Kellerman's sacrifice, Baby Intelligence leaped off onto one of the platforms floating above the river, more desperate to win than he had been in his entire life. The battle ended on the banks of a lava river, where Sebiscuits leaped to safety in order to claim the high ground and warned Baby Intelligence it was over. Determined to finish what he had started, Baby Intelligence ignored his fatal tactical disadvantage and attempted to make the same jump, blade angled for the kill, only to be severely maimed by a seismic charge. Physically crippled, Baby Intelligence tried to claw his way up the hill, but succeeded only in sliding closer to the lava river. As he did this, Baby Intelligence screamed his undying hatred for Sebiscuits, while Sebiscuits, close to tears, expressed his regret and disappointment that Baby Intelligence, the baby he had loved like a brother, had so spectacularly failed in his destiny. Shortly after, the heat of the undalatium ignited Baby Intelligence's clothing, burning his body severely. He was nearly immolated as he slid down to the edge of the burning lava riverbank. As the flames began to subside, Baby Intelligence kept himself alive with his unbreakable will; clawing his way back up the bank, struggling against his extreme injuries. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) The fate of Sebiscuits Cardarphen[ ] However, Sebiscuits Cardarphen finally returned and took Baby Intelligence to the MBH, and repaired the damage to his body through intensive cybernetic enhancements at the MBH's medical center. His new robotic extremities were updated versions of a previously-made design by Sebiscuits. Upon regaining enough of his strength, Baby Intelligence then realized he was on an operating table. Upon his revival as a cyborg, Baby Intelligence thanked Sebiscuits for saving him, and he apologized and allowed him to rejoin the S.M.S.B. This in part was due to him regaining some perspective at that point, and realizing what he otherwise would do with his life. Baby Intelligence conversed with the others and learned that they had changed the [entire timeline](/wiki/Mutantry-4444) in order to save him from perishing at Cardarphen's hands. He learned what they had been through, what Black had been plotting all along, and of the heroic contribution by the now unborn [Ashton Quintan](/wiki/Ashton_Quintan). Afterwards, Baby Intelligence went downstairs to greet the board members, who were there to discuss the future of Sebiscuits Cardarphen. As if out of nowhere, a miniature bomb that Annabeth Black had given to [Lewis](/wiki/Lewis) disguised as an access chip exploded, killing the board members. After an alarmed Baby Intelligence whipped out his sword, Black strode forward to reveal herself as the culprit and ordered Baby Intelligence to lay down Might. He refused, but Black pinned him under a tree by electrocuting its roots. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Knowing Black could enter his now-vulnerable home, Baby Intelligence quickly realized how the bomb worked and used his telekinesis to disarm it, blinding himself temporarily. As if out of nowhere, [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby) burst in and shot Annabeth Black, killing her. Force Baby then checked on Baby Intelligence and used the Kraft to quicken the process to restore his sight so it was instantaneous. Baby Intelligence then rushed over to tend to Lewis, only to learn that he was dying. Thankfully, he had a few drops left in his flask, and in a moment of irony he used it to heal Lewis. The two then discussed Cardarphen and agreed he would spend five years in a prison for juveniles, although Baby Intelligence would frequently tend to him. However, when Cardarphen quickly accepted his fate, Lewis agreed he could join the victory celebration before he began his sentence. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) The victory celebration[ ] A few days later, the S.M.S.B. organized a great celebration on the streets of [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City), where Baby Intelligence confirmed that Cardarphen had rejoined them. He also performed in front of thousands of people a second time after revealing that a karaoke set had been bought to the party, courtesy of [Rocken Role](/wiki/Rocken_Role). [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Following the celebration, Baby Intelligence detained Cardarphen in his cell, promising to visit often. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) Between the wars[ ] Tying up loose ends[ ] For the remainder of 2030, Baby Intelligence helped the police reform after Operation: Purge. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) He also attended the trial of [Whammo Fireball](/wiki/Whammo_Fireball) and the [Lunch Money Bandit](/wiki/Lunch_Money_Bandit). [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) After that fateful duel, Baby Intelligence built a motor home over the next few months whilst also continuing the training of the other members. In 2031, [Becca Smith](/wiki/Becca_Smith), whose powers had just developed, went to the MBH for testing, though Baby Intelligence deemed there was too much fear and anger in her (the same reason Sebiscuits was nearly rejected in the first place). Just then, Nagatha broke in, and Baby Intelligence struggled to fight her. Becca offered to fetch the police, and began to take flight. She did not realize that Nagatha had bit her bracelet as she left. Baby Intelligence had to release Nagatha to save Becca from Nagatha's venom, forcing off her bracelet as Becca continued off to the Jade Sanctum. Just then, Baby Intelligence found her and angrily told the police to take Becca home and ensure her parents knew what had happened. In a fit of rage, Becca stopped idolizing Baby Intelligence and hated him for his actions. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) American Purge[ ] After his encounter with Becca Smith, Baby Intelligence continued work on the motor home. When the vehicle was complete, he rallied the S.M.S.B. together, and they began a new mission to humanely hunt down and apprehend any notable criminals in the United States of America and wipe all evil off their country. During the mission, which inaccurately became known as American Purge, they virtually lived in the motor home. One of the most difficult criminals they faced was [ [blank - content needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content)]. Another notably difficult criminal was a voodoo demon. He fired an extremely powerful curse at Lindsay Kellerman, and she ultimately had to return home. Baby Intelligence permitted this, but ensured Lindsay had plenty of work to do. In 2033, they returned successful, and Baby Intelligence allowed the others five days of free time where they could relax and play. When this period was over, he continued to train the other members. He himself received exclusive training from Rotta Hecks' spirit. At some point afterwards, Baby Intelligence induced a girl into the S.M.S.B. and renamed her [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl). [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) Growing up[ ] During his sixth birthday in 2035, a guest suggested that Baby Intelligence take the name of Master Intelligence, as he was no longer a baby. He ultimately agreed and took the name for which he would go by for life. A few weeks later, and with Titanium Girl accompanying him, he came to drive [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) to the [MBH](/wiki/Mutant_Baby_Home) at long last. He introduced the cyborg to Titanium Girl. In 2037, he sensed an unusual amount of crimes being committed. He found the source was a man named Darren Slade, who had been possessed by Mr. Stupid NoHead's spirit, and engaged him in combat. Master Intelligence won the duel and was able to help Slade eject NoHead from his body, and Darren was more himself. As a result, Master Intelligence made sure Darren was not arrested for the crimes he had been forced to commit. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) Meeting Jonathan[ ] In 2038, rumors of a former NoHead headquarters in Albany compelled Jaden Vang, the leader of the Outpost in the Appalachian Mountains, to mount an expedition there. Vang brought a homeless orphan named Jonathan with him, as he knew his skills as a mechanic and believed they would come in handy. Vang also brought six hired protectors with him. Together, they attempted to find the rumored base. However, on the way, they were mobbed by a band of thieves. However, Master Intelligence, who was scouting the area for any sign of NoHead activity, happened to be nearby. He intervened and was able to rescue the party and drive off the thugs, who did not wish to contend with his might. Jaden Vang offered him a pay of 35 dollars for saving them, but Intelligence replied that he did not take charity for his heroics. Jonathan thanked Master Intelligence and, due to his current life, asked him if he could go with him to the MBH and be tested for joining the S.M.S.B. Master Intelligence already knew that Jonathan wanted to join and he was a child, filling in two of the three current guidelines. In response, the mutant asked him what his powers were. When Jonathan said he had no powers, the mutant shook his head, stating that only mutants could join. After saying goodbye to Jonathan, Intelligence also shook hands with the thugs and learned their names. After this, Intelligence finished scouting the area. The hunting party chose to turn back afterwards. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) Master Intelligence also conversed with the [ghosts](/wiki/Ghost) of Rotta Hecks and Paige Nelson often, which he usually did in private. However, he did introduce Sebiscuits Cardarphen to them once, in 2039, and Cardarphen apologized for murdering Nelson. A few months later, they also warned him that the ghosts of Hell Burnbottom and Mr. Stupid NoHead were formulating a plot and would soon come back, with the help of two mutants they had went up against before. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Eve of war[ ] - \"Well, your fate is pretty much sealed. For now, make yourself at home.\" - Master Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_Where_Are_You_Now%3F) In 2041, Master Intelligence was still teaching the S.M.S.B. when Cynthia Thomas joined the group and took the name of [Red X](/wiki/Red_X). When Cynthia headed inside his office upon being pinpointed there by Lindsay, Master Intelligence rose from his desk and greets her. He reminds her who he is and tells her he's excited to have her as a new S.M.S.B. member. He explains that she will be taught a full range of subjects, including history, science, dueling, math, art, writing, and learning to use her powers. He also tells her that in the last mentioned class, they also studied Teleportation, which any mutant could use. He then shows Cynthia to her room. When they arrive, Master Intelligence reveals that he is making her a new set of clothes before telekinetically bringing the suitcase onto the shelf next to the bed. Cynthia was awed by this. Master Intelligence told her she could also adopt a new name, and recommends \"Red X\" upon seeing her shirt. Cynthia agrees and her alias is sealed. Master Intelligence tells her she should unpack, as it will take another hour for supper to finish. He tells her she can \"make herself at home\" until then. He then leaves her to undress in private.He trained her along with the other members of the S.M.S.B., and personally helped her create her sword. However, he realized she did not always know what they were talking about, and as such arranged to personally tutor her later. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) One night, Master Intelligence awoke at about three in the morning. He immediately sensed enemy movements outside his room. Grabbing his sword, which was in a drawer with a release switch, he left his room to search for any intruders and due to Whammo Fireball's neglect, managed to locate the Lunch Money Bandit. Still in his pajamas, Master Intelligence dueled him briefly. The Lunch Money Bandit called Fireball, who showed up and linked hands before Deteleporting away from the MBH. Master Intelligence was highly eluded by this, and realized the NoHeads would return soon. The next morning, when everyone met together for their first class, he told them about what had happened. Master Intelligence and company stopped by Central Park East High School, where they met a handful of students, including Tori Newell. Later on, the S.M.S.B. made plates of their own, which they would later \"have a delicious surprise supper on them\". [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) [Campaign to discredit Master Intelligence](/wiki/Robbie_Evans%27_campaign)[ ] Return of the NoHeads[ ] - \"They're trying to discredit him. Didn't you see the Perpetual Seer last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Syndicate of Mutants because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true, he was voted out by governors after he made a speech announcing Hell Burnbottom's return. They're talking about taking away his Order of Magic, First Class, too.\" \"But Master Intelligence says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Holocards.\" - Eskea Vector and Telekinibabe explaining to Lindsay Kellerman about Master Intelligence's discredit [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_The_Return_of_the_Verasect) Finally, the plates are successfully complete. Master Intelligence tells Telekinibabe to fetch Lindsay from her room. Telekinibabe nods and heads down there to find Lindsay reading. He tells her that the plates and surprise supper have been completed. For the second time in the book, Lindsay follows him to Master Intelligence. As Master Intelligence announces that their plates \"turned out great,\" Lindsay stands next to Red X. With that, Master Intelligence disappears behind a door. He returns carrying a pot, a kettle, and a plate of steaks. Having already fetched their cups, the other members head to the long table. Master Intelligence lays down a steak on everyone's plate, then calls everyone over to get macaroni and cheese and peas from the pot and kettle, for which everyone is more than happy to oblige. When all the plates are assembled, everyone begins to eat. For Sebiscuits, the food has been mashed so he can suck it past his vocabulator. Suddenly, Lindsay Kellerman touched her plate and was mysteriously transported to the [Tower of Reincarnation](/wiki/Tower_of_Reincarnation). There, Lindsay was bound and a chunk of her flesh was taken as the final ingredient in a prism the warlord used to return to full power. Using the plate, Lindsay was able to escape Hell Burnbottom and return to the MBH. In tears, Lindsay told him the NoHeads had returned. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) Master Intelligence was not surprised, but chose to conceal this from her. The government immediately began to deny Master Intelligence and Lindsay's claims that the Dark Lord had returned, starting a smear campaign designed to slander and vilify them; in particular, Master Intelligence was removed from his positions as Chief Deviant as punishment for his refusal to stay in line with government propaganda. However, Master Intelligence professed not to care, so long as the government did not eliminate him from Holocards (though ironically, it is highly likely that he was joking). He confessed that he believed that Evans' persecution of him was of his own free will and not due to [mind control](/wiki/Mind_control), though this was small comfort. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Curbing Stanley[ ] Master Intelligence went with [Hardy](/wiki/Hardy) and Crystal to extract Tori Newell from Stanley, who was harboring her illegally. He realized they were in the right place when a light shut off, seemingly in response to his arrival. They stepped inside to encounter a group of gangsters who were also staying wth Stanley, all of whom backed down for fear of fighting him. When he told the police the gangsters had illegal guns on their person, Master Intelligence realized it was all he needed to discredit them. He was disgusted upon learning that Stanley claimed to be single and did not really love Troy. On July 10, Master Intelligence and Baby Strength encountered Rose Johannson suspiciously near the MBH. However, he overlooked the situation when Rose gave him Troy's backpack. He headed for the mansion, but for reasons he had yet to learn Baby Strength did not follow him for several minutes. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Concealing the Enforcer[ ] On July 11, Master Intelligence had a phone call with [Jena Ort](/wiki/Jena_Ort), but he was nearly overheard by [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman). Subsequently, he returned some of Troy's possessions to Jena Ort. She surprised him when she agreed to hide his mobile, the [Enforcer](/wiki/Enforcer), in her garage. She feared that this would help Rose exploit him, but Master Intelligence was confident that Rose could not undo anything about his life. On July 12, Lindsay Kellerman confronted Master Intelligence, calling him childish. He asked if he was doing anything in particular that irritated her, but Kellerman was lost for words. Days later, Master Intelligence was having an informal conversation with [Red X](/wiki/Red_X) when he realized Baby Strength was sitting in a corner and crying. Baby Strength let out days of pent-up grief by yelling at his master, explaining that Rose had betrayed Tori Newell and that was why she was in long-term treatment. Baby Strength angrily swore to Master Intelligence that he was going to slay the nurse. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Titanium Girl's birthday[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | On August 4, [Lincoln Strafford](/wiki/Ironside) phoned Master Intelligence and informed him that he had broken up with Crystal, as he had been coming onto her too hardly and she did not consider herself ready for a romantic relationship. Master Intelligence arranged to pay him a visit so they could discuss it. In the meantime, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) went to visit her close friend Daisy to help bake a cake for [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl). Kellerman unexpectedly stayed the night at Daisy's. Lincoln came to visit and he spoke with Master Intelligence. After Master Intelligence disappeared in the back to take care of 'assault charge business', Lincoln began conversing with [Red X](/wiki/Red_X) while she was making dinner. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Visitors in the MBH[ ] On August 14, Master Intelligence went to pay Crystal a visit. It turned out that several of her friends were around, including Lincoln. However, he was disturbed to learn that Crystal had been beaten up the previous night by Hunter's friend, Paul. He sent Baby Strength and Titanium Girl back to the MBH, after which time she proceeded to spend the majority of the afternoon with Master Intelligence and Crystal. Taking pity on their situation, Master Intelligence let them stay the night at the MBH. At 1:45 in the morning, Master Intelligence returned with Crystal and Lincoln. They discussed bedding arrangements, in whuch Master Intelligence allowed them both to use his emergency blankets and sleep in the Grand Training Chamber. In the afternoon, Crystal's father told her that he was getting a job in another state and that he was not below putting her out on the street as a beggar. After giving Crystal a sleeping pill, Master Intelligence returned to his office and began pacing around, thinking on how best to solve the issue. Finally, he resolved to meditate upon a proper solution. He returned to the training chamber just as Crystal awoke and Baby Strength returned from a day out with [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby). Master Intelligence told Crystal that there was a criminal attorney who could bring Hunter and Jason to justice. When Lincoln asked if it was Master Intelligence's job, he denied it, claiming he would interfere if needs be, but not before the incident was out of the penal system's control. Master Intelligence called Crystal's father and, overheard by Crystal, Lincoln, and Baby Strength, emphasized how severe Hunter's potentially fatal situation was and encouraged him to get Hunter the help he needed and keep Crystal out of danger. His top suggestion was to have Hunter placed in the same hospital that Tori Newell had been placed in years past. However, he had hopes that Hunter would grow committed and their planned move would be unnecessary. To this end, he decided the entire S.M.S.B. would help clean up Crystal's house so her father could sell it. He suggested Crystal get her dog free and let him live in the mountains with a wolf pack. Crystal doubted he was too domesticated for such a course of action, considering the idea. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Ending the campaign[ ] Hoping to end the campaign against him and Lindsay and get the truth out to the public, Master Intelligence instructed [Trevor Bones](/wiki/Trevor_Bones) to meet her and [Baby Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) in Ed's Motel on 14 December, 2041. As it was Bones who laid the foundation for the Seer's defamation of Lindsay, with her initial stories about her, Master Intelligence wanted her to be the one to set the record straight. They were joined by Kellerman, who thought Master Intelligence and Bones were \"the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates she could ever have imagined.\" Bones was initially taken aback that Master Intelligence wanted her to interview Kellerman, but he took her aback by demanding that she only write exactly what Lindsay said and not portray her as the rest of the press was. Bones claimed the Seer would not buy the story, reluctantly admitting that the government was influencing it. Master Intelligence told her that the interview would be printed in the magazine, and although Bones responded with disdain, she eyed Master Intelligence shrewdly for a few moments and then agreed. However, when she learned she was expected to conduct the interview free of charge, from the very people the campaign was against, she was furious. In response, Master Intelligence blackmailed Bones with the threat of reporting her support of [Whammo Fireball](/wiki/Whammo_Fireball)'s notorious cheating during the skyraces to the government, so Maranda Bones grudgingly complied and wrote the article. Finally, Master Intelligence and Lindsay Kellerman were both brought to a trial, on the public pressure that they were innocent. In a further attempt to discredit Lindsay, the government changed the time and location of the trial at the last minute, but thanks to Master Intelligence, the two were able to make it there just minutes late. Ultimately, they were exonerated with help from Sebiscuits Cardarphen, who had a witness and legal loopholes to help him summon [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom). Master Intelligence was so delighted that he kissed Cardarphen's cheek four times. With Master Intelligence's credibility realized once more, Robbie Evans' was permanently lost. Master Intelligence demanded that Evans disband the campaign and revert the damage. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Heroism of the S.M.S.B.[ ] A continued crisis[ ] Near the beginning of September, Master Intelligence learned from [Jena Ort](/wiki/Jena_Ort) that Tori Newell had discharged from Canyon Secure Center, only to run away again, presumably with her thuggish boyfriend [Stanley](/wiki/Stanley). At some point in mid-September, Master Intelligence divulged this information to [Captain Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) to ease his pupil's disconcertion and they lamented over the reliability of Lincoln Strafford, with Baby Strength suggesting he join the S.M.S.B., which clearly made Master Intelligence uncomfortable. Unbeknownst to them, Tori and Stanley were actually very close to the mansion, with Tori debating if she should let Master Intelligence know where she is, before ultimately deciding not to and fleeing with her boyfriend. Later that month, Crystal enrolled in Central Park East High School. She did not visit the MBH frequently, though she still spent several nights there. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Banishing Crystal[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject.

Lives are at stake.\" \"So?\" \"You're being a really bad friend, to her and me bo \u2014 wait... are you yawning during my questioning?\" \"Maybe...\" \"Leave my home at once. Go to your abusive kin, and rot. You will be welcome when you see fit to answer my questions, even if you wait until you're old and grey.\" - Master Intelligence and Crystal [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_The_Return_of_the_Verasect) On October 1, Master Intelligence sent Baby Strength to a meeting. Unable to bring him there in person due to being busy elsewhere, he asked Jena to bring him there, something she agreed to do. However, after the meeting, he was alarmed when Baby Strength divulged Jena's claim that when Tori Newell disappeared, an undisclosed individual divulged Crystal with valuable information that no one else received. On October 2, Master Intelligence confronted and interrogated Crystal. However, Crystal was very uncooperative and provided no information whatsoever, even when he emphasized to her that lives were at risk. After Master Intelligence deduced she was trying to shut down the conversation, he stood up and angrily sent her out of the MBH for good to be left at the mercy of her abusive kin, citing that she was welcome as soon as she saw fit to answer his questions \"even if you wait until you're old and grey\". Eventually, Master Intelligence began keeping tabs on [Stanley](/wiki/Stanley), hoping to bring him to justice. Much later, Baby Strength made a On October 30, 2041, Master Intelligence suggested that [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe) teach [Captain Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) how to make turkey hamburgers. During dinner, Telekinibabe suggested that Master Intelligence have a cooking class so that all the members of the S.M.S.B. could learn how to feed themselves too. He put this into consideration, although it would be over a year before this was done. After dinner, [Crystal](/wiki/Crystal) came over to the MBH and Master Intelligence and Baby Strength helped her pick out a costume from their old collection. Unfortunately, [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl) contracted a mild case of darilitis and could not participate. Crystal also ended up wearing [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby)'s vinyl puppy ears. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Halloween[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | In the morning on Halloween, Baby Strength prepared to trick-or-treat with Crystal and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby). In the morning, he went with Master Intelligence went to extract the [Enforcer](/wiki/Enforcer) and thank [Jena Ort](/wiki/Jena_Ort) for concealing it. Now in the vehicle, he took Baby Strength, who was accompanying him, to a doctor to test Baby Strength's Intelligence Quotient and give him a full medical checkup. He later learned that Stanley had been mean to Baby Strength and changed his mind about expecting him to keep tabs on the gangster. In the evening, Crystal \"flaked out\", cancelling her plans to trick-or-treat with him, Baby Strength, and [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby). He revealed to a frustrated Baby Strength, who proceeded to contact Jena Ort and learn that she was ready for trick-or-treating. Arriving at their house, he met Tori Newell's brothers, Brad and Chris Ort, as well as [Dustin Ort](/wiki/Dustin_Ort), whom his apprentice had communicated with via texting but had never met in person. When the family approached a particularly decorated house with a boom box in the shadows making scary noises, he held the hand of [Lily Ort](/wiki/Lily_Ort) to comfort the nervous toddler, though she also held Baby Strength's hand. About halfway through trick-or-treating, Master Intelligence departed for a conference meeting, promising to return. Shortly before Lindsay Kellerman's birthday, Master Intelligence pointed out to a currently irate Kellerman that would be the last time he hugged her when she was eleven, but Kellerman shrugged it off. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Meeting Cassie Ort[ ] - \"Remember when we came over on the sixteenth of November and brought some old clothes? Cassie must've been taught to be wary of strangers, because she was really quiet, even when we had to stop the dogs from running away.\" - [Captain Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_The_Return_of_the_Verasect) On November 16, Master Intelligence and [Captain Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength) visited Crystal, at which point she revealed she actually knew far less about Tori Newell's recent whereabouts than she had been suspected to, though when she told them [Stanley](/wiki/Stanley) had bugged her again asking where she was, Master Intelligence told her Tori was with her father again. He told Crystal she had passed the test and invited her back into the MBH. However, Crystal declined, bravely choosing to pursue her financial and educational goals, instead of hiding from her abusive family. Impressed, Master Intelligence and Baby Strength proceeded to stop by [the Orts' residence](/wiki/House) in order to give them some old clothes. However, one of Tori Newell's siblings, Cassie Ort, was very wary of them, having had no idea who they are. As a result, she hesitated to bring the gifts inside or even answer the door. She also had to chase down the [dogs](/wiki/Dogs) when they escaped through the open doorway, something Master Intelligence presumably helped her accomplish. On Thanksgiving, the S.M.S.B. ate together after Master Intelligence cooked for two days straight, receiving occasional assistance from [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe). [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Reunion with Tori Newell[ ] On December 7, Master Intelligence, Baby Strength, and Titanium Girl stopped by [Crystal](/wiki/Crystal)'s house so they could give her make-up kits for her birthday. She informed them that [Rose Johannson](/wiki/Rose_Johannson) stood trial before the Mutamon, and while many people vouched for her, Tori Newell did not, though she had come looking for her, only to realize Johannson was already home. They realized the Orts lived in the same area, so while Baby Strength messaged the Orts, Master Intelligence drew his sword and used a rock to sharpen it. Jena Ort responded that they were just putting up Christmas decorations and that they were welcome to drop by and help out. Upon arriving, Master Intelligence was alarmed to see Tori Newell again, as he had assumed she was with her father and they had not seen each other at all since Independence Day. He proceeded to socialize with Jena and help put up Christmas decorations. After the S.M.S.B. members left, a boy came over and went to hang out with her. Like the S.M.S.B. members, he had not seen Tori in months, which made her emphasize with how much all of them missed her. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Meeting Ted Newell[ ] Baby Strength assembled Christmas gifts for Tori Newell and her family, which he informed her of. Master Intelligence learned of this and informed Ted, since Tori was spending most of her time at his house. On Christmas, he visited her parents and siblings. Afterwards, Master Intelligence realized that the Enforcer was low on fuel and they could not visit her father as planned. He relayed this news to Baby Strength. On January 2, Master Intelligence and Baby Strength were finally able to pay Tori and [Ted Newell](/wiki/Ted_Newell) a visit and give her her present. She received a toy with two candy canes, and a young adults' novel. After she introduced Master Intelligence and his apprentice to her father's pets, Master Intelligence spent several minutes getting to know Ted, while Baby Strength spent a while speaking with Tori. Finally, Master Intelligence interjected and asked if Tori was going back to school, to which she explained that she and her father were looking into getting her a GED and getting her a new Social Security Card, since her old one was lost. After discussing heavy metal, which Master Intelligence admitted he had never been a fan of, Ted introduced Baby Strength to his collection of Game of Thrones memorabilia. Master Intelligence had a quick word with Tori until Master Intelligence asked Newell to go fetch Baby Strength so they could leave and pick up [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl). He asked Tori to go and fetch Baby Strength, and they departed the city.

You can help out by providing additional information and | In November 2042, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) reported that she had gotten her revenge against [Trevor Bones](/wiki/Trevor_Bones) by trapping him in a pit with very few supplies to sustain him. Master Intelligence found himself surprisingly satisfied. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Antarctica[ ] Hoping to lure Hell Burnbottom into the open, Master Intelligence planned a field trip to [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica). In the night, he traveled there himself and found a comfortable resort for travelers. He asked the woman in charge how much it would cost to rent a space there in two days' advance, but she claimed it was free. He asked if he could stay there with the other members, and the woman replied with a simple \"Fine by me.\" Returning to New York City, Master Intelligence made fliers to inform everyone of the event and handed them out before beginning class. The next day, all the members flew there together. On the way there, he spoke with Lincoln on the phone. When they exited the Pinewood Derby, Red X complained that it was freezing, and Master Intelligence inquired to what she had expected otherwise. After exploring their surroundings and spending several hours observing penguins, Master Intelligence led the others inside, where they encountered a polar bear who had managed to get inside. Master Intelligence failed to defeat them after missing a slash and being attacked from behind. Fortunately, Sebisucits managed to take down the beast before checking on Master Intelligence. After the trip, Master Intelligence tested the members' knowledge before announcing the beginning of a cooking class.

Later, they fought in the [Battle of New York](/wiki/Battle_of_New_York). Master Intelligence was alarmed when he realized [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom) was on his side; Titanium Girl had been right all along. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Arrival on Venus[ ] - \"Even in the midst of chaos, I find a good game of dodgeball restores the senses. Everyone, time to pick a team. You too, Ironside.\" - Master Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_The_Return_of_the_Verasect) About a month later, the group began to play dodgeball together. Just as the game began, Sebiscuits had a vision predicting that only he could defeat the Umbralord. Sebiscuits declared to Master Intelligence and Lindsay that he would risk his life to stop the NoHeads personally, and left the MBH in his skyfighter. Distraught and confused, Master Intelligence left with Lindsay, who returned to the gym. After the game ended, the leader of the S.M.S.B. went to meditate on the subsequent battle. He became devastated at the odds and quickly took action, rallying the other members in a desperate rescue mission. Upon leaving the MBH for Bast Castle, the group was attacked by over thirty robotic fighters. Master Intelligence rode in his skyfighter, and he was attacked by multiple fighters and eventually Hell Burnbottom himself. Burnbottom, using his ability to fly, went straight for Master Intelligence. When the NoHead caught up with him, Intelligence fired the afterburners, blasting off toward Bast Castle and spraying rocket fire at his quarry. Burnbottom then went after Baby Strength and Red X, who were fighting side-by-side. Red X thought this was the end, but then her hand suddenly fired lightning at him, destroying his metal tube during the battle. Burnbottom prepared to attack Baby Strength, but Master Intelligence intervened and forced the antagonist to retreat. He then landed in the base, with Red X and all the skyfighters close behind. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Battling the Apostles[ ] When the Umbralord and his army approached with a dead Sebiscuits Cardarphen, Master Intelligence screamed in horror and denial. However, Sebiscuits came back to life that very moment and jumped out of the Umbralord's arms. The Battle of Bast Castle soon resumed, and Master Intelligence fought in the following battle. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Fall of the Apostles[ ] Tracking Lindsay to the construction site, Master Intelligence found her dueling the Umbralord, but struggling to block his terrible power attacks. Subsequently an intense duel of powers erupted between all three mutants; arguably the most powerful of their time. They all displayed a deep talent, though the Umbralord was ultimately forced to flee the battle after [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom) joined the fight and deflected a series of shards, and Master Intelligence imprisoned him within a dome of water. As the Umbralord fled, he briefly possessed Lindsay, hoping that Master Intelligence would sacrifice the teenager in an attempt to kill him. However, Red X, who had left briefly, returned with the famed ethereal ore and hit the Umbralord with a fatal beam from his own weapon. The Umbralord disappeared into oblivion from the violent impact. He and Sebiscuits had a heartfelt conversation and Sebiscuits used the ethereal ore to completely heal his grievous injuries and burns, enabling him to be whole again. Master Intelligence was pleased to learn the three remaining Elites had all gone down as well. When everyone returned to the MBH, Master Intelligence had a talk with Lindsay Kellerman and Red X in the bunkers. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) After the war[ ] An adjustment period[ ] Eventually, Master Intelligence started a yearbook with Lindsay Kellerman, finishing it in time for him to have her give Red X a copy prior to her departure for the summer. His first yearbook award was \"brightest\". [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Shortly after she left, Master Intelligence recovered the [Device of Teleportation](/wiki/Arts) after he found it in the dirt, presumably hidden. He subsequently used it to teleport into Bast Castle, hoping to see if anyone was captured and being held there. He rescued the two that he found, [George Thames II](/wiki/George_Thames_II) and [Robbie Evans](/wiki/Robbie_Evans), subsequently saving them from starvation. [[30]](#cite_note-30) In August, Master Intelligence went to a resevoir with Titanium Girl, her sister Raeanne Hawkins, and [Ted Newell](/wiki/Ted_Newell). Things took an ugly shift when Raeanne lost her car keys, causing Master Intelligence to reportedly have an emotional breakdown, yet Ted proved integral in resolving the problem so everyone could come home. He and Ted hung out afterwards, with him going to work in the morning while Master Intelligence continued to recline on the couch. Upon rising from the cushions, Master Intelligence cleaned the entire house, reaching under the filthy stove and cleaning out the grime-covered rafters. When he left, he borrowed an ice bucket from Ted, intending to return it soon. However, Ted came home and, rather than thanking the superhero for cleaning his house, he furiously accused him of stealing his simple container. Master Intelligence was very hurt by this and told Raeanne that while he would continue to do his best to ensure the children were in good hands, he would never trust Ted again. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Two years later, in 2045, Master Intelligence received wind that Nagatha had come back to life. Whilst trying to get to the bottom of it, Master Intelligence, alone, met the Gladiator for the first time. Realizing the Gladiator was too dangerous to be left alive, he drew his sword and attempted to cut him down, but to no avail, as the Gladiator Deteleported away with Nagatha. Master Intelligence immediately realized it was the Gladiator who had brought Nagatha back from the dead. [[31]](#cite_note-BTS3-31) Throughout the year of 2046, Master Intelligence passed on certain pieces of information to Red X that would be important for the girl about the NoHeads, hoping to catch her up with the other members. Master Intelligence held private lessons with her. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Attempted rescue of Alicia[ ] Later on, Master Intelligence encountered the Gladiator when he moved to capture [Alicia](/wiki/Alicia) of the [Fobble Revolution](/wiki/Fobble_Revolution). After calling Red X back, Master Intelligence engaged the Gladiator in a duel. The Gladiator, however, parried his initial attack and then tortured Master Intelligence and tried to possess him for good, but when it didn't work, he tried to murder him using his sword. The nature of their swords' mystical connection caused their swords to interlock with the first attack, which created an effect called Pitial Defilatelum (Bladelock Effect). After a battle of wills with the Gladiator, Master Intelligence was interceded by Red X, who blasted the Gladiator away. She then grabbed Master Intelligence's hand and they were able to escape, being forced to relinquish Alicia yet falsely assuming the [Knights of Plague](/wiki/Knights_of_Plague) had done the same. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) [Genesis' offensive](/wiki/War_of_Jupiter)[ ] Discovering Andromeda[ ] When Alyssa Smith, who already knew she did not belong, discovered her powers, she immediately asked her father if she could join the S.M.S.B., knowing this must be her destiny. That same day, Alyssa's father called in and asked if Alyssa could join the S.M.S.B. After packing up, her father drove her to the MBH and she asked if she could apply. Master Intelligence began testing her memory and knowledge, beginning by asking her several questions, such as why she wanted to join. He then gave her an IQ test and a social quiz of his own design. When she passed these, he began to test Alyssa's abilities through several vigorous exercises, including an obstacle course. When Andromeda managed to complete these, her maturity was tested on a computer. Afterwards, she passed and was introduced to the other S.M.S.B. members. She also took the nickname of Andromeda. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Four days later, Master Intelligence's former Crodela Team Captain [Ammon Dorber](/wiki/Ammon_Dorber) arrived to release the contents of Carol Dorber's will, doubly revealing that she was dead. Master Intelligence was left a Giggel-themed backpack. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Andromeda did her best to train with the other members, but she was quickly failing in the exercises. As such, Master Intelligence resolved to teach her alone. However, Andromeda proved herself after Nagatha attacked the MBH and she drove her off before killing her. Her spirits raised, Andromeda began to improve on the training exercises. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) [Mission to Transylvania Quarters](/wiki/Mission_to_Transylvania_Quarters)[ ] After Lindsay Kellerman saw a [vision](/wiki/Vision) of the Gladiator preparing to unleash the Grand Nuke, an electrical bomb with the capacity to destroy the entire continent once it was released, Master Intelligence led the S.M.S.B. to Transylvania Quarters. After reaching Transylvania Quarters, Master Intelligence led them all through various rooms in search of the bomb, without finding it. The group became doubtful until they came across the [Court of Domination](/wiki/Court_of_Domination), a room filled with artifacts. One of the artifacts was what everyone presumed to be the [Orb of Power](/wiki/Orb_of_Power), which Telekinibabe seized. He handed it to Master Intelligence; the latter's fears were justified when the Gladiator revealed it was all a ruse to bring them there, but maintained that the Grand Nuke was real. Chaos ensued, Master Intelligence was constantly assaulted since he was holding the Orb. He was forced to order a retreat into the Death Chamber, but not before telekinetically smashing the shelves, distracting the Knights of Plague. Upon meeting up with the others, Master Intelligence realized that Kellerman had the Orb of Power. While the members regrouped, the Knights of Plague swooped down and attacked, capturing everyone except Kellerman and rounding them up before tying them. As Master Intelligence struggled, the Gladiator told Kellerman she had two choices: to hand over the orb, or watch the others die. Finally, Kellerman handed the orb to the Gladiator, who pocketed it triumphantly. The Gladiator then proceeded to reveal the Grand Nuke. Red X managed to break free and leap in front of the bomb, causing it to hit her instead and sacrificing herself in the process. The bomb never got past her torso, but it gave her a slow, painful death. The villain did not have any more bombs to launch. Meanwhile, Master Intelligence and his allies were freed by Baby Strength, and the battle resumed. Most of the members attempted to escape, though a few stayed to fight. However, Master Intelligence insisted they couldn't leave without Andromeda and Sebiscuits Cardarphen. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) [Battle of Jupiter](/wiki/Battle_of_Jupiter)[ ] The Gladiator moved in to attack the members, but Master Intelligence leaped upward, knocking him away and attacking the villain, reclaiming his sword. This resulted in a fierce fistfight between the two powerful mutants, only intensifying when the Gladiator returned to the platform and reclaimed his exomace, at which point Master Intelligence seized an electric guitar and the two faced off, this time with their instruments, thanks to the delicate intricacy of the Gladiator's attunement with his Irish instrument. The Gladiator's exomace retracted into his iconic bagpipes and began playing with remarkable vigor. Master Intelligence's skills were easily surpassed and he was overwhelmed by the Gladiator's solo. With one powerful blast, he knocked Master Intelligence away, severely damaging Master Intelligence's electric guitar in the process. Just as Master Intelligence was about to fall off the platform and into Jupiter's gaseous abyss, Lindsay Kellerman pulled Master Intelligence on top and Master Intelligence levitated the Gladiator there. Meanwhile, the remaining members wiped out most of the Knights, at the cost of Andromeda's life. Master Intelligence turned to face the survivors, rounding them up and capturing them since they were afraid of dueling him. Master Intelligence quickly rounded up numerous Knights of Plague, announcing their capture. The Gladiator was later locked in a prison he himself had built to hold his enemies. Everybody regretted Red X's death, but as a result of it everybody else survived. Eventually, Master Intelligence buried Red X next to Paige. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Discovering Centauri[ ] After defeating the Gladiator, Master Intelligence returned to New York City full of bitter resentment at his situation, feeling trapped and wasted. Fortune finally shone on Intelligence in the form of [Thomas Meyer](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer), who was at the home of Myra Gordon to research the Sword of Abomination. Meyer was as talented as Master Intelligence was. Master Intelligence quickly became fascinated by Meyer's ideas of domination, obviously considering Thomas an unexpected new chance to show his own brilliance and come out of the local misery. Eventually, Thomas joined the S.M.S.B. and took the name of Centauri. Before they left, Master Intelligence took Maranda Bones' book about him, titled \"Master Intelligence: Saint or Fraud?\". It is unknown to whether he kept it. Master Intelligence came to regret his relationship with Centauri later in life. They began a quest to locate the Sword and become its true masters. Skirmish in the MBH[ ] After Master Intelligence and Centauri returned to the MBH, [Ramona Meyer](/wiki/Ramona_Meyer), unbeknownst to Master Intelligence, the Dark Woman and a member of the Knights of Plague, Deteleported to the front of the MBH, where Sebiscuits Cardarphen confronted her. Somehow, she still managed to get inside. Unfortunately, Centauri accidentally released three zerads. The zerads began causing mayhem, but Centauri was caught by one and dragged around the halls. Suddenly, the Dark Woman Apparated into the hall and was able to shut a door on the zerad, crushing it and freeing Centauri. She then made quick work of the other two. Master Intelligence introduced himself to her, who introduced herself by her given name of Ramona and revealed that she came to wish Centauri luck. Master Intelligence then invited her to dinner, and she agreed. During the meal, Ramona attempted to defend that several Knights of Plague survived, and insisted they will not be a threat. She also suggested that Charity Hirz's hologram pit be moved to the t and i Factory for safekeeping, something Master Intelligence agreed with. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Age of prosperity[ ] Marrying Sebiscuits Cardarphen and building an industry[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | - \"All right, so in that case, what is today's topic? It is my childhood dreams and how I have achieved them. In that way, I have been very fortunate indeed. How I believe I have been able to enable the dreams of others. As a professor, there should be some lessons learned and how you can use the stuff you hear today to achieve your dreams or just as pertinently enable the dreams of others. And as you get older, you may find that enabling the dreams of your fellows merits even more enjoyment and gratification.\" - Master Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat) The following two decades were a relatively calm and prosperous time in Master Intelligence's life when he began creating industry. He also made occasional visits to [Superhero School](/wiki/Superhero_School) to give lectures to the students as a guest of honor. Master Intelligence also spent a lot of time with Ramona and came to realize that she was one of his best friends. In 2059, Master Intelligence and the other S.M.S.B. members went swimming. He also began giving lectures at [Superhero School](/wiki/Superhero_School), one of which involved the concept of enabling the dreams of one's fellow men. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Filming with Rocken Role[ ] - \"Master Intelligence, talented and unassuming, gives the movie its spine and soul, just like our town.\" - A. O. Scott, The New York Times [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat) In 2060, Master Intelligence portrayed rock star [Rocken Role](/wiki/Rocken_Role) in \"Shipped to Hell\", a fictional film about Rocken Role and Rebecca Black becoming friends and having to escape hell together with Master Intelligence's help that was from writer-director Gloria Sigismond. Master Intelligence met with Role over the 2060-61 New Year to prepare for the role; he prerecorded songs in a studio for the film. The successful film also premiered at the 2062 Moonwalk Film Festival on January 24 2062. Master Intelligence, Rocken Role, and Role's partner Wesley Carrier appeared at the festival for the company's promotion. [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe) and [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) were also present here. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Master Intelligence received praise for his performance: the Metro Times wrote, \"It turns out that Master Intelligence is actually really good at acting as well as crime-fighting. He excelled at capturing Role's icy, tough-but-cool guy demeanor, adding the needed touches of childishness that transform it into a pretty terrific performance... Intelligence is a genuine star here.\" Also, A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted \"Master Intelligence, talented and unassuming, gives the movie its spine and soul, just like our town.\" The same year, Master Intelligence was paid $10,000 for his movie role in 2061. He shared much of the money with the other members of the S.M.S.B., giving them 300 dollars each (leaving him with $8,200), telling them it's \"yours to do as you wish.\" Stephanie, who had developed something of a crush on Master Intelligence, also remarked that \"I always thought Master Intelligence was a badass, but this brings his swagger into a whole new light.\" Master Intelligence was listed as the number one actor of the year by Billboard. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Mission to the t and i Factory[ ] Ramona Meyer was secretly mounting a rise to power, she was able to search for the [hologram pit](/wiki/Hologram_pit), which she believed would give her power as well as everlasting life. In 2064, Ramona was thwarted by Centauri, with the help of Master Intelligence and the rest of the S.M.S.B. The group suffered a series of exhausting and difficult challenges in the [t and i Factory](/wiki/T_and_i_Factory), in an attempt to stop the pit from being stolen and Ramona rising to power. Throughout the challenges the group was picked off one by one and in the final task, only Master Intelligence and Centauri were left. He got both of them through a challenge involving riddles. Master Intelligence used his logic to figure out the riddle and let Centauri go forward without him, as there was only enough energy for one person. Continuation[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | In 2066, the S.M.S.B. went to a ball that all the mutants had been invited to attend. Everyone found it very enjoyable. Master Intelligence continued training the other members, and opened a rank where members who \"had made it to the top\" had certain privileges, and could help train others. Force Baby was becoming increasingly unstable. Master Intelligence secluded his student from the outside world to keep him safe. Force Baby was sweet and kind, but when he could not control his Kraft connection he became slightly dangerous. Finally, he sent the Kraton to train with individuals in China. The Church of Styricataearetrea[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Locating the Sword of Abomination[ ] In 2069, Master Intelligence was informed by Centauri that the latter had finally learned that the Sword of Abomination was located at [Thames Metalle](/wiki/Thames_Metalle). Master Intelligence insisted that they could not steal the sword from [George Thames II](/wiki/George_Thames_II), who owed him a great debt. This made Centauri furious, though Master Intelligence swiftly curtailed the argument after becoming uncharacteristically angry. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) With the revolution almost ready to go underway regardless of their argument, Master Intelligence grew to suspect that [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl) was losing her grip. To see if he was right, he tested him only to realize that his fears had been justified. Titanium Girl left the organization for good, choosing to remain in the [United States of America](/wiki/United_States_of_America) while her former companions prepared to go to [Asia](/wiki/Asia) without her. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Force Baby dies[ ] - \"You've lost your mind, Centauri! Stop this, while you can!\" - Master Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat) It was at this point that Centauri began to question the reality of the S.M.S.B. He spoke to Master Intelligence about this, who tried to comfort him as they went to check on Baby Strength and Force Baby. Master Intelligence declared he no longer desired the Sword of Abomination, leading to a heated argument that Baby Strength eventually intervened in. Centauri reminded him that he planned to share the Sword of Abomination and world domination with him once both had been acquired. Master Intelligence then said he understood Centauri was turning to evil, refusing to help him any longer. Baby Strength whispered his suggestion to kill Centauri on the spot, and Intelligence told him off again. With that, Centauri lost control and electrocuted Baby Strength, goading Master Intelligence into action. A violent duel erupted between the three men. Master Intelligence deflected telekinetic assaults, fire, and numerous Death beams cast by Centauri and bound him with cords. As Centauri tried to squeeze free, Intelligence drew his sword and held his new enemy at bladepoint, proclaiming he would take him to prison, but at that moment Baby Strength broke the ropes and declared Centauri had to die. The three duelists were counterpoised. As Force Baby watched in horror, their duel continued, with Master Intelligence unleashing withering torrents of kinetic force against Centauri. When Centauri wounded Baby Strength, Master Intelligence was left to fight alone. Both of them immediately fired energy attacks, and their bolts connected again. As the bolts locked together, Intelligence made one last attempt to reason with Centauri, but Centauri did not answer. Force Baby himself tried to intervene in the fight, but couldn't due to his turbulent abilities, and in the ensuing chaos, Master Intelligence made one last attack through the lightning cuffs, leading to Force Baby's death via explosion. No one knew whose attack it was that killed him, but Thomas Meyer already had a bad record back home, leaving the devastated Master Intelligence behind. Baby Strength resented Master Intelligence and their relationship became strained. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) However, as Master Intelligence was educating the other S.M.S.B. members, the Dark Flame was still at large in America, building up an army, and had already found the Sword of Abomination, which he used to terrorize the continent. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) [Asian Revolution](/wiki/Asian_Revolution)[ ] Discovering Retrowoman[ ] In 2071, Master Intelligence and the other members embarked on the [Asian Revolution](/wiki/Asian_Revolution), not knowing Centauri had become the Dark Flame. This mission was intended to strengthen law enforcement in the continent of [Asia](/wiki/Asia), as the country had nearly doubled in its amount of crime since 2041. He also provided covert assistance in discovering the real causes of the ultimate dissolution of the [U.S. Government](/wiki/U.S._Government) itself, being horrified upon learning it had happened yet finding the formation of the [Northern Administration](/wiki/Northern_Administration) a small comfort. During the mission, Master Intelligence encountered a baby girl named [Retrowoman](/wiki/Retrowoman), who requested for an application in the S.M.S.B. and informed him that [George Thames II](/wiki/George_Thames_II) had retired recently. Despite narrowed resources, Master Intelligence tested Retrowoman to see if \"[she was] S.M.S.B. material.\" Retrowoman passed and was made part of the group. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Skirmish in the Palace of Despair[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Near the end of the Asian Revolution, and thirty years after Centauri fled the MBH,, Master Intelligence and the S.M.S.B. were trapped in a landslide. When Master Intelligence emerged from it, he was surprised to find that Rocken Role had just arrived. After a brief talk, Role revealed that his assistant was captured by Mella Mou, and likely killed. Role then left to finish his mission. In the meantime, [Vincent Organa](/wiki/Vincent_Organa) sent [Team of Terror](/wiki/Team_of_Terror) fighter Luke Cameron, the grandson of the acclaimed Saul Cameron, to Rhinebeck to warn [Eegan Grover](/wiki/Eegan_Grover) about an imminent attack by the Dark Flame and recover the Map of Light, which Master Intelligence had left behind unintentionally. Vincent hoped his friend and savior would return and help in the fight against the Darkness. The [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers) also learned of the Map and sought it so they could destroy the mere thread of the Light. Eegan gave the Map to his son, Jason Grover, who in turn gave it to his sister [Britney](/wiki/Britney_Grover), before the Dark Flame and the Knights of Meyer arrived. The Dark Flame killed Eegan and took Jason into custody in the hopes of finding the Map, while Britney and Sue remained at their house. Knowing Mella was the head of a criminal empire in China, Master Intelligence and the S.M.S.B. allowed themselves to be captured so they could reach the Palace of Doom, their enemy's quarters. Mou used the effect of Pitial Defilatelum to see if Master Intelligence's sword had been recovered. Eventually, the others managed to escape capture thanks to the timely intervention of [George Thames II](/wiki/George_Thames_II), though the latter died in the process. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Staying with Rocken Role[ ] Following Thames II's death, Master Intelligence and his companions stayed at Role's house for some time. During their stay, Jason Grover returned and the three siblings teamed with [Fifteen](/wiki/Fifteen), sought to return the Map to the S.M.S.B. After discovering the S.M.S.B. members' current whereabouts, the quartet sneaked a ride on an airplane and flew to North Korea, where they found Master Intelligence at last. Britney presented him with the Map of Light, as a symbol of the only hope that the solar system had left. Master Intelligence took the weapon, promising it would be accepted, before inviting them to come in and explain what had happened. Initially, Master Intelligence was skeptical about their incoherent claims, but after seeing a sudden [vision](/wiki/Vision) of Fifteen being tortured and killed, Master Intelligence discovered the existence of the fanatical and unruly [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers). Horrified at the prospect of what he had left in the middle of, he immediately looked up several things on the [Internet](/wiki/Internet), knowing he had been tricked before by his visions. His research forced him to deduce that upon fleeing the MBH thirty years ago, Thomas Meyer had taken the alias of the Dark Flame and begun his [rise to power](/wiki/Insurrection). His worst fears confirmed, he went to the rest of the S.M.S.B. and informed them of the vision. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) [Shadow Wars](/wiki/Shadow_Wars)[ ] Return to New York City[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | After resting at Rocken Role's house for two nights, the S.M.S.B. returned to the [United States of America](/wiki/United_States_of_America) from Asia, taking a hotel in [Maryland](/wiki/Maryland), as Master Intelligence had just arranged an appointment with Chieftain Damon Alexis of the [Northern Administration](/wiki/Northern_Administration). There, they were visited by the Organa twins. Vincent expressed his sympathy that [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl) had left, although Master Intelligence insisted that he did not expel Hawkins, but that it had been a mutual decision for her to leave. During the meeting that followed, Alexis told him his return was most ideal, and Master Intelligence told him the S.M.S.B. had contracted their fealty to whomever the current Chieftain was. He told Master Intelligence that public opinion had grown considerably that Master Intelligence would be the only one capable of stopping the Unifiers. Master Intelligence, despite still being haunted by his history with the dark mutant, uneasily and vaguely pledged to do what he could. To aid him in his quest, Chieftain Alexis placed a man named Captain Xavier under his charge. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Confronting the Dark Flame[ ] When Knight Captain Photon indicated the location of the MBH, Master Intelligence correctly predicted that an assault on the building was imminent. On his orders, Retrowoman sent a distress call to the Mayor, asking for reinforcements. Suddenly, the Dark Flame called out to the MBH and Aspiration District, promising them a noble death. As the members of the S.M.S.B. prepared to hold off the Dark Flame, the Knights of Meyer launched attacks on the MBH but were kept from entering. Master Intelligence activated the shield generator before everyone came outside. The Dark Flame called off the Knights, the S.M.S.B. fled into a wrecked cruiser. Most of the members were disheartened and believed death to be imminent, but Master Intelligence attempted to calm them and encouraged them to stay focused. As the Dark Flame approached the MBH, a panicked Retrowoman insisted they could not face him, but Intelligence said they had to try. Master Intelligence remained calm and cautious, but Retrowoman panicked and ran out of the ship, where the Dark Flame crushed her to death. The Dark Flame then battled the remaining five S.M.S.B. members simultaneously, using his sword in a form of combat the S.M.S.B. had never faced before. Master Intelligence was nearly struck down, but leaped onto an overhead rafter and launched a powerful telekinetic shove at the Dark Flame. The general dodged the attack, however, and continued his duel with the S.M.S.B., striking down Baby Strength and killing Telekinibabe. After the Dark Flame hurled Kellerman away, Master Intelligence and Sebiscuits attacked from either side of the general, but the Dark Flame kicked Intelligence, and sent him hurling into nearby wreckage, where he dropped his sword. As the Dark Flame disarmed and nearly killed Sebiscuits Cardarphen, Master Intelligence fought himself free and tried to summon his sword back, but the revolutionist grabbed it. Desperate to protect his husband, Master Intelligence knocked the Dark Flame to his feet and retook his weapon, then dropped through the unstable ground to a cavern underneath just as the Dark Flame leaped toward him. The two dueled for several more minutes, which left the S.M.S.B. Grand Master exhausted and his shirt torn. The Dark Flame disarmed Intelligence and was about to strike him down when a company of NA reinforcements led by Captain Xavier arrived. Master Intelligence leaped away as the troops opened fire, forcing the Dark Flame to take cover. Master Intelligence tried to insist they pursue the Dark mutant, but the captain said they did not have time and the surviving S.M.S.B. members would die if they stayed. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Jorvian Asylum[ ] |This section of the article does not provide a complete profile of the subject. You can help out by providing additional information and | Master Intelligence hesitantly returned to the troops' gunship, where he was horrified to find Cardarphen and Kellerman were on life support and the other S.M.S.B. members were presumed dead. The gunship escaped the city, picked up a few friends, and flew to the Jorvian Assylum to meet with a very old friend, Sheriff Dynamo's successor. However, the recent carnage had a profound effect on Master Intelligence's optimism, with their failure to stop the Dark Flame causing him to take on a darker and somewhat grim persona. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) Four years after the [Attack at the Acquisition District](/wiki/Attack_at_the_Acquisition_District), Master Intelligence remained with the S.M.S.B., while also working at a support group for those who were seeking refuge in the asylum. Despite the destruction caused by the [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers), [Sol](/wiki/Sol) was slowly recovering thanks to the [Team of Terror](/wiki/Team_of_Terror), and Master Intelligence urged his support group to talk about their lives. In the meantime, [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl) assumed a very similar role at the asylum. While someone at the support group was talking about their second honeymoon and how they were effected by the [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers), Master Intelligence accepted on letting his sadness sympathize with others. Master Intelligence noted to the rest of the group that they must take baby steps in trying to find purpose, leading an example of having himself being stuck in [outer space](/wiki/Earthly_Plane) in 2029 before he was given purpose by the currently defunct [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army). Master Intelligence concluded that they must move on, as the solar system was in the hands of the new generation. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Returning to the warfield[ ] In November of 2099, Master Intelligence decided to use more underhanded means to undermine members of the [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers). Even after leaving the persona of \"Master Intelligence\" behind, however, he still took it upon himself to aid whomever he could in whatever way he could. Together, he and the S.M.S.B. went to the [Defilement](/wiki/Defilement) early in 2100 and rescued several members of the Team of Terror, including [Jay Organa](/wiki/Jay_Organa), several months after returning to the larger picture. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) At some point around this time, Master Intelligence was visited by the [Ruby Eidolon](/wiki/Ruby_Eidolon), [[33]](#cite_note-Prelude-33) who had seen him decades ago and confessed that he had caught her attention as a type of human being she could not identify, wondering if he was a teenage midget from [Saturn](/wiki/Saturn). [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) She asked him where [Eegan Grover](/wiki/Eegan_Grover) was, [[33]](#cite_note-Prelude-33) so he confessed that Grover had died over a decade ago. Believing the [Map of Light](/wiki/Map_of_Light) would be safer in her hands, he gave it to her, a decision which did not rub off well with [Titanium Girl](/wiki/Titanium_Girl), although she reluctantly agreed not to tell anyone, although [Hardy](/wiki/Hardy), who was also sworn to secrecy, thought his master had made a good choice. In the mix, Master Intelligence, whilst traveling in disguise, met an impoverished woman named Macy and her mute daughter, Juniper. In exchange for shelter, he begins fixing several parts of their house, during which time he bonded with Juniper and teaches her how to read and taught them both to learn to appreciate their metahuman powers. However, this causes her to realize he is in fact Master Intelligence, and so he offered them both a chance to join the S.M.S.B., and while they eventually accepted, they wanted him to convince Baby Strength to teach Juniper kung fu. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Skirmish in the Eadochas[ ] At some point in the late 2120s, Master Intelligence tracked one of the Dark Flame's most valuable relics to a cave. Upon arriving, he learned that the Dark Flame had placed many powerful defenses around the cave; however, Master Intelligence proved skilful enough to pass through them unharmed. When he found the relic, a top hat holding a [serum](/wiki/Serum) made from what he believed to be [Mercurian](/wiki/Mercury) rock dust, he saw that the serum was not wet, despite being liquid. Master Intelligence placed his hand into the hat, hoping to see how to get rid of the serum or determine what it did to begin with. The serum quickly vaporized his hand and proceeded to spread, and were it not for his own prodigious talents, he would have disintegrated within moments. Despite this injury, Master Intelligence proceeded to destroy the hat. Master Intelligence quickly returned to the MBH, where the skills of [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) managed to trap the liquid that had sunk into the superhero's pores, in his charred, handless wrist. However, both Kellerman and Master Intelligence knew that it would eventually spread to the rest of his body. Knowing that he would die in a few years, Master Intelligence reminded Kellerman that a century ago, he had promised she would lead the S.M.S.B. in his stead, and he asked her if she was ready for the burden, making her gasp. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) [Duel with the Dark Flame](/wiki/Showdown_in_the_MBH)[ ] - \"Who is the joke on now, shellhead?\" \"Still me.\" - Master Intelligence and the Dark Flame [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_New_Order) As the Dark Flame gained power, public opinion grew that Master Intelligence would be the only one able to stop him. Master Intelligence, still haunted by his history with the dark mutant, procrastinated. Eventually, the outcry became too vocal and the Dark Flame's actions too horrible for Intelligence to put off the confrontation any longer. In April of 2130, the Dark Flame discovered the plans for the MBH. He broke in to steal it. When he was alerted of this, Master Intelligence knew this moment that the duel had to be fought. Lindsay fired at the Dark Flame but the revolutionist telekinetically hurled her against a wall, temporarily knocking her out. Sebiscuits engaged the Dark Flame in a sword duel, but he was bested by the Knight and left critically injured. Lindsay drew her sword. She engaged the Dark Flame in combat and spent part of the duel in retreat, defending herself against the Dark Flame's advances. Eventually, Lindsay moved onto the offensive, raining down hard. However, the Dark Flame remained in control and regained the offensive, delivering several blows against Lindsay until he finally disarmed her and slashed her across the face. Master Intelligence intervened and engaged the revolutionist at close quarters. The resulting three-hour long battle, fought with both swords and superpowers, was one of the most well known duels in the solar system. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Death[ ] Upon being disarmed, Master Intelligence remembered what they were fighting for and apted to talk his former friend out of his destruction. After a brief moment of emotional struggle, the Dark Flame activated the weapon and brought it down on Lindsay. However, Master Intelligence leaped in front of Lindsay and it passed through his chest instead. As Lindsay and Sebiscuits watched in horror, the Dark Flame slammed Intelligence's corpse through the window for a five-story fall, dying at the age of one hundred ten. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Legacy[ ] - \"Sebiscuits and I will be with you, always.\" - Master Intelligence [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_New_Order) Master Intelligence awakened in a limbo-like state, being joined only a few minutes later by [Thomas Meyer](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer), whom [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) had slain in vengeance. He told him that the Dark Flame had died so Thomas Meyer could live. The two made their peace before proceeding forward, in two very different directions, both accepting their respective defeats as well as the concept of going to the afterlife, neither of them knowing what lay ahead. Back on the [Earthly Plane](/wiki/Earthly_Plane), a funeral was held for him, attended by members of the S.M.S.B., administration officials (including the Chieftain, who was Arcus Priscilla), centaurs, New York City residents including Master Intelligence's descendant Irma, Merpeople, [Sue Grover](/wiki/Sue_Grover), Madam Nelly of the robe shop in [Merchant Park](/wiki/Merchant_Park), as well as many other mutants and Fobbles. The ceremony took place sometime in May of 2130. After his death, Lindsay Kellerman became the new leader of the S.M.S.B., [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) as she had been promised over a century before. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) Several years later, Master Intelligence's death still haunted Sebiscuits Cardarphen. The widower still mourned his loss and had frequent hallucinations and nightmares of him. Master Intelligence \"visited\" Cardarphen multiple times before he moved on from his [death](/wiki/Death). By the 2170s, all the members of the S.M.S.B. had died, including Master Intelligence. Sebiscuits Cardarphen's final apprentice, [Matthew](/wiki/Matthew), had been assigned to continue the cause. The child felt as if he could not go on alone, but Master Intelligence, along with Cardarphen, appeared as a ghost and assured him they would always be with him, if not physically. He and Sebiscuits told Matthew where to start. With their instruction, he became the leader of the [New Order](/wiki/New_Order). [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) [Alternate Universe](/wiki/Mutantry-4444)[ City Volcano](/wiki/Skirmish_in_the_City_Volcano), [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen) drove Baby Intelligence onto a collection arm, where he forced the baby to lose his footing. Falling towards the lava, Baby Intelligence projected a Shield at the bottom, but he simply rolled off of it and into the magma to his death. Kneeling down, Cardarphe wept for his former friend. Without their leader, [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman) and her friends were left in disarray, and they were forced to go on the run. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Physical description[ ] As a baby, Baby Intelligence was described to be at the expected height and weight for his age. He was almost always seen in a grey-and-black supersuit with an orange-dotted 'i' that stood for \"intelligence\". He also wore a cap binding decorative glasses that were shaped like a mask. On occasion, however, he wore a surprisingly decorative robe while within the walls of the MBH, colored red. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) During his police training, he wore a standard officer uniform. It came with a rank bar, which consisted of translucent colored plastic tiles mounted on a metal bar, worn on the left side of the tunic over his heart. The rank bar corners were hard angle or slightly rounded. The color, quantity, and combinations of the tiles and bars were determined by rank. Although the bar was approximately half an inch in height, the length was determined by his current rank. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) He was sixty-six centimeters tall and weighed ten kilograms. As a teenager, he was much taller and no longer wore the cap. Instead he had slightly bushy tan hair. By 2094, he had a crooked nose that looked as if it had been broken at least twice. Baby Strength's punch during their friend's funeral played a role in shaping his nose. By the time he was one hundred years of age, his hair was white and beginning to fall out. It is unknown how he cured his eyesight. Personality and traits[ ] - \"No one remains a preteen forever. It is we who have the decision between vacancy and intellectualism, illness and health, poverty and wealth, disfavor and popularity, grief and joy. It is we who control these factors in the long term, while others control it merely in the short term if at all.\" \"Easy words for you, dude, who has guidance we don't, and an IQ people would kill for.\" \"I believe you will find guidance will come to anybody who merits it. Now, what do you think I mean by this? Oh, look at the time. That question is today's homework, three paragraphs, to top marks, everyone!\" - Master Intelligence and an unamed fourth year at Superhero School [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat) Baby Intelligence's most noted trait was, clearly, his intelligence, something he himself firmly believed he possessed. He had a tremendously brilliant supergenius mind, quite possibly the greatest mind in the star system (in many ways considerably intellectually superior to even most geniuses), which is stunted as much as it is enhanced by his enormously high morality, making Baby Intelligence as righteous as he was intelligent. In his first week alone, he learned how to read and speak, and when he was a month old he destroyed an evil robotic giant and survived an encounter with [Kenzie Walters](/wiki/Kenzie_Walters), and within the next few months was living by himself in a partially completed mansion seeking to bring together a team of young superheroes, having always believed that an adult would have wanted to do everything their own way. Apart from his superhumanly rapid child development, Baby Intelligence was a quick learner, becoming literate and an advanced swordsman in a very short period of time. He used his prodigious wit to get him out of several sticky situations, such as when he cut a huge hole out of a wall with his sword and used it as a makeshift sled to slide down the better portion of a mountain. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) His Intelligence Quotient (or IQ) was 295 as an infant, a substantial and unprecedented number, though as an adult it was only 226. [[34]](#cite_note-DITS-34) Considered by many as the star system's greatest superhero, and slowly accepted by those who had doubted him for his youth and relative naivety, Baby Intelligence, apart from his phenonemal wunderkind genius, has always been defined by his courage, patriotism, and righteousness. Baby Intelligence was born with and died with a noble and honest spirit, inevitably having absolutely no tolerance towards injustice, abuses of power, and especially slavery and the ways of Dark mutants. Since he grew up being heavily burdened and frequently underestimated by those who mattered, he learned on his own that true strength is having the courage to fight against abuse, no matter one's power, and having compassion for the innocent. Due to his famed exploits and his continued works to save the Eight Worlds, Baby Intelligence was generally respected by many, and slowly accepted by those who had doubted him for his youth and relative naivety; even if he didn't seek acknowledgment for his deeds. Although he was not a murderer, he was also not above killing murderous and evil individuals who went against him or his values. While he was gradually a nice and calm person, Baby Intelligence definitely had a dark side concerning his intolerance for misbehavior. To his students, he could appear as either very strict or like a grandfatherly figure, testing them to mental and physical extremities one moment and showing warmth and kindness the next. To all his pupils, who he loved with all his heart, he was exceptionally humble and strict. He never forced them to do anything he was not willing to do himself. His devotion to the [Light](/wiki/Light) was irrevocable, and he had incredible wisdom far beyond his years. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) - \"Baby Intelligence was a stern teacher, but only because he felt [his students'] defiance and confusion.\" - [Sebiscuits: Apocalypse](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Apocalypse) That said, he was a deeply compassionate and empathetic superhero, speaking reasonably with beings of terrifying power, and embracing his pupils and striving to treat them equally. Bruce Wright once noted that Baby Intelligence had very good and nearly always right instincts. Baby Intelligence had a strong awareness of the incalculable power of certain acts, which is never more apparent than when he chose to spare his bitter enemy who would someday become his dearest companion [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen_(Mutantry-2001)) and go out of his way to heal the grievous injuries he had inflicted upon him, [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) and when he had a feeling the time was right to assist Natalie K. Wagner and he arrived to find her ready to give birth. He even defended [Optica](/wiki/Optica) when she showed her self-hatred by saying part in losing her parents was an accident, to which she lamented that Baby Intelligence 'had never met someone you can't have mercy on'. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) He finally admitted to himself that he did not hate [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), and after [Force Baby](/wiki/Force_Baby) fatally wounded her, he reconciled with his adversary in her last moments, comforting her with his promise to bring the best of humanity to conquer whatever was coming next. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Baby Intelligence was almost as famous for being a great teacher as an incredible duelist. Despite his incredible power, he was fairly disdainful of combat and believed that wars could not render one great. Although he sought to take the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads) under custody at first, the chance at arrest for those so powerful and irrevocably evil soon proved no longer an option as far as Baby Intelligence was concerned. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) While he never displayed arrogance or conceit, he had no use for false modesty either and if a situation warranted it, was perfectly willing to acknowledge his virtually peerless intelligence and power. However, he was beyond aware that he had his weaknesses and blind spots just as any other man, and worked hard to keep them in check. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) His humility was such that he, in later years, declined any attempts by others to offer him positions of great political authority. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Although never as given to humor as Force Baby or [Bailey Dennings](/wiki/Bailey_Dennings), he had a dry wit. For instance, when Lindsay Kellerman (who was Chinese) lamented that [Hardy](/wiki/Hardy) \"would dig a hole to [China](/wiki/China)\", he claimed to be curious about where Chinese children dug to. He also pointed out to [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black) that a capital 'g' is just an arrow going around in a loop. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7) This humor often became more cutting when applied to people Baby Intelligence disliked. After Dante Christensen said they should banish [Willie the Banker](/wiki/Willie_the_Banker), and Baby Intelligence asked where, Christensen suggested the \"vacuum of [outer space](/wiki/Earthly_Plane)\", to which Baby Intelligence replied, \"Excuse me, but what has the vacuum of space ever done to you?\" [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) When threatened by [Olocron](/wiki/Olocron) shortly before the [Battle of the Eastern Field](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Field), Baby Intelligence responded to Olocron's threat that he'd got his eye on him by casually commenting \"I didn't know you had one to spare\". [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) It is widely believed that one of his greatest powers was his ability to [love](/wiki/Love), despite having a hard life overall and receiving no love from his own family. One of the three members he knew tried to kill him, and the other two abandoned him and left him to fend for himself. He was also open-minded and was never withdrawn from other people's knowledge, as he allowed Paige Nelson as well as \"Phoenix\" to teach him things he had not experienced given how young he was at the time. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) - \"But I warn you, your suppressed and violent policies are throwing supporters into his embrace.\" - Master Intelligence to Damon Alexis regarding the Dark Flame [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Inferno_Relit) Having learned to take care of the S.M.S.B. over the course of the [Second NoHead War](/wiki/Second_NoHead_War) and being naturally responsible, Baby Intelligence had developed into a very mature person, especially for his age. Baby Intelligence is also very independent, a trait he and the [Dark Lord](/wiki/Dark_Lord) share, preferring to work alone or with his pupils and to use his own resources whenever he could. He was commonly, though not continuously, in disagreement with authority figures. As a baby, Baby Intelligence also had a great deal of curiosity. He was always asking questions, always seeking to learn more. It didn't seem to matter what it was, he always wanted to learn about anything. Possibly because of this, he had issues when it came to trusting others, especially grown women, but this grew to be one of his greatest strengths. These trust issues surfaced hugely from being seemingly betrayed by his [mother](/wiki/Rotta_Hecks), discretely manipulated by [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black) as well as by [Sam Cornelly](/wiki/Sam_Cornelly), and from being alienated by the majority of the star system population during the [search for the Chosen One](/wiki/Search_for_the_Chosen_One). [[11]](#cite_note-POTSB-11) [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) Despite his honorable personality, Baby Intelligence was far from flawless. He was often hasty, short-sighted and impulsive though he improved upon the last two traits going into adulthood. He was also known to lose his temper and let his frustration get the better of him. Baby Intelligence suffered from PTSD as a result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured prior to the performance of [Rocken Role](/wiki/Rocken_Role). Even as a baby, Baby Intelligence displayed many signs of clinical depression, however this extended to his older life. Throughout the latter half of the [Second NoHead War](/wiki/Second_NoHead_War), Baby Intelligence showed signs of these symptoms: general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, mood swings, insomnia (nightmares and night terrors of those he killed and tried to kill him), agitation, irritability, social isolation and even lack of concentration. These symptoms were continued to be well into his mid ages. It was clear that Baby Intelligence received limited assistance in his depression during his childhood, a period of essential development, although this was possibly improved in his later life. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25) [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Fourteen years later, in 2043, he was more serious-minded and mellow, and his curiosity had wavered to a degree, so it was at an average level by the standards of adolescents. Yet apart from these traits, he hadn't changed much. The same applied after 2043. - \"I'll join [the NoHeads] when heck freezes over. For the [Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army)!\" - Baby Intelligence makes his allegiances clear to [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black). [[src]](/wiki/Sebiscuits:_Apocalypse) Master Intelligence was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests before his own. It was not uncommon for him to show more concern for others than himself. He was willing to sacrifice himself for any one S.M.S.B. member or any good citizen in general. Ironically, this was how he died when he sacrificed himself to stop the Dark Flame from murdering Lindsay Kellerman [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8). Master Intelligence strove to treat every S.M.S.B. member equally. He had a lot of respect for his fans; most of the Fobbles he worked with stated that he was \"modest, likable, and exceptionally talented\". [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Master Intelligence's greatest strengths were his morals and his ability to feel, understand, and reciprocate love, despite receiving nothing but neglect until he met Zett. [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Master Intelligence was extremely loyal to and protective of his loved ones and that love was what allowed him to overcome Mr. Stupid NoHead. Sheriff Bladepoint noted that Master Intelligence's strength of will at resisting the temptation of the Darkness, even when faced with Paige Nelson's death, who was one of his dearest friends at the time, was due to Master Intelligence's ability to love. Master Intelligence even claimed that he felt sorry for Mr. Stupid NoHead because of his inability to feel or understand love, [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) this all proves Master Intelligence's ability to love so unequivocally. Baby Intelligence, especially as an infant, was known to be sensitive to foul language, something which [Anthony Ruth](/wiki/Anthony_Ruth) considered an amusing reminder of just how young he was. In 2052, Master Intelligence seemed to be wiser and more assured of himself. He and Sebiscuits Cardarphen had become extremely close throughout their lives, often seeking both counsel and platonic comfort from each other. Eventually, his relationship with Cardarphen developed further into one that went beyond mere friendship, one that was romantic, intense and passionate, as well as sexual, and that eventually ended in gay marriage. Cardarphen had never been afraid to stand up to some of Master Intelligence's more questionable choices, and his wisdom often helped his husband get on the right road again, which very much so went both ways. In spite of his many extraordinary qualities, he was also a somewhat Machiavellian figure. He could be stoically pragmatic and was extremely prone to secrecy. He spent a considerable portion of his middle years concocting plans with [Thomas Meyer](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer) for forcibly redeeming all the Fobbles, in the process treating his ill pupil with neglect. Whilst Master Intelligence was never a deliberately cruel man, at times, he was too far-sighted, making choices that he believed to be for the benefit of humanity even if it deeply hurt some of the people around him. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Baby Intelligence had formerly shown minimal hesitancy to take the lives of the malicious, but in his adulthood and even his adolescence, Master Intelligence's strongest characteristic gradually became his strong moral code to never kill, as he had become considerably less hardcore in his approach to fighting crime. It is believed that a combination of emotional and physical improvement, coping with loss, becoming more energetic, and moving on from the potential disillusionment he had experienced during the war against the [NoHeads](/wiki/NoHeads), as well as his decreasing cynical, pessimistic, and world-weary personality towards a far more well-rounded one, caused Master Intelligence to view his former methods as too extreme (referring to his formerly held belief in their effectiveness as a \"self-indulgent lie\"), and to decide that he was better off letting his enemies suffer from the aftermath of their actions at the worthy risk of letting them possibly return and cause more harm than cruelly allowing them to die for their wrongdoings. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29) Even as a baby, Master Intelligence was haunted by his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Rotta Hecks, Sheriff Bladepoint, and Force Baby. He felt enormous remorse for his carelessness in the first two cases and selfishness in the latter, to the point that he delayed facing the Dark Flame. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) The [Attack at the Acquisition District](/wiki/Attack_at_the_Acquisition_District) had a profound effect on Master Intelligence's optimism, with their failure to stop the Dark Flame causing him to take on a darker and somewhat grim persona. When he lost [Retrowoman](/wiki/Retrowoman) and [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe), Master Intelligence stopped his fight for the next four years, instead choosing to become a grief counselor at Jorvian Assylum, before choosing to use more underhanded means to undermine members of the [Unifiers](/wiki/Unifiers). He was restless and reluctant to remain in one place for very long, as he stated that a body is immobile, while a spirit is always on the move. Even after leaving the persona of \"Master Intelligence\" behind, however, he still took it upon himself to aid whomever he could in whatever way he could. In the end, he died attempting to see his old friend show some sliver of remorse for the unspeakable things he had done, with many unsure of just what had been on his mind when he approached the Dark Flame the way he did. His sacrifice was not in vain, as he and his friend reconciled before going in very separate ways into the next life. There, he gained astral form and provided guidance for [Matthew](/wiki/Matthew) and [Alexandra](/wiki/Alexandra). [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) Food[ ] Baby Intelligence was given baby food while he lived with Rotta and Greg, even though he had teeth. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) It is unknown what he ate while he trained with the police, but as the S.M.S.B. Grand Master, he was all into health foods, placing emphasis into eating vegetables regularly. For breakfast, he usually ate Cream of Rice or eggs and fresh fruit, though on special occasions he and his pupils ate cold cereal or or homemade breakfast burritos. He would usually resort to fruit if he still felt hungry after eating. He also encouraged and somewhat enforced his students to eat just as healthily. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22) It was extremely rare that he ever ate out. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) He was more than used to going without his meals, sometimes not eating for days because there was no food around or he was incredibly busy, indeed losing a lot of food and sleep over such projects as his failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the [2030 Pandemic](/wiki/2030_Pandemic), [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) which had a significant impact on his health as a teenager. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) Powers and abilities[ ] Baby Intelligence was considered, by many, the most powerful mutant of the age. Even the Dark Flame had acknowledged that Master Intelligence was a very great mutant and secretly feared him.perienced Dark mutan In many battles of the wars he involved himself in, he was able to incapacitate much more experienced Dark mutants. During the Battle of Transylvania, he was the only one of the seven S.M.S.B. members to be neither injured nor incapacitated and, along with Telekinibabe, was the only fighter on their side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed. Powers[ ] - \"Do you dare to do this? I am equipped with powers I would not even try.\" \"Dormant abilities you are too weak to channel.\" \"I will not need to control your meta-abilities or mess up the space-time continuum. Not for you.\" - Master Intelligence and the Dark Flame [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_New_Order) - Mutantry: Baby Intelligence was considered, by many, the most powerful mutant of the age. Even the Dark Flame had acknowledged that Master Intelligence was a very great mutant and secretly feared him. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32)While already formidable without it mostly because of his legendary intellect, the serum enhanced all of his bodily functions to the pinnacle of human physical potential. His strength, speed, hearing, durability, agility, stamina, reflexes, and healing was stronger than nearly any other superhero. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7)The serum permanently transformed him from a tender infant into a mighty being capable of besting several powerful to overpower [Niranda the Thrice-Cursed](/wiki/Niranda_the_Thrice-Cursed), despite being wounded, exhausted, and utterly drained, killing her by redirecting a projectile into her forehead. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6)During the [Battle of Jupiter](/wiki/Battle_of_Jupiter), he was the only one of the nine S.M.S.B. members to be neither injured nor incapacitated and, along with [Telekinibabe](/wiki/Telekinibabe), was the only fighter on their side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed. [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29)Baby Intelligence maintained a healthy diet and a regular exercise regimen, which seems to have increased his capabilities even further. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22)It was believed by Hell Burnbottom that, if Baby Intelligence should ever fall to the [Darkness](/wiki/Darkness), his powers would be capable of annihilating even Death herself. Baby Intelligence even beat [Niranda the Thrice-Cursed](/wiki/Niranda_the_Thrice-Cursed), [Mean King](/wiki/Mean_King), and [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen)in direct combat. In addition to forcing the [Umbralord](/wiki/Umbralord)himself onto the defensive in 2043, Master Intelligence also expressed full confidence that he could easily break out from the notoriously secure [Beta Prison](/wiki/Beta_Prison)even if he was imprisoned. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10)When everything was said and done, Master Intelligence had such a profound understanding and knowledge of how mutation worked, even at his younger days, that he stood above nearly every other mutant alive, and earned the respect of many famously accomplished mutants, including Myra Gordon. Throughout his life, he greatly contributed to the advancement of mutated knowledge in modern times and became a famous contributor to many mutated scholarly journals. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8)However, despite his great power and skill, Baby Intelligence strongly disliked combat in general, and was even a bit disdainful of the idea that \"greatness\" could be achieved through martial prowess. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) - Telekinesis: Baby Intelligence possessed an extraordinary level of aptitude with telekinesis. He demonstrated on one occasion the ability to telekinetically lift and carry a crane, and proved able to keep his body upward by such means at age seven. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28)In their duel [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom)proved unable to overcome the baby with the use of telekinetically thrown objects. [[22]](#cite_note-TBS-22)Despite the sheer power that [Mean King](/wiki/Mean_King)himself possessed, Baby Intelligence was able to catch him off guard with a telekinetic push just before their duel. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25)A master practitioner of the ability, Intelligence was adept at the saber throw, as demonstrated in his return to the Sanctum during Operation Purge. [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9)In his preteen-to-early-teen years, he was so telekinetically efficient that he was seen punching through walls with psionic blasts and drawing the waters of the sewers so that it erupted and flowed out surrounding and encasing Hell Burnbottom inside a sphere of water in an attempt to drown him. However, the complex water sphere's shape required continuous sculpting and spinning, and when Lindsay Kellerman unintentionally broke his concentration and the sphere collapsed, setting Burnbottom free. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10)By the time he was in his fifties, his telekinesis was virtually unrivaled, to the extent that he astounded Lindsay Kellerman by deflecting a barrage of Death beams fired by Thomas Meyer, which is widely considered to be impossible to block even one. In the same fight, he telekinetically directed a series of ropes, snagged Centauri with them, and tied him up and forced him to the ground, all in a matter of seconds. By 2130, he could use telekinetic applications in devastating ways to demonstrate an almost godlike mastery over nature on a molecular and potentially even particle level during his rematch with the Dark Flame, allowing him to control prominent, physical, and esoteric forces. During their climactic showdown, he was able to manipulate reality by bending quantum strings in a localized area. Even at this point, Master Intelligence told the Dark Flame he had dormant abilities he wouldn't even try, namely two: first, the power to give, take away or alternate meta ability potential in those who lack, and second, the power to manipulate and distort the space-time continuum, earning him scorn from his fanatical nemesis. - Enhanced Senses: Over the course of the [Asian Revolution](/wiki/Asian_Revolution), Master Intelligence learned how to use telekinesis to augment his own physical condition even further than the serum had. On multiple occasions, he could augment his sense to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel better, perceiving his surroundings with higher awareness. In both of his fights with the Dark Flame, he used his telekinetic abilities to augment his stamina, remaining active for extended periods of time as long as three hours. However, as early as 2031, he was able to use telekinesis to punch through steel walls using psionic blasts in conjunction with his fists. - Technopathy (indirectly): Thanks to his husband, [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen), helping him figure it out, Master Intelligence learned to manipulate the functions and properties of technology and all forms of high-tech machinery. - Teleportation: Despite not directly possessing the innate ability as most mutants did, Master Intelligence, through telekinetically altering atoms and molecules of matter itself, was extremely skilled in [Teleportation](/wiki/Teleportation), as he was the only known [mutant](/wiki/Mutant)apart from [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead)capable of Teleporting silently. He could transport himself from one place to another with pin-point precision, even when locked in combat, as shown by how he dodged some of [Genesis](/wiki/Genesis)' attacks during their brief duel by teleporting away before quickly counter-attacking. By 2094, he was also able to teleport by means of creating folds in the fabric of space. - Inter-dimensional travel: In 2130, Master Intelligence could bend the very fabric of dimensional barriers, allowing him to travel through wormholes or teleportation-like movement. - Enhanced Senses: Over the course of the - Shield: He displayed an impressive mastery of the [Shield](/wiki/Shield), something he heavily relied on in his early years, surpassing that of many government employees: [[29]](#cite_note-AS1-29)as it was one of his primary superpowers. His Shields were so powerful that they were able to deflect attacks from [Kenzie Walters](/wiki/Kenzie_Walters)and later smash [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black)into a wall when she tried to kill him. [[7]](#cite_note-S1-7)With his Shields, he deflected a Stun beam from Mr. Stupid NoHead during their final battle, several punches from the physically enhanced [Baby Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength), and later a blast of the Godrider's flames without any permanent damage. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6)Thanks to [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman), Master Intelligence could transport himself from one place to another with pinpoint precision, even when locked in combat. [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) - Insight: Baby Intelligence possessed an extremely rare superpower. He was able to look into the minds of his enemies and anyone near them and see through these individuals' senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what Mr. Stupid NoHead and Annabeth Black were doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; and one that Baby Intelligence never truly mastered control of. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27)Additionally, because of their connection, Baby Intelligence felt himself shivering whenever one of his worst enemies felt strong negative emotions and/or inflicted such feelings upon others. [[25]](#cite_note-AEG-25)Baby Intelligence also possessed a non-mutated insight into the minds of his enemies thanks to his deductive skills. - Telekinesis: Baby Intelligence possessed an extraordinary level of aptitude with telekinesis. He demonstrated on one occasion the ability to telekinetically lift and carry a crane, and proved able to keep his body upward by such means at age seven. Former powers[ ] - Cybernetic Enhancements: Because his body had been severely burned in the City Volcano, Baby Intelligence was thought to have lost much of his potential, although he nonetheless retained an incredibly high control of mutated power. After he was retrained, Baby Intelligence wielded tremendous power and skill, enough to use his powers to overpower almost any opponent he could not defeat with his sword. Had the duel with Sebiscuits not taken place, Baby Intelligence would have become far more powerful than [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint). As it was, the villain \"Spicy\" John acknowledged that he had never encountered a mutant as powerful as Baby Intelligence. Sebiscuits, understanding love and having gone out of his way to keep Baby Intelligence alive, took an alternative viewpoint. Though it was true to say that he had not expected Baby Intelligence to return a cyborg, Sebiscuits believed that most of the limitations on Baby Intelligence's potential power were not physical but psychological. He believed that, were Baby Intelligence to fully confront his choices and completely shake himself out of his guilt, he would have been able to reawaken the incredible power within him. Once Master Intelligence got used to his [armor](/wiki/Armor)and re-tooled his fighting style, he regained some of his confidence and became one of the most powerful heroes in the civilization's history. However, he would always be haunted to varying degrees by the choices he had made, even to the point of what amounted to temporary insanity during the second month of the American Purge. Thus, while Baby Intelligence made progress in that regard, he was never fully able to accept who and what he had become, and therefore never fulfilled his full potential. - Enhanced durability: Besides the life support it provided his ravaged body, Baby Intelligence's armor also offered limited protection against the blades of swords. In combat, a quick blow from a sword appeared to cut the armor only shallowly, although this was enough to draw a surprised cry. However, most of the armor was purposely made out of non-sword resistant material, as Baby Intelligence worried that he might grow sloppy if he relied too much on his armor to protect him in duels. - Enhanced piloting skills: Even with his life suit he was still one of the greatest pilots in Sol. His armor did not dull the precognition ability he possessed and he was able to predict the movements of his targets during dogfights with pinpoint precision. He still possessed amazing engineering skills, having personally overseen the design of both his second skyfighter and the S.M.S.B. Motor Home's construction. In addition, he also possessed exceptional piloting skills\u2014During a pilot training exercise, Baby Intelligence, after joining the simulator exercise, managed to shoot down everyone despite his targeting computers being disabled prior to launch; saving Lindsay Kellerman, widely considered to be the best pilot in the group, for last. He then proceeded to toy with Lindsay; did various maneuvers and random blasts; matched her every move; before shooting her down despite Lindsay's best efforts. Abilities[ ] - \"You can't outthink this man. Nor can you fight him hand-to-hand.\" - General George [[src]](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Inferno_Relit) - Master combatant: Baby Intelligence is highly experienced in hand-to-hand combat. He has extensive levels of knowledge of melee combat. In 2041, he noted he was fully confident he could repel any attack attempted on him and Lindsay Kellerman by Hell Burnbottom's followers in case it happened while they travelled, and in the process effortlessly took out [Molly Dawson](/wiki/Molly_Dawson). He dueled the [Umbralord](/wiki/Umbralord)himself, countering his attacks and responding with such powerful assault as to force the demon into constant defence before eventually trapping him in an orb or water, forcing him to deteleport and to try and possess Lindsay to get Master Intelligence to mercy kill the girl. He held his own against Centauri and Baby Strength in their three-way duel. - Swordplay: Baby Intelligence was a master of swordplay, and was widely acknowledged as being perhaps the greatest duelist of his time despite being trained as a police officer. He was able to defeat several of the strongest NoHeads and Knights of Plague single-handedly and survive numerous encounters with [Mr. Stupid NoHead](/wiki/Mr._Stupid_NoHead)and [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black). Although a master of all stils, his preferred style was Stil II. During the Escape from Snake Island, he dispatched 153 corrupted children on his own using primarily his aptitude for fencing, simultaneously showing his durability to physical pain. Much of his combat style relied on jumps and acrobatics, which he was beyond capable of. Despite the fact that Baby Intelligence's primary Stil was Svarna, he demonstrated an extreme level of skill with regard to deflecting bullets. However, in his teen years, Master Intelligence had a more controlled and complex fighting style combining Svarna and Kchendo. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10)Master Intelligence was ultimately unable to defeat the [Dark Flame](/wiki/Thomas_Meyer), though it should be noted that even the Dark Flame was only able to win after dueling Master Intelligence for three hours straight, a testament to the latter's incredible dueling skill. - Stil II: Although a master of all stils, his preferred style was Stil II, as it allowed him to compensate for his limited reach and stature. His technique consisted of the pure basics of Svarna taken to their highest possible levels. Despite his young age and short stature, Baby Intelligence displayed amazing speed and dexterity, leaping through the air and twirling as he battered at an opponent's defenses. However, like virtually all Svarna practitioners, Baby Intelligence had a great deal of difficulty producing any caution in his attacks. This flaw would eventually prove to be his undoing. - Swordplay: Baby Intelligence was a master of swordplay, and was widely acknowledged as being perhaps the greatest duelist of his time despite being trained as a police officer. He was able to defeat several of the strongest NoHeads and Knights of Plague single-handedly and survive numerous encounters with - Supergenius intellect: From the day he was born, Master Intelligence has proven himself a supergenius of phenomenally outstanding, wunderkind level intellect (known to be a polymath and bibliophile, making numerous eclectic references), quite possibly the most intelligent being in the [Sol System](/wiki/Sol_System), with his phenomenally eclectic intellect virtually unrivaled, with him standing out even among other geniuses as a baby who could fight crime and an adult that could outsmart other geniuses. His knowledge even delayed Mr. Stupid NoHead getting his hands on Sebiscuits, and as well as resulting in his conversion to the Light, although this was just as much due to his uncanny capacity for genuine [love](/wiki/Love). Additionally, even [Robbie Evans](/wiki/Robbie_Evans)admired Master Intelligence's genius, and thus bombarded Master Intelligence with letters asking the adolescent for advice early into his presidential career. The adult Master Intelligence's tremendously eclectic intellect extends itself to his unparalleled tactical, strategic, deceptive, manipulative, cryptographic, robotics, hacking, escapology, genetics, political science, neuroscience, mythological, theological, and exploitative networking skills, and even more so leadership, detective, mathematical, scientific, engineering, computer science, computer programming, criminology, and literary skills, in addition to his phenomenal idiosyncratic, albeit extremely pragmatic wordplay skills. - Master mathematician: Master Intelligence was a phenomenally skilled supergenius mathematician, with him being able to effortlessly verbally extemporize computer code, being able to pick up on patterns almost all others do not notice, having a penchant to make even something as casual as sports scores sound like algebraic integers. Only [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black)was known to surpass him in this field. - Master scientist: By the time he was a teenager, Master Intelligence was an extraordinarily brilliant supergenius scientist, phenomenally skilled and knowledgeable in a vast array of scientific fields (including physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and many others). - Master engineer: Baby Intelligence is a phenomenally brilliant and prolific supergenius engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer, cryptographer and robotics technician, a wunderkind prodigy since he was less than six months old. He specialized in new disruptive technologies, notably creating the Pinewood Derby (with [Paige Nelson](/wiki/Paige_Nelson)notably calling him a genius in shock after she saw it), in addition to the teenage Master Intelligence being able to effortlessly verbally extemporize computer code. - Master hacker: Master Intelligence, as a prolific computer scientist and programmer, is an immensely formidable supergenius hacker and cryptographer, notable for his phenomenal skills of intelligence gathering, and data interpretation, his ability to hack into most computer systems without tripping any firewalls or security, as well as his superb pattern recognition and analysis skills, with Master Intelligence therefore being able to pick up on patterns others do not notice. - Master cryptographer: Master Intelligence was a phenomenally skilled cryptographer supergenius, coding his writings with unbelievable efficiency. - Master criminologist: Baby Intelligence displayed outstanding knowledge of the laws of the [Eight Worlds](/wiki/Eight_Worlds), owning several books in his private library concerning it. - Expert leader: As an excellent leader to others, Baby Intelligence had often taken charge when the situation required it. His skills progressed to the point where over thirty young mutants, most of whom were older than him \u2014 respect him as a teacher in the Light despite his being younger than they were. Sheriff Bladepoint later noted that Baby Intelligence was a superior leader to him. Baby Intelligence willingly took the burden of command, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who followed him. He did this regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect and coordinating his efforts against his enemies well. Hence, he was well-respected and feared by many and with his uncanny ability to quickly get his followers to trust him, to the point his skills as a leader was held in such a high regard that he was even offered the position of President many times and would have most definitely greatly excelled. His promotion to high positions of power in his infant year demonstrate Baby Intelligence's natural talent as a commander. [Robbie Evans](/wiki/Robbie_Evans)himself held Master Intelligence's leadership brilliance in such a high regard to the point that he would often ask for his advice. During the [Third NoHead War](/wiki/Third_NoHead_War), Master Intelligence was able to give useful leadership advice to Troq-Ness concerning how to best combat [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom), though Troq-Ness would disregard it, yet during the [Shadow Wars](/wiki/Shadow_Wars), he was able to give useful leadership advice to the head of the Masters of Tomorrow, and it was his leadership expertise giving advice to the authorities that allowed society to be not conquered by the [Dark Flame](/wiki/Dark_Flame)long enough for Master Intelligence to fight the ultimate showdown. Master Intelligence's leadership expertise also allowed him to handle the responsibilities of the Chief Deviant of the Mutamon and Supreme Defender of Peace with such effectiveness as to be well-respected for it by many, according to his friend [Captain Strength](/wiki/Captain_Strength). His leadership allowed Master Intelligence to follow in the footsteps of his old mentor and stand against the overwhelming forces of darkness at both the Second and Third NoHead War, despite also having to avoid the government's eyes, inspiring enough loyalty into his allies to make them be fearless and determined that the cause they were fighting for was right even with the massive losses of their loved ones. - Expert instructor: Having always been highly interested in teaching, from a young age, Baby Intelligence already displayed the ability to be a good mentor-like figure and model to his fellow student friends, showing tremendous skill in teaching others. Emerging from his own training at the [Jade Sanctum](/wiki/Jade_Sanctum)less than two months after his birth, he successfully passed them onto others even when he was a baby, giving proper instructions and corrections on how to perform many fields of mutantry, ranging from the relatively simplistic sword stances to the highly advanced reversal of banes. Baby Intelligence's effectiveness as a teacher led many, some even older than him, to choose him over the Grand Army, and he even went to [Superhero School](/wiki/Superhero_School)to give occasional lectures. - Master literarian: Baby Intelligence, as a famous bibliophile, has an encyclopedic knowledge of literary works, possessing vast quantities of books in his own private study, with him acknowledging Annabeth Black's own bibliophile made him \"strive for the same magnificence\". - Master mathematician: Master Intelligence was a phenomenally skilled supergenius mathematician, with him being able to effortlessly verbally extemporize computer code, being able to pick up on patterns almost all others do not notice, having a penchant to make even something as casual as sports scores sound like algebraic integers. Only - \"And I must say, you've constructed for yourself quite the network of international contacts.\" - Troq-Ness [[src]](/wiki/S.M.S.B.:_Where_Are_You_Now%3F) - Expert networker: Due to his vast reputation, Master Intelligence had a vast network of followers and international contacts around the whole star system, to the point that he is known for knowing all that happens. Indeed, even the abrasive Uranian officer Troq-Ness showed begrudging admiration of Master Intelligence's international contacts network while questioning the S.M.S.B. Grand Master. [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) - Multilingualism: Master Intelligence has also shown to be a multilingualist, preferring English as the language he taught himself to speak when he was only five or six days old before spending months elaborating on his rudimentary vocabulary, showing his enormous capacity to learn new languages at a phenomenal pace. Indeed, he mastered German and French and probably Spanish as well,[ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)] and was implied to speak Mermish. [[8]](#cite_note-AS3-8) - Eidetic memory: Master Intelligence, as a supergenius, has a photographic memory and perfect recall, which greatly aided him in mastering a vast array of eclectic fields to the highest level as a polymath, while also allowing him to make numerous layered references (to pop-culture, to biblical and pagan theology, to mathematics, to computer science, to famous books, and etc.), and to know seemingly random facts, such as the length of the star system's largest hot dog. - Expert networker: Due to his vast reputation, Master Intelligence had a vast network of followers and international contacts around the whole star system, to the point that he is known for knowing all that happens. Indeed, even the abrasive Uranian officer Troq-Ness showed begrudging admiration of Master Intelligence's international contacts network while questioning the S.M.S.B. Grand Master. - Master of Mutantry: Master Intelligence mastered all four [Arts](/wiki/Arts)and accepted his own death. The only Art he choose to keep was the Cuffs of Energy as it was a priceless family heirloom; the [Sword of Abomination](/wiki/Sword_of_Abomination)was given of Power](/wiki/Orb_of_Power)and [Device of Teleportation](/wiki/Device_of_Teleportation)were destroyed. He also displayed incredible detective skills, indeed, he was an unusually talented investigator. - Expert Crodela player: Baby Intelligence was an incredibly skilled [Crodela](/wiki/Crodela)player and played Brightener for the [Holy Mackerels](/wiki/Holy_Mackerels)when he was less than a year old. He was said to be one of the best Brighteners in the star system, despite his young age. - Indomitable willpower: Baby Intelligence appears to possess an unbreakable spirit and, though not above depression, he has never truly given up on any mission. He's been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. His indomitable will is exemplified by his ability to resist [Dark waves](/wiki/Darkness), and also by the fact that he had never begged for mercy even in life-and-death situations, but fought back in defiance, as well as perform complex telekinetic applications flawlessly. Weaknesses[ ] Post-traumatic stress disorder: Baby Intelligence was deeply traumatized by the murder of his parents at a young age and developed PTSD after his venture into [Tsala](/wiki/Tsala), the heart of terrestrial evil. He has also lost other people close to him, such as [Paige Nelson](/wiki/Paige_Nelson) during the Battle of the Fourth Dominion and [Lisa](/wiki/Lisa) just before the [Battle of Yellowstone](/wiki/Battle_of_Yellowstone). His experiences have hardened him considerably. Facilities[ ] [MBH](/wiki/MBH) - Motor home Possessions[ ] Weapons[ ] - First sword: As is the case with most mutants, and especially superheroes, Baby Intelligence's sword is among his most valued possessions. His sword is made of [copper](/wiki/Copper). He lost it at the Dukas residence in January of 2030 before the [Battle of Tsala](/wiki/Battle_of_Tsala). [Might](/wiki/Might): Following the [Battle of Tsala](/wiki/Battle_of_Tsala), Baby Intelligence constructed a new sword, which he named [Might](/wiki/Might). Might was carried by him for the remainder of the Second NoHead War; seeing action in several battles. - Serenity: A [sword](/wiki/Sword)made in 2039 and confiscated in 2042. - Retribution: An [exosword](/wiki/Exoweaponry)made independently and lost during the [Battle of New York](/wiki/Battle_of_New_York). - Justice: His fourth weapon, Justice, was constructed in 2043 and saw action in the [Battle of Bast Castle](/wiki/Battle_of_Bast_Castle)and the [Battle of Jupiter](/wiki/Battle_of_Jupiter). - Arts: At different points in his life, Baby Intelligence owned all four of the [Arts](/wiki/Arts)\u2014 the [Sword of Abomination](/wiki/Sword_of_Abomination), the Cuffs of Energy, the [Orb of Power](/wiki/Orb_of_Power), and the [Device of Teleportation](/wiki/Device_of_Teleportation). These four artifacts are the most powerful magical items in all of the Eight Worlds and were so ancient that they were created by the revered [Merlin](/wiki/Merlin). Unlike many of the previous owners of the Sword of Abomination, Master Intelligence kept its identity a closely guarded secret. Vehicles[ ] - Metalwing 4: A Metalwing 4 was a [Skater](/wiki/Skater)gifted to him from Crodela Team Captain [Ammon Dorber](/wiki/Ammon_Dorber)after joining the [Holy Mackerels](/wiki/Holy_Mackerels)in 2020. However, it was after [Hell Burnbottom](/wiki/Hell_Burnbottom)briefly occupied the MBH. [[6]](#cite_note-ROHB-6) - Electroflame: Assisted by Bruce Wright and [Lindsay Kellerman](/wiki/Lindsay_Kellerman), Baby Intelligence replaced it by forging the finest Skater available as an anonymous gift. The Skater was one of his most prized possessions for years. [Pinewood Derby](/wiki/Pinewood_Derby): Baby Intelligence got around in this vehicle. [Enforcer](/wiki/Enforcer): Master Intelligence got around in this vehicle. Wardrobe[ ] - Cloak of Peace: Baby Intelligence was awarded an ancient relic, the [Cloak of Peace](/wiki/Cloak), by [Sheriff Bladepoint](/wiki/Sheriff_Bladepoint). [Supersuit](/wiki/Supersuit): Baby Intelligence wore an iconic supersuit. - Robes Other equipment[ ] - Pit of Holograms: Master Intelligence owned the [Pit of Holograms](/wiki/Pit_of_Holograms), a stone receptacle used to store and review memories, which mutants are able to extract from their heads. Lindsay Kellerman first discovers this device to witness Master Intelligence's memory of [Aurora Black](/wiki/Aurora_Black)'s resignation from the Mutamon. - Pet: Baby Intelligence's animal companion, Achilles loved Baby Intelligence dearly, showing signs by nibbling his ear or fingers, and loyally obeyed his every command.

Throughout the course of the [War of Jupiter](/wiki/War_of_Jupiter), Master Intelligence would leave it in the [MBH](/wiki/MBH). Somehow, the backpack most mysteriously found its way to a strange chamber located within [Transylvania Quarters](/wiki/Transylvania_Quarters)in 2052. Master Intelligence was distraught, as he for a time did not know where it was. Just prior to the beginning of the [Mission to Transylvania Quarters](/wiki/Mission_to_Transylvania_Quarters)on January 9, 2052, Master Intelligence recovered the backpack and used it to conceal the [fake Orb of Power](/wiki/Disc_of_Amity)from the [Knights of Plague](/wiki/Knights_of_Plague)and their leader, [the Gladiator](/wiki/The_Gladiator). Master Intelligence brought the empty backpack with him out of the Tavern of Tombs and to the apartment of Myra Gordon. - Bible: Baby Intelligence kept a large old Bible among old Perpetual Seers and handwritten notes in his office during his lifelong tenure within the [MBH](/wiki/MBH). [[9]](#cite_note-S2-9) - Medal of Hercules medal: Master Intelligence was given an Medal of Hercules, first class, medal by the [U.S. Government](/wiki/U.S._Government)in 2030 for his unwavering allegiance to the [Police Grand Army](/wiki/Police_Grand_Army)during the [Second NoHead War](/wiki/Second_NoHead_War), his daring personal rescue of the Mutapresident himself, and his prodigious intellectual breakthroughs as a mere baby with every thinkable odd against his success as an acclaimed [superhero](/wiki/Superhero). Career accomplishments[ ] Master Intelligence was renowned as an incredibly talented and reliable superhero, and was extremely famous for it. This was coupled with the fact that he was the Chosen One who would destroy the NoHeads. He drove off many criminals that Fobbles could not dream of defeating and was idolized by thousands of people, including Sebiscuits Cardarphen, [[5]](#cite_note-BI-5) Jonathan, [[28]](#cite_note-SMSB1-28) and Lindsay Kellerman. [[19]](#cite_note-POTSB_25-19) Intelligence also helped reform the police after Operation: Purge. [[27]](#cite_note-FCB-27) Master Intelligence became the Chief Deviant and the Supreme Defender of Peace. He was removed from these posts during his conflict with the government under President [Robbie Evans](/wiki/Robbie_Evans), but was reinstated when the government was forced to acknowledge that he had correctly warned that Hell Burnbottom had returned. [[10]](#cite_note-SMSB2-10) He holds the Medal of Hercules, First Class. [[1]](#cite_note-DITW-1) Relationships[ ] the scenes[ ] - At first, Baby Intelligence was believed to have been inspired by Yoda, a character from the \"Star Wars\" saga. This is later confirmed to not be true, as the inspiration for his character actually came from Professor Charles Xavier (aka [Professor X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X)), from [X-Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men). Thomas later admitted that Professor X is his favorite character in Marvel. The series itself (X-Men) was also inspired from said fandom. Baby Intelligence was never the oldest member of the S.M.S.B., nor was he the biggest (for instance, Baby Strength is both older and bigger and Force Baby is older). This scenario was inspired years ago by a group from [Holes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holes), where an adolescent whose alias was X-Ray was one of the smallest kids yet he was the leader because he was smarter and had more experience at Camp Green Lake. - Thomas later admitted that \"everything in the [DLU](/wiki/D.I.T._Literary_Universe)seems to be cryptically relevant to the letter X\". - In February 2016, Thomas told his brother, [Ammon](/wiki/Ammon_Thomas), what had happened to Master Intelligence in [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The Inferno Relit](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Inferno_Relit). However, he was disturbed that Ammon told several people about it, which generally began a (true) rumor about Master Intelligence's later life. - After the final chapter of [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The New Order](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_New_Order), there's a small audio cue that comes with the final ending sign. The noise is a callback to Baby Intelligence unsheathing [Might](/wiki/Might)for the first time back in 2030. It's not setting up anything, nor does it seem to be a hint at a future character arriving in the DLU, but it serves as a nice bookend for Master Intelligence's contribution to the franchise as a whole. It has been confirmed that, in respect of the memory of Master Intelligence, he will not be seen or mentioned in Part Five: The Death of Shadows. - While it says in the graphic novelization of [Baby Intelligence](/wiki/Baby_Intelligence)that Peter learned to walk at six days old, this is not a canonical piece of information as it says in the novel that he was walking at four days, the day he met Colby Doge. - D. Isaac Thomas has claimed that while Baby Intelligence is a caring person, he is very pessimistic and has never fallen in love. When asked, he claimed that Baby Intelligence has \"not so much as given Lindsay or Red X a hug before.\" This may be due to his moral code but this is not confirmed to be true. This statement was retconed in 2018's [Agents of the S.M.S.B.: The Latest Threat](/wiki/Agents_of_the_S.M.S.B.:_The_Latest_Threat). Reception[ ] Baby Intelligence was received exceptionally by readers. [Melissa Vaine](/wiki/Melissa_Vaine) stated that he seemed to be the earnest nerd that readers could easily familiarize themselves with, and that he seemed to bring comfort in the most dangerous or hostile situations. It has bee mentioned that as a superhero, he seemed unstoppable, but as a person, he was just another societal protector; Chris acknowledged that the franchise continually focused on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by revealing many character flaws. He was also praised for being a natural leader. A couple of readers had a more critical take, finding him the plainest member of [D. Isaac Thomas](/wiki/D._Isaac_Thomas)' roster of heroes. Master Intelligence's position as a homosexual protagonist, as well as his eventual marriage to Sebiscuits Cardarphen have been the subject of many very positive reviews. Vaine called The Latest Threat one of the most powerful, subversive novels of the entire decade, saying that the novel challenged expectations and bravely explored content outside the scope of the young-adult sub-genre. Indeed, it was well-pressed to be something readers would discuss for a long time in the foreseeable future. Readers have noted that the two characters complement each other well as a couple, with Cardarphen's brashness balancing Master Intelligence's calm nature. Among the critics who viewed the pairing negatively, Thomas' mother was unjustifiably outraged, citing that \"[Thomas] should never include guys kissing in [his] stories. How can there be more 'Baby Intelligences' unless he has a real family?\". More constructively, a FANDOM user named \"MaleficentFan2017\" claimed that the depiction of a same-sex relationship hijacks Cardarphen's story in service of social causes to the detriment of its own creative storytelling. Thomas confirmed that at the end of the day, he simply went for the relationship that felt right to him. He also suggested that anyone who felt the relationship was not adequately foreshadowed had read his novels only expecting to see heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, most have acknowledged there is adequate foreshadowing to their romance. Prior to the reveal of the romantic relationship, there was a positive reception to the friendship between Master Intelligence and Cardarphen, the two being viewed as \"perfect partners\" in that their personalities and abilities complemented each other. The relationship was praised for having realism, including depictions of disagreements between the two. Trivia[ ] - When he was a very small baby, Baby Intelligence was very fond of bananas. - Master Intelligence is one of five homosexuals in the [D.I.T. Literary Universe](/wiki/D.I.T._Literary_Universe), the others being his husband [Sebiscuits Cardarphen](/wiki/Sebiscuits_Cardarphen_(Mutantry-2001)), and [Luke Norris](/wiki/Luke_Norris), [Zygen](/wiki/Zygen), and Elizabeth Pace. - In eight out of eleven of the books, Baby Intelligence says the last line in the story. - \"And I am no longer Peter Hecks. I am Baby Intelligence!\" (ZH) - \"Yes...I will come.\" (POTSB) - \"It's yet. It was never over!\" (RHB) - \"Well? Come and submit your names!\" (FCB) - \"Farewell, Cynthia.\" (SMSB1) - \"No one knows what lies beyond the veil.\" (SMSB2) - \"Sebiscuits and I will be with you, always.\" (AS3) - Along with [Annabeth Black](/wiki/Annabeth_Black), he is also the only character to appear in every single book of the series (including the prequels \u2014 Baby Strength and Force Baby don't appear in Dawn of Transcendence. - Aside from Merlin's apprentice, Baby Intelligence is the only known character to this day that has possessed all four of the [Arts](/wiki/Arts). [[32]](#cite_note-AS2-32) - D. Isaac Thomas and Baby Intelligence were both born in June, only a day apart - Thomas on the ninth and Baby Intelligence on the tenth. It is unknown if this is a coincidence. - Thomas revealed in 2017 that Baby Intelligence is left-handed, like himself.
