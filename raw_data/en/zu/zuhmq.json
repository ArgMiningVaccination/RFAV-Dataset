I have been practicing Energy Healing since I was a child. My father was an Energy Healer, Psychiatrist, Acupuncturist, and Hypnotherapist back in the 1990s. I watched as he used every facet of his abilities to help people. I remember witnessing people who had to be carried into a session find the strength to walk out after a session with him, without any help.When he passed, I left Energy Healing and drifted away from my own gifts. I then got my Master's in Business Management and moved to America in 2012. After realizing I needed a more holistic lifestyle and career, I became a Yoga Teacher. In 2014, I was practicing yoga at the park and got bit by a tick. Little did I know how much that little bite would impact my life. I contracted Lyme disease but it went undiagnosed for years and was debilitating. On April 1, 2016, I was bedridden. My body was aching in pain, and I struggled to communicate with my family because I had so much inflammation in my brain that I could not even put the two words together. Any noise hurt my ears, the light hurt my eyes, and the disease destroyed every organ in my body. I had a hernia in my stomach that made the food come back up after eating, and I had to sleep seated in bed.
