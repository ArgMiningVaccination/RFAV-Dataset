GAWRONSKI Third Party Respondent. FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND JUDGMENT Summary : An uninsured employer contests the Uninsured Employers' Fund's acceptance of liability for an injury claim on t he grounds that the employee's injuries were not suffered in a car accident in the course of employment but were actually suffered in an earlier motorcycle accident. Held : The uninsured employer has not met it s burden of proving that the employee's injuries were related to an earlier motorcyc le accident. This Court did not find the uninsured employer's evidence cr edible. Moreover, there is sufficient credible evidence and objective medical findings to support the employee's claim for benefits. The uninsured employer is legally obligated to indemnify the Uninsured Employers' Fund for all benefits paid or payable to the employ ee for his workers' compensation claim. Topics: Credibility. Where a witness for the uninsur ed employer testified by telephone from the Montana State Prison, the Court could not examine the witness' demeanor and therefore could not make a finding as to his credibility. However, t he witness made it clear that he was adverse to the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 2 injured worker by stating that the wo rker got him into \"trouble,\" indicating bias. Witnesses: Credibility. Where a witness for t he uninsured employer testified by telephone from the Montana State Prison, the Court could not examine the witness' demeanor and therefore could not make a finding as to his credibility. However, the wit ness made it clear that he was adverse to the injured worker by stating that the worker got hi m into \"trouble,\" indicating bias. Credibility. An uninsured employer was found not credible for two reasons: (1) he greatly exaggerated his employee' s injuries from a non-work-related motorcycle accident; and (2) he stated a former employee told him during an in-person conversation that the in jured worker intended to defraud the business, but the alleged conversation took place while the former employee was incarcerated. Witnesses: Credibility. An uninsured employer was found not credible for two reasons: (1) he greatly exaggerated his employee's in juries from a non- work-related motorcycle accident; and (2) he stated a former employee told him during an in-person conversation t hat the injured worker intended to defraud the business, but the alleged conversation took place while the former employee was incarcerated. Witnesses: Credibility: Exaggeration. An uninsured employer was found not credible where his acc ount of his employee's in juries from a non-work related motorcycle accident was greatly exaggerated in comparison to the employee's medical reco rds from the accident. Proof: Conflicting Evidence. Where the claimant testified live in Court and was found credible, and the Court could make no finding on the credibility of a witness w ho testified by phone, the Court gave no weight to the telephonic witness' allegation that th e claimant told him he intended to defraud the uninsured employer and conc luded that the wit ness' story was fabricated. Uninsured Employers' Fund: Burden of Proof. If the UEF has accepted liability for a claim and the unins ured employer disagrees with the determination, the uninsured employer has the burden of proving that the claim is noncompensable. Here, the uni nsured employer did not offer any Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 3 evidence that the worker's injuries we re causally related to anything other than his industrial injury. Uninsured Employers' Fund: Indemnification. An uninsured employer has a statutory liability to reimburse the UEF for all benefits paid or to be paid to its injured worker pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-504(1)(b), MCA. Constitutions, Statutes, Regulati ons, and Rules: Montana Code Annotated: 39-71-504. An uninsured employer has a statutory liability to reimburse the UEF for all benefits paid or to be paid to its injured worker pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-504(1)(b), MCA. \u00b6 1 The trial in the above-entitled matter wa s held on June 30, 2015, in Missoula. Petitioner Car Werks, LLC (Car Werks), was represented by Terry Wallace. Jack Palmer, Manager of Car Werks, was also present . Respondent and Third Party Petitioner Uninsured Employers' Fund (UEF) was repr esented by Joseph Nevin. Misty Knight, Claims Examiner and Mark Hurl but, Program Manager, were al so present for the UEF. Third Party Respondent James E. Gawronski was present and represented by Bradley J. Jones and Thomas C. Bulman. \u00b6 2 Exhibits: Exhibits 1 and 3 through 11 we re admitted without obj ection. During the course of trial, foundation was laid for Ex hibit No. 2 and the exhibit was admitted without objection. Exhibit 13 was introduced at tria l and admitted over Petitioner's objection. Exhibit 12 was labeled, \"All other medica l records,\" however, none were offered. \u00b6 3 Witnesses: John Holmes testified te lephonically from the M ontana State Prison. No party objected to this form of his testimony . Holmes was sworn in by Cynthia Outland, a notary and Case Manager at the prison to whom Holmes was personally known. Palmer, Knight, and Gawronski were also sworn and testified. \u00b6 4 Issues Presented: This C ourt restates the issues in t he Pretrial Order as follows:1 Issue One: Whether the UEF correct ly accepted liability for Gawronski's claim. Issue Two: Whether Car Werks is obligated to indemnify the UEF for all benefits paid or payable with res pect to Gawronski's claim. 1 Pretrial Order at 2, Docket Item No. 31. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 4 FINDINGS OF FACT2 \u00b6 5 Gawronski was an employee of Car Werks, a used car lot in Missoula. He briefly testified at trial. This Court found Gawronski to be a credible witness. \u00b6 6 On Wednesday, July 24, 2013, Gawr onski was in a motorcycle accident.3 A car entered his lane of traffic and he swerved and laid his bike down in gravel.4 He estimates he was traveling 10 miles per hour.5 \u00b6 7 Gawronski suffered a cut and abrasions on his forehead and abrasions on his elbows.6 He went to see his prim ary health care provider on t he date of the accident, as he had a scheduled appointment, and she drove him to the walk-in clinic where he saw Meredith Ruland, PA-C.7 He received 14 stiches to close the cut on his forehead.8 That evening, Gawronski informed Ruland that he developed aches and pains as the day wore on and discovered a large bruise on his left hip.9 Ruland advised him to return to the clinic if his symptoms worsened or did not improve.10 \u00b6 8 At trial, Gawronski agr eed with the characterization of his motorcycle injuries as \"superficial.\" \u00b6 9 Gawronski reported to work the next day, but was told to take time off because of his appearance. He returned to work t he following Monday and resumed his normal working hours. \u00b6 10 On July 30, 2013, Ruland left Gawronski a voice message to phone her with an update on his condition.11 There is no indication in Ruland's records that Gawronski ever 2 All Findings herein are taken from trial testimony unless otherwise noted. 3 Ex. 3a. 4 Id. 5 Id. 6 Id. 7 Id. 8 Ex. 3b. 9 Ex. 3c. 10 Id. 11 Ex. 3d. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 5 responded. On August 2, 2013, Gawronski retu rned to the clinic to have the stitches removed.12 The medical record from that da y does not mention an y ongoing problems.13 \u00b6 11 On September 5, 2013, Gawronski was in a car accident while showing an SUV to a customer. The vehicle was stopped and he was turned in his seat, talking to the customer behind him in the rear seat. The cu stomer's father was in the front passenger seat. The SUV was rear-ended by another vehicl e, causing Gawronski to hit the steering wheel and then bounce back and hit the head rest. After the accident he returned to the car lot, completed the deal on the damaged car and then sought medical treatment. That was Gawronski's last day of work at Car Werks. \u00b6 12 Gawronski sought treatment that afternoon at an urgent care c linic, complaining of back and neck pain.14 Carla C. Fritz, MD, noted that Gawronski was moving \"stiffly\" and prescribed pain medication and muscle relaxers, and stated that he should not work if he found the medicine \"too sedating.\"15 \u00b6 13 Gawronski returned to Dr . Fritz on September 12, 2013.16 The medical record from that day states: \"His lower back is still very sore as is his right neck/shoulder region.\"17 Dr. Fritz noted, \"The medici ne he is taking makes him very sleepy and he cannot work.\"18 The record further states that Gawronski had a tight trapeziu s muscle on the right, tender with palpation, and was very t ender in the upper lumbar/lower thoracic paraspinal muscles.19 Dr. Fritz advised him: \"No work until pain reduced and range of motion improved.\"20 He was referred for physical therapy to decrease pain and increase movement/range of motion.21 \u00b6 14 Gawronski continued treati ng, but the records reflect t hat he continued to have low-back and neck pain.22 12 Ex. 3e. 13 Id. 14 Ex. 4. 15 Ex. 4a. 16 Ex. 5. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Ex. 5a. 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Exs. 6, 8, 9 & 10. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 6 \u00b6 15 On January 21, 2014, Denise R. Llov et, FNP, CNM, wrote a prescription for Gawronski for chiropractic evaluation and treatm ent of low-back and neck pain for injuries sustained in a car accident while working.23 The record shows t hat Gawronski attended chiropractic sessions at Matz Family Chiropr actic from February 11, 2014, through March 31, 2014, during which time he was given acti ve trigger point treatment and achieved \"50% improvement.\"24 \u00b6 16 Gawronski filed a workers' compensati on claim for the injuries sustained in the accident. \u00b6 17 At the time of the car a ccident, Car Werks was uninsured.25 \u00b6 18 On June 3, 2014, the UEF accept ed liability for Gawronski's claim.26 The UEF notified Car Werks that it would be required to reimburse it for all benefits paid or to be paid to Gawronski.27 \u00b6 19 Car Werks notified the UEF that it was di sputing the acceptance of liability on the grounds that Gawronski was actually injured in the motorcycle accident.28 \u00b6 20 John Holmes testified via telephone from the Montana St ate Prison. Since Holmes testified via telephone, this Court cannot make a finding as to his credibility.29 Although this Court could not observe Holmes' demeanor, he made it clear to this Court that he 23 Ex. 11. 24 Exs. 11h-11u. 25 Pretrial Order at 1. 26 Id. at 2. 27 Petitioner CarWerks's [sic] Responses to Third Party Respondent Gawronski's Motion for Summary Judgment (Car Werks' Responses) , Ex. 1, Docket Item No. 22. 28 Car Werks' Responses, Exs. 2 & 4; Notice of Appeal, Docket Item No. 1. 29 See Bonamarte v. Bonamarte , 263 Mont. 170, (explaining that M.R.Evid. 611(e) usually requires in-per son testimony, that requiring a perso n to testify in person serves many important policies and purposes, and that a fact finder cannot make a determination of the credibility of a witness who testifies via telephone); see also City of Missoula v. Duane , 2015 MT 232, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20, 3 80 Mont. 290, 355 P.3d 729 (holding that testimony via Skype is permissible under M.R.Evid. 611(e) because, \"While telephone testimony presents the listener with a disembodied voice and no clue as to the demeanor of the witness, Skyp e allows the court and jury to observe and hear the testimony of t he witness firsthand\"). Car Werks had init ially informed this Court that Holmes would testify via videoconference. However, five days befor e trial, Car Werks' attorney told this Court that he was having trouble arranging for Holmes' video testimony and re quested permission to have Holmes testify via telephone. In e-mail correspondence dated June 25, 2015 (Docket Item No. 30), this Court advised the parties that it was willing to travel to see Holmes testify vi a videoconference. This Court cited Bonamarte in its e-mail. However, Car Werks had Holmes testify telephonically and there was no ob jection by either Gawronski or the UEF. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 7 was adverse to Gawronski. Holmes made the poi nt of stating that Gawronski got him into \"trouble\" and referenced a federal indictm ent, indicating bias against Gawronski. \u00b6 21 Holmes \u2014 who had previously helpe d Palmer repossess cars and had past dealings with Gawronski \u2014 was incarcerat ed from August 2013 until March 2014. According to Holmes, he met Gawronski at a bar in Missoula a couple of weeks after he was released, even though he was not supposed to be in any establishment that served alcohol. Holmes could not re call the date of their meeting with any specificity; he stated that it was \"right after winte r.\" Holmes testified that he met with Gawronski because Gawronski was claiming that Holmes still ow ed him money for guns that Gawronski had sold him. Holmes testified that during t hat meeting, Gawronski stated he had been injured in his motorcycle accident but \"was trying to get money from Mr. Palmer from a car accident after the motorcycle accident . . . .\" Holmes was unsure of many of the dates, but said: \"Alls [sic] I know is he had that motorcycle accident first. Then he was driving Jack Palmer \u2014 Jack's cars and got in a wreck in a car. Then he said he's claiming the injuries from \u2014 and they really started from the motorcycle accident, and he was claiming them on Jack's car lot's insurance.\" Holmes testified that no one el se was present, that nothing else was discussed during their m eeting, and that he had not spoken to Gawronski since. \u00b6 22 Holmes testified that he met with Palmer \"a couple mont hs\" after his conversation with Gawronski. Holmes testif ied that Palmer st ated Gawronski was \"suing him\" and that he then told Palmer what Gawronski had alle gedly told him about his injuries. When asked during cross-examinatio n if his meeting with Palmer was in June 2014, Holmes agreed that that sounded correct. Holmes first testified that no one else was present, but then testified that Palmer's father may have been there, though he was not sure. \u00b6 23 After this meeting, Palmer prepared a swor n statement for Holmes to sign. Holmes signed a statement under oath, stating: To whom this may concern. Under Oath I make this statement. I had a conversation with Jim Gawranski [sic] at the time he had an accident while he was on test drive with a custom er, he told me that he was going to sue Jack and his insurance company fo r injuries that he had already had from a motorcycle accident. He said it didn't matter because the insurance would end up paying for the injury, he thought he had been let go wrongfully and didn't care if it affected Jack and his car lot. He had sold me some automatic weapons and wanted me to pay him more money and he was doing whatever he had to do to get money. 30 30 Ex. 2. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 8 Holmes signed the statement.31 Palmer notarized t he statement and dated it November 22, 2014.32 \u00b6 24 Gawronski denied that he to ld Holmes that he was going to claim an injury in the auto accident when his injuries really ste mmed from his motorcycle accident. He deemed Holmes' claim regarding his alleged st atement a \"complete fabrication.\" \u00b6 25 This Court is not persuaded that Holm es' recitation of the content of his conversation with Gawronski is truthful. Although Holmes indicated that Gawronski had confided in him in the past and did not thin k that Holmes was on speaking terms with Palmer, it makes no sense that Gawronski would tell Holmes that he was defrauding Palmer's business at a meeting in which they were discussing their dispute over whether Holmes still owed Gawronski money for guns. Since the Court found Gawronski to be a credible witness, and since this Court gives no weight to Holmes' te stimony nor to his sworn statement, this Court finds that Gawronski did not tell Holmes that his injuries were actually sustained in the motorcycle accident. \u00b6 26 Jack Palmer testified at trial. The Court did not fi nd Palmer to be a credible witness. This Court was particularly troubled by two parts of Palmer's testimony. \u00b6 27 First, Palmer greatly ex aggerated when describing Gawr onski's injuries from his motorcycle accident in an attempt to bolster Ca r Werks' claim that Gawronski was actually injured in the motorcycle accident. Palm er, who saw Gawronski on the day of the motorcycle accident, testified that he was \"s hocked\" that Gawronski was not in the hospital. Palmer testified t hat Gawronski's head was \"split wide open.\" Palmer testified that Gawronski \"took an absolut e beating\" in the motorcycle accident, that he was \"beat to hell,\" and that the whole si de of Gawronski's body \"was bl ack and blue.\" Palmer went on to state that he personally had never seen anyone hurt that badly who was still able to walk around. According to Palmer, Gawron ski moved very slowly after the motorcycle accident because he was hurt and had not healed by the time of the car accident. \u00b6 28 The medical records do not reflect that Gawronski was anywhere near this injured in the motorcycle accident. Palmer coul d not explain the difference between his description of Gawronski's injuries and the medical report, other than to say that the medical providers must \"wear different glasse s than I wear.\" This Court is not persuaded that the medical prov iders understated Gawronski's condit ion and finds that if Gawronski 31 Id. 32 Id. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 9 was as injured in the motorcycle accident as Palmer claims, the providers would have noted that in their medical records. \u00b6 29 Second, Palmer's testimony did not mesh with Holmes'. Palm er testified that he had the conversation with Holmes about Gawr onski falsely claiming his motorcycle injuries on his workers' compensation claim \" within a month or two\" of Gawronski's car accident. Palmer then agreed that this testimony was consis tent with a sworn statement he signed33 as part of Car Werks' opposition to Gawronski's summary judgment motion, which states: 9. Around November 1, 2013, John Holmes came to Carwerks [sic] and indicated to Jack Palmer that Jim was falsifying the facts of his injury in the September 5, 2013 accident, and was doing it because Carwerks [sic] had terminated his employment wrongfu lly and he wanted to get back at Carwerks [sic] . . . .34 \u00b6 30 When asked at trial whether he was sure that his meeting with Holmes was around November 1, 2013, Palmer testif ied, \"If that's what I wrote down there, then that's exactly when it was.\" Palmer testified that he prepared the stat ement for Holmes to sign within \"a couple [of] weeks\" of thei r meeting. However, on cro ss-examination, when Palmer realized that his meeting wit h Holmes could not have been around November 1, 2013, because Holmes was incarcerated at that time, Palmer did not have a reasonable explanation. Instead, when pr essed on the discrepancy, he test ified, \"Whatever \u2014 I know the statement that he made was the statement that he signed that I not arized. That was the statement.\" On redirec t, Palmer merely stated that he must have gotten the dates wrong. \u00b6 31 While this Court knows that it can be di fficult to remember exact dates, this Court does not think Palmer made an i nadvertent mistake, given t he specificity of his sworn statement and his initial te stimony, and the large discr epancies between Palmer's testimony and Holmes'. Rather, this Court fi nds that Holmes and Palmer did not get their stories straight. \u00b6 32 Misty Knight, a claims examiner for the UEF, testified at trial. This Court found her to be a credible witness. \u00b6 33 Knight testified that she has more t han seven years of experience as a workers' compensation claims examiner. Her duties include determini ng which claims submitted to the UEF are compensable and then m anaging those accepted claims. Knight 33 Car Werks' Responses at 5. 34 Id. at 2. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 10 explained that she is trained to look for obj ective medical findings. She compared the First Report of Injury on Ga wronski's claim with the medi cal report generated on the day of his car accident and noted objective medi cal findings of decreas ed rotation and flexion in his neck.35 She also noted that the medical r eport stated he had never had issues with his back before.36 \u00b6 34 Knight noted that Gawronski was seen at the medical clinic a week later with no change in his symptoms. He was to remain off work until his pain was reduced and his range of motion improved.37 The Medical Status Form dat ed November 21, 2013, further assisted Knight in determining that Gawronski's claim was viable due to the radiculopathy diagnosis and the fact that t he medical provider continued to state that Gawronski should remain off work.38 \u00b6 35 Knight explained that when Gawronski was released to light-duty work by the Medical Status Form of December 15, 2013,39 she called Palmer to see if work was available. However, Palmer told Knight that he did not want Gawronski back. \u00b6 36 Knight knew that Palmer believed Gawr onski's injuries were the result of his motorcycle accident. Knight testified that she reviewed the medical record from July 24, 2013,40 the day of Gawronski's motorcycle acci dent, and considered his injuries minor. She also noted that Gawronski had no compla ints of back pain after that accident. \u00b6 37 Knight calculated Gawronski's wage loss benefits based on pay stubs she received from both Gawronski and Palmer . She received no informati on from any source that required her to recalculate t he wage loss benefits. She esti mated that the UEF has paid out approximately $45,000 on Ga wronski's claim. \u00b6 38 The parties mediated their dispute ov er the UEF's acceptance of liability. 35 Ex. 4a. 36 Ex. 4. 37 Ex. 5-5a. 38 Ex. 8. 39 Ex. 9. 40 Exs. 3a-3c. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 11 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \u00b6 39 This case is governed by the 2011 vers ion of the Montana Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) since that was the law in effect at the time of Gawronsk i's industrial accident.41 Issue One: Whether the UEF correctly accepted liability for Gawronski's claim. \u00b6 40 Section 39-71-520(2)(a), MCA, provides that afte r the mandatory mediation process, this Court has jurisdiction to reso lve a dispute over the UEF's determination on a claim. If the UEF has accepted liability for a claim and the uninsured employer disagrees with that determinati on, the uninsured employer has the burden of proving that the claim is noncompensable.42 \u00b6 41 Car Werks has not met its burden. Ca r Werks contends that the evidence shows that Gawronski's injuries stem from a moto rcycle accident on July 24, 2013, and not the car accident of September 5, 2013. Car Werks points to Ho lmes' testimony and affidavit in support of this contention. However, th is Court gave Holmes' testimony and affidavit no weight and found that Gawronski did not tell Holmes that his injuries were actually sustained in the motorcycle accid ent. Second, relying entirely on Palmer's testimony, Car Werks argues that the evidence shows that Gawronski was actually injured in the motorcycle accident. However, this Court di d not find Palmer's testimony credible. \u00b6 42 In contrast, the credible evidence shows that Gawronski suffered only superficial injuries in the motorcycle accident and that he was more seriously injured in the car accident. The medical records generated on t he day of Gawronski's car accident show that he sought treatme nt for an injury to his neck and ba ck consistent with the mechanism of the accident. As Gawronski explained, he was turned to speak to the rear seat passenger when the car was rear-ended, causing him to hit the steering wheel and then the head rest with the side of his neck. He was taken off work, prescribed medications, and received physical therapy and chiropractic treatments for months. The claims examiner testified credibly that the evidence pointed to a real injury for which Gawronski sought appropriate treatment, and the medical records cont ain evidence of objective medical findings in support of his workers' compensation claim. Ca r Werks did not offer 41 Ford v. Sentry Cas. Co. , 2012 MT 156, \u00b6 32, 365 Mont. 405, 282 P.3d 687 (citing Fleming v.

Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment - Page 12 any medical evidence that Gawronski's injuries were causally related to anything other than his industrial accident. 43 \u00b6 43 The evidence shows that Gawronski was injured in a work-related accident. The UEF correctly accepted liability for Gawronski's claim. Issue Two: Whether Car Werks is obl igated to indemnify the UEF for all benefits paid or payable with respect to Gawronski's claim. \u00b6 44 The UEF has a right of reimbursement from Car Werks for all benefits paid or to be paid to Gawronski pursuant to \u00a7 39- 71-504(1)(b), MCA, which states: The fund shall collect from an uninsu red employer an amount equal to all benefits paid or to be paid from the fund to or on behalf of an injured employee of the unins ured employer. \u00b6 45 This statute \"establishes a statutory liabi lity on the part of th e uninsured employer to reimburse the UEF.\"44 Car Werks has failed to show that Gawronski's claim was not compensable or that any of the benefits paid by the UEF to Gawronski were not appropriate. Car Werks is ther efore obligated to indemnify the UEF for all benefits paid or payable to Gawronski fo r his work-related accident. JUDGMENT \u00b6 46 The Uninsured Employers' Fund correctly accepted liability for the injured employee's claim. \u00b6 47 The uninsured employer - Car Werks - is obligated to the Un insured Employers' Fund for all benefits paid or payable fo r the injured employee's claim. \u00b6 48 Pursuant to ARM 24.5.348(2), this Judgment is certified as final and, for purposes of appeal, shall be considered as a notice of entry of judgment. /// 43 See Ford, \u00b6 49 (holding that medical causation must be proven through medical evidence and opinion). 44 Uninsured Employers' Fund v.
