Introduction The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Wuhan, China happened in January 2020. As the Chinese government adopted a decisive localized closure toisolate the source of infection, the mobile cabin hospital was established to treat mild and severe patients separately and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) participated on a largescale in the whole process as an antiepidemic measure. It successfully reduced the epidemic 's growth rate in China and soon the epidemic situation in China was under control.In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no special drugs and vaccines, the diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 using TCM and the integration of Chinese and Western medicine had become an important feature andadvantage of the Chinese plans. TCM participates in the control and treatment of the epidemic process on a large scale by effectively relieving symptoms, reducing the devel-opment of mild and general types to serious symptoms, improving the healing rate, reducing the mortality rate, and boosting recovery. 1Keywords COVID-19 late period of the epidemic postpandemic era TCMAbstract There are mainly following 10 aspects of the t rends in the development of international traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the late and postepidemic era. (1) Rehabilitationintervention of TCM in the recovery period is the focus of international TCM clinicalantiepidemic practice in the later stage of the epidemic. (2) The epidemic hasaccelerated the development of the internet toward high-tech online education andmedical care. (3) The epidemic has forced overseas TCM to transform from the\"agricultural era \"to the \"postindustrial era. \"(4) It has become a trend that the proportion of theory courses in online teaching will increase dramatically. (5) The limited number of practical training cou rses and the simultaneous online and of fline rotation of teaching will become a useful medium of exploration. (6) Online sharing ofhigh-quality courses can save costs and is also the direction of future development. (7)It will become the norm for the adoption of online TCM conferences that breaktraditional barriers of locale and time zone. (8) The renewal of the heavy TCM clinicaland teaching equipment is the trend of future development. (9) The involvement ofnance and venture capital will catalyze the development of the eld of corporate international chains of TCM and acupuncture. (10) Changes in the international political situation may affect the speed of the development of international Chinese medicine but will not stop its progress. received June 15, 2022 accepted after revisionAugust 26, 2022 article published online 2023DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0043-1762570.

However. notall the countries have the same opportunities and the time to enter the late stage of the epidemic depends on many factors such as the economic strength, medical level, national gov-ernance capabilities, and political decisions of countries to purchase vaccines. It is predicted that the epidemic in some countries may extend to the second half of 2023 or 2024.However, the late and postepidemic era has already become foreseeable. The epidemic has changed the way people live, work, and study and will also form inertia and impact the original methods before the epidemic. Research on the direction and trend of international Chinese medicine development in thelate and postepidemic era have been put on the agenda, and it is worthy of discussion and to think over carefully. Rehabilitation Intervention of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Recovery Period Isthe Focus of International Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinical Antiepidemic in the Late stage of the Epidemic Due to medical regulations overseas, TCM practitioners are not eligible to directly participate in the treatment of COVID-19. However, TCM rehabilitation intervention during the recoveryperiod will be the focus of international TCM clinical antiepi- demic medicine in the later stages of the epidemic. The sequelae of the recovery period account for approxi- mately 20% of the total number of patients. This includes conditions such as postviral fatigue, depression, pulmonary brosis, bromyalgia, heart failure, loss of smell, loss of taste, infertility, etc. Western medicine treatment is basically centered around the treatment of initial symptoms, andthe recovery of recovery period symptoms is not ideal. After the COVID-19 virus turns negative and the patient is discharged from the hospital, TCM practitioners can legallycarry out rehabilitation interventions during the recovery period. In addition to Chinese medicinals, TCM combined strategies such as Chinese psychology, acupuncture, massage,cupping, Qigong, Tai Chi, etc., as well as theoretical consider- such as \"syndrome differentiation may add the additional bene to f focusing on enhancing the immune system resistance. The Epidemic Has Accelerated the Development of Internet Toward High-Tech Online Education and Medical Care The epidemic has forced everyone to work from home or take online courses. Recently, several academics and their teams have used the \"Cloud Lecture \"method to deliver successful COVID-19 academic lectures on TCM treatment to TCM practitioners around the world, which greatly enhanced theghting spirit and con dence of overseas TCM practi-tioners. We have established the \"Canada Overseas Chinese TCM Online Consultation Service \"to facilitate online consul- tation for international students and Chinese expats. \"Express mail \"can solve the need for medical supplies, and technological advancements have developed \"noncon- tact remote auscultation \"and other equipment to assist online diagnosis. In my article which was published in 2015 and named \"The Top Ten Trends & Strategic Thinking of the International Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupunc- ture in the 21st Century ,\"I pointed out, \"With the further development of IT technology, the instant translation and conversion of different languages on the internet will become more mature and practical in a few years. TCMcan be taught by teachers in different countries. Due to the improvement of image recognition technology and the development of portable medical equipment, internetremote diagnosis and TCM treatment will gradually become a reality. This predicts that it will play a special role, especially in the TCM treatment for sub-health and longevitymedicine. Different types of WeChat groups nowadays have achieved a certain degree of professional exchange. 'Cloud Lecture 'provides free time and space for continuing educa- tion. \" 2These predictions have been accelerated in the epidemic situation. We believe that in the latter part of the pandemic and the postpandemic era, there will be a group of \"unicorns \"in the eld of general health and a promising growth in the TCM industry at home and abroad. T h eE p i d e m i cF o r c e sO v e r s e a sT r a d i t i o n a l Chinese Medicine to Transform from the Agricultural Era to the Postindustrial Era The characteristics of the agricultural era are based on self- sufciency and a self-management model. The characteristic of the industrial era is large-scale production and a collectivemindset with a need to cooperate with each other. The rapid development and application of IT in the postindustrial 5G era have cut the spatial distance between countries, andinstant translation has solved the problem of language barriers. Extensive information sharing has become the norm in people 's daily lives. Before the pandemic, overseas TCM practitioners opened clinics with the three- nger diagnosis technique and lived a life of self-suf ciency in the \"agricultural era. \"The character- agricultural era made overseas TCM practi- tioners more fragmented and independent of each other which at the same time, resulted in the lack of progressivemechanisms like discussing cases between peers in China. This sudden outbreak has forced everyone to learn to use postindustrial technologies such as online diagnosis andtreatment and directly bypass the industrial era and go from the agricultural era to the postindustrial era. In the process of paradigmatic \"leap frog, \"some people may not keep up and will end up being eliminated from the market. If we master and use the technology of the postindustrial era properly, it will make TCM stronger and allow it to go further. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).International TCM in the Late and Postpandemic Era Wu e30 It Has Become a Trend that the Proportion of Theory Courses in Online Teaching WillIncrease Exponentially People are forced to work and study at home due to the epidemic, and online teaching has become the only choice for teachers and students. In the beginning, teachers and stu- dents were not very comfortable. After more than a year,both teachers and students have not only adapted but also tasted the sweetness of home-based online learning. Remote learning can save a lot of time travelling to and from campus,especially in a sparsely populated country like Canada, this model will save people the inconvenience of daily transpor- tation and its associated costs in fuel and parking. For more than a year of online teaching, a complete set of learning, supervision, and assessment techniques and meth- ods have been established and perfected. All theoreticalcourses can be successfully implemented in online teaching. In the later stages of the epidemic, although students can return to school one after another to participate in face-to-face instruction, for safety reasons, students will be arranged to return to school in installments and batches, so some students still need to attend online courses at home. Even after entering the post-epidemic era, due to the inertia and advantages of online learning at home, the proportion of theoretical lessons remaining in online teaching is predicted tobe around 30% and the proportion of theoretical lessons in online teaching will continue to increase exponentially. This has already become a foreseeable trend. The Limited Number of Practical Training Courses and the Simultaneous Online and Offline Rotation of Teaching Are Useful Exploration During the epidemic, we divided the training courses into several groups and limited the number of people in eachgroup to 5 to 7 and conducted online and of fline simulta- neous teaching. For example, in the rst class, the rst group of students participated in face-to-face training in the class-room, while the second and third groups took the online classes at home; in the second class, the second group of students participated in face-to-face training in the class-room for practical training, rst reviewing the practical operation of the rst class and then learning this practical operation. The third group and the rst group studied online at home; in the third class, the third group of students participated in classroom face-to-face instruction for practi- cal training, reviewing the rst and second practical training operations rst, and then learning this practical operation. Therst and second groups learned online at home; in this cycle of learning, each student had face-to-face instructionopportunities for practical operations and kept a safe dis- tance for purposes of epidemic prevention. In the later stages of the epidemic and the post-epidemic era, the limited number of practical training courses and simultaneous online and of fline lectures in rotating groups are not only useful explorations during the epidemic, but forthose who have long distances such as 100 km to travel with each round trip taking 2 to 3 hours or more, and this mediumwill still be a useful choice. Online Sharing of High-Quality Courses Can Save Costs and Is Also the Direction of Future Development Online sharing of high-quality courses can save costs. For example, the branded courses of Ontario College of Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine are as follows: for the Tuina major\"Dr. Wu 's head massage; \"for acupuncture majors, \"and \"Basic Chinese Medicine; \"and so on. When teaching, students of Toronto City Branch School and Mark- ham City Branch School can participate at the same time which can save teaching costs and facilitate the promotionand dissemination of high-quality courses. Many colleges and universities are projected to share high-quality courses in online middle schools, which willbecome one of the trends and directions in the later stages of the epidemic and the future development of international Chinese medicine education. It Will Become the Norm for Online Traditional Chinese Medicine Conferences to Break Through the Barriers of Locale and Time Zone Before the epidemic, the international TCM conference was a face-to-face communication. Due to various factors, such as the region, time, and visa of each country, the desired result of international sharing was dif cult to achieve. During the epidemic, to promote epidemic prevention, the international TCM conference was changed to an online for- mat, thus breaking through barriers associated with region and time zone and eliminating the trouble of visa uncertainty. For example, from August 29th to 30th, 2020, our college andYunnan University of TCM successfully held the \"2020 Canadi- an Acupuncture and TCM Continuing Education Conference, \" and from August 28th to 29th, 2021, the three parties of ourcollege and Hebei Universityof TCM and Yiling Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd. jointly successfully held the \"2021 Canadian Acupunc- ture and TCM Continuing Education Conference, \"and used the time difference between Canada and China to create a 24 hour a day new conference model in which the main venues in the eastern and Western hemispheres take turns to host. It is foreseeable that in the late and postepidemic eras it will become the norm for the online and of fline international TCM conferences, and it will also be the trend and directionof future development. The Renewal of the Heavy Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinical and Teaching Equipment Is the Trend of Future Development Compared with Western medicine, TCM is simpler in both clinical and teaching equipment and lacks heavy equipment updates. Western medicine 's heavy equipment such as X-ray, Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 3 No. 1/2023 \u00a9 2023. The Author(s).International TCM in the Late Era Wu e31 color Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc. makes patients feel more intuitiveand objective than TCM 's observation, smell, inquiry, and touch. Modernization is not the patent of Western medicine, and TCM should actively use modern technologies as much as possible. Fortunately, in recent years, a multitude of clinical and teaching equipment has been developed in combinationwith multiple disciplines, such as the English/Chinese bilin- gual materials used in clinical teaching purchased by our College \"3D TCM Meridian and Acupoint Anatomy Platform, \" English/Chinese bilingual \"TCM Pulse Apparatus \"and \"TCM Tongue Surface Apparatus. \" The renewal of TCM teaching equipment has armed TCM teaching even more powerfully. It will also change the outside world 's perception of backward TCM technology and poor equipment. TCM clinical and teaching hardware updates arethe trend and the only way for future development. The Involvement of Finance and Venture Capital Will Catalyze the Development of the International Chains of TraditionalChinese Medicine and Acupuncture With the development of overseas TCM and acupuncture today, we have the conditions to form an international chainof TCM and acupuncture clinics. This epidemic has made TCM a global topic and will develop rapidly if nance and venture capital are involved. For nearly half a century, TCM and acupuncture have been developed in the form of individual, professional households overseas. The investment threshold is low, and it is not easyto be valued by nance and venture capital. The key was that the industry had no legislation. Nearly 10 years have passed, the\"right time \"has been formed. The \"geographical advan- tage \"for such a project should be in countries like Canada, the United States, and Australia who have (partial) insurancecoverage. Financial and venture capital will inject the indus- try with vitality and talented management groups will integrate scattered but reputable clinics, it will form achained and listed industry. It is expected to be established in 5 to 8 years and to take shape in 10 to 15 years. After the epidemichaspassed, asnationalpolicy favors TCM and acupuncture, it is expected to accelerate the development of the international chain of TCM and acupuncture. Changes in the International Political Situation May Affect the Speed of the Development of International ChineseMedicine, But Will not Stop Its Progress The development of overseas TCM has gone through three stages: germination, development, and maturity. The TCM acupuncture legislation of the host country is a sign of its maturity. On February 28, 2022, the \"black swan \"incident of The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act broke out in Ontario, Canada. The provincial parliament passed the rst readingof The TraditionalChinese Medicine RepealAct intheby-law 5 of the 2022 Act No. 88 Labor Law . There should be no change inthefollowingdays becausetheproposed ruling partyhas a majority in the provincial assembly, it would have quickly passed the second and third readings and become a new law. IfThe Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act passed, it would have repealed the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act 2006 , which has been in place for 16 years, would have revoked the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practi-tioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO), which was established in 2013 and has been in operation for nine years, and would have allowed untrained individuals inva-sive acupuncture under the dermis and mucous membranes, as well as diagnostics and treatments that are unique toTCM, would have directly threatened public safety and removedTCM and acupuncture from the 26 regulated health care professions in Ontario, forcing TCM practitioners to be posi- tioned as ordinary skilled workers. The act of The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act was of course met with strong opposition from the TCM and acu- puncture industry, the public recipients of these services, andall sectors of society, as well as large-scale law-protecting actions. From the incident on February 28 to March 7, it took only 7 days because of the industry 's resistance to turn the \"crisis \"into an \"opportunity \"for development; the provincial government revoked The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Actand canceled the original plan of the dissolution of CTCMPAO, and decided to set up a Chinese Language quali - cation examination for TCM acupuncturists in Ontario, pro- tecting the TCM act has achieved a complete victory. Thisshows that the successive legislation of TCM in various coun- tries is the historical trend of the development of international TCM, and the international political situation will only speedup its development and will not stop its progress. Crisis is also an opportunity for development. The epi- demic has caused many people to lose their jobs and need to switch to another industry to study again. The TCM educa- tion industry can develop against the trend. For example,Ontario College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is approved by the Canadian Federal Department of Immigration to recruit international students, and the students enjoy thesame treatment as public universities and can obtain the government 's student loan funding. During the epidemic, Ontario College of Traditional Chi- nese Medicine recruited more new students than in previous years. In the later and postepidemic eras, the unemployed needed to switch jobs and study again. People pay moreattention to the health of themselves and their family members. We believe that the TCM education industry can buck the trend and its development will continue with lots ofspace for improvement. Conclusion In the last century, Nixon 's visit to China in 1972 was the rst climax of Chinese medicine going to the world. Nearly half acentury has passed, 67 countries have recognized the legal status of TCM and acupuncture and 183 countries in the world are applying TCM.
