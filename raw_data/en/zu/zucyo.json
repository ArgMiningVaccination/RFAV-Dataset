After my first session with Dr.Khalsa I felt I was really heard, and when I began implementing the things he suggested, I felt better immediately.\" - N.K.,Princeton, NJ \"I never could have endured the recent loss of my daughter without the healing of Doctor and Mrs. Khalsa. Dr. Khalsa is not only a gifted Chiropractor but a gifted healer as well. If you desire wellness and wholeness, just allow these facilitators to do their work. The journey is beyond my greatest expectations. I've never felt so nurtured and cared for.\" - J.S., New Hope, PA \"When I arrived at Dr. Khalsa's office, I was in extreme pain. I had been going to a doctor for five years and had the opportunity to read brochures in the waiting room on how Temporal Mandibular Joint Pain could be managed. Dr. Khalsa lived up to the accounts of the literature and went far beyond them to initiate my healing. It seems almost a lifetime yet is only two years that I met this physician who could adjust my neck without further hurting my jaw, who helps me release what clenched my jaw in the first place, and who helped me fashion a healthier, happier life.\" - G.A.K., Trenton, NJ \"We often wondered if we would forever feel the physical and emotional pains of life.
