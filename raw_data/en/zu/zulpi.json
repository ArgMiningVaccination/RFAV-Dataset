Message From Superintendent Rundle District News Mercer Island High School Administrative Assistant Kristin Brintnall led a tour of the high school on Thursday, September 7, for graduates from the class of 1968. Wonder, worry, accomplishment, apprehension...joy. I flew home on Sunday night after dropping my oldest child off at college. I had many emotions to keep me occupied. Those of you who have already watched children move out, you know the feelings all too well. Whether children graduate and pursue college, careers, service, or travel, this is quite the experience. And for those of you with younger children, the moment seems so distant but it is not. Wherever we are in our journey as a parent/guardian, I recognize that it is not easy.
