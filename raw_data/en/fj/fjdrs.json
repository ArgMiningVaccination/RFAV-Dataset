THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 2000HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM,Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:37 a.m., in room2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon.

If I could have your attention, please. I know a lotof people have cameras, and I hate to throw a wet blanket on thoseof you who want to take some pictures, but unless you are a mem-ber of the media, I wish you would not take any pictures duringthe hearing. We will try to get the people you want to take picturesof together later; but please do not take a bunch of pictures duringthe meeting because it will probably disrupt what we are trying toaccomplish.Good morning. A quorum being present, the Committee on Gov-ernment Reform will come to order.I ask unanimous consent that all Members' and witnesses open-ing statements be included in the record. Without objection, so or-dered.I also ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, and ex-traneous or tabular material referred to be included in the record.Without objection, so ordered.We do have some Members who have opening statements, andwe will allow those, and if they do not choose to give an opening(1) 2statement and want to prepare one for the record, that will be fineas well.This morning we are here to talk about autism. As we learnedin our August hearing, the rates of autism have escalated dramati-cally in the last few years. What used to be considered a rare dis-order has become a near epidemic. We have received hundreds ofletters from parents across the country. In fact, here are some note-books, and each one of the pages represents a parent who has aproblem with a child with autism.They have shared with us their pain and their challenges. Mystaff tells me that some of them cried when they read some of theselettersand I have a pretty hard-nosed staff.I do not have to read a letter to experience the kind of heart-break that is in these letters. I see it in my own family. I am veryproud of this picture. The one on the left is my grand-daughter,who almost died after receiving a hepatitis B shot. Within a shortperiod of time, she quit breathing, and they had to rush her to thehospital.My grandson, Christian, whom you see there with his head onher shoulder, according to the doctors was going to be about 6-foot-10we anticipated having him support the family by being anNBA starbut unfortunately, after receiving nine shots in 1 day,the MMR and the DTaP shot and the hepatitis B, within a veryshort period of time, he quit speaking, ran around banging hishead against the wall, screaming, hollering, waving his hands, andbecame a totally different child. We found out that he was autistic.He was born healthy. He was beautiful and tall. He was outgoingand talkative. He enjoyed company and going places. Then, he hadthose shots, and our lives and his life changed.I do not want to read all the things that happened to Christian,because I am not sure I could get through it. But unfortunately,what happened to Christian is not a rare, isolated event. ShelleyReynolds will testify today. Her organization, Unlocking Autism,will be displaying thousands of pictures of autistic children at the\"Hear Their Silence\" autism rally this Saturday.Forty-seven percent of the parents who provided these picturesfeel that their children's autism is linked to the immunizationsalmost half. We frequently hear about the children with chronic earinfections and children who became autistic after spiking a feverwith their vaccinations. Liz Birt was one of the hundreds of par-ents who contacted us.- Her 5-year-old son Matthew has been classi-fied as autistic. He was developing normally. At age 15 months, fol-lowing his MMR vaccine, he began to regress. Since the time of hisvaccination, he has had chronic diarrhea. This is his pictureagood-looking kid.This is very prevalent, this chronic diarrhea, in autistic children.Matthew also did not sleep on a regular basis for over 3 years. Liztook her son to numerous gastroenterologists in prominent medicalfacilities in the United States with no resolution. Finally, this pastNovember, Liz took her son to London, to the Royal Free Hospital.A team of medical experts there examined Matthew. They felt thathe had a bowel obstruction. To the family, this seemed impossiblesince he had constant diarrhea. An x-ray indicated that Matthewhad a fecal mass in his colon the size of a cantaloupe. After the ob- 3struction was cleared with laxatives, Matthew underwent an en-doscopy and colonoscopy. The lesions in Matthew's bowel testedpositive for the measles virus.Dr. Andrew Wakefield and Professor John O'Leary will be testi-fying today. Their research has uncovered a possible connection be-tween inflammatory bowel disorder in children with autism who re-ceive the MMR vaccine and have measles virus in their small intes-tines.Since coming home from England and being treated for chronicinflammatory bowel disorder, Matthew has finally begun to sleepthrough the night. I know that is a welcome relief for his family.Unfortunately, Matthew's story is not that unusual in childrenwith autism. Our grandson has a similar problem. Unfortunately,it is important that I make two things very clear today. I, and Ibelieve every Member of Congress, am not against vaccinations,and I do not think that every autistic child acquires autism afterreceiving childhood immunizations.I think slide 3 shows a lot of children who have had autismis that correctthose are before-and-after pictures of the children.However, there is enough evidence emerging of some kind of con-nection for some children that we cannot close our eyes to itwehave to learn more.Dr. Mary Megson of Richmond, VA will testify about the correla-tion she has seen in children with autism and attention deficit dis-order. She has seen a correlation between Vitamin A depletion andimmune suppression after receiving the MMR vaccination.There are certainly children who are born with autism. Theyhave what can be called \"classical autism.\" There is, however, agrowing number of children who are growing normally and then ac-quire autism, or \"atypical autism.\"There most probably is a genetic component to autism, but genet-ics is not the only issue. Many children seem to have severe foodsensitivities, particularly to gluten and casein, ingredients in themost common foods, dairy and wheat. Many of these children showsigns of autism shortly after receiving their immunizations. Someof these children, as we will hear from Jeana Smith, have metaltoxicities, aluminum and mercury. What is the source of these toxicsubstances?Dr. Goldberg will testify that maybe what we are seeing is notautism at all, but a neuro-immunologic dysfunction.I am very concerned about the increased number of childhoodvaccines. I am concerned about the ingredients that are put inthese vaccines. I am concerned about the way they are given. Wehave learned that most of the vaccines our children are given con-tain mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. Last year, the FDAadded up the amount of mercury our babies are being given tolearn that in the first 6 months of life, they receive more mercurythan is considered safe. Think about thatin the first 6 months oflife, the FDA has said that children are receiving more mercurythan is considered safe, and most of that is from vaccinations. Whyis it that the FDA licenses vaccines that contain neurotoxins likemercury and aluminum?When asked about the increased rates of autism, many will im-mediately discount that there is even an increaseeven though the Alatest statistics from the Departinent of Education show increasedrate in every, single State. This slide shows you that every Statehas seen a dramatic increase.Others will say the increase is due to better diagnostic skills.Others will say it is because the diagnostic category was expanded.If we look at the slide showing California here, California has re-ported a 273 percent increase in children with autism since 1988.From this increase, 21 percent of all autistic children in Californialive in the 29th District, which is Henry Waxman's district, who isthe ranking Democrat on our committee.Florida has reported a 571 percent increase in autism. Marylandhas reported a 513 percent increase between 1993 and 1998. Youcannot attribute all of that to better diagnostic skills.In 1999, there are 2,462 children ages 3 to 21 in Indiana diag-nosed with autism. That is one-fourth of 1 percent of all the schoolchildren in Indiana, or 1 out of every 400; 23 percent of these chil-dren live in my district, the 6th District of Indiana.This increase is not just better counting. If we want to find acure, we must first look to the cause. We must do this now, beforeour health and education systems are bankrupted, and before moreof our Nation's children are locked inside themselves with this dis-ease.Kenneth Curtis, part of \"Dave's Morning Show\" at Oldies 100FM here in Washington, will set the stage by talking about beingthe parent of an autistic child. He will be followed by JamesSmythe, of Carmel, IN. He will share how, through properly look-ing at autism as an illness and addressing that illness, his son isimproving.Scott Bono, from North Carolina, lives close to one of the finestmedical facilities in the worldDuke University. However, he hasbeen unable to find medical experts to properly address his autisticson's needs. He is forced to drive 12 hours every 4 weeks for hisson's medical treatments.Dr. William Dankner, the father of a 13-year-old daughter withautism, and a scientist, will testify about the challenges of findingtherapies and treatments that have adequate research. He will alsotalk about the battle of getting adequate education through thepublic school system. I think all of us who have autistic childrenor grandchildren know the problems that it involves.We hear repeatedly that parents are not informed at the time ofdiagnosis by their school system what educational options an autis-tic child is entitled to. It is only after hiring lawyers and goingthrough the legal process that many children have access to appro-priate educational opportunities. We are learning that the earlierautism is diagnosed and treatments are begun, the better it is forthe child. Indiana is fortunate to have the First Steps Early Inter-vention System, a nationally recognized system that provides earlyintervention services for children up to 2 years of age.Families are forced to spend huge sums of money out-of-pocketeven when they have good insurance, because autism is often spe-cifically excluded. We need to talk to State legislators around thiscountry to tell them how important it is, with the explosion of au-tism, that these benefits be mandated by the States and be coveredby insurance. 5California passed legislation recently to require insurance compa-nies to cover autism. Parents spend $20,000 to $30,000 a year.What medical care is covered is often done after extensive struggleswith insurance companies.We have a long hearing scheduled today with a broad spectrumof ideas presented. We will have a variety of medical approachespresented. We will hear about secretin, which gained a great dealof media attention in the past year and from which many parentshave seen tremendous success.Dr. John Up ledger, a former adviser to the Office of AlternativeMedicine at the National Institutes of Health, will testify on theuse of craniosacral therapy. He is the director of the Up ledger In-stitute in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. For more than 25 years, Dr.Up ledger has been treating autistic children and helping familiesthrough this approach. Craniosacral therapy is a gentle, powerfulform of body work that directly influences the brain and spinalcord. It is used to treat pain, discomfort, or trauma to the head orface, including TMJ dysfunction and headaches. Craniosacral ther-apy can also relieve physical and emotional trauma.In addition to his work with autism, Dr. Up ledger has achieveddramatic results in treating post-traumatic stress disorder in Viet-nam veterans.In addition to medical treatments for the physical symptoms ofautism, there are numerous therapies that are needed to help au-tistic children. Special educational approaches are needed that caninclude intensive behavior modification, known as ABA, Lovass,music therapy, speech therapy, auditory integration and sensoryintegration, as well as play therapy.We will hear from both the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention and the National Institutes of Health about ongoing re-search and future needs. Of particular interest is the Brick Town-ship study which has been evaluating a cluster of autism in NewJersey.This hearing will raise more questions than we can answertoday. We owe it to our children and to our grandchildren to ensurethat we are being diligent in looking for the causes of autism. Wehave to do everything humanly possible to determine if there issomething that can be done to unlock our children from the prisonthat they are in as a result of autism. I think that as a top priority,we have to do much more research on the potential connection be-tween vaccines and autism. We cannot stick our heads in the sandand ignore this possibility.If we do not take action now, 10 years from now, it may be toolate, not only for this generation of children, but for our taxpayer-funded health and education systems, which could collapse fromtrying to care for all of these children.The hearing record will remain open for 2 weeks.I now yield to my colleague from California, Mr. Waxman, for hisopening statement.Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.I am glad we are having this hearing today on autism. We stillhave many questions about autismwhat causes it; what are thesafest and most effective treatments; is there a way to prevent it;how many people in the country suffer from autism? 6We do know some things about autism. We know there is a ge- netic component to autism. There have been some dramatic discov-eries recently in the genetics of autism like the discovery of theFragile X gene and the gene that causes Rett syndrome. We knowthat autism most likely develops very early during fetal develop-ment. We also know that parents are not to blame for autism. Wehave come a long way from the time when fathers and motherswere led to believe that they had done something to cause theirchildren's autism, leaving them with needless and destructive guilt.But I also understand that this hearing was called to consider a theory that certain vaccines cause autism. From my discussions with medical experts, scientists, and the autism community, it isclear that this is only a theory. As the American Medical Associa-tion concluded recently, \"Scientific data does not support a causal association between vaccination and autism.\"I believe that we need to increase our efforts to understand thecauses of autism. In this search, no possible cause, including vac-cines, should be off the table. That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R.3301, which would provide additional funding at NIH for researchinto what causes autism, how many people suffer from autism, andhow best to treat those who have autism.But in this process, we must not get ahead of the science or raise false alarms. At every hearing in this Congress that this committeehas held touching on childhood immunizations, I have made a point of emphasizing the tremendous public health value of immuniza-tion. More Americans have been saved by vaccines than by any other medical intervention. Across the globe, 2.5 million childrendie every year from childhood diseases; another 750,000 are crip-pled by these diseases. But American children are shielded fromthis death and misery by their vaccinations.During my 25-year career in Congress, my focus has been on im-proving health care, especially for children. When I was chairmanof the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the CommerceCommittee from 1979 to 1994, we worked constantly to expandNIH research into childhood diseases. I have continued to fight formore research, better treatments, and coverage while I have beenin the minority. During countless hearings and many legislativebattles, I have heard over and over again about the pain of parentswhose children suffer from debilitating diseases.So I sympathize with the parents who are here today. I knowhow painful and how hard it must be for you as parents to havechildren who appear to be developing normally and then, all of asudden, seemingly out of nowhere, stop communicating and stopdeveloping.We need to do everything we can to give these parents here andother parents around the country answers. There is still much tolearn. In medicine the best answers come from research that canwithstand the rigors of the scientific method. These standards havebeen developed in order to find the truth. If research has been con-ducted with control groups, and the results have been independ-ently validated, then that gives parents meaningful informationabout what causes a disease or a condition and what the best treat-ments are. 7Parents and doctors need the best possible information so thatthey can make the best possible decisions regarding their children'shealth.There are lots of experts and groups that are knowledgeableabout this issue but who were not invited to testify today. Thesegroups include Dr. Louis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health andHuman Services, and current president of the Morehouse School ofMedicine; Dr. Isabelle Rapin, from the Albert Einstein College ofMedicine; the American Public Health Association; the AmericanMedical Association, and the National Network for ImmunizationInformation. At this time I would ask unanimous consent that allof their statements be entered into the record.Mr. BURTON. Without objection, so ordered.[The information referred to follows:] Statement of Congressman James C. Greenwoodto the 762-7711 Chairman Burton, I appreciate the lead you have taken on behalf of the parents andvictims of Autism, and for holding this hearing today. Autism truly is a silent epidemic.Your commitment to understanding the origins of autism are laudable and directly pointto a need for a greater federal commitment to epidemiological and basic clinical researchto get to the root cause of this devastating developmental disorder.Because we don't know what causes Autism, Congressman Chris Smith and myself havespearheaded legislative efforts to improve surveillance of the disease and enhance federalresearch to prevent, treat and one day cure this developmental disorder.Autism is a severe, lifelong neurological disorder that usually manifests in childrenduring the first two years of life and causes severe impairment in language, cognition andcommunication. For over forty years autism was thought to be an emotional disordercaused by trauma or bad parenting. This tragic mistake resulted in the loss of an entiregeneration of children to medical progress. Now that we know that autism is, in fact, amedical disorder for which medical treatments and a cure can and will be found, we mustdevote appropriate resources.It is the third most common developmental disorder to affect children, following mentalretardation and cerebral palsy. Autism currently affects over 400,000 individuals in theU,S. and I in every 500 children born today. Autism is more prevalent than Downsyndrome, childhood cancer or cystic fibrosis.Some evidence links the disorder to environmental factors, as evidenced by autism\"clusters\" located in and around Chris Smith's district. Others point to genetic causes,and still some point to a combination of the two. Finally, some believe passionately thatvaccines cause autism. The bottom line is that we just don't know. It might bevaccinations. but it might not.The good news is that vaccines, one of the greatest medical accomplishments everachieved, are available and are the best line of defense against many infectious diseases. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 9 Due to the use of vaccines, smallpox has been eliminated, polio is nearly wiped outand, if immunization rates remain high, the eradication of the measles, pertussis andrubella are close. Millions of lives have been saved through vaccination and countlesschildren have been sparred the pain and suffering of diseases like diphtheria, smallpoxand polio that plagued our nation only a generation ago.Leading health organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), American Medical Association (AMA),American Academy of. Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians(AAFP) recommend routine immunization against numerous vaccine preventablediseases.Advances in medicine have given us the gift to forget the devastating effects of diseases,including polio and small pox. Yet diseases just as ruinous and easily preventable arevery real for millions of people today throughout the world. Scientific evidence indicatesthat side effects associated with vaccination are extremely rare and we cannot assume thatadverse events associated with vaccination are necessarily caused by the vaccine.Furthermore, there has been no data or scientific proof to link vaccines to serious adverseevents, including autism.That is why we need to consider and quickly pass H.R. 3301, the Children's HealthResearch and Prevention Amendments, currently before the Commerce Committee.Briefly, the bill will expand research and prevention activities in a number of childhooddiseases, but with specific respect to autism, the legislation will:.Create up to five Centers of Excellence for autism. These university sites wouldcombine clinical and basic research in autism, draw the attention of the nation'stop scientists, and exist as part of a network that enables findings to be rapidlydisseminated and replicated. This exact approach has been very effective inAlzheimer's and childhood leukemia.Create a centralized and open facility for gene and brain banking. These areessential for scientific progress in autism.Develop an awareness campaign for the public and physicians. Greater awarenessmeans earlier diagnosis that can lead to better outcomes and more independentpeople. Currently, some physicians often do not understand autism or know howto diagnose it, thus losing valuable months, and sometimes years, of potentiallycritical treatment.Bring together the resources of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers BEST COPYAVAILABLE 10 for Disease Control (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) to attack the problem of autism.We need to pass this bill to begin to unravel the mystery of autism. Parents and theirchildren expect nothing less. Once again, Chairman Burton, thank you for raising thisissue and for all your work on behalf of parents and children. 11 Statements from Health Care Professionals and Medical Associations\"Scientific evidence does not support a causal association between vaccination and autism.\"The theoretical causes of autism rule out vaccination as a causal factor.\"-American Medical Association\"The best available science indicated that the development of autism is completely unrelated touse of the MMR or any other vaccine...In fact, the best evidence demonstrates that autism resultsfrom complex genetic factors and therefore originates prior to birth, not afterward.\"-Louis W. Sullivan, M.D., former Secretary of Health and HumanServices\"The lack of data to support a connection between vaccine and autism makes sense given theincreasing body of information concerning when the neurobiological differences associated withautism first occur. The preponderance of evidence tells us that autism happens to our childrenbefore birth, not after.\"-The National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR)\"Allegations that vaccination causes autism represent unsubstantiated claims which have not beensupported by credible science. Yes, there is need for continuing research on causes, preventionand treatment of autism. In the meantime, it would be tragic if parents avoid fully immunizingtheir children for fear of causing autism.\"-Isabelle Rapin, M.D. Professor, Neurology and Pediatrics,Albert Einstein College of Medicine\"Our conclusion, based on the findings of our study, is that there is no evidence of a causalassociation between MMR vaccine and autism.\"\"In our study we showed that the increase in the prevalence of diagnosed autism in recent birthcohorts occurred during a time when the coverage of MMR vaccine in the same cohorts has beenconstant. The rise cannot therefore be related to the use of MMR vaccine.\"-Dr. Elizabeth Miller and Dr. Paddy (1999; 353:2026-20).\"While PKIDs advocates for additional resources for autism research, it does not condone thespread of false and misleading information linking autism to childhood vaccination. PKIDsstrongly encourages parents to continue immunizing their children with scientifically proven safeand effective vaccines.\"-Parents of Kids with Infections Diseases (PKIDs)\"We also feel it is our obligation to make clear that the current scientific evidence shows thatautism is not related to immunizations.\"-National Network for Immunization Information BEST COPY AVAILABLE 12 >,National Coalition ft,* Adult Immunization March 31, 20004733 BurtonChairman, Committee on Government ReformUnited States House of Represimmtives2157 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515 Dear Representative Burton:The National Coalition for Adult Immunization (NCAI) is deeply concerned that the congressional hearings onvaccine safety may exacerbate false perceptions of risks associated with vaccines.We recognim the importance of utilizing immunizations to protect AmericanS of all ages against vaccine-preventable diseases. The viruses and bacteria that cause these diseases continue tu exi and cause significant ratesof illness and death. The incidence of infection with these agents has drastically reduced, and this reduction isattributable to the development and utilization of vaccines.We appreciate the potential risks involved with the practice of vaccination, but feel that the benefits achieved fromthe appropriate utilization of safe vaccines far outweighs these risks and the greater risks of withholdingvaccinations. I Insubstantiated claims about vaccine safety,- including the perceived fink to autism, could result inmany Americans choosing to decline vaccinations for themselves and their children. Such actions would be .detrimental to the progress made in protecting the public health from debilitating and sometimes fatal vaccine-preve.ntsble. diseases such as measles; rubella, polio, and mumps.NCAI believes that the practice of immunization has had and will continue to have profound and positive inipacison public health. Initiatives to increase the tote or childhood and adult immumations have been quite successful,but opportunities to further improve immttnization rates still exist. These opportunities for improvement existmostly because of misconceptions about vaccination and discrepancies in access to vaccinations. The NCAI iscommitted to further reducing the incidenee of vaccine-preventable diseases by raising the awareness of Americansregarding these diseases and their prevention through the appropriate use of sate and effective vaccines, bysupporting research into new protective measures, and by supporting further research to ensure the safety ofvaccines. Sincerely,<c))Peggy S. Webster, M.D., F.A.A.P.rfirectur By For Early immunization The Honorable Henry WaxmanRanking MemberHouse Committee on Government ReformB-350A Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515RE:Vaccine Safety HearingsEvery Child By Two (ECBT) is deeply concerned that the congressionalhearings on vaccine safety, led by Indiana Congressman Dan Burton, arecreating a false perception of the risks associated with vaccines.While no vaccine is 100 percent safe, unsubstantiated claims about vaccinesafety, including its perceived link to autism, could result in children notbeing vaccinated.

Medical authorities acknowledge that therisk of experiencing severe health problems related to immunization ismuch less than the risk of developing severe health problems from thediseases that vaccines protect against. Before vaccines, millions ofAmericans each year developed diseases such as measles, polio,diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, mumps and rubella. Thousands died andmany more suffered permanent disability. Vaccinations have reducedthese diseases by 99% or more. While no vaccine is 100% safe, unsubstantiated claims about vaccinesafety, including its perceived link to autism, could result in children notbeing vaccinated. Such actions will only hurt our children by increasingtheir risk of developing debilitating and sometimes fatal vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough, measles and meningitis,among others. 1 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 15 The Immunization Education and Action Committee (IEAC) of the National HealthyMothers, Healthy Babies Coalition (HMHB) supports the continued use of federal fundsto determine the cause or causes of autism and increased research to improve the safetyof all vaccinesthose on the market and in development to ensure that our childrenare being given the safest and most effective vaccines available.

Henry Government ReformB-350A Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515RE: Vaccine Safety HearingsMarch 29, 2000 The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) isdeeply concerned that Congressional hearings on vaccine safety are creating a falseperception of the risks associated with vaccines. While no vaccine is 100 percent safe,unsubstantiated claims about vaccine safety, including its perceived link to autism, maycause parents' not to vaccinate their children, thus jeopardizing the health of millions.Exaggerating the actual risks of vaccines will only hurt our children by decreasingimmunization rates, thereby increasing their risk of developing debilitating andsometimes fatal vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough, measles andmeningitis, among others.The nearly 3,000 local public health agencies in cities, counties and towns -have played a crucial role in ensuring that children, adolescents and adults are vaccinatedaccording to recommended schedules. In fact, 93% of local public health agenciesprovide, contract, or contribute resources to childhood immunizations. Local publichealth agencies often serve as safety net immunization providers for children whosefamilies have no other access to preventive health services. Local public health agencieshave implemented many strategies, including outreach and public education, to raise andsustain vaccination coverage levels in their communities.The widespread use of childhood immunizations to prevent disease is one of themost successful public health achievements of the last 100 years, saving millions of lives.One result has been that, because vaccine-preventable diseases have become relativelyrare, the health threats they pose no longer seem real. The days when thousands ofchildren were stricken with paralyzing poliomyelitis have been forgotten by most. Somenow hold an erroneous belief that the risks of vaccines, both real and perceived, havebecome greater than the risks of acquiring the diseases themselves..Local public health agencies have witnessed oubreaks of measles and otherpreventable childhood diseases when immunization rates have declined. Theyunderstand how easily low immunization rates can lead to increased illness, disability and 17 death. To prevent a tragic resurgence of preventable diseases, communities must maintainstrong immunization programs that have the support of parents and the public.NACCHO urges continued strong support for childhood immunization programs, as well as more research and increased surveillance for adverse reactions to ensure thatunsafe vaccines never become a public health concern. At a time in our history whenvaccine-preventable diseases are on the decline in the United States and childhoodimmunization rates are at an all-time high, exaggerating the perceived risks of vaccineswill only threaten the successes of our country's immunization program at the expense of our children.Sincerely, Stephanie B.C.

I'm the director of PKIDs, a national nonprofitfor parents of kids living with chronic, viral infectious diseases. One ofour primary goals is to ensure the health of the world's children throughglobal immunization.Every parent of a child living with a vaccine-preventable disease will tellyou that they'd do or give anything to turn back the clock and have theirchild immunized. These diseases are preventable, and when a parent facesthe fact that their child is now irrevocably affected by such a disease,it's devastating.PKIDs is committed to protecting our nation's children against diseasesthat have life-long effects on their health and development. As thecommittee looks at autism today, we voice our support for more resourcesfor autism research while stressing that there is no scientific evidencelinking autism to immunization.We believe there is a long way to go in understanding autism. As a nation,we cannot ignore the need for research to find a cure for this severe andvery prevalent neurological disorder. :Autism affects more than 400,000families and costs the nation over 13 billion dollars a year - it deservesas much public attention and research as other childhood diseases.Although autism is currently the third most common developmental disorder,it receives less than five percent of the funding for research of otherchildhood diseases, like multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. Fundingfor research into diseases such as autism is an integral part of finding acure.While PKIDs advocates for additional resources for autism research, it doesnot condone the spread of false and misleading information linking autismto childhood vaccination. PKIDs strongly encourages parents to continueimmunizing their children with scientifically proven safe and effectivevaccines..Today's high immunization rates protect us from outbreaks of measles,rubella, diphtheria and polio. If we stop vaccinating, costly outbreaks ofthese vaccine-preventable diseases would return as surely as spring followswinter with devastating consequences for some families.Over the past 50 years, vaccines have gained control over or virtuallyeliminated diseases that used to be very common in the U.S., includingmeasles, diphtheria, polio, smallpox, rubella, Hib meningitis and mumps. 19 Hut, other diseases such as hepatitis B, varicella and pneumococcalmeningitis are still common, resulting in serious illness for many families.In fact, even in the U.S., where immunization rates are thehighest, approximately 1 million pre-school children are not adequatelyprotected against potentially disabling or fatal diseases that can be prevented by immunization.We urge everyone to keep kids safe with available vaccines and to searchfor every spare dollar which can be put toward finding a cure for autism,hepatitis B and C, HIV and other diseases and disorders which negatively affect the quality of our children's lives and sometimes .even end their lives.Thank you. 201 Statement.by.the American Medical Association on the Connection Between Autism and Vaccines Resources oninfectiousDiseasesResources on Infectious DiseasesVaccines Do Not CauseAutismCongress to examine vaccination's allegedlink to autismOn April 6, 2000, the Committee onGovernmentchaired byRepresentative Burton, will be holding aHearing on autism. As part of this hearing, theCommittee will be obtaining testimony on thealleged causal association betweenvaccinations - -in particular themeasles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccineandautism. Immunization is perhaps the mostsignificant public health story of this century,and the AMA remains committed tomaintaining the major public health benefits ofvaccinations. The AMA believes that criticalpublic health decisions must be made on thebasis of well-conducted scientific research andestablished scientific fact, and not onanecdotal case reports. Thus, the AMA hasprepared the following informationhighlighting the absence of scientific evidencelinking vaccinations to autism.Scientific data does not support a causalassociation between vaccination and autismTo date, there have been no convincingscientific data that linb any vaccine to autismor any other kind of behavioral disorder.Wakefield and co-workers published the onlyevidence that suggests a causal associationbetween vaccines and autism in the Lancet in1998. Specifically, based on data from 12patientS, Wakefield suggested that themeasles/murnps/rubella (MMR) vaccine mayhave been responsible for bowel problems that.may lead to a decreased absorption of essentialvitamins and nutrients, which could have thenresulted in developmental disorders likeautism. However, no scientific analyses werepresented to substantiate this claim, andfactors such as referral bias and the small BEST COPY AVAILABLE 21 sample size were not considered. Additionally,the theory that autism in the 12 patients iscaused by poor absorption of nutrients is notsupported by the study's own clinical data. Atleast 4 of the 12 patients had behavioralproblems prior to the onset of symptoms ofinflammatory bowel disease, the supposedmechanism for autism after the MMRvaccination. Most significantly, a laterpublication from Wakefield's group has shownthat patients with inflammatory bowel diseasewere negative for measles virus indicating thatmeasles virus is not responsible forinflammatory bowel disease.On the other hand, much scientific data,lexistto show no causal association between theMMR vaccine and autism. A large study byTaylor and coworkers also published in theLancet in 1999 showed that while the numberof autism cases have been increasing iniLondon, the increase was not associated withthe introduction of the MMR vaccine. Thestudy also showed that in autistic patients,vaccination did not result in earlier expiessionof symptoms, and, most significantly, theincidence of autism was the same in childrenwho received the MMR vaccine when !compared to child= who did not receive thevaccine. Thus, there is 'no causal associationbetween the MMR vaccine and autism.Additionally, studies also exist to indicate nocausal association between thediptheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPI') vaccine andautism and in 1990 the Institute of Medicinehas indicated that is no evidence todemonstrate a causal relation between the DPTvaccine and autism.The theoretical causes of autism rule outvaccination as a causal' eterAutism is a chronic developmental disorder.Its main characteristics we problems in socialinteraction, communication, and restrictive andrepetitive interests and activities. The causesof autisu, are unknown in most cases.However, recent scientific studies indicate thatautism may be a genetically based disorder thatoccurs before birth. A working groupconvened by the National Institutes of Health BEST COPYAVAILABLE 22 concluded in 1995 that autism is a geneticcondition. A recent article in the atm=7000 issue of Scientific American provides anice summary of these theories. This articleconcludes, \"The causes of this baffling anddebilitating behavioral disorder may lie inearly embryonic development, whenmalfunctioning genes could produce subtlechanges in the structure of the brain stem.\"Thus, it is extremely unlikely, if notimpossible, that vaccination is a causal factorfor autism.The National Alliance for Autism Research(NAAR) States That Vaccines Are NotCausally Associated With AutismThe national Alliance for Autism Research(NAAR), the leading national organizationdedicated to finding the causes, prevention,effective treatment and, ultimately, cute ofautism, published in their Pali 1998 newsletter(the NAARRATIVE). an article titled \"TheABCs of Mbillts and VIPs: Is there anassociation between vaccination and autism?\"This article states, \"...there has been little ifany scientific evidence to substantiate anassociation between vaccination and autism.\"and that 'The lack of data to support aconnection between vaccine and autism makessense given the increasing body of informationconcerning when the neurobiologicaldifferences associated with autism first occur.The preponderance of evidence tells us thatautism happens to our children before birth.not after.\"Other Resources on Autism andVaccinationThe Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) has a fact sheet entitled\"YagaingandAusism.*ThtInstitute for Vaccine Safety of the JohnsHopkins University has details on studiesdemonstrating the lack of causality betweenthe MNIR vaccine and autism.klatinnallittasdiatimomnizaguInformation provides provide the public.

Posted oo 4/3/2000Comm provided by LI. Ten, PIA Senior Soistoisi.Infectious sleA dose Presides?, OF MEDICINE The Honorable Henry A. Waxman2204 Rayburn HOBWashington, DC 20515-0529Dear Representative Waxman:1 am writing to call your attention to a matter I believe to be of critical importance to the health ofour nation's children. The House Government Reform Committee has scheduled a hearing forApril 6,2000, entitled \"Autism: Present Challenges, Future Needs Why the Increased Rates?\" thatwill focus, among other things, on the unsubstantiated link between autism and vaccines, includingthe measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. This hearing already has generated media coverageand is anticipated to generate additional news coverage. I am extremely concerned that thisattention may inappropriately prompt parents to forgo their children's immunizations, which willdeprive them of the important health protections afforded by vaccines.As former Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, I share the Committee'sgoal to determine the causes of autism, to identify effective treatments and to find a cure so that allfamilies will be free of the burdens caused by this disease. .I also share the Committee's goal ofassuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines being administered to our children. I feelcompelled to report to you, however, that the best available science indicates that the developmentof autism is completely unrelated to use of the MMR or any other vaccine. The National Networkfor Immunization Information (NNii), upon whose Steering Committee 1 serve, plans to providea statement at the hearing to this effect and will submit a list of supporting references. My hopeis that you will pay close attention to NNii's statement as they serve as an unbiased voice onimmunization issues within the scientific and medical communities.Because autism is usually diagnosed in children when they are 18 to 30 months old, shortly afterchildren receive many recommended immunizations, some parents may attribute the emergingsymptoms of autism to the administration of a vaccine. In fact, the best evidence demonstrates thatautism results from complex genetic factors and therefore originates prior to birth, not afterward. KNOWLEDGE WISDOM EXCELLENCE SERVICE720 Westview Drive. S.W.Atlanta. Georgia 30310-1495 Telephone (404) 752-1740 25 My concern is that this hearing will prompt media attention that will unnecessarily raise questions about immunizations and lead to an erosion in public confidence in immunizations. Should thishappen, then children will be at risk of infectious diseases that currently are well controlled as aresult of our successful immunization program. A similar autism scare in the United Kingdomthree years ago prompted many parents to abandon the UK vaccine program. As a result, manychildren in the UK have gone without the vaccines administered there. Scientists and public healthexperts in the UK have 'since conducted an extensive examination of this matter and, after asystematic review of hundreds of reports from parents and physicians, have concluded that theassociation between autism and vaccines is unsupported in science and medicine.Given the many successes being realized in the United States through our own vaccine program inthe prevention of measles, mumps and rubella, an event in the U.S. similar to the UK experiencewould be tragic indeed. It was just a decade ago that the U.S. experienced a resurgence of measles.We experienced more than 55,000 cases of measles and buried 125 children and. young adultsbecause of fatal complications. After redoubling our efforts, in the past year the country reportedfewer than 100 cases of measles. To avoid a recurrence of this predictable tragedy, I urge you, asa Member of the Government Reform Committee, to do what you can at the April 6th hearing tocalm the concerns of any parents who may listen to or read media reports about this hearing so thatour children will remain protected from unnecessary harm due to infectious diseases.I thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on this important matter.Sincerely,.21s44.144444Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.President 26Written testimony to the Congress of the United States House ofRepresentatives Committee on Government Reform: Hearing on\"The challenges of autism. Why the increased rates?\"Dr. Elizabeth MillerEpidemiologist and Head of the Immunisation DivisionPublic Health Laboratory ServiceEngland and Wales Dr. Paddy FarringtonLecturer, Department of StatisticsOpen University, UK We are pleased to provide written evidence in relation to the congressional hearing onautism, in particular the-issue of whether the condition may be caused by MMRvaccine. Together with Professor Brent Taylor, we have conducted anepidemiological study [1] to test the hypothesis raised by Wakefield and hiscolleagues [2] that MMR vaccine may cause the onset of autistic- symptoms within afew days or weeks of immunisation, particularly the form of the disease whichpresents with regression. Our conclusion, based on the rmdings of our study, Isthat there is no evidence of a causal association between MMR vaccine andautism.In order to test the hypothesis raised by Wakefield it is necessary to measure the rateat which new cases occur (i.e. their incidence) in the defined post vaccination riskperiod (weeks or months based on the Wakefield paper) relative to the backgroundrate of onset of autism in children of the same age. The statistical methodology thatwe used is called the case series method and was developed specifically by Dr.Farrington for investigating the relationship between vaccination and subsequentclinical events. The method allows a formal assessment to be made of whether therisk of such an event is greater than expected by chance. We have already published anumber of papers on the case series method, both with respect to its theoretical basisas well as its use in detecting real vaccine-associated adverse events. These papersare listed in the Appendix together with a summary of the mainfindinge from thesestudies. Our case 'Series method has a proven track record with respect toidentifying and measuring a risk of adverse events after vationd Vaccines.The critical conditions which must be satisfied for the case series in ethcid'(or indeedany other epidemiological method) to be valid are as follows:first, the method used to obtain the cases must be entirely independent ofvaccination historysecond, before the analysis is begun the risk periods which ;'e to be investigatedmust be specified at the outset. If this is not done and the dant sets are justanalysed looking for any association whatever the temporal relationship withvaccination, then there is a very real danger that spurious \"risks\" will be foundjust by chance; BEST COPY AVAILABLE 27 These two conditions were rigorously followed in our study of the temporalassociation between MMR vaccine and onset of autism and we fully endorse theevidence submitted to the congressional hearing by our colleagug Professor Taylor,on this study. We reiterate our previous statement that our study shows noevidence of a causal association between MIR vaccine andrautiim,'Moreover, Wakefield has provided no epidemiological evidence in supp'ort of sucha causal association. The inaccuracies in the graph which he submitted to the Lancetfollowing publication of our paper have been addressed by Professor Taylor in hisevidence. However, not withstanding these errors, demonstration of an apparent co-incidence of population trends in the use of MMR vaccine and the prevalence ofautism does not, by itself, prove that that there is a causal association between thetwo. On the other hand, where these is no temporal coincidence between two trends,this is evidence of a lack of causal association between them. In our study weshowed that the increase in the prevalence of diagnosed autism in recent birthcohorts occurred during a time when the coverage of MMR vaccine in the samecohorts has been constant. The rise cannot therefore be related to the use ofMMR vaccine.Following publication of our paper [1], Wakefield wrote to the Lancet [3) criticisingcertain aspects of our study. These were addressed in our responte to,the\" Lancet [4]and in Professor Taylor's evidence to the congressional eoinmitts4. Wtiketfield's maincriticism that we \"concealed\" the fact that the children born before 1987 may havehad MMR vaccine in a catch-up was not only epidemiologicallytiirelOant [4] butalso implied intention to deceive on our part. We refrained froiniespoiiding to thelatter imputation in our letter to the Lancet and concentrated on refutingihe scientificaspects of his criticism. We welcome the opportunity here of stating categoricallythat any allegation of deception or concealment in our Lancet paper is entirelywithout foundation.In Dr. Wakefield'S Lancet paper on autism he refers to previous laboratory andepidemiological work on measles virus and measles vaccinationboth of which hesays have been implicated as risk factors for Crohn's disease. He quotes this earlierwork in the context of the biological plausibility of the suggestion that thecomponents of MMR. vaccine might cause autism: The laboratory 'work that he quotesused an immunoreactive method [5]. The authors of this iitiper admit that the positivesignals they report, suggesting the presence of a measles antigen,lnay be an artefactarising from the phenomenon of antigenic mimicry (ie non-specific cross reactions).This has now been shown to be the case with the original immunohistochemicalmethod employed:by Dr. Wakefield, who first the presenct'Of nidasles virusin the tissues of patients with Crohn's disease [6]. The positive results rie:Obtainedwhich he claimed ;showed the presence of measles antigen in tissue froir patientswith Crohn's disease have now been shown to be non-specific and an artefact arisingfrom immunological cross reactions [7]. Using more specifictitakiii4iiiyemolecular methods neither Dr. Wakefield [8] nor other workera.liavel4able toshow the presence of measles virus in the tissues of patients with Crohn'thaisease [9 -12]. The laboratory evidence published to date does not therefore implicatemeasles virus in Crohn's disease. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 28 The epidemiological evidence that Wakefield cites iv his Lancet paper purporting toimplicate measles virus or measles vaccination in Crohn's diseaSe similarly flawed.He quotes a paperby Ekbom et al [13], of which he is a co-author, reporting that 3 of4 children whose mothers had measles during pregnancy developed Crohn's diseasein later life. This was not a prospective controlled study and was published as anearly ad hoc report in the Lancet. Three subsequent studies failed to substantiate thisputative association. The first, and perhaps strongest, refutation of the Ekbom paperwas published by Jones et al in 1997 [14] and was not referenced in the Lancet paperon autism by Wakefield. The study by Jones and his colleagues was iPiiispectivecontrolled study set up in the 1950s specifically to document the outcome of variousviral infections in pregnancy. None of the offspring of 47 women:who had measlesinfection in pregnancy and who. were recruited to the UK studynt:the time of theirmother's infection had inflammatory bowel disease when follciWedirii.sOMe 33 yearslater. This compares with 2 cases among the 47 controls recruited nt the same timeand followed up by similar methods. This clear refutation of the :Ekbom hypothesisthat measles in pregnancy is a risk factor for Crohn's disease was subsequentlyconfirmed by studies in Denmark and the US [15,16]. There is therefore no reliableevidence that In utero exposure to measles infection is a risk factor for thesubsequent development of Crohn's disease and strong evidence that it is not.The study quoted by Wakefield in his Lancet paper [2] which purports to show thatmeasles vaccination is a risk factor for Crohn's disease was heavily criticised onepidemiological grbunds at the time of its publication and in the ;Subsequentcorrespondence to :the Lancet [17-23]. Later, more robust atudiei [24, 25], one ofwhich is by Wakefield himself [25], have failed to substantiate this earlier work.There is therefore, no credible epidemiologicalevidenee to support of the viewthat measles vaccination is a risk factor for Pilau's disease or indeidany otherinflammatory bowel disorder. .In his letter to the Lancet [3] following the publication of our paper on 'elitism [1]Wakefield mentions a recent study from his group [26] as strongly supporting a rolefor measles virus in chronic intestinal inflammation. To quote fiOnirOtter \"Thelatest of these studies [261 was strongly positive, and was accented by isqURC\".This is not the case. The epidemiological evidence he reports in that papEt:waspresented in detail by Montgomery and Wakefield to the expert group convened bythe MRC on 23\"s March 1998. The conclusion of the MRC group on Wakefield'sstudy was that the findings were not sufficiently robust to allOw conclusions to bedrawn from theni. We agree with this conclusion.The absence of an association between inflammatory bowel disease and autism inEngland (271 or bowel symptoms after MMR vaccination and autism in Finland[28] or autism and MMR vaccination in Sweden 129) adds further support to ourstudy in which we conclude that there is no epidemiological evidence of a causalassociation between MMR vaccine and autism.

The development of the record linkage method for vaccinesafety studies is described in references 3 and 4.Using the case series method with data sets obtained by record linkage, we havemeasured the risk of a convulsion 6-11 days after MMR vaccine (known to be due tothe measles component) and obtained similar estimates to those found in studies inwhich large cohorts of MMR-vaccinated children have been folloWed upprospectively from the time of immunisation (5). Similarly, we have shown that DTP(diphtheria/tetanus/whole cell pertussis) vaccine causes hospital admission forconvulsion (albeit rarely) within 3 days of immunisation (5), a causal associationwhich has been shown in prospective clinical trials using this vaccine. We have alsoidentified and measured the risk of a convulsion 15-35 days after MMR vaccine, andshown that this was due to one particular mumps vaccine strain that has now beenreplaced in the vaccines used in the UK (5,6). The risk of a rare blood disorder calledidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes a characteristic skin rash, has alsobeen shown to be raised after MMR vaccine by the case series method (5,7). For allthe above adverse effects the risk from the disease in substantially greater than thatfrom the vaccine.More recently, we have used our method to investigate convulsions after Hib vaccineand found no evidence of an increased risk in the 0-3 day, 4-7 day or 8-14 day postvaccination period (4). The absence of an increased risk of convulsions after Hibvaccine accords with the effects of the vaccine as shown in prospective clinical trials.Our case series method has therefore a proven track record both with respect toidentifying a risk of certain adverse events from lvlivIR and DTP vaccines as well asshowing no evidence of risk for the same events with other vaccines.References: 1.Farrington CP.

ERIC FOMBONNE I am Dr. Eric Fombonne, Reader in Epidemiological Child Psychiatry at theInstitute of Psychiatry- King's College London (U.-K.), and Consultant Childand Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital (London, U.K.) for thePervasive Developmental Disorders Service. I have extensive clinical andresearch experience in autism and related disorders.I am unable to testify in person at this hearing but appreciate theopportunity to testify in writing the following comments for the Committee.Recent investigations of children with pervasive developmental disorders (ageneric term for autistic disorder) who were referred to.a gastroenterologicalunit because of gastrointestinal symptoms have suggested that a loss ofskills had occurred in the children after the combined measles, mumps, andrubella (MMR) immunization or after measles infection. All children hadhistological or biological abnormalities suggestive of rather nonspecificinflammatory processes which casted doubts on the putative links with themeasles virus. moreover, in the absence of a control group, however, it isdifficult to draw meaningful conclusions from these observations. In fact,the linking of measles exposure to the Aonset\u00ae of autism relied, to a largeextent, on the apparent temporal connection between the first symptoms ofautism and an MMR immunization shot. However, there were no details on howsuch precise estimates had been obtained from parents and there was noindependent corroborative evidence. Most professionals in the field of autismand most parents would recognize that it is extremely difficult to date theonset of the first autistic symptoms in a child with accuracy, either at thetime or retrospectively. Parents recognize the first autistic abnormalities intheir children before the first birthday in about 40% of cases. This meansthat, for the majority of autistic children, parents become concerned betweenthe first and third birthday, and usually during the second year of life witha large group of children giving first developmental concerns in their thirdtrimester of life. Any event (biological, social, etc.) occurring during thethird semester of life will therefore coincide with the onset of autism inautistic children; MMR immunization is usually given between 12 and 15 monthsof. age in the UK, a5d the onset of autism and immunizations will therefore belinked because of the connection between the particular timing of immunization.programs and the natural history of symptom development in autism. Thistemporal association, however, is coincidental and must not be taken asevidence for a causal association.Other arguments are therefore necessary to suggest a causal link (as opposedto a mere temporalassociation) between the two events., However, there is noevidence from case control studies that measles infectiOne ari:e.strong riskfactor for autism; similarly, epidemiological surveys have infections, or their rare complications (such as subacUte sclerosingpanencephalitis), as common background medical conditions in autism. Indeed,in a review of 27 epidemiological surveys published in the English languagethat we performed recently and where possible causal medical disorders wereinvestigated in about half of the studies, no mention was ever made of wildmeasles infection or of its complications as being associated with the onsetof autism in very large, representative samples of autistic children. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 3 9 34 In the UK, MMR immunizations were introduced only in 1988- and this provides atheoretical opportunity to link changes in rates of autism in the populationwith the introduction of a systematic immunization programme. However, theepidemiological evidence for a real increase. in the incidence of autism isthus far largely lacking. It is useful, here, to distinguish twoepidemiological measures: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence, or prevalencerate, is a measure of the proportion of the population affected by a disorderat a given point of time. Incidence is a measure of the number of new casesof a disease occurring in a population over a period of time. Only incidencedata can inform us about causal factors associated with rates. of a disorder ina population.In the field of autism, no epidemiological study has everyielded incidence rate estimates; this is because autism, and relateddisorders, are too rare, and because the diagnostic boundaries of autism werevery difficult to operationalize for a long time. Thus, epidemiologists haveavailable to them only prevalence estimates of autism in various countries orregions, and usually at different points in time.Under strict methodological circumstances, prevalence rates derived fromepidemiological studies could be used to indirectly assess changes in theincidence of the disorder. This would be achieved if prevalence rates can bemeaningfully compared at'two different points in time, or in successive birthcohorts. For such a comparison to be meaningful, demonstration should be madethat the concepts, definitions and diagnostic assessment, of autism-spectrumare strictly comparable across studies or birth cohorts,that the methods usedto identify cases in populations are the same, that theage groups comparedare similar, and that the areas surveyed are comparable regarding theirpopulation structure and migration out and in the area under study. No studyhas achieved such a tight control of confounding fadtore:in making suchcomparisons. The surveys performed in Europe, and notably in Sweden and inFrance, which attempted to address the issue of a secular change in theincidence of autism have concluded that either there was noincrease in prevalence rates over time once definitions and'inetihods were heldconstant across surveys, or that increasing rates over time could be accountedby changes in the detection of autism in populations or changes in theconcepts and diagnostic definitions of autistic spectrum_ disorders.Data have recently been published from various educational departments orcenters (for instance, in California) which portray alarming upward trends innumbers of autistic children registered in the corresponding databases.However, these data are not epidemiological in nature and they are susceptibleto various biases and confounding factors. Firstly, these data are justnumbers of children as opposed to rates. Only rates would be used byepidemiologists as they incorporate in the measure of disease occurrence ameaningful description of the underlying population, Numbers could change as aresult of changes in the composition of the population and they cannot be usedwithout relating them to population denominators. Secondly,.nonttempt wasmade in these series to control changes in the diagnostiO.concepts anddefinitions. The diagnostic classification in use in the'USA (DSM) has changedthree times over the last 20 years, in 1980, 1987 and 1994. Changes to theclassification systems and diagnostic criteria were substantial for childrenwith autistic conditions. The same children who did not meet criteria forautism before 1987 met criteria for autism thereafter, and so on. Reportingtime trends in such data without taking these definitional:changes into 35 account is not good practice. Thirdly, over the years, there has been anincreasing recognition of autistic conditions both in the lay and professionalpublics. This, in turn, has led to earlier identification of autistic childrenwho are now diagnose at a much earlier age in most countries. In itself, thistrend towards an earlier age at diagnosis has contributed to an increasedprevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum conditions, overall in the population,and especially amongst young children. Thus, even though:the prevalence poolof children with autism might have remained the same in the population, thistrend towards an earlier diagnosis will have contributed to an increase in thenumber of notifications to agencies, more pressure on professional assessmentcenters anda correspondihg perception that there is more autism now thanbefore. This would,' however, not necessarily be the correct' interpretation.Fourthly, the same data also showed upward trends in several childhoodhandicaps other than autism, casting doubts on the specificity of these trendsfor autism and suggesting a common artefact in the reporting statistics. Forall these reasons, these statistics cannot be interpreted as indicative of asecular increase in the incidence of autism.Therefore, there are no solid epidemiological data to support the hypothesisof an increased incidence of autism, the epidemiological measure of crucialscientific interest. On the other hand, prevalence rates have tended to behigher in the last 15 years but this mostly reflected an improved recognitionof autism in the population surveyed as well as a progressive broadening ofthe definition of the disorder. Thus, it is not correct to interpret theupward trend in rates of prevalence as evidence that the incidence hasincreased.Similarly, there are no robust epidemiological studies linking rates of autismto the relatively recent use of the combined HAIR vaccine in immunizationprograma in some countries. One UK study which specifically tested for anassociation between rates of autism in North London and the introduction ofMR immunization 11.1..1988 failed to detect en association. Beyond the putativelink between measles viruses/immunizations and autism, it has also been arguedthat measles viruses were responsible for the increased incidence ofinflammatory bowel diseases and Crohn..s disease. If meailes viruses wereimplicated in both autism and inflammatory bowel diseases, then, surely, thereshould be an association between autism and inflammatorylbowel disease. Whentested in two large,samples of subjects with autism, this hypothesis wasunsupported. Furthermore, inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease werenot reported in any of the 27 epidemiological surveys of autism conducted from1966 to 2000 worldwide. There is a natural tendency for all of us to seek explanations for events thatare unpredictable, painful, and unexplained, such as the appearance ofautistic symptoms in a young developing child. Perhaps this drive is-evenmore pronounced in the parents of those children who experience a regressionof skills in the second year of their life, as seen in up to 2S% of autisticchildren.The possibility of such a regression in the devlopment of autisticchildren has been known for a long time, and much before the introduction ofcombined MMA vaccines. In the past, other reasons have been sought to explainthese losses of skills; birth of another child, moving home, hospitaladmission, or even a simple otitis media. While keeping an open mind oncausation and developing new hypotheses are certainly necessary, an important 36 task of professionals is to remain sceptical about claims of causalassociations which fall short of strict scientific criteria.

Akhter, MD, MPHApril 6, 2000The American Public Health Association (APHA) expresses its strong and continued support for universal immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunizations have beenproven to be among the safest and most cost-effective health measures ever implemented.For every dollar spent on a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, more than $16 is saved in directmedical costs (1). Similarly compelling cost-benefit data exists for other vaccines, and theyreflect not only dollars saved, but also unnecessary suffering and death prevented.A recent past issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describes the toll taken on America's people before vaccinations were widely available:In 1900, 21,064 smallpox cases were reported, and 894 patients died. In 1920,469,924 measles cases were reported, and 7575 patients died, and 147,991diphtheria cases were reported, and 13,170 patients died. In 1922, 107,473pertussis cases were reported, and 5099 patients died (1).By contrast, in 1998 there was one case of diptheria, 6,279 cases of pertussis, 89 cases of measles and none of smallpox (2). These remarkable reductions in rates of illness and deathare attributable to immunization campaigns.Public health professionals understand that a very small percentage of the population may experience allergic responses or other negative health effects from vaccinations. Long ago, APHA called for the establishment of a national compensation system to alleviate the financial burden of such events. Furthermore, the Association continues to advocate the highest safety standards in vaccine development, manufacture, and distribution, in order to limit such potential adverse effects. These efforts must include research directed to the elimination of the rare unfavorable reactions to immunizations.In spite of science's best efforts, a small number of reactions may still be experienced. Theseoccasions, like any adverse health effect, are truly devastating for those affected. However, it is important to remember that serious consequences will result for many more people if we reduce our immunization activities. Vaccine-preventable diseases can cause widespreadblindness, deafness, brain damage, mental retardation, heart defects, sterility, miscarriage, paralysis, and death. Advancing the Public's Health Since 1872 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 38 Taking into account that the benefits of immunization against childhood diseases faroutweigh the risks, we commend national policymakers for their ongoing support foruniversal immunization. Federal funding that provides grants to states for immunizationefforts is vital and has shown dramatic results. In years where funding has been increased,there has been an expansion of the total number of two-year-olds who were fully immunizedfrom 50 percent in 1993 to 78 percent in 19%.APHA strongly supports efforts to eliminate the scourge of communicable diseases throughimmunizations and other means throughout the world.

We wish to comment on one aspect that will be addressedat the hearing: the purported link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism.The National Network for Immunization Information (NNii) was established in 1998 to provide the public,health professionals, policy-makers and the media with up-to-date, scientifically valid information relatedto immunization for the purpose of helping them understand the issues and make informed decisions. Anorganization of physicians, nurses and other health professionals, NNii serves as the voice of science andmedicine on immunization issues.Because autism is usually diagnosed in children.when they.are 1.8 to 30 months old, shortlyafter children.receive many recommended immunizations, some parents may attribute the emerging symptoms of autismto the administration of a vaccine- in fact, the best available science indicates that the development ofautism is completely unrelated to use of the MMR or any other vaccine (see attached list of references andwebsites). Evidence shows that autism results from complex genetic factors and therefore originates priorto birth, not afterward. There has been little, if any, scientific evidence to substantiate an associationbetween vaccination and autism.We have full sympathy for every child and family burdened by autism and support aggressive research intothe causes, prevention and treatment of autism. We also feel it is our obligation to make clear that thecurrent scientific evidence shows that autism is not related to immunizations.Please feel free to call On us for additional information.Sin BruceGelIin, M.D., M.P.H.Executive Directorx: House Government Reform Committee Partner*int ectial Diseases Society at Asnence Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society American Academy of Pedfatics Antencen Nome AssociationCo-DhaintSamuel L.

I thank all the witnesses who are here today for appearing. I know how difficult it is for some of them to be here,how hard it is to share their pain, and how much they want theirtestimony to be a way for us to understand that we in the Congress must do everything we can, consider all theories, get to the truthabout autism, what causes it, what we can do to treat it, and how we can prevent it. I see that as our job today, and I look forwardto the testimony and learning from the witnesses who are here to share their perspectives with us.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Mr. Waxman.Mrs. Morella.Mrs. MORELLA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your ef- fort to hold this important hearing on autism, and I look forwardto hearing the testimony of the witnesses.I come to this hearing today with an open mind, ready to listen carefully to the testimony of the witnesses. Autism and its associ-ated behaviors have been estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 500 individuals. Over 500,000 people in the United States today havesome form of autism. The estimated prevalence rate of autism nowplaces it as the third most common developmental disabilitymorecommonly occurring than Down Syndrome.Mr. Chairman, in your opening statements, you mentioned that there was a 513 percent increase in my State of Maryland between1993 and 1998, and I notice that the first witness on our first panel, Mr. Curtis, is from Maryland.Unfortunately, there is almost no existing data on causes or links to causes of autism in children. I am very concerned with thesestriking statistics. I am most concerned with the lack of informa-tion and the confusion surrounding the issue of vaccines and theirrelationship to autism.I hope that today we can come closer to discerning what the ap- propriate steps are for this committee and for Government to take.I hope to learn from testimony that will make this committee bet-ter understand where we need to focus research dollars, be itthrough vaccines, genetic or environmental factors, and the ques- tion of why is autism four times more prevalent in boys than ingirls. I hope to get some sense of what further studies are needed so that we can accelerate research on autism.There is no question in my mind that this is an issue of high pri- ority and that more studies are needed. That is why I wrote to our Representative John Porter, who chairs the House Subcommitteeon Appropriations for Labor and Health and Human Services, re-questing an increase in funding for autism epidemiology researchat the National Center for Environmental Health within the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, an appropriation of $1.5million for the CDC to expand its epidemiology activities in autismfrom two isolated studies to a more national scope.An increase in funding for autism epidemiology research in 2001will enable CDC to expand monitoring efforts to other parts of thecountry. This will allow them to better understand the prevalenceof autism spectrum disordersinformation which is necessary to eventually discover prevention, treatment, and a cure for autism. 46I think that the choice of this ribbon with its puzzle pieces as thesymbol of autism, with the heart in the center, is most appropriate.I yield back and look forward to hearing from the witnesses.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Mrs. Morella.Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage.Mrs. CHENOWETH-HAGE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I can hardly begin to thank you enough for holding this hearing.It is astounding to see all of these people who have come from allover the Nation, and I understand, Mr. Chairman, that you havearranged for two overflow rooms, and I noticed that the hall waspacked when I came in.I rarely ask to make an opening statement, but I am unable tooverstate the importance of this particular issue, and I look for-ward to hearing the testimony from the witnesses today and learn-ing more.Mr. Chairman, oftentimes, I focus on the larger issues at handwhen I address the committee, but I too am the grandparent of anincredibly handsome autistic childan incredible boy. I cannotoveremphasize how much autism affects education and family cohe-siveness in the most loving of families. All of these are irretrievablyaffected when autism is discovered in one's own family.Mr. Chairman, when Timmy was born, neither my daughter normy son-in-law knew that he was autistic. They did not have a clue.He was the youngest of four children, so his parents thought theyknew what to expect in raising a baby. It was only later that theyrealized that there was something very different about Timmy.When he was diagnosed with autism, we were all worried and sad-dened. How would our family deal with this? How could he be edu-cated, and how could we best provide for his future? How could,how could how could? And it went on.We had hundreds if not thousands of questions. We were shockedand frightened and worried and relieved to know what it was, allat the same time. At the same time, none of us knew what the fu-ture held, and the questions kept coming.That is why I am so very grateful to you, Mr. Chairman, for yourcourage and willingness to deal in areas that the Congress usuallyis not willing to open its mind to.Timmy is now 8 and is a beautiful young boy whom we are allimmensely proud of. However, I cannot understate the challengesthat our family still faces. Parents are desperate to find an answerto their questions. They want so much for their children to haveintegrative and communicative lives. Oftentimes, they feel at aloss, almost desperate, in trying to find answers to their questions.Many of my family's questions still remain. Day after day, we stillsearch for answers. It is an overriding concern with all of us.While our questions are not all easily answered, even the begin-ning of the questions, we do somehow manage to look toward abrighter future for Timmy than we ever thought possible after hisinitial diagnosis. He was a gifted child in a number of areas, par-ticularly music. But we still want to learn how to unlock the fullpotential of his future.All too often, people will write off such potential, but it is there.We are all sure of it. You can literally look in his eyes and see it. 47Mr. Chairman, autism is a very strange disorder. When Timmywas diagnosed, we were told that medical science did not know thecause of it. We were told that Timmy had about a 4 percent chanceof leading a normal life, depending on his IQ. They thought autismwas probably genetic, but they really just were not sure.After much research, we discovered his current schooling pro- gram, which is based on extensive research done by Dr. Iver Lovassof California. At first, quite simply, we encountered a vacuum of knowledge when it came to autism, and that shocked me. However,what shocked me even more was learning that the rate of autismhas increased over the past several years, and the statistics whichyou show today, Mr. Chairman, are incredibly shocking.I continue to be surprised when I discover that some studieshave found preliminary evidence of a link between autism and vac- cines, and evidence linking dietary health to autism. Vaccines anddietary health are issues that I have been very interested in forsome time now, and I look forward to hearing from the witnesseswho will address these links.Mr. Chairman, we understand from the research that was the foundation of Dr. Lovass' program, \"Ready, Set, Go,\" that thechances of Timmy leading a normal life rose from 4 percent tonearly 20 percent, and this is based on the intensive behavioralintervention program developed after decades of research by Dr.Lovass. You can imagine the impact this program has had on countless children and their families.Research in this area changes lives, as I am sure research re- garding vaccinations and dietary health has changed the lives ofnumerous others. The astounding results of research into this ter-rible disorder have changed the lives of many families, and as a re- sult of this research, I am aware of families that have literally up- ended their lives to move across the country in search of programs like that of Dr. Lovass.Mr. Chairman, there are some remarkable programs that havedeveloped over the years with regard to autism, in particular some amazing advances in educating autistic children. But we still needmore answers.Mr. Chairman, again, let me thank you and the committee andthe hard-working staff of the committee for holding this criticallyimportant hearing. For better or for worse, we must deal with thissubject. This committee is taking a very important first step.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much, Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage.Mr. Kucinich.Mr. KUCINICH. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.I have to first inform you that I have a markup and votes in an- other committee, so I will not be able to stay. But I did want tocome here specifically to support the cause of this hearing and yourefforts in this regard.While I agree with Mr. Waxman when he says the history of vac- cinations has shown a lot of benefits, it is important for science totake note of the increased reporting with respect to rates of autismin recent years. If we have a higher incidence of autism, this is an appropriate subject for a congressional inquiry, and I think it isalso appropriate for us to ask questions not only of the witnesses 48here today but of the industry producing these vaccines. I am par-ticularly interested in what are their production protocols for thevaccines which our children receive; how are the vaccines beingmade; what is in the vaccines; are there any differences in how thevaccines were made years ago and how they are made today; arethere any different products in there?These are questions which could lend themselves to an under-standing of why there is an increased rate today, and it seems tobe different than what it was years ago.So I think that when you see the heartfelt concern which is ex-pressed here, the witnesses who are appearing and are scheduledto appear, and when you see that there are scientists who are will-ing to address the question of a causal link between autism and avaccine, and when you have a scientist who is ready to say maybethere is not a causal linkthe fact that this debate has begun heresuggests an important moment in this Congress and in this countryon the issue of autism. We need to find out if there is a link, andif there is a link, we need to go right back to the way the vaccineis made and what it is made ofbecause the problem may not bein our children; the problem may be in what our children are beinggiven.So I thank you very much for your diligence, Mr. Chairman, andfor your commitment and for your quality of heart on issues of pub-lic health importance.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Mr. Kucinich, and I want to thank youfor all the help you have given us on a whole host of issues relatingto the health of the people of this country.Mr. KUCINICH. I want to say I would not be on this committeeif it were not for Mr. Waxman inviting me to be on this committee,and I am on it because of my deep respect for Mr. Waxman, whomI revere as not just our leader, but for me, he has been a personalhero. But I think I am on a committee with two of the best peoplein the House, so I am pretty fortunate.Thanks.Mr. BURTON. I hope everybody heard that. That was from theother side of the aisle. [Laughter.]Mr. BURTON. Mr. Ose has said he does not have an openingstatement.Mr. Hutchinson, do you have an opening statement?Mr. HUTCHINSON. No, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. OK.We will now proceed with our witnesses. As a practice, especiallysince we are talking about something as important as the variousproblems that have been occurring with you folks with autistic chil-dren, I would like to ask everybody to rise.On our first panel, we have Mr. Kenneth Curtis, Mr. JamesSmythe, Ms. Shelley Reynolds, Ms. Jeana Smith, Mr. Scott Bono,and Dr. Wayne Dankner.Would all of you raise your right hands, please?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. BURTON. Please be seated.Mr. Curtis, would you like to start? What I would like to ask, be-cause we have 19 witnesses, and this is a very big hearing today,is if you could try to confine your remarks to 5 minutes. Some of 49the doctors who have technical expertise that they want to express will be allowed a little latitude, but if you could stick close to 5 minutes, we would really appreciate it.Mr. Curtis, would you like to start?STATEMENTS OF KENNETH CURTIS, MD;JAMES WAYNE M. DANKNER, SANDIEGO, CAMr. CURTIS. Certainly. Mr. Chairman, all of you, first of all, thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of my son-- Mr. BURTON. Would you pull the mic a little closer? The mics donot pick up as well as we hope.Mr. CURTIS. Sure. Leave it to the radio guy to mess up the micro- phone.Thank you again for this opportunity to speak on behalf of my son, my family, and children with autism nationwide; but mostlyI am speaking on behalf of my son, because this is really his story.Autism does not announce itself in the delivery room. When our son Morgan Scott was born, he looked like a Sharpei doghe waswrinkled from head to toe. Things were sort of storybook for us at that time. We had a girl and a boy, a mom and a dad, and life was kind of like a picnic. But the clouds were rolling in, as it were. Slowly, little drops of doubt began to fall. We wondered about theway he liked to watch Disney videos over and over, or how hewould spin around and make strange noises and look at things outof the corner of his eye; the way he liked to line up his toys. Drop after dropwe wondered, and we waited to see what would hap-pen.He did not talk, and most of the time, he did not even seem to hear us. So we worried some more, and we wondered, until all ofthese little drops were like a downpourand of course, we had to take cover.Our doctor suggested a hearing test, but his ears were fine. He just would not talk. We tried speech therapy, but he still would nottalk. Even with all of these odd behaviors, my son was a happy enough kid. He was loving, affectionate, he was ticklish, stubbornjust like any kidbut he would not talk.Finally, when Morgan was a little more than 2 years old, we had a word for it, and the word was more terrifying and confusing thanany of the things we were dealing with at the time. Of course, theword was autism.But what did that mean? Of course, we thought of \"Rain Man,\"but we also thought of all the horrible stories you hear about kids who repeatedly bang their heads against the wall, or bite, scratch,and sit in a corner, rocking and hugging themselves. Is it possiblethat this could be our little boy? It did not seem realbut obvi-ously, it was.Morgan was diagnosed as \"moderately autistic,\" a term I have al- ways thought to be a bit like being \"moderately pregnant.\" So webegan to immerse ourselves in information. We were determined to learn everything possible about autismand when I say \"we,\" I really mean my wife Kimberly. You have never seen a woman on 50a mission until you have seen a mother determined to save herchild. There is no match for a mother's love. She read, she re-searched, she investigated, while I tried to come to terms with theidea that I might never be able to shoot hoops with my son.Before long, we had a plan. We opted for the one-to-one intensiveABA therapy program developed by Dr. Lovass at UCLA. We spentthousands of dollars, wrangled with the school system, hired law-yers, lived in my grandmother's house to save on rent, and webegan teaching our son in-home.For 5 years, Morgan had between 30 and 40 hours a week of one-on-one therapy. At age 4, my son had more college friends thanmost fraternity brothers. He learned to read a little, to spell a lit-tle, to use the toiletand most importantly, he learned how to lis-ten to people, and he even began to talk a little bit.I am a radio guyI talk for a livingand the irony of having ason who does not know how to communicate with words is not loston me. I know there are things that my son wants to say to me,and as he gets older, I can look into his eyes and see the frustra-tion and the confusion. There is a little boy inside of him some-where, and it is as if he is lost.This is really what it is like. It is like being in the mall with yourchild, and you look down and discover he is not there anymorethat sickening feeling you get in the pit of your stomach. Exceptthat every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of the real boytheway his eyes light up when you bring the Christmas tree home; theway he smiles when he jumps into the pool, or the way he sits per-fectly still, enraptured, when he got to see the symphony. He lovesmusic, he loves animals, he loves trains, books, swings, ice cream,and even his family, of course.But he cannot tell me his favorite color, or how his day at schoolwas, or what hurts when he falls off the swing set. He still has not figured out how to express or reveal himself. And he does not seemto understand why this is so important to us.I want to know why my son is locked inside himself. Is there agenetic disposition? Is it environmental? Is it something in thewater? Do pesticides cause itpreservatives; antibiotics; immuni-zations; Nutrasweet; the time he fell and hit his head? It soundscrazy, but these are the things we have all heard and thoughtabout, and the truth is we have no idea why our son is autistic,and we have to accept that.But we love our son so much that we can never give up hope thathe will 1 day carry on a conversation with us or even just say, \"Hi,Dad,\" when I come home from work.Morgan is a truly beautiful person in his own right just as heis right now. I have never met anyone, and I doubt I ever will, wholives more in the moment than my son. He is affectionate, imagina-tive, and even humorous sometimes. And I have learned more fromhim than I have from any other single person in my entire life. Heis autistic, and that is just the way he is.But not everybody is as lucky as we are. Morgan is not aggres-sive or self-injurious like a lot of individuals with autism. He is 8years old. I have had a lot of time to come to terms with this. Evenso, the frustration of dealing with autism is nearly eclipsed by thefrustration and the lack of concrete information about this disorder. 51Autism used to be consideredrare, the kind of thing you see in movies or read about in books, but it never actually happened to anyone you knew. In January of this year, the Autism Society ofAmerica estimated that autism had increased from 15 out of every 10,000 individuals to 1 in 500. And the repercussions of this in- crease are so far-reaching.These children will need specialized education and appropriatecare for the rest of their lives. Are we honestly ready for this? Areour schools equipped to handle this increase? This overwhelmingsurge in this disorder is not just going to affect individual families.This is going to impactour community and the entire world inwhich we live.My son is a beautifully colored thread in the fabric of my family. But even so, 1 in every 500 families should not have to live with this disorder. And what if these numbers keep increasing?So here I am today, wearing the only suit that I own, discussing my son before the legislative arm of the ruling body of the greatestNation in the world. Believe me, testifying here today is one of the most important things I have ever done, and with all due respect to the tremendous body of work before each of you, I would like to think that it is a very important day for you as well. Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Curtis.Mr. Smythe.[The prepared statement of Mr. Curtis follows:] 52Testimony of Kenneth CurtisBefore the Government Reform CommitteeApril 6, 2000Autism - Present Challenges, Future Needs - Why the Increased Rates?Autism doesn't announce itself in the delivery room. When our son Morgan Scottwas born, he looked like .a sharpee dog. Wrinkled from head to toe with extra flesh.Imagine a pink, chubby Michelin Man. We had a boy! And things were sort ofstorybook then, a girl and a boy, a Mom and a Dad. Life was a picnic, but theclouds were rolling in. Slowly, little drops of doubt began to fall. The way hewanted to watch Disney videos all the time, how he would spin around looking atthings out of the corner of his eye, the way he liked to line up his toys... Drop afterdrop. But we figured it was too early to worry. We waited to see what wouldhappen. He wouldn't talkand sometimes he didn't even seem to hear us. But wewaited some more, and worried some more, until all the little drops were adownpour, and we knew we bad to take cover.The doctor suggested a hearing test, but his ears were fine. He just wouldn't talk.So we tried speech therapy; but he wouldn't talk. Even with the odd behaviors,Morgan was happy enough - loving, affectionate, ticklish, stubborn. Just lice any .kid. But he wouldn't talk. So we waited and worried and wondered, what could bewrong? Finally, when Morgan was a little more than two, we finally had a word forit. And the word was more terrifying and confusing than any of the things we weredealing with at the time...Autism?! What did that mean? Of course, we thought of \"Rain Man\". But we alsothought of all of those awful stories you hear about kids who repeatedly bang theirheads against the wallor bite and scratch and sit rocking in a corner. Could thisreally be Mo? Our happy, quiet little boy with the fondness for Mickey Mouse? Itdidn't seem real.But it was, of course. Morgan was diagnosed as \"moderately autistic\"; (a term I'vealways thought was a bit like being \"moderately pregnant\") and we were left towonder what to do next. As you might expect, we began to immerse ourselves ininformation. We were determined to learn everything possible about Autism. Well,when I say WE, I really mean my wife, Kimberly. There is no match foraMother's love, and you have not seen a woman on a mission until you've seen a 53 mother determined to save her child. This was my wife. She gave up the verynotion of a career to memorize every bit of minutia ever written on the subject ofAutism. She read, researched, and investigated, while I tried to come to terms withthe idea that I might never be able to shoot hoops with my son.It seems like every few months or so, a new and different treatment for Autismpops up. There are volumes of theories, reports, and conjecture, and Kim took itupon herself to weed through it all, with me in tow. Before long, we had a plan.We opted for the one-to-one intensive ABA Therapy program developed by Dr.Lovaas at UCLA. We spent thousands of dollars, wrangled with the school system,hired lawyers, lived in my Grandmother's house tosave on rent, and began teaching our son in-home.For five years, Morgan had between 30 and 40 hours a week of one-on-onetherapy. At age 4, Morgan had more college friends than most fraternity brothers.He learned to read a little, to spell a little, to use the toilet, and most importantlyhe learned how to listen to people and finally began to understand some of whatwe said to him... and finally.....he began to talk.I'm a radio-guy. I'm in the business of Communication, and the irony of having ason who doesn't know how to communicate with words, is not lost on me. I knowthere are things that my son wants to say to me. As he gets older, I can look intohis eyes and see the frustration and the confusion. As his 3 year-old brother speaksparagraphs around the pacifier stuck firmly in his mouth, I know that Morganwants to be heard. There's a real boy inside of him somewhere, but he's lost,That's really what it's like; being in the mall with your child and looking down todiscover he's gone. That sickening feeling in the pit of your stomach, that lump inyour throat, wondering what's happened to your baby.Some days, I feel like that all the time. Except - every once in a while - I catch aglimpse of the real boy. The way his eyes light up when I bring the Christmas Treehome. The smile on his face when he jumps into the pool or the way he sitsperfectly still, enraptured, when we go to the symphony. He loves music, animals,birthday parties (anyone's), trains, books, swings, ice cream, and his family.But he can't tell me his favorite color, or how his day at school was, or what hurtswhen he falls off the swing set. He can label objects and count and tell me whatcolor something is.... But he still hasn't figured out how to express or revealhimself through language. He doesn't seem to understand why this is so important to us. 2 54 Why? Why is that? Why is my son locked inside of himself? And moreimportantly - what can I do to set him free? These are the two big questions thatrattle around in your head when you have an autistic child. Sadly, there are noanswers, just more questions: Is there a genetic disposition? Is it environmentalsomething in the water? Do pesticides cause it? Preservatives? Antibiotics?Immunizations? NutraSweet? The time he fell and hit his head? These are alltheories that we've heard and considered over the years. For now, though, itremains a bone fide medical mystery. We have no idea why our son is autistic...and - honestly - it really doesn't matter that much to me. I don't care about WHYas much as I care about HOW.How can we treat this overwhelming blanket of isolation that covers our son? And,again, there are many theories to consider: Vitamin therapy, facilitatedcommunication, restrictive diets, behavior modification, steroids, anti-depressants,ritalin, secretin, and even swimming with dolphins....So, I suppose we've come to the next phase of our \"grieving process\", if you will:Acceptance. We love our son so much that we could never, ever give up the hopethat he'll one-day carry on a conversation with us. Or even just say, \"Hi Dad\"when I come home from work. I suppose the diffeleace is that, somewhere alongthe line, it's become more of a dream than a hope.Morgan is a truly beautiful person in his own right, just as he is. I've never metanyone (and I doubt I ever will) who lives more in the moment than my son does.He has no concept of time; there is only the here and now for Mo. I defy you tofind a person who gets more enjoyment from a playground swing than my son. Heis affectionate, imaginative, and even humorous, sometimes - and. I've learnedmore from hint than I have from any other single person in my life. He's autistic,and that's just the way he is.But not everyone can be so lucky. Morgan isn't aggressive or self-injurous likesome people with autism. Morgan is eight years old. We've had a lot of time tocome to terms with this. Even so, the frustration of dealing with Autism is nearlyeclipsed by the frustration at the lack of concrete information about this disorder.Autism used to be considered a rare disorder, the kind of thing you see in moviesor read about in books, but it never actually happened to anyone you knew. Lately,the diagnosis has become almost commonplace. In 1998, the Autism Society ofAmerica estimated that autism occurs in nearly 15 of every 10,000 individuals. In 3 55 January of this year, that estimate increased to l in 500, and we still have nogreater understanding of this disorder.This hearing is entitled, \"The Challenges of Autism Why the Increased Rates?\"...And I wish I could tell you. In fact, if anyone who comes before you today cananswer that question with any significant degree of accuracy (or even certainty), itwould be a dream come true for me. It would seem to me that we couldn't knowwhy the diagnoses of Autism are increasing until we know what causes Autism. Oreven exactly what it is. But we don't...More research must be done. This is imperative. We have to determine once-and-for-all the cause and origin of Autism. It needs to be researched, documented, andfree of dispute. Then we can move toward a cure.I've lived with my son's disability for eight years now. After all the reading andresearch and treatments, I'm still no closer to really understanding what's wrongwith Morgan. For eight years, people have been asking me, \"What exactly isAutism?\". For once, I'd like to be able to give them an answer without shruggingmy shoulders.The irony, of course, is that it probably won't make any difference for Mo. He'sautistic, andbarring the discovery of a magic pill that cures autism he'sprobably going to be this way for the rest of his life. And that's OK. He's a prettyhappy kid, all things considered. We're lucky enough to be able to provide himwith a good life. All that aside, one in every 500 families shouldn't have to livewith this disorder... and what if the numbers keep increasing?The repercussions of this increase are far-reaching. These kids will needspecialized education and appropriate care for the rest of their lives. Are we readyfor this? Are our schools equipped to handle such an increase? This overwhelmingsurge in autism will not only affect individual families, but entire communities andthe world in which we all live.And so here I am, in the only suit that I own, standing before the legislative arm ofthe ruling body of the greatest nation in the world. For me, this small diatribe isone of the most important things I've ever done... and with all due respect to thetremendous body of work before you; I'd like to think it's important for each ofyou, as well.Thank you.Kenneth & Kimberly Curtis 4 56Mr. SMYTHE. Thank you very much, Congressman Burton, Con-gressman Waxman, and other Members of Congress, for this oppor- tunity to speak here for my son and for the tens of thousands ofautistic children around this country and the millions of peoplewho are affected by this, literallyparents, brothers and sisters,aunts and uncles, grandparents, and so on.I will keep my remarks to 5 minutes, but I would like to makethree points here, and I would like you to write these down.The first is that living with these children can be hell. They candestroy your entire home. You cannot keep anything nice around.They will ruin your rugs. They will jump off the furniture. Theywill move the furniture around the room, push it over, breakthings, clear counters with one sweep of the arm. And they do allof these things with no malice whatsoever.One cannot take them to friends' homes. One cannot stay over-night at friends' homes. When one is at a friend's or a relative'shome, they will be worse there because it is a strange environment.The second point is that no one to my knowledge is consistentlymeasuring acquired autism. And Congressman Waxman, you men-tioned that there is no causal connection between autism and vac-cines.Mr. WAXMAN. I did not say that.Mr. SMYTHE. That there is no measurable causal connection.Mr. WAXMAN. I said there is a theory, and that theory is stillcontroversial.Mr. SMYTHE. Is unproven. And I would suggest to you that weare now defining autism behaviorally; that certain activity, certainbehaviors on the part of these children cause them to be classifiedas autistic, and then, most of the medical community gives up. Andthere is a difference between classical autism, a child who is bornautistic, that one knows is autistic, and most doctors have beentrained about autism because that is the way they were born, andthey show up that way; and this late-onset autism that we are see-ing, this acquired autism, if you will. There is a tremendous dif-ference, and there may be many different medical causes. But be-cause, in our language, we are not making that distinction, we arenot able to follow medical cures or even medical causation. So thatis an important distinction which I think needs to be made for allof us and by the NIH.If you look at the insurance companies, if a child is labeled autis-tic, they will not cover it. It does not matter what the cause of thatbehavior is. If you look at the educational models, if you speak tothe professionals in education, they do not have a distinction to myknowledge in the way that children who are acquired autistic aretrained, compared with children who are classically autistic, howthey are educated. The end result is that our educational modelsare not recognizing that some of these children may in fact justsimply be sick; they may just simply be diseased. As a result, weare letting them down, and they are going through the educationalsystem basically being warehoused, without any treatment, eithermedically or educationally.From a financial standpoint, the stresses are huge. When onehas an autistic child, suddenly, a whole new world of potential 57trauma has opened up, and there is very little known on this sub- ject with regard to treatment.We have followed a number of different treatment programsau- ditory integration therapy, vision therapy, speech therapy, occupa- tional therapy, and sensory integration therapy. We have partici- pated in swimming and horseback riding, had CAT-scans, allergy testing, stool analysis and urine analysis, and all kinds of blood analysis. What we have noticed is that there is often kind of an uncaring attitude by the providers of many of these services, that \"Maybe we will find out what is going on.\" But their house is not being destroyed. They do not have the motivation or the drive, it seems, to research this process. But it is very important to re- search.Our school system is so overwhelmed that a recent Indianapolis Star article said that the State of Indiana has now changed the rules, so that a special education teacher can include anyone who has a college degree. What kind of special education is that? There is such a need out there, and the burdens are only going to become much greater.The waiting list for Indiana's Medicaid waiver in order for a par- ent to get some financial assistance here is 3 years, and as I under- stand, it is growingit has to growwith the increase in the num- bers of these children.The ignorance in the insurance industry is phenomenal. I noticed that Secretary Shalala and the First Lady spoke about the use of ritalin in children, and I have heard that 10 to 20 percent of chil- dren are now on ritalin. Has it occurred to anyone that there may very well be and almost certainly is a causal connection that is re- lated between ADD and this increase in autism; that they may be all part of one spectrum? I suggest that this needs to be looked at. But we have to make distinctions in language in order to do that. Mr. BURTON. Mr. Smythe, if you could summarize, please, we would appreciate it. I know that you have a lot to cover, and we do appreciate your testimony.Mr. SMYTHE. Thank you, Congressman.The bottom line is that there are ways to measure how at least some of what is now showing up as autistic behavior, seems to be immune-related is affecting the brain differently from most of us, how it can be treated and then cured, and how the treatment itself can be seen to produce results in the return of blood flow to thebrain.I sincerely request that the members of this panel, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services look very carefully into this process and support the healing of these childrenat least the subset which is probably responsible for this large increase.Thank you very much.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Mr. Smythe. We appreciate you being here.Ms. Reynolds.[The prepared statement of Given ToGovernment Reform CommitteeHearing onAutismPresent Challenges, Future Needs - Why the Increased Rates?April 6, 2000 Thank you for the opportunity to speak for tay son and the tens of thousands of children,and the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of parents, siblings and grandparentssuffering from \"autism.\" (See Exhibit 1, Yazbak study). To be brief, our problems aresevere, and they are exacerbated by ignorance and resulting inability to help on the part ofdoctors, health insurance companies, and schools.Consider the following circumstances in your home, with your child:Your child urinates or defecates somewhere on the floor every day. lie does thesame every night in his room, because he is up at least two to four hours betweenone and five AM every night If you go to visit friend or relative overnight, hisbehavior will be even worse, because he is in a strange environment.If you don't know where he is, and what he is doing, you know that you may regretit. He likes to play in the toilet, leave the water running in the upstairs tub, and openthe door and leave. He doesn't know about traffic.When your child is up at night, he moves the furniture in the room regularly,sometimes pushing an entire dresser through the drywall. He spends hours jumpingfrom the highest places he can climb to onto the hardwood floor. He laughs orscreams uncontrollably, as if drunk- Noone in the house can really sleep ... nightafter night.Your child only eats a few things: carbohydrates and sugars. He carries the food allover your home, and crumbs are everywhere. When you take him to a restaurant, heruns to strangers plates and begins eating their french fries without anyacknowledgement. Or he puts his hand in their drink to get some ice. He may dothis at any time during your restaurant visit, while regularly crawling to the floor toeat someone else's food left there.He will not sit, but must jump from all of the furniture in your home for hours at atime. He will push any lamp, picture, book, papers or porcelain pieces on the floor BEST COPY AVAILABLE 59 without thought, sometimes clearing an entire counter with one sweep of his arm.He is not angry, can't be disciplined, and doesn't seem to feel pain.He sometimes opens the car door while you are driving.This happened to us for two years, and we are not unique among these families. In ourexperience, it is hard to find babysitters for a child like this. Only grandparents have the loveto help out, and many families do not have these. Some families have two or three autisticchildren!The result is that life, as the family knew it before the child, stops. Time and possibilities forchildren's activities, friendships, and vacations are transformed into doctor's visits, laboratorytests, behavioral and speech therapist sessions, IEP and school educational struggles.Insurance companies refuse to pay medical bills for treatment. Friendships end for lack ofcommunication. Siblings lack the attention they deserve.Financially, the costs can be devastating. In 1998, we spent over $30,000 on treatments,programs, medicine and tests for our son John. We couldn't afford this, and neededfinancial help. Many families don't have such help available to them. They are stuck in apoor neighborhood with this condition, and no place to go for help.Treatment programs for our son have included Auditory Integration Therapy, VisionTherapy, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Sensory Integration Therapy. Wehave participated in swimming and horseback riding, the Option Program, and pictureexchange programs. Tests have included CAT scans, allergy testing, elemental hair analyses,antioxidant tests, urine profiles, stool analyses, and numerous blood analyses.The uproar over Secretin should be a teaching lesson to everyone that parents are desperatefor results. And many ignorant, uncaring, or outright fraudulent providers of \"services\" ofdifferent kinds are preying on us. Our son lost the few words he had after AuditoryIntegration Training. We saw doctors charging $1,000 and more for a dose of Secretin.Our school system would not tell us what programs were available to us, and denied usoptions we found out should have been fully available until we hired an attorney in thesecond year of the process. Now we are struggling with the nibbling away of the fifteenhours per week that our son is supposed to be receiving. The provider is subtracting time toprepare materials, take notes, write down observations, and talk to us. Our son is lucky toget 12.5 hours per week, and usually that is spent sitting on a swing observing, or watchinghim watch the weather channel rather than interacting with him. He is supposed to get 1hour of speech therapy per day minimally, and gets twenty minutes twice a week from thesystem that receives federal funds for his autism. But we have learned that our schoolsystem is overwhelmed with the increase in incidence of these kinds of children. Accordingto a recent Indianapolis Star article, the State of Indiana is so desperate for Special Educationteachers that they will allow anyone with a college degree to be one. What kind of specialeducation is this?The insurance companies will pay nothing for a child with autism. We found no companywithout this exclusion in their contracts. The waiting list for Indiana's Medicaid waiver, if BEST COPY AVAILABLE 60 you get on the list and they don't \"lose\" your spot in the meantime, is now three years.Because early intervention can be critical, the wait can be devastating to a child's ability torecover.But we now have great hope. After years of reading books about autism, trying tounderstand why some children come out of the condition and some do not, we have learnedthat the term \"autism\", as used today, is a behavioral diagnosis and not a medicaldiagnosis because of its expanded definition to include so many children.with differentdegrees of anti-social/behavioral conditions. (see Exhibit 2, Washington Post article).However, for most children, the behavior is caused by an underlying medical condition andthese children can be treated. None of the insurance companies, school or programproviders, or even physicians in Indiana with whom we met, induding the pediatricimmunologist at our local children's hospital, made this distinction. Ignorance is rampant.Perhaps because it is not their lives that are altered each day, they are not compelled tointerrupt their lives to learn. For example, the pediatric immunologist said he did not treatautism. We said, \"we're not asking you to treat autism; we are asking you to find out if hehas an immune system disorder.\" He refused to assist us because: 1) the tests are nottraditionally run in cases like John's, and 2) he could not justify running them to an insurancecompany. When we offered to pay for the tests ourselves, he still refused to order them. Hetold us that if we wanted these done, we would have to go to California and see Dr.Goldberg. He had Dr. Goldberg's information from us prior to the appointment, but stillrefused the logic of the reasoning for running the tests.My wife Denise and I followed the secretin story carefully, as well as Dr. William Shaw'swork at Great Plains Laboratory. We called and interviewed the physician who spoke on thetelevision program Dateline, spent significant time on the phone with Dr. Shaw, and readabout the peptide work being done. We followed every thread we could find on theInternet, trying to understand all of the pieces of the puzzle and the conditions necessary forit to work, as Dr. Rimland and DAN (Defeat Autism Now) seemed to be promoting.the useof Secretin for some children. During this time, I followed the web site of Dr. SydneyBaker, one of the DAN Protocol authors (see Exhibit 3), and found his conclusion \"mypresent view is that autism and related developmental problems in children will turnout to be of viral origin\" and his link to Dr. Goldberg's website, neuroimmunedr.com.(see Exhibit 4).On Dr. Goldberg's site, I found, for the first time in two years, a cogent medical explanationbacked with systems for diagnosis, treatment, and scientific measurements of progresstoward healing for children tested to be immune deficient (see Exhibit 5). The site is anoasis of understanding and treatment possibilities for children with autism, attention deficitdisorder (ADD), and progressive developmental disorder (PDD) caused by neuroimmunedisorders. It made sense to me that if there is viral or autoimmune cause to the illness, thetreatment for such cause would be fundamental to a cure.We learned, by having blood tests and immune panels prepared from our son John's bloodtests (something no physician before had thought to do), that he had high HHV6 titers andlow Natural Killer (NK) cells, a condition which is not caused genetically, but which is adisease probably brought on by genetic susceptibility. However, John is now curable! 61 Treatment began a year ago, a0d despite two setbacks due to illness in the process, John isimproving very steadily. The life described in the beginning of this short presentation hasdramatically changed, in too short a period to be attributed to maturity. We have arelationship with him. We all laugh and play together now. He always listens andsometimes follows simple directions. He doesn't mess the floor anymore. He has beensleeping through the night since December. His HHV6 titers are down. Dr. Goldbergexpects John to mainstream in the next two years. With your help, it could be sooner.John seemed to developed normally until about age twenty months. We thought he was thebrightest of all of our children, and his brother, in eighth grade, just scored 1390 on thecollege SAT. The immunization schedules of John and his siblings show that John receivedthe Hepatitis B vaccine the day he was born, May 11, 1995, and the third injection before hewas age one. This was before his older siblings, who received theirs in 1996. (see Exhibit 6).In addition to this, Denise had gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with John, and hehad a history of chronic ear infections beginning at two months of age. (see Exhibit 7).Perhaps, with Denise's diabetes, his pediatrician, a Cannel physician now specializing in thearea of autism and ADD who, I am told, now treats over 400 children, should have beenmore prudent about the use of vaccines on the day he was born, and thereafter as his earinfections signaled a weak immune system. At some point, with all of the stress put on hisimmune system, perhaps because of the MMR/DPT vaccine or one of his many earinfections by age two, we believe that he suffered the equivalent of an immunological\"stroke\". We are now trying to recovery from this.Families with autism need the following kinds of help to deal with this life-changingcondition:Doctors educated to know that this behavioral condition may be caused by atreatable medical illness, and willing to learn new methods of diagnosis andtreatment;Schools in which teachers and staff understand that many, if not all of thesechildren are sick, not defective, and can be helped and rehabilitated to have abright, normal future;Education for parents and the medical profession about the difference between theold, classic definition of autism and the new form of acquired autism;Insurance companies to recognize that these children are sick, but can and need tobe made well;Money for research and education, to assist those qualified medical professionalswho understand the problem to fill in the answers in the next two years and speedrecovery of these children so that they resume normal development and becomeproductive citizens.In May, 1999, 45 days into treatment for John, I attended a conference on NeuroimmuneDySfunction Syndrome at the National Institute of Mental Health. The curriculum vitae ofmost of the speakers, and a short summary of the presentations, is attached. (See Exhibit 8).While I have great respect for the many physicians and professionals toiling to help thesechildren, to nay knowledge only the NIDS Medical Research Board combines the applicationof real science to make many autistic children well today with 1) predictable results, 2) BEST COPYAVAILABLE 69-622D-01--3 62 scientifically measurable markers, and 3) commitment to the safety and well-being of thepatients. They have a business plan and are confident in their ability to quickly speed theiralready predictable solutions for autism caused by neuroimmune dysfunction in a short time.(See Exhibit 9). We are only one of the many families seeing significant, predictedimprovement. (See Exhibit 10). Independent medical research supports their scientificapproach. (see Exhibit 11). Political affiliation among different autism camps will not affectthe knowledge gaps needed to be filled for quicker neuroimmune solutions, but can delaythe process necessary to attain it. Even if a genetic solution is attainable in ten years, wepatents are willing to drive an earlier version of solutions today with our children. For thesake of our children and our families, please support the NIDS research team and thescience that produces S-- 66 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 72 67Ms. REYNOLDS. Mr. Chairman and Members, my name is Shelley Reynolds. I live in Baton Rouge, LA with Aidan, my husband of 8 years, and my children, Liam, who is 4, and Mairin, who is 2. Iwould like to thank you both for holding this hearing and allowingme to testify before you today.I met Aidan in the 10th grade. We were in love with each other from day one. We dated all through college, and we got married as soon as we graduated. We had our own house, two cars, two ca-reers, and two dogs. We were living the American dream.Right after we were married, Hurricane Andrew, one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever hit the United States, slammedthrough Baton Rouge. Sustained winds of 100 miles an hour ripped off our roof, and 8 days without electricity left us with very little food or water. We promised each other we would never again be unprepared for such a disaster.But 6 years later, hurricane-force winds blew into our home again. This time, the disaster was the diagnosis of autism for our first born son Liam. It completely tore our home apart, and the ef-fects have lasted much longer than 8 days. No amount of prepared-ness can ready you for a storm such as this.Liam was a normally developing baby until June 27, 1997, whenhe received his MMR and Hib vaccines. He did everything he was supposed to do. He cooed, rolled over, crept, crawled, pulled up and walked on time. He said \"Mamma,\" he said \"Daddy,\" he said \"Loveyou.\" He learned how to sing \"Itsy Bitsy Spider.\" He played fingergames with us. He loved to interact, and he especially loved toshow off for his grandparents.We did all the well-baby checkups on time. I breast-fed him untilhe was 8 months old. I did not start solid foods until he was 4 months old. We did everything completely by the book.But when he was 17 months old, shortly after he had receivedthe shots, he started exhibiting some different behaviors. He was constantly taking off his shoes; he screamed if we dressed or un- dressed him; he would stare for hours in front of the television andwould not move if you blocked the view. He could not tolerate play-ing in the sandbox anymore. He did not want to sing any of his fa-vorite songs; he would cover his ears and scream \"No.\"We assumed he was just asserting his independence, since hewas almost 2. And somewhere along the way, he developed chronic,nonspecific diarrhea, sometimes 8 to 10 times a day, and still suf-fers from that 3 years later.By April 1998,I realized that Liam was no longer saying\"Mamma\" or \"Daddy\" or \"Love you,\" so I took him for a speech andlanguage evaluation. They told me that my 27-month-old child hadthe language capacity of an 8-month-old. This was a child who onlymonths before would chime in \"Ee-i-ee-i-o\" at the appropriate mo- ment when singing \"Old MacDonald.\"What had happened to our beautiful baby boy, and how could we help him? My husband and I decided to become advocates andwork for increased funding for autism research and awareness. The answers may not come in time to help our son, but we are hopefulthat we can persuade you to see the need for intensive research re- garding this disorder which is affecting more and more childrenevery year.73 68In Liam's case, we have no doubt that he developed his autismas a direct result of an adverse vaccine reaction. And personally,if I could strike the belief that my son's autism sprang from a rou-tine childhood vaccination, that I held him down on the table forand had to go back to the Russian roulette of genetics, I would takeit in a heartbeat, because the pain of knowing that I inadvertentlycaused him harm due to blind trust in the medical community, ora matter of inconvenience of yet another office visit taking timeaway from my job is nearly unbearable.Many in the medical community continue to dismiss this as merehappenstance because autism often coincides with the time of vac-cination, and state that there is no scientific evidence to back thisup. My question to you is: How long does it take for a coincidenceto surface time and time and time again, case after case after case,before it can become a viable hypothesis, especially when the solu-tion to solving the problem seems so apparent? How can pharma-ceutical companies concoct substances with mercury, formaldehyde,antifreeze, lead, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue and live virusesand not expect that as they continue to pour these highly toxic andreactive substances into children, increasing dose after dose, all onthe same day, that it will not alter their minds and bodies?Why would it be so completely impossible for a child to contracta chronic form of the disease rather than to have the \"properimmunologic response,\" especially if their immune systems are notup to par? And where is their scientific evidence to back up theclaim that this cannot happen, when it is published in the verypackage inserts, in their writing, that they have not studied the ef-fects of these vaccines for more than a few weeks, or longer thanthe incubation of this disease itself?What happens when you give multiple doses in 1 day or combinedifferent diseases into one hypodermic needle?I need someone to explain to me why it is acceptable to haveproducts on the market that exposed my son to 37.5 microgramsof mercury in 1 day at a time when he should not have been ex-posed to more than .59 micrograms of mercury given his bodyweight. I should not be exposed to more than 5 micrograms, andI have 31 years of an immune history behind me. It is completelyunacceptable. One size does not fit all when it comes to vaccines.Through our organization, Unlocking Autism, we have talkedwith thousands and thousands of parents from across the country,and their story is the same: Child is normal; child gets vaccine;child disappears within days or weeks into the abyss of autism.If you doubt me, I invite you to come to the \"Hear Their Silence\"rally on April 8th on the Mall, where the \"Open Your Eyes\" projectwill be displayed and view the thousands of pictures that we havecalled and realize that 47 percent of those people who participatedbelieve that vaccines contributed in some way to the developmentof their child's autism.Parents like me are relying on you to demand that the pharma-ceutical companies retrace their steps once again and that the pub-lic health community look at the possibility that these things mightindeed not just be a coincidence. They obviously have a forced mar-ket. They manufacture products that are required for every childin this country. We fear that it is possible that while seeking great-74 69er monetary profits, there may be some who have lost sight of themedical community's original goal regarding vaccinationsto pro- tect children from harm.I know my children, and I know what happened to my son. As far as I am concerned, the needle that silently slipped into my baby's leg that day became the shot heard around the world.Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Ms. Reynolds.Ms. Smith.[The prepared statement of Ms. Reynolds follows:] 70 Testimony of Shelley Hendrix ReynoldsBefore the Government Reform CommitteeApril 6, 2000AutismPresent Challenges, Future Needs Why the Increased Rates? Mr. Chairman and members, my name is Shelley Reynolds. I reside in BatonRouge, LA with my husband of eight years, Aidan, and my children, Liam, whois 4 and Mairin, who is 2. I would like to thank you for both holding thishearing and allowing me to testify before you today.I met Aidan in the tenth grade. We were in love with each other from dayone. We dated all through college and got married as soon as we graduated.We had our own house, two cars, two careers. We were living the AmericanDream. Right after we were married, Hurricane Andrew, one of the mostdestructive hurricanes to ever hit the United States, slammed through BatonRouge. Sustained winds of 100 mph ripped up our root Eight days withoutelectricity left us with very little food and water. We promised each otherwe would never again be unprepared for such a disaster.But six years, later hurricane force winds blew into our home again, thistime the disaster was the diagnosis of autism for our first born son, Liam.It completely tore our home apart. The effects have lasted much longer thaneight days. And no amount of preparedness can ready you for a storm such asthis.Liam was a normally developing baby until June 27, 1997, when he received hisMMR and Hib vaccines. Developmentally, everything was progressing completelynormally. He cooed, rolled over, crept, crawled, pulled up and walked ontime. He said all the things that parents crave to hear like \"Momma\",\"Daddy\" and \"Love you.\" His expressive language increased to around 75words. He was very social and had a completely infectious laugh. He likedmusic and learned the hand motions to little songs like \"Itsy Bitsy Spider.\"He loved to interact and show off in front of his grandparents and ourfriends.Well baby check-ups were kept on time. I breast-fed him until he was S monthsold. I didn't start solid foods until 4 months old. We did everythingcompletely by the book and more.When he was 17 months old, Liam started exhibiting some different behaviors.He was constantly taking off his shoes and screaming when we dressed and 71 un-dressed him. He wouldn't let us brush his teeth anymore. He startedstaring into space when he watched a video on television and wouldn't move ifyou stood in front of the television. He couldn't tolerate playing in thesandbox anymore. He didn't want to sing favorite songs anymore and would just scream ''No! No! No!\"We assumed he was just asserting his independence since he was almost 2.Somewhere along the way he developed chronic, non-specific diarrhea ...sometimes 8 to 10 times a day.A month before Liam turned two, visited my parents who live in Tennessee who had not seen Liam since the first week of July, 1997. They were shocked by the changes in him. My mother was alarmed at his lack of response when we tried to speak to him. She urged me to have his hearing tested. I had his hearing tested. It was normal.By April of 1998 I realized Liam was no longer saying \"Momma\" or 'Daddy\"so I took him in for a speech and language evaluation. They told me that my 27 month old child had the language capacity of an 8 month old. This was achild that only months before would chime in \"ElE10\" at the appropriate moment when singing \"Old MacDonald.\"We saw a pediatric neurologist, because that was on the list of things thatyou do with a suspected case of autism, and found that he had no seizure activity. His 12 hour EEG and MRI were normal. We continued doing bloodwork, stool and urine samples to determine his body chemistry, which was acomplete disaster. His immune system was hardly operating. He had a host ofbacterial, paratific and fungal infections. The blood work also confirmedthat he had suffered heavy metal exposure which had stippled his blood cells. Generally this type of thechange in the blood is only seen when someone has been acutely exposed to a toxic metal. Liam had amounts of aluminum, mercury, tin, lead, and antimonythat were off the charts. Liam was sick and in pain. We were scared anddistraught. What had happened to our beautiful baby boy? How could we help him?We decided to become advocates and work for increased funding for autismresearch and for awareness. The answers may not come in time to help our son,but we are hopeful that we can persuade you to see the need for intensiveresearch regarding this disorder which affects more and more children everyyear. In California, only one of the 50 states, at least one child isdiagnosed with autism every four hours, twenty-four hours a day, seven days aweek. How many children have to slip through your fingers before you takenotice that there is a serious problem here and that something other than genetics is causing it? 72 There are those who will argue that we are better at diagnosing autism todaythan in the past and that these children were once considered mentallyretarded. However, according to a recent study, the mentally retarded havefollowed normal population increases and remained a steady constant while theautistic population has exploded. Is autism just the diagnosis du jour?Hardly. I wouldtruly like to know where the parents of these autistic children were thatdid not recognize that their children were not talking, were spinningconstantly in circles, doing odd things, abusing themselves, not making eyecontact, having serious gastrointestinal disturbances, eating and sleepingproblems, experiencing a failure to thrive due to malabsorption and sufferingfrom excessive allergies. You cannot miss these children.In Liam's case, we have no doubt that he developed his autism as the directresult of an adverse vaccine reaction. Personally, if I could strike thebelief that my son's autism sprang from a routine childhood vaccination thatI held him down on the table for, and had to go back to the Russian rouletteof genetics, I would take it in a heartbeat. Because the pain knowing that Iinadvertently caused him harm, due to a blind trust in the medical communityor a matter of the inconvenience of yet another office visit is nearlyunbearable.Many in the medical community continue to dismiss this as a mere happenstancebecause autism often coincides with the time of vaccination and state thatthere is no scientific evidence to back this up. My question to you is, howlong does it take for a coincidence to surface time and again, case aftercase after case before it can become a viable hypothesis, especially, whenthe solution to solving the problem seems so apparent? How canpharmaceutical companies concoct substances with mercury, formaldehyde,antifreeze, lead, aluminum and live viruses not expect that as they continueto pour these highly toxic and reactive substances into children, increasingdose after dose, all on the same day even, that it WON'T alter theirdeveloping minds and bodies? Why would it be so completely impossible for achild to actually contract a chronic form of the disease rather than have a\"proper iimnunological response,\" especially when their immune systems may notbe up to par? And where is THEIR scientific evidence to back up the claimthat this cannot happen, when it is published in the very package inserts, intheir writing, that they have not studied the effects of vaccines for morethan a few weeks? Or longer than the incubation period of the disease itself?Or what happens when you give multiple doses in one day or combine differentdiseases into one hypodermic needle?Could someone please explain to me why it is acceptable to have products onthe market that exposed my child to 37.5 micrograms of mercury in one daywhen at that time he should not have been exposed to more than .59 micrograms 7. 73 of mercury given his body weight? Even a body as big as mine shouldn't beexposed to more than 5 micrograms of mercury in one day. That is completelyunacceptable. One size does not fit all when it comes to vaccines.Through our organization, Unlocking Autism, we have talked to thousands andthousands of parents from across the country and their story is the same. Child is normal, child gets a vaccine, child disappears within days or weeks into the abyss of autism. Ifyou doubt me, I invite you to attend the HearTheir Silence Rally on April 8th on the mall where our Open Your Eyes project will be displayed. View the thousands of pictures we have collected and realize that 47% of those who participated believe that vaccines contributed to the development of their child's autism.Parents like me are relying on you to demand that the pharmaceutical companies retrace their steps once again and that the public health communitylook at the possibility that these things might indeed not be just a coincidence. They obviously have no incentive to do so themselves. They are immune from liability and they have a forced market. They manufactureproducts that are required for every child in this country. We fear that it is possible that while seeking greater monetary profits there may be some who have lost sight of the medical community's original goal regardingvaccinations---to protect children from harm.I know my children.

Mr. Chairman and Meiri. bers, I am Jeana Smith. Ilive in Denham Springs, LA with my husband Darrell and our four small children-5-year-old genetically identical twins, Jesse andJacob, 3-year-old Garrett, and 16-month-old Julianna.Darrell and I have always loved children, and we tried for over 6 years to have a child. We simply gave up on the idea that it was possible, and then I discovered I was pregnant with not one but two babies. I was completely overwhelmed.Perhaps because I had tried so hard to have a child, I took espe- cially good care of my body while I was pregnant with the twins.Our identical twins were born right wi time and were completely healthy. We were absolutely thrilled. Our family was perfect.One month later, we found dark blood mixed in with Jacob's di-arrhea. Jacob had never had diarrhea before. We immediately tookhim to the doctor, who assured us that there was no problem. He mentioned that in the chaos that generally follows the birth oftwins, we had been released from the hospital without them receiv-ing their hepatitis B vaccine and wanted to give it to Jacob thatday.I questioned him, because it did not seem right to give a poten-tially ill child a vaccine, but he convinced me that it was routineand safe and not to worry.Two months later, Jacob received his second hepatitis B vaccineand Jesse his first. On the same day, Jacob and Jesse both receivedtheir first DPT, polio, and Hib vaccination. From that day on, Jacob was constantly coming down with one ear, respiratory, or sinus infection after another. Jacob was constantly on antibiotics.As his mother, I was heartbroken to see him sick or in pain prac-tically all the time. As a new mom, I was embarrassed and frus-trated to have a child who was always ill. I knew I was doing ev- erything I could for him, and I could not understand why he wasconstantly ill.Jacob met every developmental milestone that first year, rightalong with Jesse. They were two little peas in a pod and went ev-erywhere together. At only 16 months of age, Jacob and Jesse re- ceived their first MMR vaccine. On this same day, they also re-ceived their fourth DPT, their fourth Hib, and their third hepatitisB. The following 24 hours, both twins slept most of the time, withover 100-degree temperatures, in spite of receiving the rec- ommended Tylenol dosage every 6 hours. Immediately followingthat, Jacob began exhibiting strange behaviors. He was no longerexcited or responsive when Daddy would come home from work. Hebegan to become preoccupied with certain toys. He would spendlong periods of time studying the way their wheels would spin orwhether or not they were lined up just right. Any attempt to inter-rupt or distract him was met with great resistance and an eventualfit. During this time, Jesse continued to progress, starting to talkand interact with all the children around him.Back to the doctor we went again, but this time with even bigger concerns about the growing developmental difference between Jesseand Jacob. And once again we were met with the \"dominant twin\"theory, that Jacob would probably be more quiet, Jacob would prob-ably want to play by himself more often, and Jacob is fine, stopworrying. 75Finally, we would not stand the undeniable difference between their language and communication skills. Something was most defi- nitely wrong with Jacob. He could not express even the most sim- plest needs or wants. He could not ask for juice or something to eat. Jesse was chattering constantly. And at times, Jacob was so withdrawn that we could absolutely not reach him.On days when Jacob is overloaded from sounds, colors, or lights, we cannot go anywhere. Autism not only isolates the individualwhom it affects; it isolates the entire family. My husband and I have to go to the grocery store independently. When our other chil- dren have programs at school or birthday parties, one of us has tostay home, because Jacob cannot stand the outside stimulation.Our vacations have changed to only being able to go to the beach no amusement parks, no baseball games, no family outings.Unlike most parents of an autistic child, I do not have to wonder what Jacob would have been like. I know what he would have been like. I see what he would have been like every day in Jesse's eyes. I see Jesse excelling in school and in social activities. I see Jesse excited about T -ball; I know that Jacob will probably never play T- ball and that he cannot attend birthday parties.For us, there is no denying that in Jacob's case of autism, the answer does not lie in genetics, but in a catalyst. The thousandsof hours of research that we have spent searching and retracing hisregression continue to point to the fact that the road of Jacob's au- tism began when his immune system was damaged by the hepatitis B vaccine he received when he was ill. The final blow was the ad- verse reaction to the host of vaccines he received 16 months later.We are certain that for Jacob, the catalyst was his vaccine. I cannot bear the thought that after waiting so long and being so careful carrying my twins, I was so easily persuaded to immu-nize Jacob without knowing all that I should. I should have takenthe time to find out what his risk of contracting hepatitis B at only1 month old was. I did not do that. I should have found out aboutall the toxic metals that are used to manufacture the vaccines. Idid not do that. I should have known back then what I do today.I did not. I trusted his pediatrician. I trusted the CDC. I was per- suaded to believe that I was doing the best thing I could to protect my child.No scientist, doctor, researcher or parent looking for answers or resources should never have to question where the funding willcome from. It has to be here, and it has to be here now. I imploreyou to act now. Pleasewe do not have the time to wait for an-other hearing and another panel of parents and experts to adviseus that this epidemic is waiting in the wings. We are swiftly andsilently losing a generation of children to this disease that possiblycould have been avoided. Please let this country be the leader inseeing the percentages of autism decrease and not increase.Every night, Darrell and I tuck two beautiful little boys into bed.On the outside, they look the same. Their pajamas are the same; their bed covers are the same. Everything on them is the same. They have the same ears, and they have matching toes. As Darrelland I sit in between their beds, we talk to Jesse about his day. He gives us all the details of his day at school and tells us everything he did with his friends. He talks about how excited he is for the 76next birthday party that will come this weekend. He talks to Dar-rell about working on his batting swing to prepare for T-ball in thesummer.As he drifts off to sleep, we turn and look at Jacob. We knowthat even at only 5 years old, Jacob will never be able to enjoy thesimple pleasures of childhood the way Jesse does. He will never beon a sports team. He cannot enjoy the fulfillment of a birthdayparty or friends. This difference is real. We know that Jacob's au-tism will not go away.When they fall asleep, we once again see two beautiful, matchingfaces. We know what should have been. It is the only time thattheir faces match. Even though they are identical, Jacob's coun-tenance left when he was 16 months old. The light behind his eyeswas replaced with a blank, lost, bewildered stare.Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Ms. Smith.[The prepared statement of Ms. Smith follows:] 77Testimony of Jeana SmithBefore the Government Reform CommitteeApril 6, 2000Autism - Present Challenges, Future Needs - Why the Increased Rates?Mr. Chairman and Members. I am Jeana Smith. I live in Denham Springs, LAwith my husband Darrell and our four children... 5 year old genetically identicaltwins, Jesse and Jacob, Garrett who is 3 and our grand finale' Julianna, who is 16 months.Darrell and I have always loved children. For six years we tried, unsuccessfully,to have a child and decided that it simply wasn't meant to be. To our complete surprise I found out that I was pregnant with twins - a double blessing!Perhaps, because we had tried so hard to have a child, I took especially good care of my body while I was pregnant with the twins. Our identical twins were born right on time and completely healthy. We were absolutely thrilled. Our family was perfect.One month later we found dark blood mixed in Jacob's diarrhea. Jacob hadnever had diarrhea before. We immediately took him to the doctor who assuredus the blood was from a rectal tear. He mentioned that in the chaos that generally follows the birth of a baby, much less twins, we had been released from the hospital without vaccinating the twins with Hepatitis B. He wanted to vaccinate Jacob right then. We questioned him because it did not seem right to give a potentially ill child a vaccine, but he convincedus that it was routine and safe. Not to worry.Two months later, Jacob received his second Hepatitis B vaccine and Jesse his first. On this same day Jacob and Jesse both received their first DTP, Polio and Hib vaccination. From that day, Jacob was constantly coming down with one ear,respiratory or sinus infection after another. Jacob was constantly on antibiotics. As his mother, I was heartbroken to see him sick or in pain practically all the time. Asa new mom, it was embarrassing and frustrating to have a child that was always ill. I knew I was doing everything I could for him, and couldn't understand why he continually ill.Concerned, we asked our pediatrician and he explained that Jesse was the dominate 78 twin, and this was perfectly normal for Jacob, slightly smaller, to have a weakerimmune system and to be prone to common infections.Jacob met every developmental milestone that first year right along with Jesse.They were two peas in a pod and did everything together.At only 16 months of age Jacob and Jesse received their first MMR vaccine, alongwith their fourth DPT, fourth Hib, and their third Hepatitis B. The following 24hours both twins slept most of the time with 100 degree temperatures, in spite ofreceiving the recommended dosage of Tylenol every six hours. Just days later,Jacob began exhibiting strange behaviors. He was no longer excited or responsivewhen Daddy came home from work. He became preoccupied with certain toys. Hewould spend long periods of time studying the way their wheels would spin orwhether or not they were lined up just right. Any attempt to interrupt or distracthim was met withresistance and an eventual fit. During this time, Jesse wentalong with business as usual.Back to the doctor we went again, this time with very serious concerns about thegrowing developmental difference between Jesse and Jacob. And once again, wewere met with the dominate twin theory. Jacob would probably be more quiet.Jacob would probably want to play by himself more often. \"Jacob is fine, stopworrying.\"Finally we could not stand the undeniable difference in their language andcommunication skills. Something was most definitely wrong with Jacob. He couldnot express even his most simple needs or wants. He couldn't ask for juice orsomething to eat. Jesse was chattering constantly. And at times, Jacob was sowithdrawn that we absolutely could not reach hint.In a waiting room, in front of several other parents, we received Jacob's first officialdiagnosis. The Director of LSU's Speech and Hearing clinic callously and simplystated, \"Mrs. Smith, Jacob is autistic. There is nothing that we can do for himtoday. You will need to call back and make an appointment to see one of ourspeech therapists.\"I will never forget the day I heard those devastating words, theones I knew were coming, but words I would not allow my heart to tell my head. Iwalked out of the office with Jacob in my arms, sobbing and bewildered. THIS ISCOKPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE my mind screamed. Autism is genetic and Jesse isfine. What is going on with my baby?Because we were facing the overwhelming news that our perfect-looking son had a 79 serious life-long disability, the word of one \"expert\" was simply not good enough.We continued seeking answers. Three more diagnosis' quickly followed.Jacob is a beautiful child who has abnormal sleep patterns and has lived withcontinuous physical pain. His lack of sleep keeps me up all hours of the night, andby the time I finally fall asleep, it is time to wake the kids up for school and startthe day. We are constantly working with Jacob to help him understand the outsideworld so that we can maybe go to the grocery store, the mall, the gas station orMcDonald's without him getting hysterical from sensory overload from all thefluorescent lights and sounds.What may sound like water dripping to us may sound like a massive water fall to anautistic child. What may sound like squealing tires to us may sound like the Indy500 up close to a child like my son. On days that he is \"overloaded\" from sound,colors or lights, we can't go anywhere. Autism does not only isolate the child that itaffects. We can't take the family out to dinner or out to have fun. When the otherchildren may be waiting in anticipation to go have a day out with mom and dad, oneof us will have to stay home with Jacob because he is so agitated. If one child has aschool program and Jacob is frustrated, then we have to see that crestfallen look onthe child's face because both mommy and daddy cannot go, since one has to staywith their brother. We know if we take him in public, there will be a scene.Littlethings such as this \"rob\" life's enjoyment from our other children.Unlike most parents of autistic children, I don't have to wonder what my childwould have been like. I see what he would have been through Jesse every day ofmy life. I see Jesse excelling in school, and his social activities. He will be startinga tee ball team this summer. I will have to fmd a babysitter to watch Jacob so thatour family can attend Jesse's games.This may not seem like a lot to some people, but not being able to do thingstogether is not fair to the other children in the family. We have had to explain toJesse and Garrett what Autism is. That is not an easy concept for two small childrento understand. And it is not easy knowing that someday when my husband and I aregone that one of our children may have to take care of Jacob for the rest of his life.We should not have to prepare our children for that possibility. But we have tothink ahead. What happens if Darrell and I go somewhere together and somethinghappens to us? Who will take care of Jacob and see to his needs? Who willunderstand what he is going through? Who will defend Jacob when we are notthere to do it and he cannot do it for himself? Who will understand his frustration ifwe someday aren't around? These are things that keep us, as parents, awake at night BEST COPYAVAILABLE 80- worrying.For us, there is no denying that in Jacob's case of autism, the answer does not lie ingenetics but in a catalyst. The thousands of hours of research that we have spentsearching and retracing his regression continue to point to the fact that the road toJacob's autism began when his immune system was damaged by the Hepatitis Bvaccine he received when he was ill. The final blow was the adverse reaction to thehost of vaccines he received by 16 months. We are certain that for Jacob, thecatalyst was his vaccines.With Jacob's initial diagnosis, many doctors and professionals suggested that weput him on medications designed to mask autistic behaviors. WHAT ANOUTRAGE!To give our small child drUgs to cover up what was actuallyhappening inside his body did not make sense. We wanted to find out what hisbody was doing and treat that first.We were blessed with a wonderful Doctor in Louisiana, Dr. Stephanie Cave. Sheran blood and urine tests to find out what amino acid, vitamin and mineraldeficiencies and immune system dysfunctions Jacob had, along with his exposure toheavy metals, invasive fungal infections and extensive food allergies. The resultswere shocking. It was amazing this little guy was able to do as well as he did.After placing Jacob on a structured, nutritious diet, supplementing his deficienciesand working to restore his immune system, Jacob is giving perfect eye contact andbeginning to initiate and interact in conversation. He has made incredible strides.Jacob is still autistic. There is no doubt about that. But he is only five. Theprogress we have seen inspires us to shout from a mountaintop the hope available toso many children! For hint, it is evident that autism is not always a traditionalcongenital genetic disorder. It can be an acquired syndrome. And that is why I amhere today.There is a huge epidemic of autism in this country with countless parents thatbelieve, as I do, that their child's autism is the result of a vaccine reaction. I havetalked to thousands of parents and they know their children! They are not lookingfor a scapegoat. They are looking for answers and truth. They tirelessly look atevery possible reason their perfectly normal child could slip away so quickly. Ifparents were looking for an excuse for why their child could be snatched away soquickly, they certainly would not choose to put the blame on something they did toprotect their child and keep them from harm. 81 I can't bear the thought that, after waiting so long and being so careful carrying mytwins I was so easily persuaded to immunize Jacob without knowing all I shouldhave.I should have taken the time to find out his risk of contracting HepB, Ididn't.I should have found out about all the toxic metals that are used tomanufacture the vaccines. I didn't. I should have known back then what I do now. I didn't. I trusted his pediatrician, I trusted the CDC. I was persuaded to believe Iwas doing the best thing I could do to protect my child.I can assure you that this epidemic will not go away until we address it. Everyscientist, doctor, researcher, parent looking for answers and resources should never have to question where their funding will come from.It has to be here now!Ifyou don't deal with this today, how will you deal with it in 15 years?Three years ago when Jacob was diagnosed, autism affected at least 1 in 500children. Now it affects one in 300 children nationwide. In some places it affects as many as 1/127.Today, Coast to Coast the school and service systems are over run.In California alone the tax dollars will cost 2 million dollars per childdiagnosed with autism. Last year alone almost 2,000 children were diagnosed with autism and added to the already .... system. We cannot run from this. The numbersare rising. The numbers are real. Autism and the children, and adults and familiesaffected by it are living in the towns and cities of every person in this room.I implore you to act now. You do NOT have time to wait another year for another hearing and another panel of parents and experts to advise you that an epidemic iswaiting in the wings. We are swiftly and silently losing a generation of children toa disease that could possibly be avoided. While we are taking our children everyafternoon to the therapies that they need to make it through the day, or charting the15 supplements that we have to give them in order to keep their body chemistryafloat, or monitoring every crumb or drop that enters their mouth in the hopes that it does not contain a trace of gluten or casein, or educating the teachers that work withour children everyday, or fighting the school system to make sure that our childrenget the education that they are entitled to, or arguing with the insurance company about the fact that yes that very expensive test was absolutely necessary indetermining the best course of medical intervention for my child, or working two jobs to pay for the multitude of services that our children need because thegovernment can't keep up with the demand, we need YOU on the front linesdemanding answers from the medical community. We need YOU on the front linerequiring the pharmaceutical companies to come up with the research that theyshould have done decades ago. We need YOU to fund the independent scientists so that they can maintain their objectivity in investigating the possibility of a 82 connection between vaccines and autism. We need YOU to help fund the researchthat will ultimately lead us to a cure for these kids.Please, let this country be the leader in seeing the percentage decrease not increase.Just like Jacob, these children are not without hope. They can get better. Jacob isdoing better than we ever imagined. But we have fought, and scratched, and 'struggled to get him the things that he needs. A child with Autism is a puzzle for usall. And each piece of the puzzle is incredibly important. But closing your eyesand relying on 40 years of medical rhetoric that has dismissed autism as a meregenetic, psychiatric disorder will keep parents like me from having the answers thatwe certainly deserve. Good science research into the autism/vaccine connectionmust begin NOW in a serious and accelerated way, with independent researchinstitutes like the M.I.N.D. Institute at U.C. Davis leading the way.Every night Darrell and I tuck two beautiful little boys into bed. On the outsidethey look just the same. Their bed covers and pajamas match, their cheeks and hairmatch, There is nothing on their body that does not match, even their toes are thesame.As Darrell and I sit in between their beds we talk with Jesse about his day.He gives us all the details of his day at school and tells everything he did with hisfriends. He talks about how excited he is for the birthday party at his cousinshouse this weekend. He talks with Darrell about working on his batting swing toprepare for T ball this summer. As he drifts off to sleep, we turn to tuck in Jacob.We know, even at only 5, Jacob will never be able to enjoy the simple pleasures ofchildhood the way Jesse does. He will never be on a sports team. He cannot enjoythe fulfillment of birthday parties or friends. The difference is real! We knowJacob's autism will not go away! When they fall asleep, we once again can see twobeautiful matching faces and know what should have been. It is the only time theirfaces match. Even though they are identical, Jacob's countenance left when he was16 months old. The light behind his eyes was replaced with a blank, lost,bewildered stare.I cannot count the times Darrell and I have cried quietly in between their bedswhile they sleep. We cannot imagine that anyone else could understand such grief.Tomorrow morning, or perhaps, in the middle of the night we will be awakened bythe reality of their difference, by the reality that Jacob is autistic. 83Mr. BONO. Before I begin, I would like to give you the perspective of an autistic parent.Right now, I am morenervous about where my son is, becauseI do not see him, than Iam about being before you today. That isa constant worry in the mind of a parent of an autistic child.My name is Scott Bono, and I live in Durham, NC with my wife Laura and my children, Dylan, Ashley, and Jackson. I have read the testimony and heard the stories of other parents in similar cir- cumstanceschange that to \"identical circumstances.\" Our story is not much different.We had a perfectly normalpregnancy and birth of our son. In thefirst 16 months of life, he learned language, played with toys, ap- propriately began pretending skills, initiated contact with his twin sisters, and could light up a room with his wonderful personality.He was brighter than most, and he could even tell the difference between a Concord jet and a 727 at such an early age. On August 9, 1990, Jackson would begin a journey into silence, bewilderment, and a medical enigma. That was the day he received his MMR immunization. He would not sleep that night. In the days to follow, he would develop unexplained rashes and horrible con- stipation and diarrhea. After eating, he would experience projectilevomiting that would scare him.His normally very healthy body was being ravaged by an in- vader. Over the next weeks, he would slip away, unable to listen or speak. He retreated into what we now know as autism. He be-came allergic to everything in his world. His immune markers sky-rocketed.What was the reason for this change? It is my sincerest believe that it was that shot.The single biggest challenge in raising an autistic child is gettingappropriate, informed, and competent medical services. As I sit be-fore you today, autism is, as it has been for decades, viewed as a psychological disorder. I cannot help but wonder about and getfrustrated by the lack of medical and physiological intervention forall of these children.I live just 3 miles from Duke University Medical Center, yet forone of the most effective treatments for Jackson's gastrointestinalproblems, I drive 12 hours for a procedure that takes 5 minutes.I have been doing this for the past 21/2 years and will be making this trip 13 times this year alone.To dismiss Jackson's acidic diarrhea for 7 years because \"autistic children sometimes do that\" is just what happened. That is just un- acceptable. As my son's advocate, I know that he is not receivingthe medical treatment he needs, and I believe that as long as au- tism is regarded as a psychological disorder, this will always be thecase. We need and seek responsible, effective and caring physicianswho do not dismiss the patient's ailments as \"behaviors,\" but look at them as treatable medical conditions with appropriate medicalintervention.This is what I believe to be the single biggest problem in gettinggroup insurers to pay for medical services. Insurers must pay ac-cording to their contract. It is the law. But if a doctor says the visit to his office is for the treatment of autism when the autistic childis being seen for gastrointestinal distress, the insurer will not pay89 84the claim. If, however, the diagnokic code for the visit shows thatit is for gastrointestinal distress, the bill will be paid. The diag-nosis of autism is used as a shield by some insurers to deflect theresponsibility of paying for medical and remedial treatment forthese children's medical problems.The expenses of seeing Jackson's needs are overwhelminghun-dreds of thousands of dollars over the past 8 years. After goingthrough all of our savings and retirement, we continue to accumu-late debt to meet his educational and therapeutic needs and hismedical needs.Our priority right now is to get him well. There are other costsbesides financial. Jackson is on a very strict diet that takes timeand money. If he eats offending foods, he gets a rash, has diarrhea,and we will not sleep for the next 5 nights. His behaviors will wors-en.How do I put a cost on not sleeping for 6 years? How do I puta cost on attention not paid to my daughters because I am seeing to the needs of my son? How do I put a cost on locking every door and window at all times for fear of him wandering out of thehouse?Financial burden is only part of it. It is only part of the picturethat families with autistic children face. If the price of eradicatingmeasles, mumps, rubella, or any other illness is thousands of autis-tic children or health-impaired children, is it worth it? Have wesimply traded acute illness for chronic disease? Is that worth theprice?Autism has reached epidemic proportions, and the numbers arestill growing. We must allocate funds to find the cause and thecure. The U.S. Department of Education indicates the increase in autism is 900 percent in the 8 years since 1992. If tooth decay wentup 900 percent, we would be scrambling for answers.The statistics can no longer be ignored. Thousands of parentswho claim their children were developing normally until the MMRvaccine should no longer be ignored. We all cannot be wrong.As elected officials, you hold the public trust, the essence of faithin Government. Your challenge is to uphold that trust.Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Bono.Dr. Dankner.[The prepared statement of Mr. Bono follows:] 85April 6, 2000 \"The Challenges of Autism Why the Increased Rates?\"Scott BonoThank you, each of you, for allowing me to come before you today. I will talk about the challenges of raising an autistic child, with particular attention given to finding treatmentoptions, the personal financial burden of treatment, and insurance reimbursement issues.I have read the testimony and stories of other parents in similar circumstances. Our story is not much different. We had a perfectly normal pregnancy and birth of our son. His first sixteen months of life were filled with joy. He learned language, played with toys, appropriately began pretending skills, initiated contact with his twin sisters, and could light up a room with his wonderful little personality. He was brighter than most and could even tell the difference between a Concorde jet and a regular one at such a young age. He was a joy.On August 9th, 1990, Jackson would begin a journey into silence, bewilderment, and amedical enigma. That was the day he received his 1VIIVIR immunization. He would not sleep that night. In the days after the vaccine, he would develop unexplained rashes and horrible constipation and diarrhea. After eating he would experience projectile vomiting that would scare him. His normally very healthy body was being ravaged by an invader. Over the next weeks, he would slip away. Unable to listen or speak, he retreated intowhat we now know as autism. He became allergic to everything in his world. His immune markers skyrocketed. What was the reason for this change? It is my sincerest belief, that what caused his autism was that shot.We would visit our pediatrician many times over the next few months for help, only to bedismissed. \"There is nothing to worry about, boys develop slower than girls, you are comparing him to your daughters.\"The single biggest challenge in raising an autistic child is getting appropriate, informedand competent medical services. As I sit before you now, autism is, as it has been fordecades, treated as a physiological disorder. I can't help but wonder about and get frustrated by the lack of medical and physiological intervention for all of these children.Unfortunately, there are more autistic children today. Fortunately, there are more informed parentswho thanks to the internet have more access to information than no other time are able to affect changes in their children. They are not accepting the line, \"there is not much information and research about your child's condition,\" and they have pulled a small group within the medical community into thinking out of the box..The parents are the ones who have been finding treatment options for their children. Theyhave to beg, coax, and cajole to get the doctor to think that the treatment they believe will help their child, was the doctors idea before the treatment is made available for theirchild. And, therein lies the problem. Doctors don't know what treatment options are available.Treatments are available. But, so few doctors are really willing to work with these children. If you can find a doctor who is willing, you will wait months for the opportunity BEST COPY AVAILABLE 86 to see them. If you find that special doctor who is willing to work with these children,they become swamped with new patients; until they can't or won't accept any newpatients.I live just three miles from Duke University Medical Center, yet for one of the mosteffective treatments for Jackson's gastrointestinal problems, I must drive 12 hours everyfour weeks for a procedure that takes less than 5 minutes. I have been doing this for thepast two years, and will make this trip 13 times this year alone.In medical school, autism is not taught as a medical disorder. If it is mentioned, it issomething that a psychologist would delve into, not a medical student.As long as autism is explained by, and treatment options exclusively available frompsychologists finding the cure will be out of reach.A psychological explanation of behavior does nothing for explaining a medical orphysiological situation. Here is an example:You have three bran muffins and a glass of prune juice for breakfast. You hop on themetro to get to your Capitol Hill office, and you expect to be there in 20 minutes. But, thetrain in front of yours has stopped, and you are stuck for the next 90 minutes. Paralyzedby the fear of the normal demands of your body, you begin to sweat. You become moreirritable. The last thing you want to do is make small talk with people who suddenlyrecognize you. They think your abrupt behavior is weird. They wonder what you are\"hiding\" because no one else is sweating. You get the picture...To explain your state of emotions does not help you. To develop \"coping methods\" and\"strategies\" is not what you need. You don't want a psychologist asking you if you aresure that there is not some \"other reason\" you are behaving in a perturbed and anxiousmanner. Your behavior is obviously emanating from a physical need. Autistic childrenare no different.To dismiss my child's acidic diarrhea for seven years because \"autistic childrensometimes do that\" is just what happened to Jackson. His diarrhea would be so acidic thatif not immediately washed off would create blisters on his buttocks and legs. Theseepisodes would happen at least 10 times a day. This is unacceptable.As my son's advocate, I know that he is not receiving the medical treatment he needs.And I believe that as long as autism is regarded as a psychological disorder this willalways be the case. We need, and seek, responsible, effective and caring physicians whodon't dismiss the patient's ailments as \"behaviors\" but look at them as treatable medicalconditions with appropriate medical intervention.This is, what I believe to be the single biggest problem in getting group insurers to payfor medical services. Insurers must pay according to their contract. It is the law. But, if adoctor says that the visit to the office is for the treatment of autism, when the autistic 87 child is actually being seen for gastrointestinal distress, the insurer will not pay the claim.If however, the diagnostic code for the visit showed that it was for gastrointestinaldistress, the bill would have been paid. The diagnosis of autism is a shield used by someinsurers to deflect the responsibility of paying for medical and remedial treatment for these children's MEDICAL problems.I would like to recognize my son's doctor, as being the most caring, most willing to listenand helpDr. Richard Layton. My wife and I truly love him for what he has done for our son and other children.Today, you will hear, or have heard from, Dr. Andrew Wakefield. He too is a rare doctor.He is seeking to correct the gastrointestinal problems of his autistic patients. In doing so, he is challenging the \"traditional\" medical perspective on autism. What he does for me,as a parent, is give me hope that his work will spur on more treatment options, optionsthat are already out there, but not thought of to help those with autism. He dares toquestion public health policy with respect to immunizations safety. Thank you Dr. Wakefield.When Jackson's condition was at its worst, we were told by professionals/specialists that \"he probably won't make it past age five or six\" and that \"institutionalization\" is anoption. Neither of which were alternatives for our family. My wife and I developed a planthat guided our efforts. Medical, educational and therapeutic were the major categories.The expenses for seeing to Jackson's needs are overwhelminghundreds of thousands ofdollars over the past eight years. After going through all of our savings, and ourretirement we continue to accumulate debt as we try to meet his medical needs. Our priority right now is to make him well again.Money is the means to measure financial costs. And I am but just one father of onefamily. How much are all of the families spending? What will the cost be to the taxpayersto educate these children? Some experts put that cost at $2 million per child until their18th birthday.There are other costs. To get a cup of coffee in my home, I have to unlock a padlock toget the sugar. Why a lock? Because if Jackson eats sugar, (or any thing else in thatcabinetwheat cereal for my daughters, flour, pancake mix, or certain fruits) he gets arash on his bottom that is so bad he can hardly sit. No one sleeps for three to five nightsand Jackson experiences massive diarrhea. Yet, these are the foods he craves. Why?How do I put a cost on six years of not sleeping through the night? What is the price?How do I put a cost of attention NOT paid to my daughters because I am seeing to the needs of my son?How do I put a cost on locking every door and window at all times for fear of himwandering out of the house?

Honored committee members, fellow panel partici-pants and members of the audience, I feel privileged today to ap-pear before this committee to share my perspectives on autism, foremost as a parent but also from the additional perspectives asa pediatric infectious diseasespecialist and a scientist engaged inclinical research and evidence-based medicine.My daughter Natalie, who is over there, is now nearly 13 yearsold, has autism, and has taught my family and me a lot about our-selves and how the world around us deals with individuals who ap-pear different from the norm. She has been both a joy and a real challenge to live with, and we continue to live through these expe-riences every day, and I want to emphasize that.We have weathered this storm by rejoicing in her triumphs andfinding humor in past events, even when those events may haveseemed unbearable at that time. And I should add that my wife,unfortunately, is the one who has to bear most of these unpleasantexperiences.We have found that our daughter's greatest needs have been inthe area of education and for a highly structured environment toallow her some control over the events of her life. It is in the areaof education that we have experienced our greatest challenge andhave been labeled by our local school district administrators as themost difficult parents they have had to deal with. In the contextof that meeting, we found this statement an insult, and there wereother personal comments made to my wife that essentially haveput her in a position where she will not talk to the school districtadministrators any longer.But we have been convinced by our friends and family that weshould wear this as a badge of honor. If anything, it highlights theadvocacy that we have championed for our daughter's right to anappropriate education that addresses her individual needs and themanner in which she learns best. I should point out that probably every parent on this panel is his or her own child's best advocate. My greatest hope today is that members of this committee andthe audience will gain a better understanding of the unique natureof autism, the challenges and demands placed upon families caringfor autistic children and adults, the significant emotional, financial,and community resources required to prepare and involve these in-dividuals in everyday life, and to accept and respect these individ-uals for who they are.However, as previously mentioned, I also come to this committeeas a trained infectious disease specialist and clinical scientist and, therefore, feel compelled to comment on two other areas of impor-tance to me. In the area of medical and other treatments intendedto help autistic children function to the best of their ability, I would hope to see more funding to allow for appropriately controlled andconducted studies to rapidly determine the true effectiveness ofthese interventions so that families can make informed decisionsregarding the best use of their limited resources, as we have heardfrom a number of the panel Participants already. Without thesestudies, I and other parents of autistic children are forced to makedecisions which may at times prove disadvantageous to all in-volved, without the benefits of real data. 89I would also wish to comment on the current concerns regarding the potential causes for the perceived increase in autism. I implore the committee to be cautious in its statements and conclusions withregard to possible links to environmental factors and medical fac- tors, especially immunizations. Recognizing that there are other parents on this panel who may feel otherwisein fact, definitivelyfeel otherwiseas a pediatric infectious disease specialist, I have seen no sound evidence linking autism to the MMR or any othervaccine, yet there is considerable evidence proving that the MMRvaccine is safe and highly effective in protecting children from seri-ous diseases.In closure, no matter what conclusions are formed today or where the activities of these hearings may lead, I would like to share an axiom of medicine I have learned, practice daily, and con- tinue to teach to future doctors: Above all, do no harm.

Thank you. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 91Mr.BURTON.First of all, I'll start withyou, Dr. Dankner. Your daughterwhom I see sittingover there and is a lovely youngladyacquired her autistic conditionwas this from birth? Dr.DANKNER.No. She had the typical description that has been more commonly described of showing behaviors that became more and more obvious from about 14 to 18 months of age. Mr.BURTON.When she was 14 monthsor thereabouts, did she receive any shots?Dr.DANKNER.She received the normal vaccine schedule of im- munizations as recommended by the American Academic of Pediat- rics and theMr.BURTON.What shots were those?Dr.DANKNER.She received her MMR at about 151/2 months of age.Mr.BURTON.And when did she manifestor change? Dr.DANKNER.She was manifesting subtle changes before that. It was obvious to us;we just did not know what to attribute it toat that time or what the issues were. We used to joke that com- pared to our older son, she seemed to be on an \"independent study program.\"Mr.BURTON.Did she receive any other shots when you started seeing the manifestation of autism?Dr.DANKNER.She had received her previous shots at about 6 months of age.Mr.BURTON.And had she receivedany others close to the time she started developing autism?Dr.DANKNER.Not at that time, no.Mr.BURTON.There were no other shots?Dr.DANKNER.No, because at 12 months, essentially, you just get your PPD to screen for tuberculosis, which in California is poten- tially prevalent.Mr.BURTON.When she started manifesting these signs, did she get worse after the MMR shot, or did it have any effect at all? Dr.DANKNER.We did not noticeany difference in her behavior; in fact, she got her second dose of MMR at about 5 years of age, and there was definitivelyno change in her behavior after that.She pretty much continuedon in her mode of autistic behavior thatrequired, in our opinion, a definitive educational approach to ad- dress her needs.Mr.BURTON.Thank you, Doctor.Mr. Bono, when didyour child start manifesting signs of autism?Mr.BONO.Within about 30 days of the MMR.Mr.BURTON.So when didMr.BONO.Quite honestly, whenmy wife had said, \"Don't you see?\" I think mothers havea much keener sense of behaviors withtheir infants.Mr.BURTON. Iunderstand, but what I am trying to find out is she received the MMR shot, and you and your wife started noticinga change--Mr.BONO.Indeed; exactly.Mr.BURTON[continuing]. In 30 days, you said?Mr.BONO.Well, within hours of the shot, we went home, and there was no sleeping that night, and he had rashes on his body 92Mr.BURTON.And it got progressively worse?Mr.BONO[continuing]. And over the next week, there were gas-trointestinal problems, and finally, full blown behaviors that wereodd.Mr.BURTON.And how old was your child when that started?Mr.BONO. Ithink it was right at 16 months.Mr.BURTON.Sixteen months.Ms. Smith, when did your child start manifesting a change in be-havior?Ms.SMITH.Well, at 16 months when they received the host ofmultiple vaccines, including the---Mr.BURTON.Which were what? What were all those shots?Ms.SMITH.The DPT, the Hibit was their fourth DPT, theirfourth Hib, their third hepatitis B, and their first MMR on thatdaythey came home, they slept for 24 hours, most of that time,did not eat a whole lot, long periods of sleep, had over 100-degreetemperatures in spite of giving them Tylenol before the vaccine andduring the entire 24 hours.After that time, I figured, well, Jacob is sick again, because hewas just kind of out of it and did not seem real interested inmuchMr.BURTON.But this was at about 16 monthsMs.SMITH.Right, right.Mr.BURTON[continuing]. That you started seeing the manifestchange in the child with autism.Ms.SMITH.Right. And when we did go to the pediatrician, \\heyjust passed it off as his asserting his independence.Mr.BURTON. OK.Ms. Reynolds.Ms.REYNOLDS.Liam got his shot on June 27, 1997. That is whenhe got his MMR and his Hib. That was the day before he turned\\17 months old. A week later, I went to visit my parents in Mary-ville, TN for July 4th, and we started seeing some very strange, dif-ferent behaviors showing up then. He would not come when wecalled his name. He was doing weird pattern movements upagainst the wallbut it was within a week.Mr.BURTON.So it was right after he received the MMR shot.Ms.REYNOLDS.Yes, sir.Mr.BURTON. OK.Mr. Smythe.Mr.SMYTHE.At about 20 months, our sonI included in therecord his vaccine schedule and my other children's, and interest-ingly, he was given hepatitis B the day he was born and then re-ceived the other two shots, one of them 30 days later, and anotherabout 8 months later. He received 12 vaccines in the first 6months, as the record shows, as compared to our other childrenwho did not, in fact, receive the hepatitis B until a year after hereceived his third shot.Mr.BURTON.When did he startMr.SMYTHE.Right after the MMR, at 20 months.Mr.BURTON.At 20 months, right after the MMR.So you four people right here are all in concert that right afterthe MMR shot, you started seeing the manifest change in your chil-dren. Is that correct? 93MS. child, Mr. Curtis?Mr. CURTIS. Iguess I have to be the dissenting opinion on this end of the table. I do not really remember the specific day of Mor- gan's MMR shotsor any of his immunizations. He did not really exhibit any behaviorsitwas not anything that he didit was what he never did. Itwas the fact that he never talked. And again,as I mentioned, it was a very gradual process. I think his idiosyn- cratic behaviors of liningup his toys and the self-stimulatory be-havior, the flapping of the hands, the spinning, all really started after he was 2years old. It seemed like once we had a word for it, then it almost gotworse.We have thought about thisa lot, because this is a very common theory. You read about iton the net, and you talk with other par- ents, and my wife and I have both discussed it at length, and we really do not seeany correlation between the time of his immuniza- tions and the onset ofany specific or more intense behaviors.Mr. BURTON. OK. My lastquestion, then, would be did you notice shortly after his birth,as he was progressing, some problems then?Mr. CURTIS. I think,yes. The reason I say \"I think\" is becausewe wanted to believe that hewas a late talker, a late developer. The only thingwe noticed was that he was not speaking and that he did not seem to reactto the things thatwe did with himbut otherwise, he wasa very normal, happy baby. He played, he interacted, he made lots of noises. He just never formed wordsand almost did notseem to react to our speech.For a long time,we were very concerned about his hearing, that maybe he did not hear properly. In fact, when his hearingwas test- ed, in the first test, they said he was deaf, andonce they did the brainstem test thatwas conclusive, it turned out that his hearingwas absolutely fine; it was just that he was not reacting to sound or voice.Mr. BURTON. Thankyou, Mr. Curtis, very much.I want to yieldgo ahead.Mr. SMYTHE. Iam sorry. I also noticed that my son was given the DPT vaccines thesame day he was given the MMR. So he got six vaccines on thesame day.Ms. SMITH. So did mine.Mr. SMYTHE. BURTON. Thankyou.Mr. Waxman.Mr. WAXMAN. It takesa lot of courage for all of you to be here,and I want you to know how much I appreciate it, especially when you are talking about something personal and painful. And, I know you are here to try to help us understand what you are going through so thatwe can try to find out about autism, and so that we can spare others from going through what you are going through.There is legislationthiscommittee does not have legislative au- thority; it has the ability to hold hearings and get information. But the committee that has legislative jurisdiction, which Iam also on,e 94is the Commerce Committee, and there, we have a bill, H.R. 3301,which incorporates legislation by Congressman Greenwood, Con-gressman Bilirakis. Both Mr. Burton and I are on that bill, and itwould do a lot to research more about the prevalence and ways todeal with autism. I hope that will give us some of these answersthat we so desperately want.Dr. Dankner, you are in a unique position. You are the father ofan autistic child, and you are also a pediatrician and an expert oninfectious diseases. But your testimony, is that you do not thinkthere is sound evidence linking autism to the MMR vaccine. Howcan you say that when the other parents have given us evidencethat, in their view, their children developed autism after the vac-cine? Isn't that sound evidence? As a scientist, how do you thinkwe should consider it, and what do we need to prove that there isa connection, if there is one?Dr. DANKNER. One thing is that I am not here to invalidate thetestimony of the other individuals. I know that from their heart,they feel that these events occurred in relation to a specific timeand place, and it would be wrong for me to make a challenge toanyone on this panel. This is a personal issue for a number of theseindividuals.However, as a clinical scientist, when we do researchI takecare of HIV-infected childrenit is important to identify causalevents so that we do not do, as I mentioned, harm on either sideof the fence of any of these issues. And I think it is important thatif this committee or the scientific world feels that there is notenough evidence to generate a causal link between vaccinationsand autism or any other disorder, those studies need to be doneand that people then should look at those studies in a critical view,with appropriate peer review, and all individuals who are purport-ing one position versus another should be able to stand under thelight of appropriate peer review to ensure that the scientific infor-mation is collected appropriately, analyzed appropriately, and dis-cussed in an open forum and not in closed sessions, to ensure thatthe best information is provided to everyone so that, again, best de-cisions can be made by individuals.I would like to bring a personal perspective as an infectious dis-ease doctor. Unlike the other panel members, I have been on theother side of the fence and have seen children who have beenharmed by vaccine-preventable diseases. I live close to the border,where the vaccination rate in Mexico is not the same as in theUnited States. I have seen children who have developed congenitalrubella, a lifelong disabling condition. I have seen children die ofmeasles during a measles epidemic in San Diego 10 years ago, evenwith the pretty reasonable vaccine rates for a highly transmissibledisease. I have seen children suffer from pertussis, hospitalized atsignificant rates.That position puts me in a position of being cautious about mak-ing any links, because if the vaccine rates fall in the United States,I can almost guarantee from my own personal experience thatthere will be individuals who will suffer on the other side of thefence, and those are the individuals that this committee usuallydoes not hear about. 95Mr.WAXMAN. Iam not a scientist. I studied science at differentlevels of my education, and when I studied science, Iwas told that there is a scientific method to try to get answers, and the scientific method sometimes tooka theory or a hypothesis and then testedit, and you had trials and control groups, and you tried to find out whether that theory is correct or not. Sometimes, theories turn out to be widely believed, but then they are discarded. We all studied the fact that in the past, people did not know about hygiene in con- nection with hospitals, which used to be among the most dangerous places to be because of the lack of hygiene.But you are a scientistthe others on this panel are parents but from a scientific method,are you saying the theory is abso- lutely incorrect, orare you saying that we just do not know enoughto say that it is correct?Dr.DANKNER.There are other people who will testify today who I think can probably betteranswer that. I was asked to come on the panel both asa parent and as a scientist.My reading of what has been correlated to date does notappear to indicate a causal link. I think that debate has not been settled and probably needs to be,so that we do not continue to move down avenues that may be less productive in terms of the resources that are necessary to identify other potential links to autism, what the needs are in the community, which I can tell you are great Mr.WAXMAN.Let me interruptyou because my time is up. Are you saying to us, in other words, that we should not be alarmed about vaccinations and have parents refrain from having their kids vaccinated because of this theory, which, at this point,you do not think has gone througha scientific evaluation to be established as scientific fact?Dr.DANKNER. Ithink an alarmist view is always of concern. I am a cautious individual, and I think we just need to be cautious in how we approach this issue.Mr.BURTON.Thank you, Mr. Waxman.Dr. Dankner, I hope thatyou will have the ability to stay andhear some of the other scientists' positions just foryour mation.Dr.DANKNER. very much.Mrs. Morella.Mrs.MORELLA.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I am very moved by the testimony that I have heard and read today. You are indeed the heroes, and we see you as role models, and your children arevery fortunate to have you as parents. Sothank you for being here.I think the only question I want to ask is to Mr. Bono. When you said that you had to travel 12 hours for a 5-minute treatmentI do not know enough about the. background to know what that treatment is, why you have to travel 12 hours for it, and howyou found out about it.Mr.BONO. Ihave to travel 12 hours, but that is deceiving, and first let me apologize. It is 6 hours up and 6 hours back in 1 day, so it is 12 hours.Mrs.MORELLA.It is significant. 96Mr. BONO. I have to travel because the treatment is not recog-nized as helping my son, and it is not approved. It is secretin, andthey call it a slow push, or an infusion of sorts. We found thatgoing up about every 28 days is a real good cycle for Jackson. With-out it, he will not have a normal bowel movement; he will haveacidic diarrhea, and he will not digest food properly, he will haveunexplained rashes.Mrs. MORELLA. Who advised you that this would help him inthat area? Is there another doctor who made the suggestion?Mr. BONO. At the press conference, one of the doctors said thatthe parents have really been the ones in the forefront of findingtreatment options for their children, and this was a parent, too.Her name is Victoria Beck, and she serendipitously discovered se-cretin working for her child as the result of an endoscopy.Laura and I had always thought there was some connection be-tween the gut and the brain that needed to be bridged, and whenwe heard about Victoria's experience, we were rather fascinated, and we began to read about it, and that is how we arrived at thattreatment.Mrs. MORELLA. Dr. Dankner, I just want to briefly ask youitis your daughter who is autistic, but in general, as I mentioned inmy opening statement, there is a prevalence among males with re- gard to autismare there some unique challenges that you facewith a female rather than a male with autism?Dr. DANKNER. Oh, yes, and those challenges are becoming moreapparent now that she has achieved puberty. Luckily, she respondsvery well to sequenced pictures. One of the social stories that was provided to her through her school at my wife's insistenceand Ihave to admit that she has taken the forefront on thisis how todeal with menstruation. If you allow our daughter to do her ownthing, she gets into a pattern, and that pattern becomes very dif-ficult to break. And we have several holes in our wall for which wecould probably pay a drywall person a pretty sum of money to re-pair when she gets mad at things, she will kick holes here andthere. Luckily, we are having a room addition put on very soon, sothat will take care of the last patch jobs that we did. That is oneissue that came up.Another issue that my wife and I feel very concerned about is therisk for her to be sexually abused as she gets older because of herinability to really indicate or express interactions with other indi-viduals, as a number of the other panel discussants talked aboutwith older children. Our daughter comes home from school, andyou can ask her how her day went, and she will say \"Fine,\" but you will not be able tounless we are given a set of things that went on at school, she is not there to carry on small talk; that isnot a major impetus in her life. She will interact with us becauseshe has needs, and she will seek us out for those, but if left to herown devices, she will stay in her garage room, watch her TV, what- ever video she finds the most appealing that day, and she loves to play with the reverse and replay buttons on a regular basis.So, yes, I think there are some special challenges, but I thinkthere are challenges for males growing up with autism also. Thereare things that they are going to have to face as they get older, and as they get older, I think the challenges become different. And I 97think all of the parents have to deal with the issue of what is going to happen to their childrenas they get older, who is going to takecare of them when the parents are beyond an age when they can no longer take care of these children.Mrs. MORELLA. The tollon parents is immeasurable, obviously.Thank you.Thank you, BURTON. Mrs. haveany questions?Mr. TURNER. Thankyou, Mr. Chairman.Doctor, I just haveone question for you, and I know this hearingcenters on the problem of autism. The chairman has had personal experience with it in his family, and I know that he has also had some experience with a granddaughter with the hepatitis B vac- cine.I just wonderis thereany reason to question the age at whichsome of these vaccines are administered? I have always had thefeeling that the younger the child, the more fragile, and therefore, the negative impact, if it be there, the potential is certainly greater when those vaccines are administered at an early age. I have, of course, had particular interest in the hepatitis B vac- cine which is administered, I think, in most States now at birth, routinely. In fact, I was in the home of a family in my district this weekend who have a 2-year-old child who is severely disabled, and basically, this family spends most of their 'waking hours tending to the child, and they strongly suspect that the problem is the result of a hepatitis B vaccination. That is administered at birth, and I have been told that there is really no logical argument for trying to vaccinate a newborn, because the threat of hepatitis B does not exist at that early an age, but it might be a more appropriate vac- cine for later in childhood or approaching the teenage years. Is there any reason to question the timing of some of these vac- cines? One of our witnesses today talked about the large number of vaccines administered atone time.Dr. DANKNER. Again, Iwas not called to the panel, I think, togive a long explanation of vaccine policy. There are lots of other in- dividuals who have been involved in those policymaking decisions over the years. But I can give you my perspective once again fromthe diseases that we see in these age groups. Albeit hepatitis B is an uncommon disease process that children may or may not get exposed to, the more likely exposure is goingto occur when they reach sexual debut, as we call it, when they can easily be exposed to hepatitis B from a partner. That is one of the major concerns, and hepatitis B is a major cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and has reached a rate where vaccina- tion would definitely have an impact on that disease in terms of its prevention.The reason for giving some vaccines earlier is just to ensure that the vaccination gets performed. Rubella is a perfect example. When congenital rubella was identified in the United States, Australia and Europe as a devastating disease linked definitively to the ac- quisition of rubella by mothers who were previously uninfected, with no previous immunity to rubella, the approach was taken dif- ferently by different nations. If you look at the United States, they 98focused on giving the rubella vaccine early in life so that you wouldeliminate the pool of individuals who were exposing adults to rubel-la, whereas England took the approach of trying to vaccinate ado-lescent females primarily, because they were the, \"at-risk popu-lation\" who could transmit rubella to their unborn fetus. The expe-rience in England was that it took them a lot longer to eliminatecongenital rubella from their population, and the experience in theUnited States was an enormous success, because even though youhad women who were susceptible to rubella, they were not beingexposed, and as those children who got the rubella vaccine early inlife aged up into their childbearing years, they were no longer atrisk of developing congenital rubella. The result is that the UnitedStates sees probably about two, four, five cases of congenital rubel-la a year, and most of those are from individuals who have eithernot received vaccination or come from a foreign country where thevaccine rates are much lower.Additionally, the hemophilus influenza B vaccine, the vast major-ity of H-flu meningitis that we see occurred in children less than24 months of age. If you wait until they are 2 years of age to givethe vaccine, you have missed the peak period. We used to see atour Children's Hospital in San Diego 60 to 70 cases of hemophilusinfluenza meningitis per year. That is a pretty devastating diseasefor most of the children. We see essentially one case about every2 or 3 years now, and the last case we saw was in a mother whohad her fourth child and just did not get to the doctor to get theH-flu vaccine.I think that if you want to ask about the policies, you will needto talk to the policymakers for their conclusions. I can only giveyou my viewpoint from the standpoint of how I see infectious dis- ease and the impact that I have seen in our local community, and the diseases that I no longer see, which some doctors in practicenow may never see again, I think to the advantage of those par- ticular children who are not suffering from those particular dis-eases.To be fair to the other panel participants, I recognize that I ama physician and I bring certain issues to the table, but I think the other individuals also have a lot to say that needs to be heard, andI do not want to monopolize everyone's time.Mr. TURNER. I appreciate your comments. I guess the only pointI was trying to make, and perhaps the witnesses on our secondpanel will help us with it, is that there are obviously good publicpolicy reasons to have the vaccines given, but at a minimum, if thetiming of those vaccines could be later in life for children, it seemsthat at least we owe the public that information, because particu-larly in the case of hepatitis B, if the threat of hepatitis B only oc-curs at the time when the child has the potential of becoming sexu- ally active, it does not make a lot of sense to have a public policythat says we administer it on the second day of life; and if thereis a risk, I as a parent certainly would not want that vaccine ad-ministered to my child at that point in time. People need to havethat information.Thank you so much, Doctor.Mr. BURTON. The gentleman's time has expired.Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 99Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Turner.Mr. LaTourette.Mr. LATOURETTE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Waxman.I want to thank each of you for sharing your families' experiences with us today. Ms. Smith, my wife and I are the parents of 8-year- old twins, and we always said that if the twins had been first, they would have been last, because raising twins is enough of a chal- lenge all by itself.I was not going to talk about what my friend from Texas was talking about, but it always amazed meand I am not smart enough to know the connection between vaccines and what bringsyou here todaybut it always amazed me thdt after these vaccines,you would bring your baby home, and he would turn bright red andhave a horrible fever, and they would say, \"Well, you just have to hang on for a little while, and everything is going to be OK,\" andthis was a drug which was going to prevent some horrible child- hood disease in the future. But why they were being exposed to these vaccines within the first couple days of being born, or even the first few months of being born, is something that I do think we need to get a handle on.But Ms. Smith, I want to talk to you about a portion of your tes- timony, and Ms. Reynolds also, because if I understand it, you may be following similar paths. That is, you have had Jacob screened and tested for the presence of heavy metals and fungi and otherforeign substances within his system, and he is currently under-going some nutritional therapy and so on. I wonder if you could share those experiences with us. And I think it was you, Ms. Smith, who wrote that the results of that screening were shocking and that it was amazingwas it you who had Dr. Stephanie C ave---Ms. SMITH. Yes. We both--Mr. LATOURETTE. You both had Dr. Stephanie Cave.Ms. SMITH. Right.Mr. LATOURETTE. OK. Then, maybe one at a time or in tandem, you could tell us a little bit about Dr. Cave's work and what aboutthe results of these screenings was shocking, and what sorts of things now Liam and Jacob are going through that give you hope and point in the direction that this is a biomedical condition ratherthan a neurological condition.Ms. SMITH. In my case, it is clearly not a genetic issue, consider- ing that they are identical. The other reason I do not feel that it was a neurological disorder that he was born with is because hisdescent into autism happened so rapidly. He was completely with me, and he descended into autism so rapidly, and to me, that is nota neurological disorder that he had at birth.Also, I feel that it was not a neurological disorder that he was born with because when he was 21/2, we had several professionals recommend that we put him on medications. I do not know whatmedications they said, such as RitalinI never pursued that ave- nue, because I felt like medicating a 21/2 child was simply not goodenough when I did not know what his body was already doing. I went to see Dr. Cave, and she ran blood and urine tests and took stool samples to see what deficiencies he had, the areas that 100 .he was lacking in, his amino acids and so on. We found that he had10 food allergies. Because he had been on repeated antibiotics, hehad extremely highout of 23 fungal add yeast infections, he washigh in 20. He was chromium, zinc, magnesium and copper defi-cient. He was B5-deficient. So, basically, what we did was we im-mediately started taking out what was bad and putting back whatwas good and taking him off the foods that he was allergic to. Andwithin 5 days, my son, who had only a couple of words in his lan-guage and was very lost, said a full, appropriate sentence andstarted speaking again.So the rapid improvement also shows me that this was not aneurological disorder in his case.Mr. LATouRErrE. OK. And Ms. Reynolds, is Liam also under-going similar therapy?Ms. REYNOLDS. Yes, he is. When he was diagnosed in May 1998,we put him on a strict, gluten-free, casein-free diet that Dr. Cave prescribed, where he was not allowed to eat any of the substances,because his body was taking those things and actually manufactur-ing morphine, which was what was making him just sit and stareand not respond appropriately to things.Since that time, he has undergone an MRI, EEGs, all the normalthings that they run on autistic children, and those all point to nor-mal things. But when you start doing blood work and stool workand urinalysis, and they measured for toxic metals in his hair, shesuggested that we give him a medication that would help pull outthe heavy metals that he had been exposed to, and my husbandand I were so gun-shy at this point from dealing with doctors thatwe pulled out the PDR and read through it, and we were, like, \"I do not know, this sounds a little weird to me; I do not think weare going to try this.\" And we took Liam to an environmental toxi- cologist who did some blood work and told us that the shape ofLiam's bloodhe had stippled cells that would be the same as aplant worker who had had serious toxic heavy metal exposure andthat our son's blood cells were malformed as a result of heavymetal exposure that he had received.We have given him this medication several times. We were ablein December to get a good urine sample, which is a little challeng-ing around our house, and we were finally able to test that. Thenormal rangeand I am probably going to mess this upbut thenormal range for anything to show up in their bodies is betweenzero and six, and his lead and mercury had reduced down to nor- mal ranges, but his levels of tin were completely off the charts.They were not even measurable. They were up around 250.Mr. LATouRETTE. Did you say tin?Ms. REYNOLDS. Tin.Mr. LATOURETTE. If I could just beg the chairman's indulgence,is he likewise receiving, aside from the medication that you aretalking about, a nutritional program?Ms. REYNOLDS. He receives a number of nutritional supplementsevery day. He is on an antifungal medication, because we have been dealing with a yeast infection that just will not go away for3 years, that makes him just a real mess. He is just a walking bio-logical nightmare. And he looks as healthy as a horse. He has greatskin, he has great teeth and cheeks. He is a beautiful, beautiful lit- 101tle boy, but if you take it down to the cellular and the molecular level, you can see that this child is a total mess. Mr. LATOURETTE. Thankyou very much.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Ms. questions?Ms. BIGGERT. No questions, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Well, letme thank this panel. I just want to say to the four of you who have experienced this change right after the MMR shot that my daughter is sitting back there, and I andmy daughter experienced exactly the same things that you did, and I believe what you are saying, and we are going to pursue that as diligently as possible, because I cannot believe that it is just a coin- cidence that the shot is given, and within a very short timehe got nine shots in 1 day, the MMR and DPAT, HIB and oral polioand within a matter of justa few days, instead of being the normalchild that we played with and talked to and everything else, he was running around, banging his head against the wall and flailing his arms.When people tell me that that was a genetic problem, I am tell- ing you they are just nuts. That is not the way it was. With that, I want to thank this panel very much. We will now go to our next panel.Thank you very much.We now welcome our second panel to the witness table. This panel consists of: Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who came all theway from merry old England, and we appreciate him being here; Profes-sor John O'Leary, whom I am sure you will notice after he starts talking is from Ireland; Dr. Vijendra Singh, I appreciate you being here; Dr. Co leen Boyle, Dr. Paul Offit, and Dr. Brent Taylor. Would you all please rise and be sworn?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. BURTON. Please havea seat.Dr. Wakefield, wouldyou like to start this panel?STATEMENTS OF DR.

Yes, thankyou, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. It is a great privilege to be here.The purpose of my testimony is to report the results of the clini- cal and scientific investigation of a series of children with autism. Nothing in this testimony should be construed as anti-vaccine; rather, I advocate the safest vaccination strategies for the protec- 102tion of children and the control of communicable disease. I am alsohere on my behalf representing the children who have come to mefor investigation.I would like you to look at the screen if you would, please, andI will take you through the presentation.Next slide, please.Just as a little bit of background, this represents 12 years of in-tensive clinical and scientific research, collaborative research, intothe causes and mechanisms of bowel inflammation. I am a gastro-enterologist.The principal authors of this work have contributed to over 1,500peer-reviewed and published scientific papers and abstracts. Again,these represent my views.Next slide, please.I want to report the results today from the first 60 children thatwe have investigated. We have now investigated over 150 children,and the results that I am going to describe are pertinent to allthose children bar about four.As far as the range of psychiatric assessments, the great majorityhad autism, but there was a spectrum of neuropsychiatric problemsincluding Asperger's Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder. Byfar and away the most important investigation has been direct vis-ualization of the bowel and taking biopsies by the procedure ofileocolonoscopy. This is a flexible instrument introduced into thebottom end to take a biopsy.Next slide, please.What you have heard this morning is a classical description oftwo different types of autism from the parents. You have heardabout the children that we have seen, those who have gone off aftera period of normal development, many of them in the face of mul- tiple vaccine exposures with severe gastrointestinal symptoms.The other type, described very articulately, was of an insidiousfailure to acquire skills at an extremely important point. The es-sence of what I am going to present today is based upon conven- tional clinical medicine. It is listening to the patient.Here is a child who was entirely normal for the first year of lifeand went off a week after receiving his MMR vaccine. He is exactlyas the four children were described earlier. Next slide, please.The classical features in these children are painthere is aradiograph here of the abdomen, and there is fecal impaction.When these children came to us, the feature was of diarrhea, butin fact this turned out to be what we call spurious or overflow diar-rhea. There was soiling, loss of contents, fastidious eating habits,reflux and nighttime wakening. They get heartburn, and they wakeup very distressed. These symptoms are the same wherever you go. If I listen to parents from Canada, from the States, from Europe,and from Australia, the story is the same.Next slide, please.The associated features that we have in these children are ofatopyasthma, eczema, and hay fever. There are refractory upperrespiratory tract infections. They do not deal well with commonchildhood infections, colds, and there is a very high level of auto- 103immune disease in the familythyroid disease, diabetes, for exam- ple.Next slide, please.This is the insider's view of the small intestine. The panel on the top left is of what it should look like in a child. The bottom left of is lymphoid nodular hyperplasia. There is a swelling of the lymph glands in the bowel. These are rather like tonsils, and when they swell, they cause pain and symptoms.Mr. Waxman asked about the reproducibility. He is absolutelyright. Up on the top right-hand panel, you see a child who was scoped in the United States with exactly the same symptoms. So this is reproducible in two different continents. We have comparedit with controls, and the graph on the bottom right shows that even children who come to us with gastrointestinal symptoms who are scoped, the finding of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is relativelyuncommon. In the bar on the left, 85 percent of them show no evi-dence of it, but virtually all of our autistic children show evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia, either mild, moderate, or severe. Next slide, please.There are histological changes under microscopy which showthere is a definite disease. The top left-hand panel is normal; thebottom right-hand panel, for example, shows what is called a crypt abscess, that is, puss in the bowel wall, and this is a feature that we see in children and adults with ulcerative colitis. There is aclear and demonstrable, albeit subtle, pathology.Next slide, please.A further paper that is due to be published soon has taken this to one further level and asked is this disease distinct from classicalinflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's and colitis, or is it something new. And the data, at least, so far, suggest that it is somethingnew.Next slide, please.We have described this feature in the gut, lymphoid hyperplasia,and colitis in children with autism. From this same city, from Georgetown University, Professor Joe Bellanti has described it inchildren with attention deficit disorder, coming back to the ques- tion, is this a spectrum of disorders which have at their heart some gastrointestinal abnormality.Next slide, please.Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia classically occurs in the presence of immunodeficiency. We do see it during acute infection, but it isclassically associated with immunodeficiency. Are our children immunodeficient? As a group, the answer is yes, they are. This graph just shows you a particular count of a certain type of immune cell in the blood. The green line is the upper limit for normal, the red line is the lower limit for normal, and each bluedot represents a child. You can see that the great majority sit at or below the lower limit of normal. Not only are they numericallydeficient, their immune system does not respond appropriately to common recall antigens when compared with normal age-matchedchildren. In other words, if you give them a skin-prick test for per- tussis or diphtheria, they mount no response. Next slide, please. 104So the key features of the syndrome are developmental regres-sion, ileocolonic lymphoid hyperplasia, swelling of these the small andlarge intestinesand immunodeficiency.Next slide, please.So it is a real syndrome, there is a remarkably consistent patternof bowel inflammation, and it provides us with vital clues. Whatare those clues?Next slide, please.The story as told to us and which we have an obligation to reportis that the majority of children regressed following a period of nor-mal development in the face of MMR vaccination. That does notmean it is the cause of the disease.We also had two children who regressed after classical measlesinfectionone after the monovalent measles vaccine and one aftera rare vasculitic rash. Thirty-six percent of parents could contem-poraneously identify no particular environmental hit.Next slide, please.Have measles and common childhood infections been linked toautism before? Is there a reason to go into this and look at it? Theanswer is yes, there is. There is a paper that came from the Har-vard School of Public Health, and it showed that atypical patternsof exposure to common childhood infectionsmeasles, mumps,chicken pox, rubellawere a risk for autism in the child. By \"atypi-cal,\" I mean maternal exposure when pregnant or neonatal expo-sure.What was intriguing about this, which we may come to later, isthat if you were a pregnant mother who was exposed to more thanone of these common infections at the same time, or indeed, an in-fant child, then your risk of autism was both greater, and the se-verity of the autism was greater. Question: Was there a compoundeffect of more than one infection?It has also been shown that children born in and aroundepidemics of measles and rubella have higher rates of this disease.Next slide, please.What about vaccines? There is a paper from the Vaccine DamageCompensation Board in the United Statesacute encephalopathyfollowed by permanent brain injury or death associated with fur-ther attenuated measles vaccine. What was intriguing in this co-hort of children who fulfilled rather strict criteria was that 43 outof 48 underwent developmental regression as part of their syn-drome. So we have this other pattern of exposure to measles as thefurther attenuated vaccine children undergoing developmental re-gression.Next slide, please.To summarize, unusual patterns of exposure to common child-hood infections are associated with autism and developmental re-gression.Next slide, please.Here is the clue. This is the important image, and here, you seethe insider's view againthese swollen tonsilar tissues. If you arelooking for an infection, this is where you should be looking.Next slide, please. 105When you lookdown themicroscope, this iswhat tonsil tissue lookslike, andyou are looking in thecenter of that for the infection.This isa response toa foreign agent,a foreign antigen, usuallyan infection. So ifyou are looking for thecause of that, that is whereyou are looking.Next slide, please.This is avery high-poweredmicrograph dendriticcell, thisis crucial, you for thesource of that infection,not only areyou looking in that lymphoid follicle,not only in thecenter of the lymphoidfollicle, but slide, andonly we find itin that cell. We do not findit in other cellsor other tissue,we find it in that adenovirus,herpes HIV, and other crucialcontrols that Mr.Waxman referredto early, and you do not find them.They are not there.So at least withinthe context ofthis study, thisappears to question:Is therean antibody; inthese children?The merepresence does not make it thecause. Is We take theautistic withage- matched controls,and look at controls ofmumps, rubella, andcytomegalur virus,or other common childhood infections. The onlyone which there isa sta- tistically significantdifference betweenthe cases andthe controls is for identifythis copies. Anythingless, we couldnot find it.The Japanese hadsucceeded,so we sent nine bloodsamples from our children to the Japaneselaboratory, andwe also sent 21 other patients. We mixedthem up. We didnot tell them whatthey were getting. They justhad a control label.And they identifiedmeasles virus in three ofthose nine childrenin That is an intriguingfinding. This isconsistent with; butnot definitely, vaccine strain. Onecan only say that this isconsistent with, but there it is, and thiswas a blinded controlstudy. Next slide, please.Very briefly, tofinish up, what isthe link betweenthe gut and gut influence Icome a liver unit wherewe see patients withchronic liver failure,acute liver failure, slide,pleaseis hepaticencephalopathy. Thisis where 106the liver is damaged, is diseased, and fails to degrade the chemicalconstituents of the bowel that come through. It fails to mop themup and clear them out; they impact upon the brain. This is largely reversible. If you are hit with these for long enough, it becomes ir-reversible.The question is, thereforeat least we have biologically a plau-sible hypothesis, a testable hypothesis that elements from the gut,undegraded chemicals from the gut, including the opiods that werereferred to by Shelley Reynolds, may be getting through, may notbe metabolized, may be impacting upon the rapidly developingbrain during the first few years of life and producing residual cog-nitive deficit, which we recognize as autism.Next slide, please.So finally, in summary, we have an environmental insult in per-haps a genetically susceptible child. The problem is that if you goto Sweden now, autism affects over 1.2 percent of the pediatric pop-ulation. So if there is a genetic background, it is clearly widely dis-tributed within the population. We believe that in many children,clearly, the subset of autistics, it leads to gut infection and damage;that leads to an ingress, an impaired metabolism, degradation ofthese chemicals from the gut which then get through and impactupon the brain. And the disregulated immune system which mea- sles classically can produce also encourages immune diseases,atopic diseases, and immuno disregulation.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Doctor.Professor of Dr. Wakefield follows:] AutismandImmunisation Dr Chairman andmembers of the Committee,The purpose of thistestimony is to reportthe results of the clinicaland scientific investigation in a seriesof children withdevelopmental disorders,principally autism.

The clinicalfindings described in thesereports have been reproduced in the extendedstudy of more than 150 children.The lattergroup includes 4 children from the US. Independently, other centresinvestigating children withautism andgastrointestinal symptoms inthe UK, Europe andthe findings that comprisethe syndrome ofautistic enterocolitis. 108JOur study was initiated at the request of parents, and was stimulated by theconviction that their children had; 1) developed normally during the first 1-2 yearsof life; 2) undergone developmental regression to autism, in majority of casesfollowing measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccination, and; 3) the parents' opinion, were closely associatedwith the behavioral/developmental pathology. Almost without exception, theanxieties of the parents, as described above, had been dismissed by the medicaland allied professions. Bowel symptoms had been disregarded withoutinvestigation. Raising the issue of the possible role of MMR vaccine in theirchild's autistic regression had led to an acrimonious breakdown of the doctor-parent relationship in many cases.One of the fundamental rules of conventional clinical medicine is to listen; tolisten to the patient or the patient's parents, and then to investigate thepresenting symptoms, without prejudice, in order to determine whether or notthey have an organic origin. In this context, the Committee should be aware thatthe parents' story is remarkably consistent whether, for example, they come fromthe US, Canada, the UK, mainland Europe, Asia or Australia. The pervasivefeatures include developmental regression and gastrointestinal symptomsfollowing MMR vaccination (Figure 1).

The issue of coincidenceMany pediatricians have expressed the opinion that, for autism, anyassociation between MMR vaccination and the parents' recognition of the child'sbehavioral problems is coincidental. Such an assumption is inappropriate in theabsence of a thorough history and investigation. For example, symptoms ofclassical, early onset autism are often noticed initially, in the first and secondyears of life the child does not develop in the way of normal siblings and peers.Parental concerns about the child's development are often expressed in thesecond year, when these differences become evident. MMR vaccine is givenroutinely at this age, and coincidence is therefore inevitable. However, inchildren with autistic regression, the pattern is of loss of speech, language andsocial skills, accompanied by bizarre behaviors, in a previously developmentallynormal child. This is consistent with an early onset disintegrative psychosis.Furthermore, loss of speech and language are accompanied by symptoms ofexcessive thirst, bowel disturbances, self-injury, and a self-limited diet associatedwith cravings for particular foods. Atopy and recurrent, refractory upperrespiratory tract infections are prominent features. These symptoms do notfeature in the exclusively behavioral descriptors of the diagnostic manual forautism - DSM-IV.The issue of coincidence may be addressed, in part, by considering thosechildren who have received more than one, measles containing vaccine. If theintestinal pathology and the associated behavioral problems are causally linkedto a persistent viral infection of the intestine, then re-exposure to the same virusvaccine might be expected to exacerbate the condition by, for example, elicitingan immune response against virally infected cells. In the cohort of children with 113 autistic enterocolitis under our care, we have 10 children who have receivedmore than one dose of a measles containing vaccine. Developmental/behavioralchanges had to be identified contemporaneously, rather than retrospectively. Thedata for first and second vaccine doses, and initial and subsequent behavioralchanges are shown graphically, below (Figure 7). MMR and Behay.

The graph, where each time line represents one child, showsthat for 7 children (2-4 & 6-9) developmental regression accompanied bothexposures. In 2 children (1 & 10) it followed the second dose, long after thesecond year of life. These data are not consistent with coincidence. Temporal trends in autismIf MMR vaccine is causally related to autism and autistic enterocolitis, thenthere should have been an increase in the numbers of cases of autism followingthe introduction of MMR vaccine in different countries.

ConclusionPeltola et al tested the wrong hypothesis I 0-X 4? 4, 117 The Taylor paperTaylor B et at (Royal Free & University College Medical School & the PublicHealth Laboratory Service) published a paper (Lancet 1999;353:2026-2029) thatsought to dispel any relationship between MMR vaccine and autism. Theyperformed a Case-Series analysis of children with autism in North West Thames.Reasoning: If there is a causal association between MMR and autism, thereshould have been a step-up in the numbers of children with autism in the firstbirth cohorts eligible for MMR. The authors stated that such a step-up shouldhave occurred in those born in 1987 since these were the first children eligible toreceive MMR in the second year of life. There was .a crucial omission from thepaper by Taylor et al. In 1988 with the introduction of the MMR in the UK a\"Catch-Up\" campaign was instituted which targeted pre-school children of one tofour years of age who had not previously received monovalent measles, mumpsor rubella vaccines irrespective of their immunity to the three infections.Corroboration of this comes in the form of a contemporaneous paper fromDr Christine Miller, previously of the PHLS, who stated: \"Although the programwill be aimed mainly at the one to four year age groups, where it wilt have themaximum effect, MMR vaccine can be given at any age.\" (Miller C. Introductionof measles/mumps/rubella vaccine. Health Visitor 1988;61:116-117)Taylor et al noted that the rise in autism occurred in children born in thefew years before 1987 and concluded, therefore, that since this rise had startedbefore the introduction of MMR it could not have been caused by MMR. Thispaper has been cited by various vaccine officials as definitive proof of the safetyof MMR in this context.Taylor et al's omission of the crucial information on the catch-upcampaign, led the reader to believe that those, and only those, born in 1987 werethe first children eligible for MMR. They were challenged on this omission in asubsequent letter to the Lancet (1999;354), In their reply they acknowledged thatthey were aware of the catch-up campaign and admitted that no fewer than 36autistic children in their data-set were born before 1987 and had, therefore,received their MMR over the age of 2 years. They claimed that this was not 123 118 relevant since symptoms had apparently started in these children before MMR.This is not relevant; testing of a \"step up\".hypothesis is not based upon analysisof individual case notes, other than to confirm diagnosis. Since they were awarethat their cohort contained children who received the MMR after the age of 2years it was not scientifically legitimate to test the hypothesis that a step upshould be seen in those born in 1987. The fact that the step up occurs in thoseborn in 1986 is alarming, and would be consistent with an association with MMR.Such were the anxieties about the quality of this study that it was recentlythe subject of a special, and highly critical debate at the Royal Statistical Societyin London. The conclusion reached was that Taylor et al's study design waswrong.Further evidence for a temporal association between the introduction ofMMR and an increase in the numbers of cases of autism comes from a currentstudy of autism in island populations. The data for Shetland are shown below. Year of BirthShetland Islands,Scotland.A birth cohort effectfor autism is 1980's,corresponding withthe introduction ofMMR vaccine.Source Thrower D. 119 Year of Birth Figure. A similar birth cohort effect is seen for those born in the WesternIsles of Scotland, a geographically distinct group from the Shetlands. MMR and Compound effectsParental reports have implicated the polyvalent MMR vaccine, but rarely themonovalent measles vaccine, in autistic regression. Is such a causal associationconsistent with what is known of the risks for acquired forms of this syndrome?Atypical patterns of exposure to common childhood infections measles, mumps,rubella and chickenpox- have been associated with autism and autisticregression. In utero and infant exposures have been identified as periods ofapparent susceptibility, when both the brain and the immune system areundergoing rapid development (Deykin EY and Mac Mahon B. American Journalof Epidemiology 1979;109:628-638). It is notable that a close temporalrelationship in the exposure to two of these infections during the periods ofsusceptibility may compound both the risk and severity of autism. Althoughhistorically, these rare patterns of exposure may have accounted for only a smallproportion of autism, the widespread use of a combination of the candidateagents in a single vaccine may have changed this. Recently, measles containing BEST COPYAVAILABLE n 120 vaccines were linked to developmental regression (Weibel RE et al. Paediatrics1998;101:383-387). In order to understand why autsistic enterocolitis might result from acompound effectwhere the interaction of multiple concurrent viral exposures isimportant - it is helpful to examine the patterns of childhood infection that havebeen identified as risk factors for persistent measles virus infection and delayeddisease. One important pattern of infection that may increase the risk of delayeddisease is where different viruses interact, either with each other or both interactwith the host immune system simultaneously. A close temporal exposure tomeasles virus and another infection, including chickenpox or an encephalitogenicenterovirus, is associated with an excess risk for a rare fatal encephalitis(subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), the onset of which may be delayed formany years. Similarly, atypical patterns of measles infection, including a closetemporal exposure to mumps infection, but not other common childhoodinfections, have been identified as a significant risk factor for chronic intestinalinflammation - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Clues that the component viruses of MMR could interfere, one withanother, were provided in the very first pilot studies of this vaccine in 1969(Buynak et al. JAMA 1969;207:2259-2262). However, despite providing compellingevidence of the potential for dose- and strain-dependent interactions between thecomponent viruses in the MMR vaccine, both in the context of adverse reactionsand antiviral immune responses, the matter was left in abeyance. Six years later, in 1974, the potential for viral interference in MMR was thesubject of a more detailed follow-up to the Buynak study, by Minekawa et al(Biken Journal 1974;17:161-167). The most striking observation was of a dose-dependent influence of the mumps vaccine upon not only clinical reactions to themeasles component, but also seroconversion to rubella vaccine.The ability of mumps virus to interfere with the cellular immune responseto certain strains of measles virus and, thereby, in particular combinations 121 potentially to reduce viral clearance and increase the risk of persistent infection,is an intriguing hypothesis to some of those involved in the current debate.Whatever the ultimate merits of this hypothesis, the contemporaneousinterpretation of Minekawa et al was that further studies were necessary.However, it does not appear, from the published literature, that these furtherstudies were undertaken. SummaryAutistic enterocolitis is a real syndromeThe swollen intestinal lymphoid tissue provides a focus for searching forthe cause(s) of this syndrome.A The virological data indicate that this may be measles virus in somechildren.It would be imprudent to interpret the temporal relationship with MMR ascoincidence, in the absence of thorough investigation.Epidemiologic and virologic data support the possibility of a compoundeffect of multiple concurrent viral exposures influencing: the clinical andimmunologic response to MMR; the risk of autism; and, the risk of delayedsequelae, including chronic intestinal inflammation.Autistic enterocolitis appears to be important part of the current epidemicof autism and autistic spectrum disorders. ConclusionsIf, following thorough independent scientific investigation, it emerges thatautistic enterocolitis and other related disorders are causally related to acompound influence of the component viruses of MMR, whether theseviruses have been encountered naturally or in the vaccine, then throughjudicious use of the vaccines, one may have a means for preventing thedisease. Spacing the single vaccines, thereby dissociating the exposuresthat, together, may constitute the risk, provides a way of not onlypreventing the acute measles, mumps and rubella infections, but also, 122 potentially, the risk of one of the most devastating diseases that it hasbeen our misfortune to encounter. 123Dr. O'LEARY. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thepurpose of my testimony is to report the scientific results in a se-ries of children with autistic enterocolitis that has just been de-scribed to you. Nothing in my testimony should or must be con- strued as anti-vaccine; rather, it encourages safe vaccination strat- egies. The opinions that I am expressing in the text and in my presentation are those of my own.These studies were undertaken following an approach made to me by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who has just submitted independenttestimony. The studies represent a transnational, multidisciplinaryresearch program aimed at elucidating the causes and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases in association with developmentaldisorders of childhood.Next slide.Dr. Wakefield has alluded to measles virus as a potential associ- ated factor in the pathogenesis of autistic enterocolitis, and hecame to our laboratory to seek molecular confirmation.Next slide, please.He posed some questions. The first question: Was measles viruspresent in gut biopsies from these children?Next slide, please.Where was itlocated? How much was there? Could it besequencedcould we actually confirm there was measles virus? And finally, could different molecular technologies actually inde-pendently confirm the presence of measles virus?May I inform you that I am a pathologist and a molecular biolo- gist. My area of diagnostic expertise is histopathology, which is un- derstanding and examining the cellular basis of disease.Next slide, please.The blinded study included 46 cases; 25 children had a diagnosis of autistic enterocolitis, and 21 controls were included in the study, including 15 normal children who did not have a developmental disorder, four children with Crohn's disease, which is a chronic in- flammatory bowel disease condition, and two children with ulcera-tive colitis, a very similar condition but one which is histologicallydifferent.We examined terminal ileal biopsies, and from the blocks of tis-sue that were given to us, we looked at four to six serial sectionson the one case. What we wanted to do was to see if we could iden-tify the virus; could we replicate it on multiple sections from one patient. Where available, fresh tissue was examined.Next slide.The positive control materials in this study were transvectedmeasles virus-infected viral cells which contained measles virus ge- nome, and measles virus-infected brain tissue. As negative controls,we screened a panel of other virally infected cells lines.Next slide.To confirm the presence of measles virus, we adopt a five-hit strategy. The first was to localize and identify the presence of mea-sles virus RNA in the tissue sections from these patients.The second was to quantify using a technology called Taq Manreal-time quantitative PCR. I have worked in this technology forthe last 6 years, and it is approximately 1,000 times more sensitive than existing PCR-based technologies. 124Finally, we wanted to confirm the sequence of the virus, so weemployed capillary fluorescent-based sequencing.Next slide.Let me summarize what in-cell PCR is. I know this is technical,but I think it is extremely important. Measles virus is an RNAvirus, and RNA when it is removed from the body is extremely eas-ily degradable. PCR basically is like a photocopying reaction. Wecan make multiple copies of a particular gene that we are inter-ested in looking for.In-cell PCR allows us to demonstrate these genetic sequences incells and without cells, looking down the microscope.Next slide.Taq Man quantitative PCR basically is a revolutionary PCR-basedtechnology which is sequence detection-specific. You will only get apositive result in this assay if the desired gene of interest that youare looking for is present in the tissue section.Next slide.In our laboratory, we are one of the few laboratories in the worldthat actually perform RNA inhibition assays. This is effectively totest how degraded the RNA in our samples is, and No. 2, is thereanything in the environment of the laboratory that is contributingto the breakdown of RNA in tissue samples of cells.Next slide.I think it is extremely important in relation to the detection oflow-copy viral infections, and I think our laboratory has a reputa-tion for the detection of low-viral copy numbers, that we have strictanti-contamination measures. What I mean here is that we do notwant to generate false-positive results.So we have separate, isolated extraction and PCR areas. This isin a newly built, custom-designed molecular biology facility. Wehave two independent laboratory sites, and for the purpose of thisinvestigation, we employed in situ hybridization, which is basicallya way of taking a cloned or a fragment of DNA or RNA that you have in your laboratory and looking for the presence of that in atissue section or cell. We can use the technology of in-cell PCR thatI have described, solution phase PCR, and PCR, which arecomplementary technologies, but Taq Man PCR is 1,000 times moresensitive than standard solution phase PCR technologies, and thensequencing.Next slide, please.Just to reiterate again the point: Our laboratories go to desperatelengths, No. 1, to prove that we do not have RNA inhibition, butsecond to prove that we do not have contamination. We purposelyin all of our plates set up contamination. This is effectively tooutrule the possible generation of false-positive results.Again, I would appeal to the non-scientific members of the com-mittee that this is an extremely important control that must be in-cluded if you are looking for low-copy viral gene detections.Next slide, please.And of course, to confirm the presence of measles virus, the goldstandard is to confirm the sequence of the virus, to say yes, thisis measles virus RNA that we have got in the tissue sections.Next slide, please. 125Let us look at the results now. We carry out an extensive set of optimization reactions where we had measles virus clones, looking at several regions of the measles virus genome, F, N, and H. The technical detail of this is not important, but just to show you that we could look at several genes within the measles virus genome, and we could reproducibly make copies of these or amplify them. The bottom panel shows youan experiment which allows us to detect the measles virus in viral cells, showing what the optimal concentration of the probe that we require to detect the virus is, and you can see clearly that the optimum concentration is 1 to 1.5 micrograms per ml.Next slide, please.This slide shows the results of in-cell PCR by two different tech- nologies. One is in-cell phase PCR, the other is in-cell Taq Man PCR, which produces a green signal in the right-hand panels, top and bottom. Again it demonstrates that we can clearly identify measles virus in these transvected cells.Next slide, please.This is a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Mea- sles virus is the cause of this condition. So of course, if we are to reliably detect measles virus in biopsies of the children that Dr. Wakefield provided to us, we should of course be able to identify measles virus in brain biopsies from patients with SSPE.The left panel and the middle panel show measles virus presence in these biopsies, and the right-hand panel is the negative control. Next slide, please.This is a case of an autistic child No. 1. You can see the top left- hand panel is a microscopic appearance of what the gut looks likeand this is not normal gut epithelium from a child; it is heav- ily inflamed. The bottom left-hand panel show a spidery, black de- posit, outer width of the cells that are in green. This is actually measles virus RNA. The top right-hand panel again in a different field shows a heavier deposit of black, which again is measles virus, and again, I need to point out to you that this is outer width of the cells that are surrounding it.Measles virus was located in the tonsils, in the lymphoidhyperplastic areas that Dr. Wakefield described on endoscopy. And the negative control is absolutely clean.Next slide, please.This is another case, a second autistic child, again showing a very similar findingsa black deposit, which is measles virus, out-side of inflammatory cells, associating the fibrillary matrix, and thenegative controls here for mumps are absolutely clean. Next slide, please.I think this slide is extremely important. If you look at the left- hand panel, this is measles virus for the nucleocapsid gene. It is a black signal. It again is the outer width of the cells, but it hasa spidery, cobwebby morphology. There are little processes and ten-tacles coming out of this region. If you look at the top right-hand panel, the follicular dendritic cell has processes, dendrites, which form the cell matrix, which is very, very similar to what we see on the left-hand panel. And the immunocytic chemical staining analy- sis which Dr. Wakefield alluded to gives exactly the same results. Next slide, please. 126By solution phase PCR, by what we call fairly standard labora-tory protocols, we can detect the measles virus in gut biopsies fromthese children, and the negative' controls are appropriately nega-tive.Next slide, please.Even in a paraffin-embedded tissue section that has probablybeen sitting around in wax for 4 to 5 years, we can detect measlesvirus. That is an astounding finding in view of the fact that waxand fixation by itself breaks down RNA. This graph shows in realtime, we can look at the accumulation of the PCR product that weare making, confirming that measles virus is actually present inthis biopsy.Next slide.And of course, we can sequence it, and we can say that this ismeasles virus RNA present in the biopsies of these children.To do this properly, you need to do it in a forward and negativestrand. I started off by saying that measles virus is an RNA virus.When we make copies of the RNA virus, we make copies in two-strand forms. So if we are to sequence it, we should sequence ina forward and reverse strand.Looking at that electrophoretogram, the sequences in both direc-tions are exactly the same.Next slide, please.In summary, then, in terms of the association that AndrewWakefield alluded to, I can confirm that his hypothesis is correct-24 out of 25 childrenthat is 96 percent of the children's biopsiesthat he sent to my laboratory, blindedchildren with autisticenterocolitis harbor measles virus genomes.Three out of with Crohn's diseasethese are chil-dren with Crohn's diseaseand one out of two children with ulcer-ative colitis also contain measles virus. That is an interesting bio-logical fact.Finally, 1 of 15, 6.6 percent, of control children harbored measlesvirus genome. I think it does not take greater statistical analysisto work out that there is a significant difference between 24 out of25 and 1 out of 15.Next slide.Solution phase RT-PCR, which is standard laboratory-based tech-nology, was positive in all children with autistic enterocolitis fordifferent regions of the measles virus genome. That is extremelyimportant. And we can sequence measles virus isolates from thesechildren.Final slide, please.However, the infection that is present in these children is at ex-tremely low copy, at about 5 to 30 transcripts per approximately2,000 cells.Now, again, I want to add some technical overlay on this. Theway that we quantify RNA in our laboratory is by a method calledcopy RNA. Again, we are one of the few laboratories worldwidethat would do this as the most accurate way of actually measuringRNA. Indeed, industry now is accepting this as a standard way ofquantifying RNA in cells of tissue sections.Finally, the presence of measles virus was identified by in situhybridization, by solution phase PCR, by TaqMan PCR, by in-cell 127PCR, by sequencing. This really, in terms of technology, is as goodas it gets right now.I hope that I have given you evidence here which is compellingin relation to the presence of measles virus in children with autis-tic enterocolitis.Thank you for your time and attention.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Professor, and when we get to the ques- tion-and-answer phase, I am sure that we will try to ask questionsin layman's terms and try to get some answers so that we can un- derstand everything that both you and Dr. Wakefield saidbut Ithink we got the gist of it.Dr. Singh.[The prepared statement of Dr. O'Leary follows:] 128Testimony before Congressional Oversight Committee on Autism andImmunisation by John J. O'Leary MD, PhD, MSc, MRCPath.Mr. Chairman and members of the committee,The purpose of this testimony is to report the scientific results in a series ofchildren with autistic enterocolitis. Nothing in this testimony should be construedas anti-vaccine, rather it encourages safe vaccination strategies. The opinionsexpressed in this text and attendant presentation represent those of the author,and are not representative of any organisation or institution.The studies were undertaken following an approach made to me by Dr. AndrewWakefield (who has submitted independent testimony). The studies represent atrans-national, multi-disciplinary research programme aimed at elucidating thecauses and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and developmentaldisorders of childhood.Biopsy material for this study was provided by Dr. Wakefield and presented to mylaboratory using \"blinded protocols\". Unique accession numbers were thenassigned to each case to maintain patient and diagnostic anonymity. Seniorscientists and technicians have carried out the research work at a dedicated stateof the art molecular biology facility.Dr. Wakefield posed three questions to our group in relation toautisticenterocolitis:Was measles virus present in gut biopsies of affected children?Where was measles virus located in gut biopsies of affected children?How much virus was present in gut biopsies of affected children?Following scientific discussions it was decided to augment this panel of questionsby including two additional important questions:.Could measles virus genomes be sequenced from gut biopsies fromchildren with autistic enterocolitis?.Could different molecular technologies be employed to confirm thedetection of measles virus genomes in affected children?Before commencement of the project a standard operating procedure (SOP) waswritteninrelation to handling of samples, extraction of nucleic acid andperformance of molecular virology screening assays. The assays used in quantitative Specific regions of the measles RNA genome were selected as detection targets.These included the haemagglutinin (H), nucleocapsid (N) and fusion (F) regionsof the measles genome.Strict anti-contamination procedures were adopted throughout the study toprevent false positive results being generated. These included separate amplification, visualisation of genetic sequences (DNAand RNA) in tissue sections. The in-situ hybridisation assays employedcloned cDNA (copy DNA) fragments of the H, N and F region of the measlesgenome. Cloned fragments were labelled with biotin and /or digoxigenin usingstandard nick translation technology. Hybridisation (specific attachment) of probeto the target sequence in cells and tissues was carried out using conventionalchemistries..Detection of the formed hybrid was achieved using standardimmunocytochemical techniques. In all cases tyramide signal amplification (TSA)was applied to increase detection sensitivity.One-step immunocytochemical detection has a sensitivity of 50 genome copiesper cell; three step immunocytochemical detection has a sensitivity of 10 15copies per cell: However, TSA achieves single copy viral gene detection in cellsand tissue sections.In-situ hybridisation assays were performed on serial sections of gut biopsiesfrom affected children. Hybridisation efficiency was assessed using a conservedhuman repeat sequence (I.e. present in every cell). Negative control probesincluded Human Papilloma virus types 16 and 18 and Human Herpes Virus 8.lmmunocytochemical and detection controls were included in all assays.Optimisation experiments were carried out using measles virus infected Verocells and brain biopsy material from patients affected with sub-acute sclerosingpan-encephalitis (SSPE), which is caused by measles virus. 130 Testimony before Congressional Oversight Committee on Autism and Immunisationby John J. O'Leary MD, PhD, MSc MRCPath. In-cell PCR:This technique allows the investigator to amplify (make copies of) DNA and RNAin cells and tissue sections with a detection sensitivity of one viral or mammaliangenome copy per cell.The location of the virus within the tissue can beidentified.In addition, problems with DNA and RNA contamination are notencountered using this method, because only DNA/RNA present in tissuesections (i.e. either inside or outside cells).will be amplified and localised. (Figure1). .. O. Figure 1:Schematic representation of RT in-cell PCRIn these cases, measles virus RNA was amplified using in-cell RT-PCR (reversetranscriptase PCR).This technology employs a polymerase chain reaction(PCR) step (in order to make copies of the RNA molecule) and a hybridisationstep using a labelled probe to detect the newly formed amplicon(gene copies).Optimisation experiments were carried out using measles virus infected Verocells and measles-infected brain biopsy material from patients with sub-acutesclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE).Four to six serial sections of gut biopsies from affected children were examinedfor the presence of measles virus, while including appropriate controls, i.e.omission of reverse transcriptase enzyme,omission of DNA polymerase, BEST COPY AVAILABLE 131 Testimony before Congressional Oversight Committee on Autism and Immunisationby John J.

Optimisation experiments were carried out using measles virus infected Verocells and brain biopsy material from patients affected with sub-acute sclerosingpan-encephalitis (SSPE), which is caused by measles virus.The detection sensitivity of single round PCR is 15 viral copy RNA equivalents(cRNA) in 105 RNA sequences. Taq Man quantitative PCR:This technique allows automated quantitative PCR analysis of RNA and DNAgene sequences. My laboratory has been involved with this technology forapproximately 5-6 years. Taq Man PCR utilises two primers (as in conventional BEST COPYAVAILABLE 132 Testimony before Congressional Oversight Committee on Autism and Immunisationby John J. O'Leary MD, PhD, MSc, MRCPath. solution phase PCR), but in addition uses a probe labelled at one end with afluorescent reporter molecule and at the other end by a fluorescent quenchermolecule. These molecules are chosen so that the reporter emits fluorescenceat the specific wavelength that the quencher will absorb fluorescent light. Nofluorescence can be detected when the probe is intact due to the proximity of thereporter molecule to the quencher. The probe is designed so it will bind to thetarget sequence between the two primers.It is also important to note that Taq Man PCR utilises a characteristic of theenzyme Taq polymerase, namely its 5' nuclease activity.If the target sequence of interest is present, then both primers anneal (stick) tothe ends of the target sequence. At the same time hybridisation (sticking) of theTaq Man probe occurs. During the extension phase of PCR, the Taq Man probe isdisplaced and cleaved (broken) with release of the reporter molecule into solutionaway from the quencher sequence. For each new copy of the gene that is made,one reporter molecule is released which can be monitored in a specificallydesigned sequence detector (7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems)).The assay is entirely sequence specific and does not yield false positive results.In addition, it is a closed tube assay, which minimises potential contaminationevents.

The signals obtained (see Figure 7)appear to be extra cellular and fibrillary in nature. Localisation of measles virusgenomes was confirmed on serial sections from the same patient. In eachbiopsy, 1-3 loci of amplification were identified; indicating low measles virus copynumber. The results must be taken in the context of formalin fixation, which, byits nature degrades RNA molecules in cells and tissue sections.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.I did not realize that I could have shown a couple of slides aswell to make the point much more in layman's language, but I willtry to explain the results of the research that I am involved in.It has been nearly 25 years that I have been involved in so-calledchildhood diseases, from the immunology side as well as the pedi-atric neurology side. I was working at Children's Hospital in Van-couver, Canada, which is where I began my career in childhood dis-eases, and early on, I saw a few examples of autism mentioned incongenital rubella syndrome. It was a fascinating observation, be-cause at that time, I was very excited about the research on virusinfections and nervous system disorders. That really led me to kindof work back and forth between nervous system disorders and virusinfections and immunology.So the whole thing here is that we need to consider combinationof these disciplines that we talk about. We are not going to be ableto answer any questions as far as I am concerned about nervoussystem diseases simply by studying psychology or simply by lookingat the epidemiology data. We need to come together as a team tofocus histories of nervous system, immune system, and whateverelse comes into the picture. That is one major focus of attentionthat at least I am taking for my future research.On autism as an immune disorder, I think I am probably one ofthe earlier investigators who started working on the immunity andautismconnection.Followed bythat was my theorythat autoimmunity is a very important process in autism. That is partlybecause I was studying autoimmunity in nervous system disorderslike multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Quite frankly, someof my earlier work in Alzheimer's disease has opened the way, andtoday, people are actually using immunology as a platform to de-sign treatment for Alzheimer's disease.It was funny to see on the news last night that some doctor hasa new approach; he says he is going to use immunology as a meansof activating the nervous system in order to correct the Alzheimer'sproblem. That is a fascinating stuff, at least to me.So I started to pay more and more attention to autism, and theresults that I am going to share with you are actually quite uniqueto autism. They are part of the nervous system, but they are beinganalyzed by the immune system research.I know there are people, especially who are funded by NIH or byCDC, who continue to make no mention at all of this so-called im-munology research or autoimmunity research in autism. I havebeen invited by the NIH panel; I have made two trips to NIH pan-els. I made a visit to the Institute of Medicine and the NationalAcademy of Sciences about 11/2 or 2 years ago. And if you hearthose people who have been funded by these agencies, when theygo out and present, they do not even mention anything aboutautoimmunity in autism. NIH people prepared a document of thatmeeting. It was designed for updating the screening and diagnosticcriteria. If you read that document, there is virtually no mentionof this sort of research. To me, this is simply mind-boggling.Is it because people out there in the scientific community do notwant to buy the argument, or are they just being naive about what 4'11A144 139is already coming out in the way of solid, decent, experimentally proven research?Now, having given that background, let me show you some of the results. First of all, I started looking at autism as an autoimmune disorder, as I mentioned. And what we have found is over the last 5 or 6 years of researchand I think now, the number of cases I have studied is approaching about 400 casesvery early on, I wanted to study the myelination problem in the brain. You will ask what is myelination. It isone of the most critical events in thenervous system development. So when a child is actually growing,this myelination process isvery important. It is really more or lesslike a mother will feeda child and perhaps nurse in such a waythat this process has to be nurtured very, very carefully. Having said that, what weare finding is auto-antibodies. Auto-antibodies are the hallmark of the autoimmune process. If you have an autoimmuneprocess, you are going to have auto-anti-bodies, but if you have those antibodies against an organ which is affected in a diseasein autism, what would that bethat would be the brain. So we are finding brain auto-antibodies in autobodies. What I am trying to illustrate in this chart is that we had a number of normal children, normal adults, patients with other dis- orders, Down syndrome, andnone of those seemed to show theseauto-antibodies, but on a rare occasion, 1 or 2 percent positive in the normal or control population.Here, we have a scientific observation which anybody can go out there and repeat. I do not think I need to use any difficult thing to illustrate that point. It is a consistently reproducible result, and it is happening now in children all over the world. I am getting specimens from overseas as well, not just the nationwide specimens alone. So this is a very important thing.Furthermore, I find that particular protein marker is selective, because I have now studied two additional markers of the same structure in the brain, and I do not find these auto-antibodies in autism.Let me move on to the next issue. What happens is, assuming there is an autoimmuneprocess, most autoimmune diseases aretriggered by virus infections. So I started to think about looking at viruses. I was not thinking of the vaccine issue at all. I was think- ing of virus infection. And, quite surprisingly, when I started to do antibody measurements to viruses which are out there or tempo- rarily associated, what I found was that the measles virus stands out as statistically significant in terms of its antibodies, signifi- cantly much higher in autistic children. So these children have what is so-called hyperimmune response to the measles virusnot otherviruses.Westudiedrubellavirus,HHV-6virus, cytomegalovirus, and none of those three viruses showed this hyperimmune antibody response.Furthermore, the important thing is the measles antibodies which we have now measured by two different methods, and the result is the samea statistically significant increase.The next thing I wanted tosee was if anything correlated be-tween these two parameters. Quite strongly, I found that brainauto-antibody-positive patients also had measles antibody levels which were very high. So the higher the antibody level to measles 140virus, the higher the chance of brain auto-antibody. It does nottake too much intelligence to make some sense here now.Over the years, some of these families have been sending mewritten notes or telephone calls and so on, and every time I wasgoing out to make my presentation, people would tell me about thevaccine connection with autism.Early on, I was not sure what was happening. So I tried to puttogether their own reports, and the report looks like this in the piechart. Nearly 53 percent of the families reported that their childgot autism because of MMR. The remaining 30 percent said it wasbecause of the DPT shot. And about 15 percentthis was a criticalcategory for two reasonsabout 7 percent said they were not surewhether it was measles or DPT, but the remaining 7 percent hadno history of vaccination connection, or at least they did not makethe connection. I wonder if that 7 or 8 percent category is whereDr. Dankner's child might fit in.The last point I want to make is that of a very recent researchfinding of my own, not yet published, but something quite impor-tant. About which I showed a slide in my presentation in a meetinglast year which was held in Orlando, FL. This is an observation ofantibodies to measles, rubella, because that is the largestpopulation which was reported to me as being affected by the mea-sles vaccine.We took the vaccine preparation itself, and we decided to exam-ine antibodies in these children. Normal children do not show anyantibody to a protein that I will point out in a second, but in chil-dren with autism, nearly 65 percent of them showed that antibody.Actually, I can illustrate that point a little more if we just imag-ine that I am a molecule, or a preparation of measles, mumps, ru-bella. This protein, this antibody that I am detecting will be some-thing like detecting this coat pin. In other words, antibodies to thisprotein which is present in the measles, mumps, rubella vaccinepreparation were found in autistic children, but not in the normalchildren. I think this is a very, very important laboratory-based re-search evidence. If anybody wants to make a criticism of that, ofcourse, they are at liberty to do so. However, I find this is a sci-entifically very, very important observation, telling us that perhapsthere is a good connection, there is something happening with thismeasles, mumps, rubella vaccine in these children, something isunusual.So basically, after having illustrated some of these points, I wantto make a final comment. That is, if you really look at the lit-erature reported on the vaccine adverse reactions, I do not thinkyou will need a crystal ball to see that vaccines have adverse reac-tions. The literature is full of those reports. What is not there oris it has never been reported, or at least, the officials from the CDCcontinue not to mention anything about it. What they mention isthat vaccines are good. Every week, you read about it in the news-paper, and you hear about it on the television. And I do not dispute that information because I know vaccines are very, very important.My concern as a researcher now, more so than ever before, is thatwe must pay attention to the safety of these vaccines. It is missing;it has not been disclosed publicly, and I do not think it exists in 141the literature, and therefore, I urge the Government Reform Com- mittee to look into particular new policies concerning the vaccine safety issue.Thank you very much.Mr. BURTON. Thankyou, Dr. Singh.Dr. Boyle.[The of follows:] 142Vaccines-induced Autoimmunity in Autism:.ByVijendra K. Singh, Ph.D.Department of Biotechnology CenterUtah State University, UMC 4700Logan, Utah 84322 Today, I will be speaking about the autoimmunity aspect of vaccines in autism, a medicalcondition that has been largely ignored by the medical community and federalgovernment for a very long time and yet the incidence of autism is increasing at analarming rate. An estimated one-half of a million Americans, mainly children, andmillions more worldwide are known to suffer from autism, a heart-rending disorder thatseverely impairs higher brain functions: social interaction, communication, language,imagination and cognition. The disorder is a life-long mental disability with devastatingconsequences for both the patient and his/her family. Thus the financial burden is hugefor the families who care for children with autism.Autism is an idiopathic brain disorder, which simply means that the etiology of thedisorder is not known. And there is no single, clear-cut cause for autism. Causallyspeaking, I tend to think that autism is a complex disorder, in which autoimmunityto brain plays a key role. Today,_ in. spite of virtually no funding available,autoimmunity is the most extensively investigated topic of research in autism. This isby and large due to the fact that autoimmunity is the prime target of therapy that hasprovento be quiteeffectivein, amelioratingautisticcharacteristics.Thus theautoimmunity research, unlike: the genetic research; 'has already significantly.improvedthe health and welfare of individuals with autistic disorder. I have recently coined a term\"Autoimmune Autism (AA)\" to refer to a subset of autism that has autOimmune etiology.Moreover, there are scientific reasons to think that this subset may indeed be a result ofvaccine injuries to children who display autistic regression.Autoimmunity is an abnormal reaction immune reaction, in which the immune systembecomes primed to react against body organs. It's a mosaic of highly complicatedinteractions and networking between cells and molecules of the immune system. Thebody makes autoantibodies against itself, resulting in damage to tissues and organs. The\"autoiminune\" response is what happens in autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and myresearch showed that a similar response my account for the brain abnormalities found inpeople with autism.Autoimmune diseases are identified and characterized by many factors. The hallmark isthe \"organ-specific autoantibodies\" that have also been identified in people with autisticdisorder. To that end, I have recently summarized laboratory data of approximately 400cases (autistic and controls) and found that up to 80% of autistic children have 143autoantibodies to specific brain structures, in particular a brain protein known as myelinbasic protein (MBP) of the myelin sheath, a fatty coating that insulates nerve fibers andabsolutely essential for higher brain functions. These autoantibodies are present quitefrequently (65-85%) in autistic children, but only rarely (0-5%) in normal children andother disease controls. Accordingly, I postulated that autism involves a specificautoimmune response to MBP -- an immune assault that impairs myelin development inthe developing brain, thereby modifying the nerve cell functions of the brain. Ultimately,by way of impaired wiring diagram in the brain, this results into autism.Autoimmunity is commonly triggered by environmental exposures such as viralinfections. Virus serology (or virus antibodies) is an excellent tool for studying virusinfections in disease states. However, until recently, such studies had not been performedfor autism. Because of my ongoing research, I became interested in examining a viruslink with autoimmunity in autism. I recently raised two specific questions: (1) Doesautistic children have a hyperimmune response (or increase of antibodies) for a specificvirus? (2) Is there a relationship between virus antibodies and brain autoantibodies inautism? I conducted a carefully designed study to address these two questions.Succinctly,I made two very important observations: first,there was indeed ahyperimmune response to a virus and it was specifically for the measles virus (MV), butnot for the other viruses tested [human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), rubella virus (RV), andcytomegalovirus (CMV)]; and an association between measles virusantibodies and MBP autoantibodies (i.e., the higher the measles virus antibody level thegreater the chance of brain autoantibody). Few months earlier in the same year (February,1998), I had already found that many autistic children had antibodies to a specific proteinof the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (MMR vaccine preparation). These viralantibodies were also related to positive titers of brain MBP autoantibodies. This wasmost probably the first laboratory-based evidence to link measles virus and/orMMR vaccine to autoimmunity in children with autism. Collectively, theseobservations led me to speculate that autism may be caused by a measles- or MMRvaccine-induced autoimmune response. Unfortunately, due to lack of funding, I havenot been able to extend this research and the progress has been hampered.As I made scientific presentation of my initial findings, a vaccine-autism connectionbecame even more apparent. I compiled a nonscientific, anecdotal survey of vaccine-injured children with \"autistic regression\" or autistic disorder, as reported by families.Surprisingly, up to 93% of the reported cases had autistic shortly 7% of the reported cases were not linked to any vaccination at all. Indeed,if these numbers are reproducible, the data will lead to inescapable conclusion thatthese vaccines can potentially cause autoimmunity in autism. Quite candidly, this willnot be first time that a vaccine has been linked to a disease or disorder. There is quite abitofliteraturelinkingvaccinestoautoimmunediseases.Furthermore,anepidemiologicalstudyjustpublishedin JAMA (March 8thissue)described\"extraimmunization\" amongst American children and considered it to be a contributingfactor for the adverse effects of the vaccines. And I think the vaccines and autismconnection is no exception to these adverse effects. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 144In summary, the rapidly accumulating evidence strongly implicates autoimmunityin autism, which in many may result from a vaccine injury. There is a possibility ofan atypical measles infection in autism, but the evidence also suggests a MMRvaccine infection. Without any reservation, I would strongly recommend that thisCongressional Committee reviews all the information in bipartisanship, and explore thepossibility that drug companies never properly evaluated the safety of vaccines inthe first place. If this indeed were true then it becomes imperative that we as a societymust pay an immediate attention to this problem; otherwise, an epidemic of autism is areal good possibility. There should be no mistaking about it because autism is on a sharprise and vaccinations, especially the extraimmunization, could potentially explain thisrise. The onset of autism (or autistic regression) post-immunization should no longerbe regarded as merely a coincidence with the timing of the vaccinations, as ourfederal health officials continue to do. We must find new ways to curve adverseeffects of vaccines, including autism. Considering a population of 500,000 cases ofautism in the United States, the autoimmunity research, but not the genetic research, hasalready had a great impact on the health and welfare of autistic people. Since brainautoimmunity is found in up to 85% of cases, it can potentially help an estimated 425,000Americans. Indeed, many of them are already reaping the benefits of the experimentalautoimmune therapy. Thus there is an urgent need to promote autoimmunity research inautism. This recommendation is in contrast to the opinions held by the directors of thefederal agencies and major private foundations (Cure Autism Now and National Alliancefor Autism Research) who are erroneously committed themselves to fund geneticresearch only. Finally, I urge the Government Reform Committee to provide leadershipfor new solutions to the existing problems surrounding autism research, and request- theCommittee Members to be visionary and offer new hope to the people with autism Theessence of life is to care. 145Ms. BoYLE. Goodafternoon, Mr. Chairmanand members Chief ofthe DevelopmentalDis- abilities Branch at Prevention. I am presentingthe agency's testimony,and I am accompaniedby Dr. Ben Schwartz,who ActingDirector of theEpidemiology and SurveillanceDivision at the NationalImmunization Program at CDC.I am pleased todiscuss our workat CDC to preventdevelop- mental disabilitiesincluding autism. Iwant to begin byassuring the parents thatwe have heard from todaythat CDC is concerned about autism, andthat we are workinghard to find thecauses of autism and otherdevelopmental disabilitiesso that all children will have theopportunity to havea healthy and productivefuture. Autism isa serious developmentaldisability whichcan have pro- found impacton children and their families. It is characterizedby qualitative impairmentsin social interactionsand communication and a pattern may requirelong-term a cost more peryear. Costs for residentialcare can be $80,000 to year. CDC's role in preventingdevelopmental disabilitiesincluding au- tism is to track thedisease rates in thepopulation and toidentify causes of this condition. CDC can then establish prevention pro- grams and then evaluate how well theseprograms work. We do not know ifautism ratesare going up. Early studiesfound autism rates in therange of 4 to 6 per 10,000children, usinga narrow set of criteria. Morerecent studies havereported rates averaging 12per 10,000 children, but these studies have useddif- ferent criteria thanthe earlier studies.CDC is not certainhow much thereported increase isdue to changes in the definitionof autismor an improved recognition of this conditionover time. We also do notknow if other factorshave contributed to the largernumbers of childrenseeking treatment. CDC is currentlydevelopingways to bettermeasure autism. In 1998, we added autismto our the only community-widestudy in the UnitedStates. CDC has just funded MarshallUniversity in WestVirginia to starttracking au- tism in six countriesin that State.At this point, Iwant to briefly describeour activities in Brick Township, NJ and ininvestigating the allegedassociation between autism and the MMRvaccination.In early 1998, theCDC and the Agencyfor Toxic Substancesand Disease Registry[ATSDR],were contacted by the New Torricelli,and U.S. Represent- ative numberof children with autismwas too high.In response, CDCconducted a study ofchildren with autismliv- in Townshipduring 1998. ATSDRinvestigatedsources of environmental pollutionand in BrickTownship. data havebeen collected, andthe resultsare currently un- 146dergoing scientific review. Once this review is completed, we willprovide the report first to the parents of the affected children, thecommunity, and then the local and State health departments. Wewould be pleased to brief interested Members or their staffs on theresults of this work at the time we make them available to thecommunity.As the committee is aware, a theory links the MMR vaccine andautism, which has generated public interest and some controversy.CDC believes that the current scientific evidence does not supportthe hypothesis that MMR or any combination of vaccines cause thedevelopment of autism. Initial case series reports have not beensubstantiated by more focused reviews or by more in-depth follow-up research.It should be pointed out that factors known to be associated withautism include genetic factors and events that occur before birth.CDC recognizes how important it is to identify the causes of au-tism as well as to ensure the safety of vaccines. CDC is currentlyundertaking three studies related to autism or about hypothesesrelated to vaccines and autism.First, CDC is using its Autism Surveillance Program in Atlantato examine the possibility of a link between the MMR vaccine andautism.Second, we are working with the National Institutes of Health toconduct a study that will evaluate whether vaccination is linkedwith developmental regression which occurs in some children withautism.Third, CDC is using the Vaccine Safety Data link, in collaborationwith several HMOs, to study inflammatory bowel disease and theMMR vaccination.Through these studies, CDC is working to assure the safety ofthe vaccination program and to identify preventable causes of au-tism.Mr. Chairman, in the past 4 years, public health has made sig-nificant advances in preventing developmental disabilities. Preven-tion of congenital syphilis and congenital rubella syndrome havespared lives and prevented disability for thousands of children.Newborn screening programs have prevented lifelong mental retar-dation in children with hyperthyroidism and sickle cell disease.However, given these strides, we still do not know what causesmany developmental disabilities, including autism. While addi-tional scientific research is being completed, it is important to alsoconsider the broader context of public health, including the vaccina-tion program, which is one of the most successful public healthachievements of the 20th century.Given the weight of the scientific data and the known serious-ness and ongoing risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, in CDC'sjudgment, the best public policy is to continue vaccination un-changed while aggressively working to try to identify causes of de-velopmental disabilities.CDC agrees with the committee and the parents who have testi-fied today that autism has a significant and profound adverse im-pact on the lives of children and families and communities whereit occurs. We must track this disorder, we must identify the pre- 147ventable causes, and we must institute effective prevention pro- grams.It is my hope that our efforts, combined with those of the NIHand the academic community, will lead to a way to prevent devel-opmental disabilities of autism, enabling those children to live fulland productive lives.Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.Mr. BURTON.

Developmentaldisabilities preventchildren from achievingat the level of theirpeers and through no fault of their own causeatremendous burdenon families and our society in general. Developmental disabilitiesare a diverse group of physical, cognitive, psychological,sensory andspeech impairments that areusually identified betWeenbirth' that about 17% ofall children -havea developmentaldisabilityvalon%havotriefit=.developmental such as mental retardation, Cerebralpalsy or autism. Ininost-case,s';.We '-do not know thecause of the developmental disability. Several infectiousdiseases are knowntocause developmental disabilities, including HaemophiliaMfluenzae type B andcongenitalrubella syndrome,a known cause of autism.Other known causes ofdevelopmental disabilitiesinclude nutritional deficiencies such as those of iodineand iron, and environmentalexposuresincluding lead andmercury. Autism and conditions related to autismrepresent some of themostserious of these developmental disabilities. Autism isa life-long disability characterized byimpairments in social interaction and communication anda pattern of restrictive,repetitive and 1 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 150 stereotypic behaviors, interests, and activities. The impact and burden of autism on children andtheir families is tremendous. Most children with autism require long term care and services,including special education and supervised care. Developmental disabilities are costly to society and to families. Local, state and federaleducation departments spent approximately $49.2 billion in the 1998-99 school year on specialeducation programs for children with developmental disabilities. The cost of special educationfor a child with autism is often more than $30,000 per year to the family and the community, andthe cost of residential care, which many of these children require, is $80,000 to $100,000 peryear. There is no cure for autism; however, recent studies suggest that early intense behavioralinterventions benefit some children with autism.VCDC's role in preventingdevelopmental,disabilities; includirtgAtulitrn,:i&to:d.etertninezthe scope;of the intervention programs: 'We dothis using the public health tools of population-basedsurveillance, epidemiologic investigations, and prevention programs. PREVALENCE OF AUTISMMuch attention has been focused on whether there is a higher rate of autism than previouslythought. Researchers conducted the first epidemiologic study of autism in England in 1966 andfound the autism rate in the general population to be 4 to 5 per 10,000 children. Other earlycommunity studies published also yielded prevalence rates in this range. In general, these studies 2 BEST ON AVAILABLE 151 defined autism usinga narrow set of criteriawhich included marked impairment in socialcontact and elaborate behaviors or mannerisms. Studies published since 1985 outside the UnitedStates reported higher prevalence rates than those prior to 1985, about 12 per10,000children,while a few very recent studies have found rates that are even higher. It is unclear why the more recent studies have yielded higher rates. However, we do know thatmore recent studies have used diagnostic criteria for autism which are considerably broader andincorporate the clinical recognition that the hallmark features for autism can occur in a widerange of severity levels and in many different manifestations. Clearly, a greater awareness andbetter recognition of this condition also have had an impact on the reported prevalence rates. There have been only two population-based prevalence studies ofautisin in the US.. Bothstudies were conducted in the 1980s =E:Yielded prevalence rates of 3Slitidchildren, which is lower than nioit European. studiet.7The U.S:_ studies: relieditin identification of ;,-;children with autism already knoWn to service providers whichmayaboountfor-thevelatively-low.prevalence rate. However, other U.S. data sources seem to support the idea that the prevalence of autism is higherthan previously thought. A recent report from the California Health and Human ServicesAgency examined the number of people with autism entering the California DevelopmentalServices system each year from 1987 to 1998 and showed an overall increase of 273%, withincreases every year since 1987. Services for all other developmental disabilities increased no 3 ST COPY AVAILABLE 152 more than 50% during this time period. The State of California has contracted with the MedicalInvestigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute of the University ofCalifornia at Davis to conduct a study to determine the factors accounting for the increasedcaseload of children with autism in California. Similarly, service provider data from the USDepartment of Education showed that the number of U.S. children with autism who receivedspecial education services increased 556% from 1991 through 1997. Chile we cannot be certain of the reason for changes in prevalence rate, some percentage of theincrease seems related to broadening of the definition of autism, changes in referral patterns,improved recognition and greater awareness of the condition. Other factors may involveeligibility and reporting requirements.for disability services, changes in population demographicsand patterns of migration. Genetic and ens irtaimental factors may also be contributing to anincrease in the number of Children with is nirededio better understand trends in autism rates as well as otherdevelopmental disabilities. -')CDC'S EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF AUTISMCDC is developing reliable estimates of the prevalence of autism. In 1998 we added autism toCDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP).This program also monitors the prevalence of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, visionimpairment, and hearing impairment among school-age children. MADDSP is the only ongoing 4 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 153 population-based study of multiple disabilities in school-age children in the United States.Information on children with developmental disabilities, including autism, is obtained by reviewof records from service providers in metropolitan Atlanta and identification of children withdevelopmental disabilities in the public school system. CDC expects to publish the results of thisfirst population-based prevalence study later this year. CDC is also funding Marshall Universityto begin a surveillance program for autism in six counties in West Virginia. CDC believespopulation-based surveillance for developmental disabilities is a critical element in preventingthis disorder. THE BRICK TOWNSHIP INVESTIGATIONMr. Chairman, beginning in early 1998, as you are probably aware, CDC and the Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) were contacted by the New Jersey Departmentof Health and Human Services,,ILS. Senator, Roberacirricelli,and LLS. Representatives.,Christopher Smith regarding thepossibility of fedendassistance in addressing issues raised bythe citizens of Brick Township, New. Jersey:. TheY tiote-concemed that the-turfibetinf childrenwith autism in Brick Township could be several times higher than expected based on availableU.S. prevalence rates for the disorder. CDC assistance was requested because of the complexityof investigating a behavioral disorder such as autism, and because of the fact that CDC wasdeveloping epidemiologic methods that address the unique challenges of autism. ATSDR'sexpertise was requested because community members felt that environmental factors related topotential hazardous waste sites might be involved. CDC investigators with expertise inpopulation-based studies of autism were responsible for the prevalence investigation. The 5 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 154 prevalence investigation identified children with possible autism spectrum disorders whoseparents were residents of Brick Township during 1998. The autism diagnosis was verifiedthrough a clinical assessment. ATSDR has conducted a scientific literature review to determinewhat is known about associations between chemical contaminants and autism. ATSDR has beenassessing potential exposure pathways for sources of environmental pollution in Brick Township,and also is assessing whether the potential exposure pathways could be associated with thehomes where children with autism lived. Specifically, three potential sources of environmentalpollution were identified: (1) the municipal drinking water supply, (2) the Metedeconk River,and (3) the Brick Township Landfill. Possible exposure pathways include recreational uses ofthe river where contaminants may have been discharged, as well as the use of the river as asource of drinking water supply.

We would--be pleased to brief interested Members or their staff on the results at the same time we makethem available to the affected community. CAUSES OF AUTISMThe cause of autism remains unknown for most children. Several studies support an underlyinggenetic mechanism for autism. Studies indicate that family members of individuals with autismalso are more likely than others to be diagnosed with the disorder. An identical twin of a child 6 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 155 with autism has a 75 to 90 percent chance of having autism as well. A fraternal twin of a childwith autism has a 5 to 10 percent chance of having autism. Similar genetic susceptibility mayextend to other developmental disabilities as well. Among families with autism there is a 10 to40 percent increase in the diagnosis of other developmental and learning disabilities, such aslanguage delays and learning disabilities. Autism tends to occur more frequently than expectedamong individuals with certain medical conditions such as Fragile X syndrome, untreatedphenylketonuria, congenital rubella syndrome, and certain seizure disorders. A scientific literature review has identified limited evidence that certain agents ingested bypregnant women such as lead, alcohol and the prescription drug thalidomide may cause autism intheir children. Such evidence, as well as prevailing theories about autism etiology, suggest thatevents during development in utero, especially in the earliest stages, play a substantial role in the:cause of autism.

BENEFITS OF VACCINESOne of the most effective, proven ways parents can protect their children from certain infectiousdiseases is to ensure they receive all of their recommended vaccines on schedule. The threatsposed by vaccine-preventable diseases are known and real. The viruses and bacteria that cause 7 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 161 156 vaccine-preventable diseases still circulate in the U.S. and around the world. High rates ofmeasles vaccination have protected U.S. children and communities from sustained outbreaks. In1998 and 1999, 16 measles outbreaks and 13 rubella outbreaks in the U.S. were reported to CDC.Measles is not a benign childhood illness. It can have serious complications, includingpneumonia, ear infections, brain damage, seizures and even death. A measles epidemic in theUnited States led to more than 55,000 cases of measles, more than 11,000 hospitalizations, andmore than 120 deaths in the three years from 1989 to 1991. Measles still accounts forapproximately 750,000 deaths each year globally, and congenital rubella syndrome results insevere disability or death for over 200,000 infants per year. Common manifestations ofcongenital rubella syndrome include deafness, blindness, heartdefects, and mental retardation.Continued high U.S. vaccination rates are crucial to prevent the spread of these diseases amongU.S. children_ Vaccinations protect individuals.and communities from diseases spread by.-person-to-person transmission.

A decision to not vaccinate places individuals and communities at-risk.- CDC'S MISSION TO ENSURE SAFE VACCINESThe public should expect that we will do all we can to deliver safe vaccines. While vaccines areamong the safest pharmacologic interventions for disease prevention available, no drug orvaccine is 100 percent without risk. Extensive pre-market studies of vaccine safety areconducted and carefully reviewed by FDA before a vaccine is licensed. Post-marketingevaluation of vaccine safety is also conducted. CDC and FDA have developed an infrastructure 8 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 157 to continue monitoring vaccine safety. This includes the Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem (VAERS), a nationwide, passive surveillance system that provides \"signals\" of potentialvaccine adverse events; and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, an active surveillance system that linksvaccination and health data from four large Health Maintenance Organizations and which can beanalyzed to assess whether an association exists between vaccination and an adverse event. Inaddition, targeted epidemiological studies using case-control or cohort methodologies are alsoconducted to investigate specific concerns. These methods have been used to further enhance the safety of the vaccination program.Examples of changes that have been made to improve the safety of the vaccination programinclude a shift from whole cell pertussis vaccines to a less reactogenic acellular vaccine; a changefrom oral to risk of intussusception,.afonnof bowel obstruction-0)1*g infantaThese examples demonstrate the commitment of CDC and partner agencies to assuring vaccinesafety and the flexibility of the program to respond to safety issues that have been scientificallydocumented. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE REGARDING VACCINES AND AUTISMCurrently available scientific evidence does not support a link between vaccination and autism orany other behavior disorder. This statement is based on the following synopsis of publisheddata:An initial observation linking autism and MMR vaccine was reported by Dr. Andrew9 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 158 Wakefield and colleagues, who had first attempted to link measles disease andvaccination to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Cr Ohn's Disease. Dr. Wakefieldsuggested that measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccination led to intestinalabnormalities, resulting in impaired intestinal function and developmental regressionwithin 24 hours to a few weeks of vaccination. This hypothesis, which suggested thatchildren developed autism shortly after receipt of MMR vaccine, was based on a case-series (a collection of patients with limited comparison or control groups) reporting datafrom 12 children. The Working Party on MMR. vaccine of the British Committee on Safety of Medicinesconducted a systematic review of reports of autism, gastrointestinal disease and similardisorders after receipt of MMR or measles/rubetla:(MR) vaccine. In 1999, the WorkingParty concluded that the information available noti4portithersuggested e.;association or give cause for concern about_theiafety,ofheintatAiltvaccinei\": i A study published in 1999 in The Lances by Dr. Brent Taylor and colleagues providespopulation-based evidence that overcomes a number of limitations that the Working Partyand the Wakefield group experienced. The authors identified all 498 known cases ofautism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children living in certain districts of London whowere born in 1979 or later and correlated the cases to an independent vaccination registry.The results of this study were: 10 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 159 1. The first diagnosis of autism or initial signs of behavioral regression were not morelikely to occur within time periods following MMR vaccination than during other timeperiods. 2. Despite an increase in the number of diagnosed ASD cases since 1979, no jumpoccurred after the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1988. Such a jump would havebeen expected if MMR was causing a substantial increase in autism causes, but this wasnot the case. 3. Children who were vaccinated before 18 months of age were diagnosed with autism atages similar to children who were vaccinated. after 18 months of age, indicating that thevaccination did.not result in earlier expression of ASD-characteristies..:, If MMR werecausing many autism cores, itwouldhavef.beetexiieded that childreilairiccinatisciat a.zyounger age would develop autism at a younger age than -children vinatedittOblerages, but this was not the case. 4. At age two, the MMR vaccination coverage rates among ASD cases were nearlyidentical to vaccination coverage rates of children in the same age group in the wholeregion, providing evidence of a lack of overall association between ASD and the MMRvaccination. If MMR was a major cause of autism, then it would have been expected thatcases of autism would be more likely to be vaccinated than the general population, butthis was not the case. 11 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 160 Another study, conducted by Dr. Christopher Gillberg and Dr. Harald Heijbel, alsoshowed no evidence of association between the MMR vaccine and autism. The studycompared autism prevalence rates in populations of children from two communities inSweden. The results indicated no difference in autism prevalence between children bornafter the introduction of the MMR vaccine in Sweden and those born before the vaccinewas used. The study was published in the journal Autism in 1998. At this time, the weight of scientific evidence does not support an association between MMR andautism. WHAT RESEARCH IS CDC CONDUCTING ON VACCINATION AND AUTISM?Many parents remain concerned that their child's autistic behaviors seemed to occur or to worsenshortly after vaccination.. Deipiti.the fact thavtii0Vailablitivittelice,:ini; balinite;40*ss not beat aciontifittnetlxidsitgallable: The &Menge Ofsafety research is to use scientifically sound methodologies to investigate uncommonevents and to distinguish events that would have occurred anyway even without vaccination fromthose that are truly causally related. One important ongoing CDC study is based on CDC's population-based autism surveillancesystem in metropolitan Atlanta one of few such surveillance systems in the world. The systembegan to identify cases of autism in 1998 among children between 3 and 10 years old in themetropolitan Atlanta area. Children with autism are identified through special education records12 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 161 of all area public schools and other sources. Capitalizing on this unique resource, CDC hasinitiated an epidemiologic study with the primary objective of evaluating the association betweenMMR vaccination and autism. The study will compare the vaccination histories of over 500children with autism and over 1500 control children matched on school, age, gender, and thechildren's schools. Data collection is nearing completion and the study results are expected laterthis year. In addition, CDC is working with the National Institutes of Health to develop a study that willevaluate whether vaccination is linked with developmental regression. These studies, and a CDCstudy of inflammatory bowel disease and MMR vaccination using the Vaccine Safety Datalink,demonstrate CDC's ongoing commitment to assuring the safety of the vaccination program. Given the balance of available scientific data ancl.the known seriouS onal Ongoing-risk of vaccinepreventable diseases, the best public health policy is to continue vaccination schedulesunchanged while we condone to monitor vaccine safety. This approach, we believe, is mosteffective in protecting the overall health of children and reflects the strategy of other countriessuch as the United Kingdom, which also has considered these questions. CONCLUSIONMr. Chairman, in the past 40 years, public health has made significant advances in preventingdevelopmental disabilities. Identification and prevention of congenital syphilis and congenitalrubella syndrome have spared the lives and prevented disabilities for thousands of children.Newborn screening programs have prevented life-long mental retardation and prolonged the lives13 BEST COPYAVAILABLE167) 162 of tens of thousands of children with metabolic disorders, stich as hypothyroidism, PKU, andsickle cell disease. However, even though this is good news, we still don't know the causes ofmost developmental disabilities, including autism. CDC agrees with the Committee that autismis a serious developmental disability that has a significant and profound impact on the lives ofnot only the child with the disorder, but also the child's family. We must develop a betterunderstanding of autism and its causes. We need to track this disorder, identify preventableCauses, and institute effective intervention programs. CDC is using available resources todevelop surveillance systems to collect information so that ive can better understand what ishappening with the prevalence rate over time. We must also conduct epidemiological studies tobegin to uncover the causes of this serious developmental disability. It is my hope that this work,combined with scientific investigations conducted by other federal agencies such as NM andwithin the academic community, will lead to identifying what causes autism, preventing thisdisorder, and enabling these, children to live full and productive lives. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, for the opportunity to testify beforeyou today about CDC's efforts to better understand and prevent this serious developmentaldisability. I am happy to answer any questions you might have. 14 163Dr. OFFIT. First, I would like to recognize the courage of the par- ents who have testified her today, as well as the two grandparents on the committee, including you, Mr. Chairman. As I share my tes- timony, I also deeply share their feelings and concerns. My name is Paul Offit. I am pediatrician, and I am also the chief of infectious diseases and the Hen le professor of immunologic and infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In addition, I am a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices to the CDC. I have 20 years of experience in the areas of vi- rology and immunology.My role in these proceedings is to explore the theories that havearisen due to concerns by the public that autism might be caused by the combination of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines known as MMR.No evidence exists which proves this association. However, three theories have been used to explain it. In the time that I have been given, I would like to explain why I think that these theories are not valid.The first theory is that children who get the measles vaccine make an immune response not only to the vaccine, but also to their own nervous system. This kind of reaction is called autoimmunity.To understand why this theory is invalid, we must first understand differences between natural measles infection and measles vaccina-tion.During natural measles infection, the measles virus reproducesitself many times in the body and causes disease. In contrast, fol- lowing measles vaccination, the vaccine virus reproduces itself much less and does not cause disease. Because more measles pro- teins are made during natural infection than after immunization,the immune response to natural infection is greater than the im- mune response to immunization. If the immune response is greaterafter natural infection, then the autoimmune response would also be greater. If this were the case, then autoimmunity should occur more frequently after natural infection than after vaccination. Or,said another way, if measles virus caused autism, then measlesvaccination would lower, not raise, the incidence of autism.The second theory is that the child's immune system is simplyoverwhelmed by seeing three viruses in a vaccine at the same time. Some have gone so far as to suggest that it may be of benefit to divide the MMR vaccine into three separate vaccines. The rationalebehind this theory is that children do not normally encounter such an assault on their immune system.From the birth canal and beyond, infants are confronted by a host of different challenges to their immune system. Their intes- tines encounter foreign proteins in milk and formula. Their lungsencounter bacteria inhaled on the surface of dust in the air. Andliterally thousands of different bacteria immediately start to live on the skin as well as on the lining of the nose, throat, and intestines. Here is how infants deal with this immediate confrontation totheir immune system. Babies have a tremendous capacity to re- spond to their environment from the minute they are born. The newborn has billions of immunologic cells which are capable of re- sponding to millions of different microorganisms. By quickly mak- 164ing an immune response to bacteria that live on the surface of theirintestines, babies keep these bacteria from invading their blood-stream and causing serious disease.Therefore, the combination of the three vaccines contained inMMR, or even the 10 vaccines given in the first 2 years of life, isliterally a raindrop in the ocean of what infants successfully en-counter in their environment every day.The third theory is that the MMR vaccine is given by an unnatu-ral route. The rationale behind this theory is that children do notnormally encounter viruses or bacteria under their skin or in theirmuscles. But infants and children frequently encounter viruses andbacteria in many places throughout the body. Our species survivesbecause from the minute we are born, we are capable of meetingchallenges at all sites.To review, here are the medical facts. First, if autism is a con-sequence of autoimmunity, the incidence of autism would have de-creased, not increased, after vaccination.Second, children from birth are confronted with and manage anenormous array of different challenges to their immune system atthe same time.Third, challenges to their immune system occur by a variety ofroutes.The parents we have heard testify here today are asking a sci-entific question: Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? Questions ofscience are best answered by scientific studies, and the answer tothis question is already available. Dr. Brent Taylor and his cowork-ers in London have conducted a large, meticulously designed, well-controlled study that disproves an association between MMR vac-cine and autism. I believe other studies will confirm Dr. Taylor'sresults, because it is important to have confirmatory studies.What is really at stake here? In the early 1990's, our immuniza-tion rates against measles dropped only about 10 percent. Measlesoutbreaks swept across the country. About 11,000 people were hos-pitalized, and 123 died from measlesdied from a disease which iseasily and safely prevented by a vaccine.My concern, Mr. Chairman, is that parents listening to or read-ing about this hearing might incorrectly conclude that vaccinescause autism. This is not the case. Vaccines are extremely safe andhighly effective. I encourage this committee to make that fact clearto every parent in America.If, as a result of reading about this hearing, some parents chooseto withhold or delay vaccines for their children, their tragedy couldbe profound. If many parents choose to withhold vaccines, the trag-edy all across America could be devastating.Let us proceed cautiously, carefully, and scientifically.Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you.Dr. Taylor.[The prepared 165Dr. Paul A. OffitTestimony toGovernment Reform CommitteeAutismPresent Challenges, Future Needs Why the Increased Rates?April 6, 2000 My name is Paul Offit.

I am also the co-author of a book entitled \"Vaccines: What Even' Parent ShouldKnow\". My expertise is in the areas of virology and immunology.In addition, 1 have been in collaboration with Merck and Co. on the developmentof a rotavirus vaccine since 1992. My interest in this project is to prevent rotavirusdisease. In developing countries rotavirus infections kill about 14 children every day. Infact, more children die every day from rotavirus infections than from any other singleinfectious disease. In the United States, about 1 out of every 75 children born will behospitalized with severe water loss (or dehydration) as a result of rotavirus infections. Wehope that by developing this vaccine we can prevent the severe disease and death causedby this virus.My role in these proceedings is to explore the theories that have arisen due toconcerns by the public that autism might be caused by the combination of measles,mumps, and rubella vaccines (known as MMR). No evidence exists that proves thisassociation. However, three theories have been used to explain it. In the time that I havebeen given, I would like to explain why I think that these theories are not valid. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 166 The first theory is that children who get the measles vaccine make an immuneresponse not only to the vaccine, but also to their own nervous system. This kind ofreaction is called autoimmunity. To understand why this theory is incorrect, we must firstunderstand differences between natural measles infection and measles vaccination.During natural measles infection, the measles virus reproduces itself many timesin the body and causes disease. In contrast, following measles vaccination, the vaccinevirus reproduces itself much less and doesn't cause disease. Because more measlesproteins are made during natural infection than after immunization, the immune responseto natural infection is greater than the immune response to immunization.If the immune response is greater after natural infection, then the autoimmuneresponse would also be greater. If this were the case, then autoimmunity should occurmore frequently after natural infection than after vaccination. Or, said another way, ifmeasles virus caused autism, measles vaccination would lower, not raise, the incidence ofautism.The second theory is that the child's immune system is simply overwhelmed byseeing three viruses in a vaccine at the same time. Some have gone so far as to suggestthat it may be of benefit to divide the MMR vaccine into three separate vaccines. Therationale behind this theory is that children do not normally encounter such an assault onthe immune system. However, this notion is incorrect.From the birth canal and beyond, infants are confronted by a host of differentchallenges to their immune system. Their intestines encounter foreign proteins in milkand formula. Their lungs encounter bacteria inhaled on the surface of dust in the air. Andliterally thousands of different bacteria immediately start to live on the skin, as well as on 167 the lining of the nose, throat, and intestines. So how does the infant deal with thisimmediate confrontation to their immune system?Babies have a tremendous capacity to respond to their environment from theminute they are born. The newborn has billions of immunologic cells that are capable ofresponding to millions of different microorganisms. By quickly making an immuneresponse to bacteria that live on the surface of their intestines, babies keep those bacteriafrom invading their bloodstream and causing serious disease. Therefore, the combinationof the three vaccines contained in MMR, or even the 10 vaccines given in the first 2 yearsof life, is literally a raindrop in the ocean of what infants successfully encounter in theirenvironment every day.Because the peak of some diseases (such as pertussis and Haemophilus influenzatype b) occurs in early infancy, it is important to make sure that children are fullyimmunized against these diseases by 6 months of age. This is easily accomplished. About95% of infants will develop protective antibodies following immunization because theirimmune systems are quite capable of responding to vaccines.The third theory is that the MMR vaccine is given by an unnatural route. Therationale behind this theory is that children normally inhale measles, mumps, or rubellaviruses carried on droplets from another person, and do not normally have virus injectedunder the skin. However, encountering viruses or bacteria under the skin or within themuscles does occur naturally. To meet this challenge, children have collections ofimmune cells in lymph glands located strategically throughout the body. For example,lymph glands are located behind the elbow and under the arm. Because our skin can becut, our bodies are ready to encounter challenges at any site. Indeed, although wondrous, 3 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 168 the birth process is quite traumatic. Newborns commonly have small cuts on the face andbody after passing through the birth canal. Because the birth canal is covered withbacteria, the child will encounter bacteria under the skin immediately. Our speciessurvives because, from the minute we are born, we are quite capable of meetingchallenges at all sites.To review, I have made three points that counter the plausibilitythat autism would be a consequence of the MMR vaccine, or, more importantly, anyvaccines:First, if autism is a consequence of autoimmunity, then the incidence of autismwould havedecreased,not increased, after vaccination.Second, children from birth are confronted with an enormous array of differentchallenges to their immune system at the same time.Third, challenges to their immune system occur by a variety of routes.These are medical facts.Parents testifying here today are asking a scientific question, \"Does the MMRvaccine cause autism?\" Questions of science are best answered by scientific studies. Andthe answer to this question is already available. Brent Taylor and his coworkers inLondon have conducted a large, meticulously designed, well-controlled study thatdisproved an association between MMR vaccine and autism. I believe other studies willconfirm Dr. Taylor's results.We also have to ask ourselves this question, \"What is really at stake here?\" In theearly 1990s our immunization rates against measles dropped only about 10%. When thathappened, measles outbreaks swept across the country. About 11,000 people were 4 169 hospitalized and 123 died from measles died from a disease that is easily and safelyprevented by a vaccine.My concern, and it should be the concern of this committee, Mr. Chairman, is thatsome parents listening to or reading about this hearing might incorrectly conclude thatvaccines cause autism. This is clearly not the casevaccines are extremely safe andhighly effective at preventing serious disease and death. I encourage this committee tomake that fact clear to every parent in America.If, as a result of reading about this hearing, some parents choose to withhold ordelay vaccines for their children, their tragedy could be profound. If many parents chooseto withhold vaccines, the tragedy all across America could be devastating.Let's proceed cautiously, carefully, and scientifically.Mr. Chairman, I am ready to respond to any questions the committee might have. 5 175 170Dr. TAYLOR. Hello. I am Brent Taylor: I am the professor of com-munity and child health at the Royal Free and University CollegeSchool of Medicine and the head of the Department of Pediatricsand Child Health on the Royal Free campus of University CollegeLondon.I am honored to have the opportunity, to testify today. I am hereas a clinical scientist, but I am also a practicing pediatrician. My clinical work involves children with disabilities including autism.I know how desperate families can be to understand the causeof their child's often devastating condition. I also know that if weare to avoid families being led astray by false hopes, advances in understanding and treatment must be based on high-quality andrigorous science.Mr. Wakefield and Professor O'Leary's testimony notwithstand-ing, the belief that MMR is the cause of autism is a false hope.I have four main points. We do not fully understand the reasonswhy autism has recently increased. We do know that there is noevidence that immunizations are involved.Second, there is no evidence that MMR vaccine causes autism.Third, there is no conspiracy to suppress information about theside effects of vaccinescompletely the reverse. Fourth, because ofpoor science, uptake of MMR vaccine has fallen to dangerously low levels in the United Kingdom, putting children's lives at risk froma resurgence of the damaging and occasionally killing of prevent- able diseases, measles, mumps, and rubella. The same thing couldhappen in the United States of America.If I could have the first overhead, please.Here are some figures from the United Kingdom. You can see atthe top, in the black closed circles, MMR uptake, which has fallenfrom about 90 percent in 1995 to 75 percent in April 1999. Thereis almost an exact parallel fallshown in the open circlesinmothers' confidence in the safety of MMR vaccine.Could we have the next overhead on top of this one, please?The reason for this loss of confidence relates mainly to two pa-pers produced by Mr. Wakefield and colleagues. The first, which in- correctly related measles vaccine to Crohn's disease, one form of in-flammatory bowel disease, has subsequently been completely un-dermined. There is no evidence that measles or measles vaccineplay any part in inflammatory bowel disease.The second arrow shows the timing of a paper produced by Mr.Wakefield and colleagues describing a small group of inadequatelydescribed children with a range of autism-related disorders.Following each of these papers, there was a major effect on moth-ers' confidence and a resultant further decline in MMR uptake.I will now discuss the results of an epidemiological study I ledto test Mr. Wakefield's hypothesis that MMR causes autism. Mytwoseniorcolleagues,Dr.ElizabethMiller and Dr.Patty Farrington, have submitted testimony to this committee with de-tails of our methods and the background of our study.We identified all known cases of autism-498 in totalliving adefined area of North London and compared details of the onsetand recognition of their condition with independently collected dataon exactly when they received MMR and other measles-containing vaccines. The study involved a large amount of work, and we ana- 171lyzed the data in considerable depth. There are lots of results which have been published in the Lancet.In summary, all of our analyses were negative. We concluded.that MMR vaccine is not causally related to autism. In particular,we looked at the clustering after MMR of regression where it oc-curred, the timing of parents' concern about the child's develop-ment, and the age at diagnosis. There were no significant relation-ships.Our results are supported by other studies from Sweden, fromFinland, and from France.Our particular interest in this hearing is the rise with time we identified from the late 1970's to 1992.Could we have the next overhead, please?Mr. Wakefield has compared our results with those reported inCalifornia. This is the overhead. It is important to remember thatthe authors of the California report clearly stated that theirs was not incidence data.The overhead, which is downloaded from the Lancet Web page, is of rather poor quality, and so is Mr. Wakefield's content. He hasfiddled with the data regarding the dates of the introduction of au- tism, and to demonstrate other problems he has with time relation-ships, it is worthwhile just looking at the bottom line, where it goes from 1987 to 1960 to 1990. What is actually going on?I have included two additional arrows, the red arrows, which per- haps more accurately identifies the acceleration in cases in the rates at which autism is increasing. These, one can see, occurredat least 2 years before autism was introduced into the United King-dom and at least 2 years after in Californiahardly a convincingcausal relationship.There is another problem for the MMR theory. Could we havethe next overhead, please?Here is our data from our study up until 1992, which is what we published. The rise in autism can be seen there as clearly occurringlong before MMR was introduced, and I must say, contrary to whatMr. Wakefield and some of the groups he is associated with say, that we included all cases in our analysis, including those involvedin the MMR Catch-Up Campaign.After 1992, the numbers fell. We did not include these data inour analysis because we felt that there might be too many missingcases not yet diagnosed, and by leaving the left-hand side, it reallygave the hypothesis that MMR causes autism the best chance ofbeing confirmed.The parallel line in red is data from two of the larger districts,and this is important, because we have preliminary data as part of the further study on the same population to see what has hap-pened. Is autism still going up, or is it flattening out?What our early results in these two districts showif we could have the final overheadis that rates are going down. There is an overall increase of numbers, reflecting continuing better recognitionof autism, and immigration. The fall is seen in both studies, sug- gesting it is a real fall. Cases appear in this population to havepeaked in about 1992, for reasons which are quite unclear.This finding alone must exclude MMR as a cause of autism.MMR had a rapid uptake in our population from 1988; then, rates 172plateaued, certainly until 1995, while autism rates were rising andthen falling.We need more research on autism and its treatment, but Mr.Chairman and members of the committee, present evidence doesnot support a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and au-tism. As a result of adverse publicity on this topic, many clients inthe UK are now at risk from the dangerous diseases of measles,mumps, and rubella. I urge this committee to strongly support thecontinued MMR program to avoid putting America children's livesat risk.As a result of my work and clear study of the evidence on thistopic, I believe I can say with confidence that MMR vaccine is nota cause of autism.[The prepared statement of Dr. Taylor follows:] 173Testimony to the Congress of the United States House ofRepresentatives Committee on Government ReformHearing on: \"The challenges of autism. Why the increased rates?\" Brent TaylorProfessor of Community Child HealthRoyal Free and University College Medical SchoolUniversity College London, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom 6 April 2000 IntroductionI am honoured to have the opportunity to speak today. I am here to testify mainly as a clinicalscientist but I am also a practising paediatrician and have been for over thirty years. Myclinical work mainly involves children with disabilities including autism and relatedconditions. I know the devastating impact autism can have on children and families and howdesperate families can be to identify the reason why their child developed the condition. The main thrust of my research activity over many years has been the identification of riskfactors in early life which might influence subsequent health and development in childhoodinto adult life and which can be altered, with implications for prevention. This is a complexarea of research. It is all too easy to draw simplistic conclusions from time relationships suchas the introduction of MMR vaccine and the apparent rise in the prevalence of autism. Such arelationship is most likely not to be causal but only an association. Statistical analysis,particularly in this area, needs careful interpretation. Four main points:I would like to make four main points in relation to the apparent rise in autism, particularly inrelation to the possible role of vaccines and immunizations:1.Recorded rates of autism have recently increased. This may reflect increased knowledgeabout the wide range of abilities of people with autism, with more professionals trainedand willing to recognise the condition, or may, at least in part, be real. Preliminary datafrom North London suggests that rates there may now be falling. There is no validscientific evidence that the change in rates relates to vaccines or to immunization. 1 BEST COPYAVAILABLE7-9 17412.There is no satisfactory evidence that MMR vaccine causes autism (or bowel disease).Parents whose children have autism can be reassured thht they did not cause their child'scondition by allowing him or her to be immunized.3.There is no conspiracy to suppress information about the side-effects of vaccines, indeedthe scientific community is looking very carefully and critically for adverse effects,4.Uptake of vaccines has fallen dangerously in the UK because of the publicity associatedwith poor science suggesting that there is a relationship between MMR vaccine andautism and/or inflammatory bowel disease. Supportive statements from influential bodieslike this committee could prevent the same thing happening in the USA Background:Vaccination and vaccine safety are issues of major concern to the public, their electedrepresentatives and all health care workers. I have recently undertaken, with colleagues fromthe UK's Public Health Laboratory Service and the Open University, a study of the possiblerelationship between MMR vaccine and the onset of autism in North East London. This workhas been funded by the UK's Medicines Control Agency, a body charged with assessing thesafety of products used for medical treatments, and linked to the Department of Health. The stimulus to this work was the hypothesis by Wakefield and colleagues that MMRvaccination might be causally linked with autism. They had found such a relationship in eightof twelve children with autistic conditions investigated because of associated bowelsymptoms. Their group of children has never been adequately described and seems veryunlikely to be a representative sample of children with autism. The authors stated in theirpaper that they had not proved a causal association but the resultant media attention resultingfrom this work, and earlier work from the same investigators suggesting an associationbetween measles-containing vaccines and inflammatory bowel disease (work not confirmedin their subsequent studies, or by anyone else, anywhere), has had a dramatic effect on publicconfidence in MMR vaccine and on immunisation uptake as demonstrated in figure 1. Epidemiological study investigating the relationship between MMR vaccination and theonset of autism: I will now describe our study which has been published in The Lancet (12June 1999). We identified all known children with autistic spectrum disorder, a total of 498individuals up to 19 years old, in the population of North East London. We examined theirmedical records recording the age at which the parents became concerned about the child's 2 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 175 development, the age at which the diagnosis of autism was made and, in the third of caseswhere it was a feature, the age at which the child's development regressed. We compared thisinformation which was recorded before the recent concern about immunization, withindependently collected data on exactly when the child received MMR vaccine or othermeasles-containing vaccines. Thus this was a properly conducted population-basedepidemiological study. We undertook four main analyses. The most direct assessment, and therefore our mostimportant result, was that there was no clustering of development regression in the monthsafter vaccination, no increased likelihood of autism diagnosis within one or two years aftervaccination and, with a single statistical blip to be explained later in this paper, no increasedlikelihood of parental concern within six or twelve months of vaccination. Other negative results included no difference between the age at diagnosis in vaccinated andunvaccinated children with autism, closely similar MMR uptake in the children with autismand in the general population (Figure 2), and no change in time-trend, that is no step up in thenumbers of cases identified with autism, when the MMR vaccine was introduced to the UK inOctober 1988; this lack of effect from MMR is shown in Figure 3 Our study has been criticised by a few individuals and groups who still believe that MMRcauses autism. It has been suggested that we failed to consider older children who wereimmunised as part of the catch-up programme when the MMR vaccine was introduced. Thisis not so. We identified all 36 such children with autism in our study who received MMR.Age at parental concern about the child's development was recorded in 29 of these. In all 29cases the parents were concerned before the child was vaccinated. Apparent rise in the prevalence of autism:Of major interest to this hearing is the identification in our study of an apparent markedincrease in the numbers of children with autism by year of birth. We believe this partly, atleast, reflects increased recognition and better recording of individuals with the condition. Weused current disability registers, many now computerised, to identify the children. Theseregisters have undergone considerable development over recent years but tend to concentrateon younger children. Thus older children with autism, many of whom are educated awayfrom their normal place of residence and who may not be-known to local services, might not3 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 176 be recognised by such a study. Thus identification of cases in our published study is unlikelyto be complete but this will not have affected our results regarding MMR vaccination. The increase we described matches the recent increase in the number of cases with autisticspectrum disorder identified in California. Wakefield has compared our results with theCalifornia study and has suggested that the rise in both parts of the world coincided with theintroduction of MMR. Figure 4 shows his graph. I have inserted two other arrows whichmore accurately identify the time of the apparent increase in autism; three years after theintroduction of MMR in California and two years before the introduction of MMR in theUnited Kingdomhardly a convincing causal relationship. In general little can be learnedabout possible causality by comparing such time-relationships which are likely to be onlycoincidenceswith many alternative-possible explanations as well as the one the enthusiastis promoting. More direct investigation is required such as the study we conducted. Statistical artifacts:Wakefield and groups he is associated with have made much of a marginal positive statisticalassociation in our paper relating parental concern with MMR vaccination within six months.This was one of 14 such analyses and with so many analyses one might have expected apositive statistical association by chance. We have considered this single positive result ingreat detail and consider it to be a statistical artifact reflecting the tendency for parents whenrecalling symptoms many months after the event to round up to twelve months, eighteenmonths, twenty-four months and the like. This is shown in figure 5 which also shows that theaverage age for MMR vaccination was 13 months. A positive association was only seen for the particular interval, 13 months and 18 months. Itdid not occur, for example, if the child received MMR vaccine at 14 months with parentalconcern at 19 months. No biological process can be so time-specific. It was not seen withother measles-containing vaccines because these earlier vaccinations were given over a widertime range than MMR so the co-incidental time-relationship of vaccination at 13 months andparental concern at 18 months could not occur. MMR vaccine is given in the second year oflife which is the age when symptoms of autism often become manifest. The relationship is astatistical associationa co-incidence, not a causal relationship. 4 82EST COPYAVAILABLE 177 Californian report not an incidence study:The report by the Department of Developmental Services in California clearly stated thattheirs was not an incidence study. \"The quality and type of information examined in thisreport were not suitable for measuring incidences in the population of persons with autism.Ascertaining the incidence of autism and the other PDDs will require carefully controlledresearch... Speculation about the rise in numbers is abundant, but such speculation is notbased on scientificresearch\". Our UK study is consistent with an increase in the incidence ofautism in recent birth cohorts up until 1992. That increase may be real or mainly a reflectionof other factors such as better recording and case identification arrangements in recent years.However, whether real or artifactual, the trend in increasing incidence with successive birthcohorts to 1992 was not related to the introduction of MMR vaccine or to vaccine coverage,which reached a plateau during the period in which autism incidence was apparentlyincreasing. Recent preliminary evidence that rates of autism are now falling:Our Lancet paper used data up until 1992 although we collected data up until the end of 1997.We selected 1992 as a cut-off to provide the best possible chance to confirm the hypothesisthat MMR was the cause of autism. We could not do so. Additional, unpublished data fromour study, shown in figure 6, showed a subsequent marked decline in the number of identifiedcases with autism. We thought this might reflect delays in diagnosis inherent to the disorders.However we are in the process of repeating our prevalence study in the same population andpreliminary results in a sample of districts suggest that the peak about 1992 has beenfollowed by a real decline in cases by year of birth as shown in figure 7. These findingsexclude a causal influence from MMR or any other vaccine as coverage has been stable whilerates of autism have climbed and are now going down. It is hard to see how one could causethe other. Independent support for and validation of our results:Our published results confirm and extend studies from Sweden (Gilberg and Heijbel. Autism1998; 2: 423-424) and Finland Lancet 351: 1327-8), both of whichdemonstrated no relationship between MMR vaccination and autism. Other reports havefound no link between measles infections, or their rare complications, and autism; nor hasinflanunatory bowel disease been associated with autism in epidemiological studies(Fombonne E. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 1999; 29: 349-350). There5 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 178 was no evidence that MMR vaccination led to inflammatory bowel disease in the continuing,large, Finnish study by Peltola and colleagues mentioned above, which was established toassess the long-term efficacy and safety of MMR. Conclusions:Possible adverse reactions to vaccines have a particular attraction to various pressure groupsand to the media with important and possibly catastrophic effects on public confidence inimmunization and on vaccine uptake. Present evidence does not support a causal relationshipbetween MMR vaccine and autism. As a result of adverse publicity on this topic manychildren are now at risk of these damaging and occasionally fatal diseases. I urge thisCommittee to support strongly the continued MMR vaccination program. I certainly supportthe need for further work on identifying the cause or causes of autism, which remains elusive,and on better treatments for this often disabling group of disorders. However as a result of mywork I believe I can say with confidence, that whatever causes autism, it is not MMR. 6 179 IBD paper 90Autism paper 80 of mother's confidentabout MMR Figure 1: MMR uptake at 16 months and proportion of mothers believing incomplete or almost complete safety of MMR vaccine.

This finding is not compatible with any effect from MMR vaccine becauseuptake of MMR rose rapidly from it's introduction in 1988 and has since remainedsteady, while recorded cases of autism rose and fell over the same period (for reasonsthat are quite unclear). 191. 186Mr.BURTON. Iwant to thank the panel. We will now go to ourquestions.Dr. Offit, you talk about collaboration, I guess, with the MerckPharmaceutical Co.?Dr.OFFIT.Yes. As I disclosed in my written report, I have beenin collaboration with Merck and Company on the development ofa rotavirus vaccine since 1992.Mr.BURTON.Do you do any traveling around, speaking on behalfof Merck or Merck products?Dr.OFFIT. Itravel and speak about vaccines, and those talks aresupported by unrestricted educational grants from either pharma-ceutical companies or from universities.Mr.BURTON.So they pay for your expenses and that sort ofthing?Dr.OFFIT.They have an interest in educating physicians aboutvaccines, and it is good that they do, because physicians need tobe educated about vaccines.Mr.BURTON. Iunderstand. And they produce the MMR vaccine,don't they?Dr.OFFIT.Yes, they do, yes.Mr.BURTON.Thank you.Dr. Taylor, in your Lancet paper, you omitted to mention theCatch-Up Campaign. That is the vaccination of children over 1 yearof age when the vaccination was introduced. Yet you appear tohave included these Catch-Up children in your analysis of the step-up hypothesis. So you consider that to be methodologicallydo youthink that is a correct analysis?Dr.TAYLOR.Basically, that statement is not true, Mr. Chairman.We did include the children involved in the Catch-Up Campaign inour analysis, as is clearly stated. To suggest otherwiseand I sus- pect the suggestion comes from Mr. Wakefieldis malicious.Mr.BURTON.Well, was it includedwas it not omitted in theoriginal paper that you submitted?Dr.TAYLOR.No. All cases were included who received MMR vac-cine. All caseswe will submit additional analysis with all caseswho received any measles-containing vaccine---Mr.BURTON.Didn't some of those 36 children receive the MMRvaccine after the---Dr.TAYLOR. Ithink what you are referring to is the reply whichwe put to Mr. Wakefield's criticism of our paper in the Lancet. Ihave to say that his is the only criticism of our paper which wehave received on a scientific basis. All other reports have been con-structive and supportive.Mr.BURTON.WellDr.TAYLOR.What we looked for there were the children who hadreceived MMR vaccine, which we had included in our analysis.There were 36 such children, and in 29 of them, there was evidenceregarding when the parents became concerned about their child'sdevelopment. In all cases, this was before they received the MMRvaccine.Mr.BURTON.We have an epidemiologist in the audience, andwhere is he?Would you mind coming up? I would like to have you sworn inreal quickly. 187Dr. SPITZER. Yes.[Witness sworn.]Mr. BURTON. Thankyou.Can you explain the importance of properly counting these chil- dren born before 1988 whowere given the Catch-Up vaccines?STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER 0. SPITZER, PROFESSOR EMERI- TUS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, MCGILL UNIVERSITY, AND MEM- BER, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, CORPUS CHRISTI, TXDr. SPITZER. Well,as implied by ProfessorMr. WAXMAN. Point of order, Mr. Chairman. Point of order, if you will suspendyour answer to that question. I want to make a point of order.Mr. BURTON. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. WAXMAN. The rules of this committee require that \"Wit- nesses appearing before the committee shall, so far as practicable, submit written statements at least 24 hours before theirappear- ance, and, when appearing in a nongovernmental capacity, provide a curriculum vitae and a listing of any Federal Government grants and contracts received in the previous fiscal year. Identification of witnesses are to be provided to members of the committee.\" Suddenly, we have a witness being called forward, and Rule 2 says \"Every member of the committee or the appropriate sub- committee, unless prevented by unusual circumstances, shall .be provided with a memorandum at least 3 calendar days before each meeting or hearing explaining 1) the purpose of the meeting or the hearing, 2) the names, titles, background and reason for appear- ance of any witness. The ranking minority member shall be respon- sible for providing thesame information on witnesses whom theminority requests.\"Suddenly, we have a witness being called forward. We have all of these people testifying, andwe have now a witness coming upI do not know who he is. It just seems to me that this is in viola- tion of the rules.Mr. BURTON. I thinkas you were reading there, where there are \"unusual circumstances\"and I believe you can go back and read that againor whenever \"practicable\" was another term that was used in thereso the chairexcuse me, let us suspend for one mo- ment. [Pause.]Mr. WAXIVIAN. Mr. Chairman, if I might be heard Mr. BURTON. NoMr. WAXMAN [continuing]. And I am going to withdraw my point of orderbut I do want tosay that there are procedures for theconduct of hearings which provide for opportunities for all points of view to be expressed. And for a witness to be brought out of the audience because the witnesses before you did not give you testi- mony that fit with your preconceived. theory seems to me to turn a congressional hearing more into a circus than a genuine fact-find- ing opportunity.But I will not object ifyou want to call this witness. I do wantto also point out that we have rules on the time allocated to mem- bers, and I would insist that that time be observed or that all members be given thesame open-endedness that I see about to 1,88come in your questioning, hecause the clock that usually keepstime for our questioning has been deliberately stopped.I will not object, but I do 'think it is inconsistent with the rulesof this committee to bring witnesses out of the audience when youhave a panel here that just testified, with whom we ought to pur-sue our questions.Mr. BURTON. The parliamentarian has just informed me thatwhere there are extenuating circumstances, the chair has the abil-ity to bring a witness forwardand this is not the first time thishas happened.[Applause.]Mr. BURTON. That is the first thing. The second thing is that thisis one of the most important hearings I think we have had, becausewe are talking about an epidemic of autism that is taking place inthis country, and if there is information that is being given to thecommittee that is going to be in the Congressional Record that isnot accurate, it needs to be corrected as quickly as possible so theAmerican people and people from around the world who may wantto look at the record of this committee have the facts.Now, if we have an epidemiologist here who has expertise abouta report and can cite that information about this report wherethere might be an error, then we ought to correct it right now, in-stead of waiting until a report is filed, goes out to the Americanpeople, and then try to correct it where there might be a misunder-standing. SoMr. WAXMAN. Well, we do have an epidemiologist on this panel,and perhaps you ought to question her, or this other witnessshould have been asked to testify. No one would have objected tohaving anybody who had anything pertinent to say to us to havean opportunity to present what they have to say.Mr. Chairman, let us proceed, and let us keep the rules on time,or acknowledge the open-endedness of questions, because we willhave a lot of questions as well.Mr. BURTON. Dr. Spitzer.Dr. SPITZER. Very briefly, Congressman Waxman, your points arewell-taken, and I respect them. I will say now to Professor Taylorthat those additional cases in the Catch-Up Campaign may wellhave been included in the paper but were not clearly segregated oridentified or enabled peers to evaluate the possible impact of in-cluding them or not, so the findings may have been misleadinguntil we reanalyze them taking that into account.Moreover, the use of the case series strategy of analysis is uncon-ventional, not accepted by mainstream scientists, and leaves thepaper at best as a hypothesis-generating study and not somethingwith which he or anyone can categorically say this proves thatthere is no relationship. It just shows and emphasizes what he saidhimself, that we need to study it further.So we have a compelling reason to have a blue panel, an inter-national panel, to go back to that data base, look at the raw data,and be able to come up with a second assessment that is verifiableby the scientific community and the relevant community.Thank you, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much.Mr. TIERNEY. Point of order, Mr. Chairman.j-94 189Dr. TAYLOR. Mr. chairman, can I comment on that?Mr. BURTON. Stop the clock.The gentleman will state his point of order.Mr. TIERNEY. Is Mr. Taylor going to be given an opportunity torespond at this point intitime?Dr. TAYLOR. May I comment?Mr. TIERNEY. I think it might be helpful to those of us who aresort of surprised by this new witness. I would like to hear what Mr.Taylor has to say in response to that. I think it would be edu-cational.Mr. BURTON. I have no objection to him responding, but I havesome more questions of Dr. Wakefield, so--Mr. TIERNEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, my point of order is can we have them nearer in time to each other so we can get the full bene-fit of it, rather than go back and forth.Mr. BURTON. I will yield to the gentleman next. He can have thetime next, or Mr. Waxman can, and he can yield to Dr. Taylor.Dr. Wakefield, would you come back up, please? Dr. Wakefield,would you clarify the difference of opinion that you have from yourcolleague?Dr. Wakefield. My anxiety, Mr. Chairman, is that if you test a step-up hypothesisthat is, those children who should be the firstto receive the vaccine at the age of 1 year, born in 1987, becausethe vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988, and therefore theywould have been 1 year old, then the take-off, if there were a rela-tionship between MMR and the vaccine, should have occurred atthat point.The paper illustrated the point that the take-off occurred beforethose born in .1985 and 1986. What took place when the MMR wasintroduced was the Catch-Up Campaign, where all children of 1 to4 years of age were targeted. It was an aggressive campaignIknow that, because one of the authors on the paper that we pub-lished in the Lancet was in charge of that campaign for Hackmeyin Northeast London. If you give the vaccine to children over theage of 2, then it will cause the take-off to occur before 1987, andthat is exactly what occurred.Now, at the very least, those cases should have been mentioned,because the reviewers, in the absence of those data, cannot give a valid interpretation of the paper when they make a recommenda-tion for it to be published or not, and they should have been ex-cluded from the analysis so we could see how the graph lookedwithout them, and that did not occur, and that is a major anxiety.Mr. BURTON. Dr. Taylor, do you want to respond now?Dr. TAYLOR. It does seem slightly surprising that at one moment,we are accused of excluding them and therefore that upsets the re-sults, and now we are accused of including them, and that upsetsthe results.I have to say the time relationships, the step-up part of ourpaper is the least important part of our findings. The direct find-ings, the time series analysis, is much more important, which isthe direct evidence that the individual children did not developsymptoms of autism within various defined periods after they re-ceived the MMR vaccine.19S69-622D-01--7 190If I could just comment on Dr. Spit zg.r's comment, he describesour analysis as unorthodox. We used the highest standards of epi-demiological and statistical analysis in pur handling of this data,and this data has been reviewed by numerous experts, both priorto publication- and since. to Last week, our research was the basis of a detailed debate at theRoyal Statistical Society, where there was no criticism of the statis-tical techniques that we used, and the conclusions of our paperwere accepted by this very expert group.The testimony which you received from Dr. Elizabeth Miller, whois an epidemiologist, and Dr. Patty Farrington, who is an expertstatistician, is tabled for the committee's consideration.Mr. BURTON. Would you mind, since there is a strong differenceof opinion between you and Dr. Wakefield, and I presume someothers, providing the data for your study to the committee, thecomplete data?Dr. TAYLOR. I will have to take advice on that from both my col-leagues and the others. I would be required to decide whether thecommittee is an appropriate body for this information, which wascollected, as you know, by the Medicines Control Agency, which isa branch of the Department of Health in the UK. In principle, Ihave no problem, but in practice, I would need to checkMr. BURTON. Well,, we would be very happy to write to the De-partment of Health in the UK and ask that you be able to releasethat information to the committee in total so that we could havesomebody who is totally nonbiased, hopefully, on this issue to ana-lyze it.Dr. TAYLOR. Yes. I think it would need to be done by more thana selected statistician. If it is to be reanalyzed, it should be reana-lyzed by independent individualswhich, of course, is the problemwith much of Mr. Wakefield's research, that it has never been inde-pendently verified. No one anywhere in the world has been able toreproduce any of his studies, and it seems possible, and it is onlygoing to be a matter of time before this most recent information isalso found to be inadequate.Mr. BURTON. Well, my time has expired, but let me just say thatI believe that Dr. Wakefield and Professor O'Leary and otherswould be willing to give us the documentation in the study thatthey did, and we would like to have yours as well so we can lookat all of that.Mr. Waxman.Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, because I believe autism is such aserious problem, I am troubled by this hearing. This hearing wascalled and structured to establish a point of view, and it is thepoint of view of the chairman. The chairman believes a particularpoint of view, and that is the connection between autism and vac-cinations.You can look at it by the first panel, where we had five parents,all of whom believed the same thing that the chairman believed,and the way we just had the handling of the questions a minuteago.What also bothered me was when we asked that we have theAmerican Medical Association or the American Public Health Asso-ciation or the National Network for Immunization Information or 191the former Secretary of HHS, Dr. Louis Sullivanreal experts inaddition to those we have before uswe were told no, they cannotfit in.I think hearings like this have a real danger because if you sen-sationalize the idea that there is a connection between immuniza-tion and autism, immunization rates will drop. That is what hap-pened in Great Britain after Dr. Wakefield published his firststudy. Immunizations dropped. Autism rates did not drop, but mea-sles rates increased.I was impressed by the statement that we had a drop of just 10percent in measles immunizations in 1990, and then we had 11,000people hospitalized from measles. This can cause brain retardationand death. We know we can prevent that. Why should we thenscare people about immunizations until we know the facts?I fear that what we have in this hearing is a sensationalizationby the chairman in order to get all these cameras to report to theAmerican people that there is this connection because he believesit, and many other people believe it, and therefore a lot of otherswho watch this will think, \"I will not immunize my children.\"Dr. Wakefield came out with a report in England, and the firstgroup that examined his claims was the Medical Research Council,which is the British equivalent of the. NIH, and they found no evi-dence to indicate any link between the MMR vaccine and boweldisease and autism.After they did their work, the Chief Medical Officer of the UnitedKingdom issued a letter to doctors in 1998, stating, \"Based on theprevious material that I have seen and on the opinion of expertspresent at the Medical Research Council, I have concluded there isno link between measles, measles vaccine, or MMR immunization,\"etc.Then, the World Health Organization looked at his study, andthey came up with the following statement: \"Given our view, theprevious scientific claims made by Dr. Wakefield and colleagueslack scientific credibility, and his present study does not meet therequirements for establishing such a causal relationship.\"I do not know whether that is true or not, but that is what thescientists in England said when they evaluated it, as did Dr. Taylorwhen he evaluated Dr. Wakefield's study.Now, Dr. Wakefield has testified he has some new information.Fine. Let us get the new information out there. Let us let the epi-demiologists evaluate it. Let us let scientists explore where thetruth may be. But to put this out in a congressional hearing andscare people from getting immunizationswe know that withoutimmunizations, dreaded diseases will occur, deaths and mental re-tardation and disability will occur among our children, and we canprevent that.What we do not know, and we have a lot of information to thecontrary, is that autism will result from that immunization.Dr. Taylorwell, let me ask Dr. Boyle. You are an epidemiolo-gist. Suddenly, we had to pull out of the audience an epidemiolo-gist. But you are an epidemiologist. What do you have to say aboutthis debate that we are seeing back and forth? Have you evaluatedany of this information that is now being presented as if it werefact?197 192MS. BOYLE. I think that the scientific data currently does notshow an association between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wehave heard from Dr. Taylor. We also know that there is a study in Sweden by Dr. Gilberg and associates, who have been monitor-ingSweden is actually the only country that has been monitoringthe rate of autism over timeand they looked at pre-MMR immu-nizations and post-MMR immunizations and found no changes in the rates of autism.Mr. WAXMAN. Well, I cannot tell you what is true or not, but I do not think our chairman can tell you what is true or not either, and I feel that when we had the hearings on whether there were campaign abuses by Democrats, a lot of people's reputations were ruined, and I thought the hearings were unfair. But those were po- litical. The consequences of an unfair hearing on autism connected to vaccinations can cause people to die, and I worry about that, andI think we should get the facts before we make the assertions and not make the assertions and then throw out the witnesses who tellus information that does not fit those allegations.I yield back the balance of my time.Mr. BURTON. The gentleman's time has expired.Does the gentlelady from Florida wish to question the panel?Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and Ithank you for holding this hearing.Rather than asking questions, because I am needed for a caucus in my other subcommittee, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, forholding this important hearing and for highlighting the need forfurther research as we explore the possible causes, interventions, strategies, counseling and other services to help families who are living with autism. We need to keep in mind that a person with autism is indeed a person first and not a behavior.These posters, which I would like to have the audience and thepanelists see, show constituents from my Congressional District,Bonnie and Willis Flick, two beautiful children in my district who are living with autism, and, indeed, the whole family lives with au-tism.Bonnie and Willis are fortunate to be able to afford treatmentand therapy, but so many other families are not as fortunate.So I thank you for the opportunity to hear from researchers andfrom parents and people who cope daily with this disease, and Icommend you for your initiative, Mr. Chairman, in seeking an- swers to help those individuals with autism and for the opportunityto learn from experts and researchers.I especially want to thank you for allowing Dr. Cathy Pratt, thedirector of the Indiana Resource Center for Autism to come todayand share her expertise on what we as policymakers can do to helpfamilies deal with autism.Approximately 50 percent of Florida's children with autism re-side in my community in south Florida, so I am delighted to haveyou take this leadership role, Mr. Chairman, and have your com-mittee address this issue so that 1 day, we can find prevention andmethods and a cure to help us all cope with this rising curse of au-tism.I thank you .very much, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Will the gentlelady yield to me? 193Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Yes, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. Let me just ask Dr. Wakefield, because I want toconclude with this panel and move onwould you be willing to giveus all of the information on your study so it can be reviewed?Dr. WAKEFIELD. Certainly.Mr. BURTON. You will?Dr. WAKEFIELD. Yes.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much.Professor O'Leary, would you be willing to give us all the infor-mation on your study so that we can review it?Dr. O'LEARY. Yes, sir; no problem.Mr. BURTON. I cannot hear you.Dr. O'LEARY. Yes, sir.Mr. BURTON. OK.Dr. Singh, would you be willing to give us all the information onyour study so we can review it thoroughly?Mr. SINGH. Yes, absolutely, without any hesitation.Mr. Chairman, if there is a moment, if I may have a chance, Iwould like to raise some interesting points later on.Mr. BURTON. Yes, but just 1 second.Mr. SINGH. Yes. Thank you very much.Mr. BURTON. Now, then, Dr. Taylor, will you give us all the infor-mation on your study so we can review it along with the others?Dr. TAYLOR. In principle, I have no problem, but I would needto discuss that with my employing authority, University CollegeLondon, and with the Department of Health, who funded thisstudy.Mr. BURTON. Who funded your study, Dr. Wakefield?Dr. WAKEFIELD. We did. We have a small charitable contribution,butMr. BURTON. A charitable organization did; I see.Dr. WAKEFIELD. We found it a little difficult to get fundingMr. BURTON. And yours was done by the Government?Dr. TAYLOR. It was funded by the Medicine Control Agency,which is the body charged with responsibility for the safety of vac-cines and other treatments.Mr. BURTON. Well, I would be happy to work with the rankingDemocrat, Mr. Waxman, to get an independent group of doctors/sci-entists that we mutually agree upon to review all of your work tocome to some kind of a conclusion if that is possible.So, since Dr. Wakefield and Professor O'Leary and Dr. Singhhave all agreed, we would sure like to have yours, and I will behappy to write a letter, as I said before, to the authorities in Eng-land asking for your report, and hopefully, we will get that alongwith the others so we can review them side-by-side.Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, on that pointand I want to agreewith you.Mr. BURTON. Sure. Mr. Waxman.Mr. WAXMAN. I drafted a letter, and I am going to share it withyou, and I hope you will join with me on this letter to SecretaryShalala. We say in this letter: \"Because of the vital public healthimportance of childhood immunization as well as the growing con-cerns over the prevalence of autism in the United States, we urgeyou to convene, under the auspices of the National Institutes of 194Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and theFood and Drug Administration, an expert panel of leading sci-entists and clinicians to review whether there is any causal asso-ciation between vaccines and autism. Given the grave possibilitythat immunizations against life-threatening childhood diseasesmay decline is a result of unsubstantiated allegation of vaccine-in-duced autism, I would want her to act as expeditiously as possible.\"Perhaps you will join me in this letter because I think the onlyproper thing to do is to get the experts to evaluate all of these con-flicting claims. I would not want the American people as a resultof this hearing to stop being immunized if these claims are notMr. BURTON. Let me reclaim my time and say nor would I, butone of the concernsthe time is right there; it is on the clockletme just say that the Department of Health and Human Servicesand Donna Shalala and the others have some very competent peo-ple over there. We have been checking into all the financial recordsof the people at FDA, HHS, and CDC, and we are finding thatsome of those people, even on the advisory panels, do have somepossible financial conflicts, as was expressed in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine just recently, on their front page.As a result, I will join with you to get an independent panel toreview all of these studies, but I want to make sure they are notcontrolled by the health agencies of this country that may havesome people who have some possible conflicts of interest. It has al-ready been expressed in the New England Journal of Medicine, andwe believe that that also possibly exists with some of the agenciesof our health services here in the United States. So I will join withyou, and we will pick them together, and we will try to make surethat we have some people who are totally unbiased.Mr. WAXMAN. Well, \"independent\" means no conflict of interest.I would not want a panel that had people with a conflict of interest,but I do want a panel of experts, and I think that the NIH andthe CDC and the FDA can give us a panel that can do this evalua-tion. [Laughter.]I do not know why some people find that amusing, but IthinkMr. BURTON. So long as we find there is no conflict of interest,we would not have any problem with that.Mr. Tierney.Mr. TIERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I have to say that I am a bit disturbed with the nature of thishearing and the direction that it has gone, only because I have aconsiderable number of people in my district who have not onlychildren with autism, and they deal with it every day, but we havea number of institutions that have been working hard to give peo-ple the kind of support they need to deal with this situation, andI find this hearing taking on a lot different tone than a hearingthat would like to look at some solutions and work together in acooperative way to find out just what we can do.I do note that Representative Michael Bilirakis from Florida hassome legislation filed, and one of the provisions would authorizefunding for the NIH to establish Centers of Excellence that wouldconduct basic and clinical research into the causes, diagnosis, de-tection, prevention and treatment of autism. I congratulate the 195members of this panel who are cosponsors on that legislation andhope that that is the direction in which we will proceed, becauseI think we need to find out what the causes are.First, Dr. Boyle, you are an epidemiologist. Given your back-ground, have you examined the evidence that autism is increasingin the United States?Ms. BOYLE. We do know that the rates of autism appear to behigher than previously thought. As I said in my testimony, theyrange from 10 to 15 per 10,000. But that is really from studiesfrom other countries. We have not had prevalence studies con-ducted in the United States. There were two done in the eightiesthat found very low rates, with perhaps methodologic reasons forthat.At CDC, we have begun to develop a monitoring program at CDCwhich is only for the Atlanta area. We have our first year of datacollected, and we are in the process of reviewing the informationon the children with autism, and we hope to have a rate fairlysoon. And we would like to see similar activities in many other lo-cations. We have a wonderful model on birth defects. They aremany years ahead of us in terms of trying to understand the causesof birth defects, and there are about 35 States that monitor birthdefects on an ongoing basis. That does not happen for develop-mental disabilities, and we need to make that happen.Mr. TIERNEY. There are people in my district, particularly in theMerrimac Valley area, who seem to have at least acknowledged anincreased number of reported cases, if not of autism itself, of oneof the related diagnoses. Have you heard ofMs. BOYLE. It is a difficult issue because the diagnosis for autismhas changed considerably. The first studies were based on fairlynarrow criteria from the way it was originally described. The morerecent studies have actually used criteria that are much broader,and there is increased recognition. So we really do not know. Therehave been a number of investigators who have tried to see whetherthe increase in rates over time, or the higher rates in more recentyears, is really due to a real increase or sort of a redefinition and'better awareness. It is not an easy question to answer.Mr. TIERNEY. I bring that up only because in one instance, atleast, a group of very active parents of children with autismworked with the school system and some other researchers andheightened the awareness of identification and found a marked in-crease in the number of cases that were beginning to be identifiedin the area, so people had not really appreciated these symptoms,including some doctors, pediatricians, who looked at it.Does that sound right to you?Ms. BOYLE. The one study that has addressed this is the studyby Gilberg which I mentioned earlier, which looked at trends overtime. If you look at the range of functioning of those children overtime, it appeared that the increase was in children who were high-er-functioning as well as children who were lower-functioning. Sothe classic group seemed to remain constant. Now, why that is hap-pening, we do not know. That is what we hope to do the researchto understand.Mr. TIERNEY. Well, I agree that we ought to do this research anddo it soon. I am a little bit concerned about what might be the mes- 196sage taken from this hearing by people and what we want to takeon this.Dr. Boyle, if you had young children today, would you vaccinatethem?Ms. BOYLE. I do have children, and they are both fully vac-cinated, and I would vaccinate them again.Mr. TIERNEY. Dr. Offit, how about you?Dr. OFFIT. Yes. I have a 7-year-old son, Will, and a 5-year-olddaughter, Emily, and they are both fully vaccinated.Mr. TIERNEY. And you would do it again?Dr. OFFIT. Of course. I want them to be protected against the vi-ruses and bacteria that can cause serious disability and death. Iam fortunate, actuallyI was a little boy in the early 1950's, andwhen I was a little boy, there were four vaccinesdiphtheria, per-tussis, tetanus and smallpox. I was fortunate that I was not killedby measles or paralyzed by polio. My son, hopefully, did not haveto be as lucky, but hopefully, as we move into the 21st century andcan develop vaccines against respiratory virus and para flu, chil-dren will not have to die from those diseases.Mr. TIERNEY. Dr. Boyle, you wanted to add something.Ms. BOYLE. I did want to mention one thing. We do monitor thetrend of other serious developmental disabilities in Atlanta, andjust based on my own experience over the last 10 or 15 years, weused to see children who were deaf due to congenital rubella orwho had mental retardation due to hemophilus influenza Type B.We no longer see those children in our program.Mr. BURTON. The gentleman's time has expired.Mr. TIERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. BURTON. I just have a few more questions, and then we willgo to the next panelI think Mr. Waxman has a few as well.Dr. Boyle, why did the CDC ignore the pleas of the parents ofBrick Township when they begged CDC to look at the vaccineissue?Ms. BOYLE. Actually, the study of Brick Township is sort of ourfirst step, which is to look at the prevalence ofMr. BURTON. Did you check into the vaccine issue, though? Theparents there wanted the vaccines looked into as well. DidCDCMs. BOYLE. The concern with the parents from Brick Townshipin a number of meetings that we had with parents was related toenvironmental concerns.Mr. BURTON. They did notMs. BOYLE. We have been working with the Agency for ToxicSubstances and Disease RegistrationMr. BURTON. But didn't they also ask that the vaccines that hadbeen given to their children also be investigated?Ms. BOYLE. That is not my understanding. My understanding isthat their initial concern was to answer the question, is the rateof autism in their community higher than what they thoughtMr. BURTON. Well, the information that we have is that the par-ents of Brick Township were very adamant that they wanted thevaccines checked because so many of their children had become au-tistic. And evidently, that is not one of the things that CDC is look-ing into, anctI would like to pose the question to you and have you 197answer it in writingwhy? Why didn't CDC include as one of thethings they were investigating the possibility that some of thesevaccinations may have caused the autism increase? Would youcheck that out and let me know?Ms. BOYLE. I would be happy to.Mr. BURTON. OK.[The information referred to follows:] (2 0 3 198 Brick Autism Project - Executive S...lopment, and Disability and Health http://www.cdc.govniceb/cddh/dd/execsum.htm Prevalence of Autism in Brick. Township, New Jersey, 1998:Comtnunity ReportCenters for Disease Control and PreventionApril 2000Return to Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBackgroundA citizen's group in Brick Township, New Jersey contacted the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services(DHSS) in late 1997 with concerns about an apparently larger than expected number of children with autism in BrickTownship. Because of the complexity of the disorder and the citizens' concern that environmental factors might play a role,the New Jersey DHSS, U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli, and U.S. Representative Christopher Smith contacted the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) for assistance.In response, a four-pan plan was developed, including a prevalence investigation, a literature review of environmentalfactors associated with autism, an investigation of environmental pathways for human exposure in the community, andcommunity education and involvement activities. This report presents die results of the prevalence investigation.MethodsThe objective of the prevalence investigation was to determine the prevalence rate of autism in children aged 3-10 yearswho were hying in Brick Township in 1998. Investigators used a two-phase approach. Phase I involved identifying allchildren whose condition might meet the case definition for autism by reviewing records at schools, service providers(physicians or programs Ihr children with autism) and from names provided by the citizen's group. Phase II was to verifycase status through an examination by a developmental pediatrician, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G (ascientifically well- established tool for diagnosing autism) in addition to standard clinical procedures. Autism included thespectrum of disorders defined by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -- FourthRevision (DSM-IV), i.e., autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disordernot otherwisespecified (PDD-NOS). In order to determine the prevalence rate, it was necessary to estimate the number of children aged3-10 years in Brick Township in 1998.ResultsPhase I of the investigation identified 75 children with possible autism, In Phase II, 60 children were found to meet theDSM-IV criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The prevalence rate of ASD was 6.7 cases per 1,000 children (95%CI- 5.1-8.7). For die subset of 36 children whose condition met the diagnosis for autistic disorder, the prevalence was 4.0cases per 1,000 children (95% CI 2.8-5.6). The male-to-female prevalence ratios were 2.2 and 3.7 for autistic disorder andPDD-NOS, respectively. Sixty-three percent of the children with autistic disorder had an IQ score of less than or equal to 70(ie., mental retardation). Of children with a known birth residence, 64% were born in Brick Township. Seven children werereported to have a brother or sister who also had an ASD.ConclusionsThe rate of autistic disorder and ASD in Brick Township were high relative to previously published studies from othercountries. There are no recent prevalence studies of autism in the United States. However, there are a few very recent studiesfrom other countries that have yielded similar rates. These studies, like the Brick Township investigation, tended to userelatively intense case-finding methods.The well described epidenriologic characteristics of children with ASD in Brick Township the predominance in malesand the high proportion of children with IQ of 70 or less -- were observed in the Brick Township population, which providessupport for the appropriateness of our study methods.Whether the Brick Township rates are higher than expected is difficult to answer because of the uncertainty about the truerate of autism. Recent higher prevalence rates found in other countries along with the increase in the number of children seenby service providers in the United States, is believed to be due in part to the broadening of the diagnostic criteria andimproved recognition.To help with the interpretation of the rate of autism in Brick Township, and rates in other communities, we needcomparable data on the prevalence of autism in several large and diverse populations in the United States. Studies examiningthe role of genetic, infectious, immunologic, and environmental factors in the cioccurence of autism are also needed.Return to Table of Contents 1 of 1 1/25/014104 PM BEST COPY AVAILABLE 199 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopment, and Disability and Health http://www.ccic.govinceb/cddh/dd/report.thin Prevalence of Autism In Brick Township, New Jersey, 1998:Community ReportCenters for Disease Control and PreventionApril 2000Return to Table of ContentsBackgroundBrick Township, New Jersey, a town of about 77,000 residents, is located approximately 60 miles north of Atlantic City,just a few minutes from the Atlantic coast. In late 1997, a citizens' group in Brick Township, Parents of Special Services andEducation (POSSE) contacted the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) with the results of a surveythey had conducted on the number of children in their community with autism. The results of this survey suggested that therate of autism among Brick Township children could be several times higher than expected based on prevalence rates for thedisorder. In early 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances andDisease Registry (ATSDR) were contacted by the New Jersey DHSS, U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli, and RepresentativeChristopher Smith about the possibility of federal assistance in addressing the concerns of the citizens of Brick Township.CDC assistance was requested because of the complexity of investigating a disorder such as autism, in which the diagnosis isbased solely on the behavioral characteristics of the child, and CDC was developing epidentiologic methods to address theunique challenges of autism. ATSDR's expertise was requested because of a concern by the community that the apparentincrease in autism might be caused by environmental factors.In response to the requests for federal assistance, a four-part Health Action Plan for Brick Township was developed whichincluded: (1) a prevalence investigation of autism; (2) a review of the literature on the association between chemicalcontaminants and autism; (3) an investigation of environmental pathways for human exposure in Brick Township; and (4)community involvement and health education activities. This report presents the results of the Brick Township autismprevalence component[Return to Table of Contents]MethodsThe population for the prevalence investigation was children aged 3 through 10 years whose parents resided in BrickTownship, New Jersey, at any time during 1998. The age range was chosen to be analogous with the ages of childrenidentified in CDC's Atlanta-based surveillance program for autism and other developmental disabilities, the only othercurrent U.S. population-based study of autism.Children with autism in Brick Township were identified using a two-phase process. In Phase 1, all children who met theage, study year, and parental residence requirements with possible autism were identified through a review of school,medical, and other source records. In Phase 2, clinicians with training and experience in diagnosing autism confirmed thediagnosis in children identified through Phase 1.Case dentition: The case definition included children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This includes thediagnoses of autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disordernot otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger'sdisorder, based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical ManualFourth Edition (DSM-IV)criteria. The case definition did not include children with childhood disintegrative disorder or Rett Syndrome. (See Appendixfor DSM-IV criteria.)[Return to Table of Contents)Phase 1Identification of children in Brick Township with a possible ASD.Three sources were used to identify children with a possible ASD: 1) school records maintained by Brick TownshipSchools, Department of Special Services; 2) records of private physicians (i.e., neurodevelopmental pediatricians andpediatric neurologists) and private schools or programs that specialize in diagnosing or treating ASD in children; and 3) listsof children with a possible ASD maintained by POSSE and children whose parents contacted CDC directly .To identify children whose condition might meet the prevalence case definition from special education records in theBrick Township schools, a developmental psychologist reviewed records of all children who received special educationservices in 1998. This review included records of children who were receiving services in private schools (for whom theservices were paid by the Brick Township school system) and children who were evaluated for services but did not meeteligibility requirements for services. Children were identified as possible cases if their special education classification was anASD, their record described behaviors consistent with diagnostic criteria for ASD, or another indication that an ASD may bepresent (i.e., a sibling with the disorder).To identify children with ASD from private clinicians and private schools or other programs that provide services tochildren with autism, a list of such sources was developed through input from parents, school administrators, parentorganizations (i.e., POSSE and the Center for Outreach Services for the Autism Community), the Ocean County HealthDepartment, and area phone books. Fifteen private schools, four psychiatric facilities that provide inpatient and/or outpatient 1 of 8 1/25/01 4:05 PM BEST COPY AVAILABLE 205 200 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopment, and Disability and Health http://www.cdc.govhiceh/cddh/dd/reporUum services for children with autism and other psychiatic disorders, three child psychiatrists, four pediatric neurology practices,and one general pediatrician were identified as possible sources. CDC investigators contacted these potential sources bytelephone to determine whether they provided services to any children from Brick Township. Several schools providedservices for Brick Township children with autism, however; these children already had been identified from the specialeducation files maintained by the Brick Township schools. The psychiatric facilities all reported that in 1998 they served nochildren with autism from Brick Township. Of the clinicians, three pediatric neurologists were identified who provideddiagnosis and treatment to children from Brick Township in 1998 and who allowed access to their records. The fourthpediatric neurologist reported having seen no children with an ASD from Brick Township. A review of the files from thegeneral pediatrician indicated that we had already identified all children with autism in that practice. We were unable toobtain any information from the three child psychiatrists. Although it is unknown whether additional children would havebeen identified from the three child psychiatrists, only one of these clinicians was named in the record review at the schooland other sources.The final source for case identification included the lists of children with possible autism maintained by POSSE (alterpermission was obtained from the parents to forward their names to CDC) and parents who contacted CDC directly afterlearning of the investigation.For each child identified as a possible case-child from the schools, physician offices, and the parent lists or inquiries, ateam of two CDC research assistants (who specialized in abstracting psychological and medical reports for children withdevelopmental disabilities) abstracted information from the records onto an abstract form developed by CDC investigatorsfor use in its Atlanta-based autism surveillance program. Information abstracted from the records included demographicfactors, descriptions of behaviors consistent with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for an ASD, standardized testing mulls(e.g., TQ testing), special education eligibility/classification, and selected medical tests and procedures (e.g., genetic testingresults,fic screening results).[Return to Table of Contents]Phase 2Clinical assessment for autism.Families of children who were identified in Phase t were invited to participate in a clinical assessment For logisticalreasons, the six children who were identified from physician offices only were not invited to participate in the clinicalassessment. The /impose of the clinical assessment was to use a standardized instrument in applying the DSM-IV criteria forASD in children identified in Phase I. The clinical examination also afforded the opportunity to obtain consistentdemographic and medical history information. All clinical assessments were conducted at the Ocean County HealthDepartment after written informed consent was obtained from parents of all participating children.The clinical evaluation was conducted by a developmental pediatrician with extensive experience in diagnosing andtreating children with ASD. The clinical evaluation included a medical, developmental, and behavioral history; a standardphysical and neurologic examination; and front and side view photographs, that were subsequently evaluated by a geneticistIn addition to these standard clinical procedures, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G (ADOS-G) wasadministered. The ADOS-G is a senustructured observational assessment that includes activities to evaluate the child'sfunctioning in the critical areas of social interactions, communication, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors. The ADOS-Gallows for DSM-W diagnoses within the autism spectrum, with threshold scores for autistic disorder /Lord, 1998; Lord &Risi, 1998; Lord at al., 1989). The developmental pediatrician received special training in the adminiitration of the ADOS -Oand the reliability of her diagnosis was monitored to accordance with recommended guidelines for this measure.In'addition to the clinical evaluation by the developmental pediatrician, a battery of tests was administered by adevelopmental psychologist to assess the intellectual, language, spatial-cognitive, and adaptive functioning of each child.Three instruments were wed: the Differential Abilities Scale (a test of general intelligence, Elliott, 1990); the DevelopmentalTest of Visual-Motor Integration (which assesses spatial-cognitive ability, Berry, 1997); and the Vineland Adaptive BehaviorScales (which measures application of cognitive ability to functioning in everyday life, Sparrow et al., 1984). Each of thetests is standardized for administration and scored to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Scores below 70 (or twostandard deviations below the mean) indicate significant delay or impairment.Case Status. Case status was determined using all information for each child. For the children who participated in theclincsr*xeinination, the diagnosis of ASD was determined primarily from the ADOS-G results, although the developmentalhistory of the child was also considered. However, history and functioning information altered theft nal case status based onthe ADOS-G results in only a few instances. For all other children identified as possible case-children (i.e., children whowere invited but did not participate in the clinical assessment phase and children identified from physician offices only), theclinicians determined case status on the basis of a review of all the abstracted diagnostic information for each child.Behaviors described in these abstracted records that corresponded to each of the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder wererecorded by the clinicians onto an abstract form. Following DSM-IV criteria, the number and pattern of behaviors were usedto determine whether the child was within the autism spectrum and whether the child's disorder met the fun diagnosticcriteria for autistic disorder.(Return to Table of Contents)Calculation of Prevalence Rates The prevalence rates of all ASD (autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger's disorder),autistic disorder alone, and other spectrum disorders (i.e., PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder combined) were calculated for 2 of 8 1125/014:05 PM BEST COPY AVAILABLE 201 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopment, and Disability and Health http://www.cdc.govincehkddh/dd/reporthtm children aged 3 years through 10 years, who resided in Brick Township at any time during 1998. The numerator of the rate isthe number of children identified by the clinical exam or clinical record review (when exams were not done) as meeting thecase definition for one of these conditions. The denominator is the estimated number of children aged 3 tuoughl 0 yearswhose parents resided in Brick Township in 1998.Because the exact number of 3- to10- year old children living in Brick Township in 1998 was not available, we estimatedthe denominator by adjusting the 1990 census count of 7,117 by a 25% inflation factor. This inflation factor was equivalentto the increase observed in the Brick Township student population for grades K through 5 in the school years 1989-90 and1998-99, which were provided by the Brick Township Public Schools. Using this inflation factor, the estimated number ofchildren aged 3 - 10 years in Brick Township in 1998 was 8,896 (4,364 girls and 4,532 boys).Statistical precision of the prevalence rates were assessed by computing 95% confidence intervals, which indicate that95% of the time the interval will include the true rate. Confidence intervals were used to compare prevalence rates withinBrick Township, such as between younger and older children, and to compare the prevalence in Brick Township with thatfound in other studies. Confidence intervals that do not overlap provide guidance that the rates are statistically different fromone another.For the moat part, the analyses include information about all children identified with an ASD in Brick Township, with thesample restricted for a few analyses only to children who participated in the Phase 2 clinical assessment Findings arepresented for all children within the autism spectrum as well as separately for children whose disorder met the diagnosticcriteria for autistic disorder and for children who had the other spectrum disorders (PDD-NOS/Asperger's disorder).[Return to Table of Contents)ResultsSeventy-five children were identified as possible case-children in Phase I of the investigation (Table 1). Most (83%) wereidentified at more than one source. Of the 75 possible case-children, 53 participated in the clinical examination,and 22 wereevaluated solely on the basis of diagnostic information included in school and physician records. Sixty of the 75 potentialcase-children met the DSM-IV criteria for an ASD; 36 of these children met the criteria for autistic disorder. Fifteen childrenidentified as possible case-children in Phase I did not meet the ASD diagnostic criteria; these children had a number of otherdevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mental retardation, or a speech disorder. Thefollowing results are based on the 60 children whose conditions met the DSM-IV criteria for an ASD.The overall and ago-specific prevalence rates in Brick Township for autistic disorder, other spectrum disorders(PDD-NOS/Asperger's disorder), and all ASDs combined are presented in Table 2. Age - specific rates were based on thechild's attained age in 1998. The overall rate of autistic disorder is 4.0 caseiTiFTr ,000 children aged 3-10 years, with a 95%confidence interval (CI) ranging from 2.8 to 5.6. The overall rate for children meeting the criteria for other spectrinndisorders was 2.7 (95% CI -41.7.0). Finally, the overall rate of ASD was 6.7 cases pea. 1,000 children aged 3-10 years(95% Cl = 5.1-8.7). Age-specific prevalence rates of ASD or autistic disorder in children 3-5 years old did not differsignificantly from those among children 6-10 years in 1998, although the tendency was for lower rates prevailing among theolder aged children.Forty-four (73%) of the 60 children with ASD were boys (Table 3). The male-to-female prevalence rate ratio was higherfor children with PDD-NOS/Asperger's disorder than for children with autistic disorder, 3.7 and 2.2, respectively.The racial/ethnic distribution of children with. ASD was 89% white non-Hispanic, 4% Hispanic, 4% other races, and 3%unknown. This distribution is comparable to Brick Township - -94% white non-Hispanic, 4% Hispanic, and 2% other races.Of the 60 children with ASD, maternal residence at time of the child's birth was obtained from school or other sources (e.g.,birth certificates) for 56 (93%) of the children. Of the 56 children with known birth residence, 36 (64%) were born in BrickTownship, and 20 (36%) had a maternal residence other than Brick. One child with ASD, bon outside Brick Township, wasadopted.In addition to the 43 case- children who participated in the clinical exam, IQ information was available for two of the 17children with only record information, and these children are included in the IQ analysis. The mean IQ score for childrenwith ASD was 72 (range 45 to 118); 21(47 %) children had IQ scores lass than or equal to 70. Of children who met thediagnostic criteria for autistic disorder, 50% had an IQ score of less than or equal to 70, and 40% of those withPDD-NOS/Asperger's disorder fell in this range (Table 4). Four children with autistic disorder couldnot complete the IQtesting because of limited language ability and/or cooperation. All four of these children were considered by thedevelopmental psychologist to be functioning in the moderate to severe range of mental retardation; the correspondingVitteland standard scores for each child was less than 50, indicating moderate to severe deficits in skills of daily living.Including these four children in the less than or equal to 70 IQ group would result in 63% of the children with autisticdisorder functioning in the range of mental retardation.Parents were asked during the clinical assessment whether their child bad experienced any loss of acquired skills beforethe diagnosis of ASD. Ten of the 43 children who participated in the exams, all in the autistic disorder category, were!epoxied by their parents to have lost skills. The earliest age of skill loss was reported as 12 months for four children, 13months for one child, 15 months for two children, and 18 months for three children. For the 17 children with recordinformation only, no information in their medical or school records indicated s loss of skills. 3 of S 1/25/014:05 PM BEST COPYAVAILABLE 2O 202 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopment, and Disability and Health http://www.cdc.govincehtddh/dd/reportlitm Seven children from four families were reported by their parents as having a sibling with an ASD (Table 5). For three ofthese sibling pairs, both children met the age criteria to be included in the prevalence investigation. There were a total of 81siblings in the investigation, which yields a sibling rate of ASD of 4.9%. In addition, six children were reported to have oneor more siblings with a developmental disability other than an ASD, primarily attention deficit hyperactivity disorder orspeech/language disorders.Five (8.6%) of the 60 children had specific medical conditions that have been found in other studies to be associated withautism. These conditions were seizure disorder (two children), fragile X syndrome (two children), and a genetic translocation(one child). A clinical geneticist at CDC reviewed photographs and videotapes the facial features of 43 children whoparticipated in the clinical evaluation and indicated that none had a major, recognizable syndrome. A few children hadseveral dysmorphic features, but there was no common facial appearance.[Return to Table of Contents]DiscussionThe rate of autistic disorder in Brick Township was 4.0 per 1,000 children. The rate for the spectrum of autism disordersobtained in this investigation was 6.7 per 1,000 children. These rates are higher than previously published rates. However,there is much controversy about the actual rate of autism. Considerable debate has focused on the actual prevalence of autismand whether the prevalence has increased during the past 20-30 years (Fombonne, 1996; 1999; Gillberg & Wing, 1999).Nearly all recent studies (Table 6) suggest that the prevalence of autism is considerably higher than the rates of 0.4 to 0.5 per1,000 that were originally described These early rates were based on narrowly defined criteria for autism that included twoessential features - -a profound lack of affective contact and elaborate repetitive and ritualistic behaviors (Kanner &Eisenberg, 1956). More recent diagnostic criteria for autism, based on the DSM-IV (1984) or the International Classificationof Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10, 1992), are considerably broader incorporating the clinical recognition that the hallmarkfeatures of autism - impaired social interactions, inability to conummicate, and repetitive or restrictive behaviorscan occur ina wide range of severity levels with several different manifestations (Wing, 1993; Filipelc, at at, 1999). Recent reviews of theprevalence of autism (Fombonne, 1999; Gillberg & Wing, 1999) suggest that a conservative estimate of the prevalence ofautistic disorder from studies published in the 1990's is about 1 per 1,000 children. For the entire spectrum of autisticdisorders, the rate of 2 per 1,000 that was obtained by Wing and Gould (1979) is cited most often. However, a few recentstudies have shown rates that are considerably higher than the above estimates. Specifically, studies conducted in Japan andSweden showed rates of autism ranging from 2.1 to 6.0 per 1,000 children (Honda et al, 1996; Arvidsson et al., 1997;Kadesjo and Gillberg, 1999). Although each of these studies included relatively small populations, which would havefacilitated more intensive case finding methods, the small sample sizes also resulted in statistically unstable prevalence ratesas reflected by wide confidence intervals. However, a study recently completed in the United Kingdom, with a considerablylarger population, reported a provisional rate of 3.1 per 1,000 children for autistic disorder and 5.8 per 1,000 children forASD (Baird et at, in press). One reason for the higher rates in these studies may be their more intensive case-fmdingmethods that included screening the entire population. As discussed below, intense case finding activities may havecontributed to the high rate in Brick Township.Another important point to consider when interpreting the rate found in Brick Township is the lack of U.S. data on theprevalence of autism, although there is no reason to believe that the rate in U.S. populations should differ appreciably fromother population groups. The data used by Gillberg and Wing (1979) to derive their estimate of I per 1,000 for theprevalence of autism is based on studies conducted outside of the United States. The two U.S. studies that satisfied thecriteria to be included in the review -- population -based screening followed by a clinical evaluation - -obtained rates of 0.3 per1,000 (Burd at al., 1987; Ritvo, at al, 1989) and are considered outliers by most investigators ( Gillberg & Wing, 1999). Thelow rates in these U.S. studies probably result from their exclusive reliance on referred cases from sources that providedservices to children with autism, rather than actively reviewing all potential source records as in the Brick Townshipinvestigation.Other U.S. data sources seem to support the idea that the prevalence of autism is higher than previously thought, althoughhow much higher is still uncertain. A recent report released by the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS)showed a large increase from 1987 to 1998 in the number of children with autism for whom the DDS provided services. Weestimated a prevalence rate from the California DDS data of 1.5 per 1,000 4-9 year old children (95% CI=-1.45-1.54) in 1998by using the number of children aged 4-9 years receiving DDS services for autism in 1998 as the numerator and the U.S.census estimate of the number of children in this age range living in California in 1998 as the denominator. This rate isprobably an underestimate because this service system is unlikely to identify all children with autism. CDC has recentlycompleted data collection for a large prevalence study in metropolitan Atlanta. Although case review and data analysis areongoing, provisional rates of autistic disorder based on the number of cases reviewed (40% of total), and assuming a similarrate of case confirmation for the remainder, range from 2 to 3 per 1,000 3- to 10-year-old children. The combination of theAtlanta and California data suggest that the rate of autistic disorder in the United States is substantially higher than the 1 per1,000 estimate of Gillberg and Wing (1999), although how much higher and how the rates vary across differentsubpopulations is yet to be determined.Another data source that might add some perspective to the Brick Township rates is the New Jersey special education datafor autism. The percentage of children provided special education services by Brick Township was not unusual compared toother towns in New Jersey during 1997. In the annual reporting for federal funding under the Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act, there were over 100 towns in New Jersey that reported a higher percentage of children in autism special 4 of 8 1/25/01 4:05 PM BEST COPY AVAILABLE I203 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopinent, and Disability and Health http://www.cdc.govinceb/cddh/dd/reportlitm education classes than reported in Brick Township (Factor-Litvak, personal communication). However, the special educationdata have to be viewed with caution because school placement is based on the educational needs of the child rather thanexclusively on underlying diagnosis, and classification practices may vary among school systems. For example, in BrickTownship, only 50% of children with an ASD and 66% of those with autistic disorder had autism listed as their specialeducation designation for services.Differences in study methods may account for much of the variability in autism prevalence rates (Fombonne, 1996; 1999;Gillberg & Wing, 1999; Wing, 1993; Bryson & Smith, 1998). We mentioned previously that other studies with higher ratestended to have more intense case finding methods. In Brick Township, a number of factors contributed to the intensity ofcase finding. First, the relatively small size Of the target population allowed CDC investigators, parents, and professionals inthe community to be especially thorough in identifying and reviewing potential case sources. Second, the local school systemwas fully cooperative with investigators, which facilitated the identification of all children receiving special educationservices, including newly referred children. Third, the well-organized citizen groups resulted in an acute awareness of thefeatures of autism in the community among both parents and professional groups. Finally, the intense media coverage thatfollowed the initial report of a possibly large number of children with autism in Brick Township undoubtedly led to a greaterawareness of the condition by parents and professionals.We found 1.5 times more children with autistic disorder than with other ASDs. A recent review suggested just theoppositea higher prevalence of other spectrum disorders than autistic disorder (Fombonne, 1998). There are several possibleexplanations for the discrepant findings. One possibility is the instrument used to guide the clinician's diagnosis of autism,the ADOS-G, is limited in its ability to discriminate autistic disorder from PDD-NOS (Lord, 1998). However, the meanscores were similar for functioning assessed by the ADOS-G (i.e., social, communication and repetitive behaviors domains)to the mean values from the sample used to develop the norms for the ADOS-G. Such similarity suggests we did notoverdiagnose autistic disorder relative to the nonnative data. Another possible explanation is that our method of caseidentification was not good at identifying children with other spectrum disorders. Our method of case finding assumed thatthe autistic behaviors of children would be recognized and/or described previously by someone--an educator, parent orclinicianeven in the absence of a formal autism diagnosis or classification_ Some children with PDD-NOS or Asperger'sdisorder may function well in the community and therefore may have been missed by our case-finding process.We observed several well-established epidemiologic characteristics of children with autism in this investigation, althoughthe strength of the associations were perhaps less remarkable than in most previous studies. These characteristics included thepredominance of males and the high proportion of children with co-existing mental retardation. The male-to-female ratiosfound in other studies have ranged from about 2:1 to 4:1 with a few exceptions of very high ratios (see Table 6). Thus, the2.2 male-to-female prevalence ratio for autistic disorder observed in Brick Township is at the lower end of the range found inother studies. The higher male-to-female ratio for PDD-NOS/Asperger's disorder than for autistic disorder seems unusual,however, less is know about epidemiologic characteristics of this clinical entity and as noted, we may have missed childrenwith other spectrum disorders. Similarly, we found about two thirds of the children with autistic disorder and slightly lessthat half the children with PDD-NOS had co-existing mental retardation. The prevalence of co-existing mental retardation inprior studies ranged from 44% to 100%, with the majority of studies in the 604- 80% range. The proportion of case-childrenin Brick Township with mental retardation was at the lower end of this range. Possible explanations included the intelligencetest used, the Differential Abilities Scale, which is a preferred test for children with autism because it minimizes the level ofverbal abilities needed to complete the tasks in comparison to other standardized IQ tests (Tager-Flusberg and Joseph, 1999).Also, the growing availability of early intervention services may impact the level of functioning for the group of childrenfrom this community. Finally, if children without IQ information were lower functioning than children for whom IQinformation was available, the proportion with mental retardation would have been higher.Epilepsy has been found in other investigations as the second most common co-existing medical condition amongchildren with autism, occurring in up to 25% of case children; other medical conditions occur much less frequently(Fombonne et al., 1997; Gillberg et al., 1994; Sponheim & Skejeldal, 1998). Associated medical conditions of any type werereported in just five (8%) the case children in Stick Township. Only two of these children (3%) were reported to haveepilepsy.The strong genetic component of autism has been well described in family and twin studies (Szatmari, 1998; Splicer,1999). In this investigation, 7% of the 57 families had more than one child with an ASD; the rate of ASD in siblings was 5%.Genetic family studies had found rates of ASD of 5-6% in siblings (Szatmari et al., 1998), suggesting that Brick Township iswithin the range of what has been observed previously.While we obtained permission to review records from most potential case sources, there were three physicians identifiedas possible sources who elected not to participate. Although the names of only one of these physicians was noted in the chartreview at other sources, it is unknown whether additional case children would have been identified from their practices. Thismight be especially true for higher functioning children who were not known to other sources.One possible explanation for a high rate of autism in Brick Township is that families with children with already diagnosedASD were more likely to have moved into Brick Township than other families. Although we did not have specificinformation about the changes in the Brick Township lotion over time, we do know that about one third of the families with children with ASD who were included in the s ved into Brick Township sometime after their child's birth. This rate of in-migration is comparable to the rate of growth experienced by the Brick Township schools where the elementaryschool population increased 25% in the 9-year interval from 1990 to 1998. 5 of 8 1/25/01 4:05 PM BEST COPY AVAILABLE 204 Brick Autism Project Report, DBDCD...lopment, and Disability and He lilth http://www.cdc.govincebicddh/dd/reporthtm [Return to Table of Contents]ConclusionsOur investiption found high rates of autistic disorder and ASD in Brick Township relative to rates from previouslypublished studies. The rates for the majority of recent studies are several fold lower than the rate in Brick Township.However, a few, very recent studies yield rates close to those in Brick Township. These studies, like the Brick Townshipinvestigation, tended to use relatively intense case-finding methods. In Brick Township, the relatively small size of the targetpopulation; the heightened awareness of parents, teachers, and clinicians; and the full cooperation of most of the serviceproviders allowed for thorough case-finding. The use of the ADOS-G may have contributed to the high rate of autisticdisorder because children with more subtle signs of an ASD may have been included as cases. At the same time,comparability between epidemiologic characteristics of children with ASD in Brick Township and those in previous studiesattest to the validity of our methods.Although progress has been made in understanding this complex neurobehavioral disorder, a great deal of research stillremains. The important population-based research that will provide full understanding of the magnitude of this importantpublic health problem and identification of potential risk factors has only recently begun in the United States. To bestinterpret the rate of autism in Brick Township, we need comparable data on the prevalence of autism from a number of largeand diverse populations in the United States. Such studies must use standardized case-finding methods and similar diagnostictools to enable comparisons of rates across different geographic areas and across other population characteristics, and toidentify potential causes for autism.Subsequent steps may include conducting a large community-based case-control study of autism in Brick Township andin several other communities in New Jersey. This investigation could include a prevalence phase, to compare the prevalencerates of autism in Brick Township and surrounding connnunities with other areas in New Jersey. An analytic phase couldexamine the roles of various genetic, infectious, immunologic, and environmental factors in the etiology of autism.[Return to Table of Contents]ReferencesArvidsson, T., Danielsson, D., Forsberg, P., Gillberg, C., & Johanson, M.

In early 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and theAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) were contacted bythe N.J. Department of Health and Senior Services, .S. Senator RobertTonicsand U.S. Representative Christopher Smith the possibility offederal assistance in addressing the concerns of the citizens of Brick Township.CDC assistance was requested because of the complexity of investigating a behavioral disorder such as autism and the that CDC was developingepidemiological methods that address the unique challenges of autism. ATSDR'sexpertise was requested because community members felt environmental factorsmight be involved. ATSDR conducted a scientific literature review to determine what is known aboutassociations between chemical contaminants and autism. ATSDR investigatorsalso assessed whether any environmental pathways for human exposure exist inBrick Township. ATSDR also developed a plan for community involvement andhealth education activities.CDC investigators with expertise in population-based studies of autism conductedthe prevalence investigation.

CDC, Media Relations (404) 639-3286 It is not known how many children in the United States currently have autismor a related disorder. Studies done in Europe and Asia Indicate as many as 2 out ofevery 1,000 children have some type of autism.A recent investigation by CDC in Brick Township, New Jersey, found a prevalence ratefor the autism of 4.0 per 1,000 children and a rate of 6.7 per 1,000 children for the morebroadly defined category of autistic spectrum disorders. Although the rates obtained inBrick are high compared to other published reports, it is important to keep in mind thatthere are no current rates for autism from the United States.Furthermore, investigators in other countries who used Intense case finding methods insmall communities are finding rates of autism in the range of those found in BrickTownship. The Interpretation of the results from the Brick prevalence investigation will notbe fully understood until addit ional prevalence rates have been obtained from othercommunities and compared to those in Brick Township.CDC runs the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program(MADDSP), one of the few programs in the world that conducts active and ongoingmonitoring of the number of children with developmental disabilities in the multiracialAtlanta area. CDC added autism to the program In 1998 and anticipates havingprevalence rates for autism In the fall of 2000.Autism is a spectrum of disorders that are complex and lifelong. Individuals with autismhave problems with social interaction, commtmication difficulties, and restrictive orrepetitive interests/behaviors. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) includes autisticdisorder, pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (also known asatypical autism), and Asperger's disorder as defined by the American PsychiatricAssociation's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).Children with autism require long-term care and services. Special education costs for achild with autism are more than $8,000 per year, with some specially structuredprograms costing about $30,000, and care in a residential school costing $80,000 - BEST COPYAVAILABLE 2 2 6 221 $100,000 per year.Little is known about causes of autism, although genetic and early prenatal exposures have been suggested. There is no cure for autism. However, early and intensiveeducation can help children develop skills and reach their potential. Although availablemedicines cannot cure autism, some may relieve symptoms associated with the disorders.Other Related CDC ActivitiesCDC funds Marshall University Autism Training Center, West Virginia, to develop andimplement a program to prevent secondary conditions among children withautism and their families. Marshall University is also developing a prevalence system for autism in six counties of West Virginia. 6R-622D-n1 --6 CDCCENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROLAND PREVENTION222 Fact Sheet Investigation of the Prevalence of Autism in Brick TownshipA Community Report Embargoed with 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, April 18, 2000 CDC, Media Relations (404) 639-3286 At the request of the New Jersey Department of Health and SeniorServices and congressional district representatives, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for ToxicSubstance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigated if the rates ofautism among children in Brick Township, New Jersey were higher thanexpected. Published prevalence rates were examined and researcherslooked into whether there were possible links to environmental exposures.Autism is a spectrum of disorders that are complex and lifelong.Individuals with autism have problems with social interactions andcommunication skills as well as a tendency towards restrictive or repetitiveinterests and behaviors. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a term usedto describe the continuum of functioning among persons with autism.ASD includes autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder - nototherwise specified, and Asperger's disorder as defined by the AmericanPsychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - FourthEdition (DSM-IV).CDC's expertise was called upon because of the complexity ofinvestigating a behavioral disorder such as autism and the fact that CDCwas developing epidemiologic methods that address the uniquechallenges of autism.The prevalence investigation identified children with possible autismwhose parents were residents of Brick Township during 1998. The autismdiagnosis was verified through a clinical assessment.The rate of autism among children in Brick Township was 4.0 per 1,000children aged 3 through 10 years. The prevalence of the more broadly 223 defined autism spectrum disorder was 6.7 per 1,000 children. Theseprevalence rates are higher than rates reported in other currentlypublished studies from other countries.Whether the Brick Township rate is unusual relative to other U.S.communities is uncertain. No current data on the prevalence of autism inthe U.S. is available.A few very recent studies in other countries have found high rates.Service provider data in the U.S., e.g., special education data, showincreasing numbers of children with autism receiving specialized services.There is ongoing scientific discussion about whether higher rates ofautism worldwide reflect a true increase over time, a greater awareness ofthese disorders, improved case finding techniques, broader diagnosticcriteria, or a combination of all these factors.Other results from the Brick Township investigation:Sixty of the 75 potential case children met the criteria (DSM-IV) foran ASD.Thirty-six of the children met the criteria for autistic disorder.There were twice as many boys than girls with autistic disorder.Sixty-three percent of the children had mental retardation.Seven children had a brother or sister who also had an ASD.Because of the lack of data on autism in the U.S., monitoring theprevalence of these disorders in several communities across the countrywould be helpful to identify the magnitude of this health problem and howit varies in different population subgroups. In addition, we need to dolarge-scale epidemiologic studies to begin to understand the cause of thisimportant health problem. ,9 ATSDR224 Fact Sheet Results of Brick Township Investigation of Environmental Pathways - A Public HealthAssessment Embargoed until 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, April 18, 2000 ATSDR Office of Policy and External Affairs, at(404) 639-0501 At the request of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, local parents,members of Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Agencyfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) agreed to investigate the prevalence ofautism cases in Brick Township and to also determine if there was an environmentalexplanation.ATSDR, a federal public health agency that deals with hazardous waste issues related to humanhealth, conducted the investigation which looked for environmental explanations. ATSDRreviewed environmental sampling data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), theNew Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), the Ocean County HealthDepartment (OCHD), and the Brick Township Municipal Utilities Authority to assess thepossibilities of past and current exposure to hazardous substances.ATSDR has prepared this public health assessment to address hazardous chemicals in theenvironment for three areas: the municipal drinking water supply, swimming In the MetedeconkRiver, and the Brick Township landfill. After a thorough examination of data for each of theseareas, ATSDR researchers concluded that, while chemicals may have been found, neitherchildren nor pregnant women were exposed to levels which would be likely to cause adversehealth effects.Public Health ConclusionsATSDR looked at information for the Brick Township municipal drinking water systemfrom 1987 to 1995 and found that, during this period, the water at various timescontained several substances, which included tetracholoroethylene (PCE),trichioroethylene (TCE), and trihalomethanes (THMs).

BEST COPY AVAILABLE 226Mr.BURTON.Dr. Taylor, you have shown the measles virus inthe intestine, and you have in your laboratoryor \"laboratory,\" asthey call it in your countryyou have gone through and checkedthose samples that were sent to you by Dr. Wakefield that showthat there definitely was measles in the gut of these children whobecame autistic. I think Dr. Singh verified the same thing.Did you check any of that, Dr. Taylor, why there was measles inthe guts of those children? Did you take a look at any of that?Dr.TAYLOR. Iam sorry, I have not had a chance to look at thispaper. It is interesting information. However, in terms of Mr.Wakefield's history, in all of his initial results, he has found thecure for, first of all, Crohn's disease, and he has found the cureforMr.BURTON.Let me just ask you thisI do not want to go intothose other thingsDr. Wakefield showed us on his slides thatthere was measles in the guts of these children who were vac-cinated with the MMR shot. Professor O'Leary verified it in a sepa-rate laboratoryDr.TAYLOR.Not in a separate laboratory; that was the same lab-oratory. That, I think, is the critical point.Mr.BURTON.Well, it wasDr.TAYLOR.This information does have to be verified by an inde-pendent laboratory.Mr.BURTON[continuing]. It was sent to himand Dr. Singh, Ithink, verified it as well. You have not, though, looked into theproblem with the measles in the gut of these children, though?Dr.TAYLOR. Ido not know quite what you mean. That is not myarea.Mr.BURTON.You have not checked into that; OK.Professor O'Leary, did you want to say something?Dr.O'LEARY.Sir, can I make a comment, please? What I pre-sented is evidence, direct evidence, cell-based and tube-based. Itwas done at a separate laboratory from Dr. Wakefield's.If Professor Taylor has a beef with me, he should say that. Mywork is completely independent. I stand over it. I have come hereto tell the truth. There is nothing for me to be gained in not tellingthe truth.Mr.BURTON.Dr. Singh, you had some more comments, and Iwant to yield the balance of my time to you to respond.Mr.SINGH.Yes, just a couple of things. Basically, I want to raisethe issue that when we think about epidemiological studies, whatare these individuals really looking at. All they do is they takenumbers from previous, old records of what-have-you. They do noteven pay any attention to the fact that old-time vaccines weremade based on old immunology. Today, immunology is so different;it is almost a difference of day and night. So we need to take intoaccount that new research should really be evaluated by so-calledexpert epidemiologists.The second thingMr.BURTON.Well, let me just say one more thing. I want to askDr. Boyle one last question, and that is do you believe anybody whois getting funds from Merck or any of the other pharmaceuticalcompanies should be on advisory panels that are making judg-p232- 227ments about pharmaceuticals coming from those companies, or do you believe that that is a conflict of interest?Ms. BoYLE. I think that is a difficult question to answer. Mr. BURTON. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You thinkit is a difficult question to answer. If somebody is getting fundingof some type from a pharmaceutical company, for them to sit on an advisory panel that is approving or giving their approval to a new drug that is coming on the market, you do not see that as a con- flict?Dr. SCHWARTZ. Mr. Chairman, I am Dr. Schwartz. I am a col- league of Dr. Boyle and am the acting director of the Epidemiologyand Surveillance Division in the National Immunization Program,and we appreciate your indulgence in allowing me to testify and to help with answering questions about immunization.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is a char- tered advisory committee under the FACA regulations. There are very strict guidelines regarding the participation in votes of mem-bers who may have conflicts of interest that will help assure that those potential conflicts of interest, those potential financial con- flicts, do not affect the votes and the decisions of the advisory com- mittee.The reason why individuals who may potentially have conflictsare included in the committee is to assure that we get the best ex-pert advice possible so that we can make the best vaccine rec- ommendations possible, and frequently, the best experts are thosewho may have done research or may have provided information tosome of the vaccine manufacturers--but their role in the committeeand in the voting process is very strictly defined.It is also important to point out that recommendations for vac- cination are made independently by the American Academy of Pe-diatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, andthose recommendations are virtually always in harmony with therecommendations from the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices.Mr. BURTON. Well, I am going to go aheadmy time is expired,but I am going to come back to you on that. I will take anotherround on that.Mr. Waxman.Mr. WAXMAN. I want to say to the parents in the audience andto others, family members, who are here that I do not want you to think that I am in any way trying to minimize what you havegone through or to in any way challenge the depth and sincerityof your feelings. I think that is a separate question from the sci-entific question of whether there is a causal link. And because itis so important, it is essential that through sound science, we de- termine this factnot through emotionalism and not through sen- sationalism.I did not come here to say one side is right or one side is wrong, but I want us to have the best scientific information we can have. Now, Dr. Offit's integrity has been challenged, presumably be-cause he has a point of view that does not quite fit with the chair-man's point of view. Dr. Schwartz started to indicate why hethought your situation, even though you have a relationship with Merck, did not put you in a conflict. 228Let me ask you directly, Dr. Offit, do you have a conflict of inter-est, and if \"No,\" why not?Dr. OFFIT. No, I have no conflict of interest. What I have is anapparent conflict of interest, and that is why I disclosed that at thebeginning of every ACIP meeting, and that is why I disclosed it inmy written report.If I could just explain this a little bit, I have been doing researchfor 20 years on rotaviruses. What I have done in my laboratoriesis try, with my colleagues, to understand what the genes are thatcause diarrhea and what the genes are that help the body fight in-fection. That led to a patent on a vaccine for rotavirus. Rotaviruseskill 13 children a day in this world, and rotaviruses cause 1 out ofevery 75 children born in this country to be hospitalized. It is a se-rious, and in developing countries often a deadly, infection.It would be an advance if we could prevent that disease. Merckand Company has made a commitment to developing that vaccine,and hopefully, if we can develop a safe and effective vaccine, wecan prevent a lot of disease and death.Mr. WAXMAN. I think that everyone here should agree that wewant a safe vaccine, or a vaccine that is as safe as possible. Merckdid not hire you to come up with a particular position, did they?Did they tell you they wanted your research to have a certain out-come?Dr. OFFIT. No. This work was all donefrankly, it was fundedby the National Institutes of Health, and it was funded by researchthat we did as a basicI am an immunologistthat is my exper-tise.Mr. WAXMAN. There is an organizationand I am going to putthis in the recordcalled the Autism Autoimmunity Project. I havea letter from its president urging people to give money to it, be-cause this project is going to fund research that is going to showthe connection between vaccines and autism and other diseases.And they proudly say they fund Dr. Wakefield and Dr. Singh. Isthat true?Mr. SINGH. Yes.Mr. WAxmAN. Is that true, Dr. Singh?Mr. SINGH. Yes. I just received some money from that founda-tion, oh, about 2 months ago. My research has been going on onthis issue for the last 15 years.Mr. WAXMAN. Yesand I am not saying there is anything wrongwith itMr. SINGH. I just wanted to make a point on that.Mr. WAXMAN [continuing]. Although this organization seems tohave a particular point of view. How would you think they wouldfeel if your research came up with a different conclusion from whatthey wanted to achieve in theirbecause they have a positionMr. SINGH. Mr. Waxman, I am a very honest, decent humanbeingunlike, perhaps, some other people that you might knowofand I can tell you that if I found a connection which was notexistent or if my results did not support what this foundationwanted, I would even return the money to that foundation.Mr. WAXMAN. Even though they want a particular point ofviewMr. SINGH. They never asked me to do any research 2291'Mr. WAXMAN [continuing]. You are an independent scientist, andyou have integrity.Mr. SINGH. What I amMr. WAX1VIAN. Just answer yes or no, because I do want toaskMr. SINGH. I beg your pardon?Mr. WAXMAN. My question to you is they have a point of view,but they fund you, you have integrity, and you are going to do yourwork based on science. Is that your answer?Mr. SINGH. My answer is that I am getting funds from privatesources because national agencies continue to decline my researchgrant proposals when I submit. Where else am I going to go to getthe funding?Mr. WAXMAN. Have you been turned down by NIH?Mr. SINGH. I am trying to raise funding independently, on myown, not necessarilyMr. WAXMAN. Have you been turned down by NIH?Mr. SINGH. Three times, I have attemptedthree times, I havewritten grants, and NIH has not given me a single dime.Mr. WAXMAN. I want Dr. Wakefield to be able to answer thesame question very briefly.Dr. Wakefield, you acknowledge you have received money. Doyou feel that that in any way raises expectations that your re-search come out with a result that this organization wants?Dr. WAKEFIELD. We are funded to test hypotheses, and wepresent the data whether the hypothesis is correct or not. And wehave done that, we have gone on record as doing it. We publishnegative studies in association with measles and Crohn's disease.That does not mean it is not there; it means that our hypothesiswas wrong in terms that we could not find it using the technology.So we have gone on record as publishing both positive and negativedata.Mr. WAXMAN. I ask unanimous consent that those documentsfrom the Autism Autoimmunity Project be put in the record, andI would note, Mr. Chairman, that you are also associated on theboard of this group.Mr. BURTON. Without objection. That is no problem.[The information referred to follows:] Autism and NINER, Vaccine: AND AUTISMThe number of cases of autism in the country appears to haveincreased significantly in the past 10 years. In trying toaccount for this increase, some people have suggested thatvaccines could be a possible contributor. To date, however,there is no evidence that demonstrates a causal link betweenvaccines and autism.There have been isolated case reports that have suggested anassociation between measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)vaccine and autism, but the suggested association has not beenconfirmed by other researchers.The scientific studies that have been conducted to date, haveshown go association between MMR (or othermeasles-containing vaccines) and an increased risk of life-long disorder: People who have autism havetrouble in communicating and interacting with other people.Symptoms of autism may first appear in children from 18-30months of age. Autism is seen more in boys than in girls.Although there is no known cure, autism is treatable. In somechildren, symptoms associated with autism often improve withtherapy and as they grow older. MMR vaccine is recommended for children and adults.Most persons have no reactions after receiving an MMRvaccination. The most common side effects from MMRvaccination are pain, swelling and redness at the injection site.What you should know BEST COPY AVAILABLE416/00 12:08 PM 231 Autism and MMR Vaccine: No Known Relationship http://www.ede.sovIniptraeafekoneansAtutisin/ To assure the safety of vaccines, the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC), the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health(NIH), and other Federal agencies routinely monitor andconduct research to examine any new evidence that wouldsuggest possible problems with the safety of vaccines.If you wish to report a health problem that followedvaccination, you or your health care provider should call theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at1-800-822-7967.For more information contact National Immunization Program, CDC:National Immunization Hotline: English (800) 232-2522,Spanish (800) 232-0233National Program 2ore 4/610012:06 PM BEST COPYAVAILABLE 2 37 232 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Natioiul Immunisation Program ?Health Topics A-1 Vaccines are responsible for the control of many infectious diseases thatwere once common in this country. However, the viruses and bacteria thatcause vaccine-preventable disease and death still exist and can be passedon to people who are not protected by vaccines. Vaccine-preventablediseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations,and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose timefrom work.Polio Polio virus causes acute paralysis that can lead to permanent physicaldisability and even death. Before polio vaccine was available, 13,000 to20,000 cases of paralytic polio were reported each year in the UnitedStates. These annual epidemics of polio often left thousands ofvictimsmostly childrenin braces, crutches, wheelchairs, and iron lungs.Development of polio vaccines and implementation of polio immunizationprograms have eliminated paralytic polio caused by wild polio viruses inthe U.S. and the entire Western hemisphere.In 1999, as a result of global immunization efforts to eradicate the disease,there were about 5,000 documented cases of polio in the world. In 1994,wild polio virus was imported to Canada from India, but high vaccinationlevels prevented it from spreading in the population.Measles Before measles immunization were available, nearly everyone in the U.S.got measles. There were approximately 3-4 million measles cases eachyear. An average of 450 measles-associated deaths were reported eachyear between 1953 and 1963.In industrialized countries, up to 20% of persons with measles arehospitalized, and 7% to 9% suffer from complications such as pneumonia,diarrhea, or ear infections. Although less common, some persons withmeasles develop encephalitis, resulting in brain damage. It is estimatedthat as many as one of every 1,000 persons with measles will die. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world and isfrequently imported into the U.S. In 1998, most cases were associated withinternational visitors or U.S. residents who were exposed to the measlesvirus while traveling abroad. More than 90% of people who are notimmune will get measles if they arc exposed to the virus.According to the World Health Organization, nearly 900,000 deaths 7FST COPY AVAILABLE416/0012:09 Pi Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Irmnunizatior, Prognan n17231 bttp://sAvw.ctie.govinip pnbliestionn'fnipett/WhatlfStopittni occurred among persons in developing countries in 1998. In populationsthat are not immune to measles, measles spreads rapidly. If vaccinationswere stopped, 2.7 million measles deaths worldwide could be expected.hi the U.S., widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than99% reduction in measles compared with the pre-vaccine era. If westopped immunization, measles would increase to pre-vaccine levels.Haeinophilus Influenzae Type b (Bib) Meningitis Before Hib vaccine became available, Hib was the most common cause ofbacterial meningitis in U.S. infants and children. Before the vaccine wasdeveloped, there were approximately 20,000 invasive Hib cases annually.Approximately two thirds of the 20,000 cases were meningitis, andone-third were other life-threatening invasive Hib diseases such asbacteria in the blood, pneumonia, or inflamation of the epiglotis. Aboutone of every 200 U.S. children under 5 years of age got an invasive Hibdisease. Hib meningitis killed 600 children each year, and left manysurvivors with deafness, seizures, or mental retardation.Since introduction of conjugate Hib vaccine in December 1987, theincidence of Bib has declined by 93 percent From 1994-1998, fewer than10 fatal cases of invasive Hib disease were reported each year.This preventable disease was a common, devastating illness as recently as1990; now, most pediatricians just finishing training have never seen acase. If we were to stop immunization, we would likely soon return to thepre-vaccine numbers of invasive Hib disease cases and deaths.Pertussis (Whooping Cough)Since the early I980s, reported pertussis cases have been increasing, withpeaks every 3-4 years; however, the number of reported cases remainsmuch lower than levels seen in the pre-vaccine era. Compared withpertussis cases in other age groups, infants who are 6 months old oryounger with pertussis experience the highest rate of hospitalization,pneumonia, seizures, encephalopatby (a degenerative disease of the brain)and death. From 1990 to 1996, 57 persons died from pertussig 49 of thesewere aged <6 months.Before pertussis immunizations were available, nearly all childrendeveloped whooping cough. In the U.S., prior to pertussis immunization,between 150,000 and 260,000 cases of pertussis were reported each year,with up to 9,000 pertussis-related deaths.Pertussis can be a severe illness, resulting in prolonged coughing spellsthat can last for many weeks. These spells can make it difficult for a childto eat, drink, and breathe. Because vomiting often occurs after a coughingspell, infants may lose weight and become dehydrated. In infants, it canalso cause pneumonia and lead to brain damage, seizures, and mentalretardation.The newer pertussis vaccine (acellular or DTaP) that has been availablefor use in the United States since 1991. These vaccines are effective andassociated with fewer mild and moderate adverse reactions when BEST COPYAVAILABLE4/6100 12:09 PS 234 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Immunization Program htmithvianv.eile.goviniplpublieations/frigenfWhatlfStop.han t.compared with the older (whole-cell DTP) vaccine.During the 1970s, widespread concerns about the safety of pertussisimmunization led to a rapid fall in immunization levels in the UnitedKingdom. More than 100,000 cases and 36 deaths due to pertussis werereported during an epidemic in the mid 1970s. In Japan, pertussisvaccination coverage fell from 80 percent in 1974 to 20 percent in 1979.An epidemic occurred in 1979, resulted in more than 13,000 cases and 41deaths.Pertussis cases occur throughout the world. If we stopped pertussisimmunizations in the U.S., we would experience a massive resurgence ofpertussis disease. A very recent study found that, in eight countries whereimmunization coverage was reduced, incidence rates of pertussis surged to10 to 100 times the rates in countries where vaccination rates weresustained.Rubella (German Measles)While rubella is usually mild in children and adults, up to 90 percent ofinfants born to mothers infected with rubella during the first trimester ofpregnancy will develop congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), resulting inheart defects, cataracts, mental retardation, and deafness.In 1964-1965, before rubella immunization was used routinely in the U.S.,there was an epidemic of rubella that resulted in an estimated 20,000infants born with CRS, with 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250miscarriages. Of the 20,000 infants born with CRS, 11,600 were deaf,3,580 were blind, and 1,800 were mentally retarded.Many developing countries do not include rubella in the childhoodimmunization schedule. Since 1996, greater than 50% of the reportedrubella cases have been among adults. Sites of exposure for severaloutbreaks have included workplaces and communities. In 1998, 12outbreaks of rubella occurred resulting in 19 pregnant women contractingrubella.If we stopped rubella immunization, immunity to rubella would declineand rubella would once again return, resulting in pregnant womenbecoming infected with rubella and then giving birth to infants with CRS.Incidence of CRS declined dramatically with widespread use of rubellavaccine.Varicella (Chickenpox)Chickenpox is always present in the community and is highly contagious.Prior to the licensing of chicken pox vaccine in 1995, almost all persons inthe U.S. had suffered from chickenpox by adulthood. Chicken pox wasresponsible for an estimated 4 million cases, 11,000 hospitalizations, and100 deaths each year.Chicken pox is usually mild, but may be severe in some infants,adolescents, and adults. Some people who get chicken pox have alsosuffered from complications such as secondary bacterial infections, loss offluids (dehydration), pneumonia, and central nervous system involvementIn addition, only persons who have had chicken pox in the past can get 3 of 7 4/6'001209 PP BEST COPYAVAILABLE 235 ICenters for Disease COMM! -National Immunization Program htip://www.cdc.govinip/publicationsrfargen/WhatIfStop.htm Anf7shingles, a painful inflamation of the nerves. There are about 300,000cases of shingles that occur each year when inactivated chicken pox virusis activated in people who have had chicken pox in the past.From March 1995-August 1999, a total of 18.5 million doses of chickenpox vaccine were distributed in the United States. Vaccine coverageamong children 19-35 months was 43% in 1998.In 1990 in the U.S., the cost of caring for children who contractedchickenpox was estimated as $918 million annually. If we were to stopvaccinating for chicken pox in the U.S., this disease would quickly returnto its previous high rate of infection. As a result, almost every child wouldmiss a week of school (and the parent a week of work), and 50-100varicella- related deaths would occur each year, most of them in previouslyhealthy children and adults.Hepatitis BMore than 2 billion persons worldwide have been infected with thehepatitis Bvirusat some time in their lives. Of these, 350 million arelife-long carriers of the disease and can transmit the virus to others. Onemillion of these people die each year from liver disease and liver cancer.National studies have shown that five percent of Americans --1.25 millionpeoplehave been infected with hepatitis B virus. In addition, thesestudies have shown that about 300,000 people have been infected withhepatitis B virus each year for the two decades prior to 1990. Currently,there are about 125 million people who have life-long hepatitis B virusinfection. Each year about 4,000-5,000 of these people die from relatedliver disease resulting in over $700 million of medical and work-losscosts.Infants and children who become infected with hepatitis B virus are athighest risk of developing lifelong infection, which often leads to deathfrom liver disease (cirrhosis) and liver cancer. Approximately 25% ofchildren who become infected with life-long hepatitis B virus would beexpected to die of related liver disease as adults.CDC estimates that one-third of the life-long hepatitis B virus infections inthe United States resulted from infections occurring in infants and youngchildren. About 16,000 - 20,000 hepatitis B antigen infected women givebirth each year in the United States. It is estimated that 12,000 childrenborn to hepatitis B virus infected mothers were infected each year beforeimplementation of infant immunization programs. In addition,approximately 33,000 children (10 years of age and younger) of motherswho are not infected with hepatitis B virus were infected each year beforeroutine childhood hepatitis B vaccination was recommended.DiphtheriaDiphtheria is a serious disease caused by poison produced from thebacteria. It frequently causes heart and nerve problems. The death rate is5%-10%, with higher death rates (up to 20%) in the very young and theelderly.In the 1920's, diphtheria was a major cause of illness and death for BEST COPYAVAILABLE4/60012..09 PP Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Immunization Program236 btm://vmrsv.cdc.govinip/publications/fsigen/WhatlfStop.Imn children in the U.S. In 1921, a total of 206,000 cases and 15,520 deaths were reported. With vaccine development in 1923, new cases of diphtheriabegan to fall in the U.S., until in 1998 only one case was reported.Although diphtheria is rare in the U.S., it appears that the bacteriacontinues to get passed among people. In 1996, 10 isolates of the bacteriawere obtained from persons in an American Indian community in SouthDakota, none of whom had classic diphtheria disease. There has been one death reported in 1999 from clinical diphtheria caused by a related bacteria.There are high rates of susceptibility among adults. Screening tests conducted since 1977 have shown that 41%-84% of adults 60 and over lack protective levels of circulating antitoxin against diphtheria.Although diphtheria is rare in the U.S., it is still a threat. Diphtheria iscommon in other parts of the world and with the increase in internationaltravel, diphtheria and other infectious diseases are only a plane ride away. If we stopped immunization, the U.S. might experience a situation similar to the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union. With thebreakdown of the public health services in this area, diphtheria epidemicsbegan in 1990, fueled primarily by persons who were not properlyvaccinated. From 1990-1998, more than 150,000 cases and 5,000 deathswere reported.Tetanus (Lock Jaw)Tetanus is a severe, often fatal disease. The bacteria that cause tetanus are widely distributed in soil and street dust, are found in the waste of many animals, and are very resistant to heat and germ-killing cleaners. From1922-1926, there were an estimated 1,314 cases of tetanus per year in the U.S. In the late 1940's, the tetanus vaccine was introduced, and tetanusbecame a disease that was officially counted and tracked by public healthofficials. In 1998, only 45 cases of tetanus were reported in the U.S.People who get tetanus suffer from stiffness and spasms of the muscles.The larynx (throat) can close causing breathing and eating difficulties,.muscles spasms can cause fractures (breaks) of the spine and long bones.Some people go into a coma, and die. Approximately 30% of reportedcases end in death.Tetanus in the U.S. is primarily a disease of adults. From 1995-1997, 35%of reported cases of tetanus occurred among persons 60 years of age orolder, 60% occurred in patients greater than 60 years of age. The NationalHealth Interview Survey found that in 1995, only 36% of adults 65 or older had received a tetanus vaccination during the preceding 10 years.Worldwide, tetanus in newborn infants continues to be a huge problem.Every year tetanus kills 300,000 newborns and 30,000 birth mothers whowere not properly vaccinated. Very recently, an increased number oftetanus cases in younger persons has been observed in the U.S. amongintravenous drug users, particularly heroin users.Tetanus is infectious, but not contagious, so unlike othervaccine-preventable diseases, immunization by members of the 5 of 7416/00 12:09 P1 BEST COPYAVAILABLE Cullers for Disease Control and Prevmuion - National Immunization Program237 littp://svww.cdc.goriniisipublications/fsigenAVhatlfStoplitm community will not protect others from the disease. Because tetanusbacteria is widespread in the environment, tetanus can only be preventedby immunization. If vaccination against tetanus were stopped, persons ofall ages in the U.S. would be susceptible to this serious disease.MumpsBefore the mumps vaccine was introduced, mumps was a major cause ofdeafness in children, occurring in approximately 1/20,000 reported cases.Mumps is usually a mild viral disease. However, rare conditions such asswelling of the brain, nerves and spinal cord can lead to serious sideeffects such as paralysis, seizures, and fluid in the brain.Serious side effects of mumps are more common among adults thanchEdren. Swelling of the testes is the most common side effect in malespast the age of puberty, occurring in up to 20-50% of men who contractmumps. An increase in spontaneous abortions has been found amongwomen who develop mumps during the first trimester of pregnancy. An estimated 212,000 cases of mumps occurred in the U.S. in 1964. Aftervaccine licensure in 1967, reports of mumps decreased rapidly. In 1986and 1987, there was a resurgence of mumps with 12,848 cases reported in1987. Since 1989, the incidence of mumps has declined, with a total of606 cases in 1998. This recent decrease is probably due to the fact thatchildren have received a second dose of mumps vaccine (part of thetwo-dose schedule for measles, mumps, rubella or Mh112) and the eventualdevelopment of immunity in those who did not gain protection after thefirst mumps vaccination.If we were to stop vaccination against mumps, we could expect thenumber of cases to climb back to pre-vaccine levels, since mumps is easilyspread among unvaccinated persons.Rotavirus The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted onOctober 22, 1999 to no longer recommend rotavirus vaccine for infants.The action is based on the results of a review of scientific data presentedto the ACIP by CDC in cooperation with the FDA, NIH, and Public HealthService officials, along with Wyeth-Lederle, the manufacturer of thevaccine. Data from the review indicated a strong association betweenRotashield vaccine and a rare occurrence of intussusception (bowelobstruction) among some infants during the first 1.2 weeks followingvaccination.Rotavirus and other causes of severe diarrhea remain a serious healthconcern for young children in the United States. In the U.S., rotavirusdisease has been associated with approximately 50,000 hospitalizationsand at least 20 deaths per year.CDC has started a national education program to help parents managesevere diarrhea in children, the most serious complication of rotavirusillness. Education efforts will include outreach to parents through theirhealth care providers and directly to parents through popular media such 6 of 7 416/0012:09 Pt BEST COPY AVAILABLE 243 238 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - National Immunization Program htm://www.edc.govinip/publications/fs/genfWbatItSiop.htm as parent magazines and radio public service announcements, in English and Spanish.Parents are urged to learn steps to relieve diarrhea symptoms which may lead to severe dehydration and the need for immediate medical care. Signs of severe dehydration in children include decrease urination or wetting of diapers, crying without tears, sunken eyes, unusual drowsiness or fussiness and dry, sticky mouth.

On Apnl 10 and 11, 1995, the National Institutes of Health(NIH), in response to a Congressional request, assembled a working group ofdistinguished scientists at the Hill to assess the state of the science in autism,identify gaps in knowledge, and make recommendations to the NIH regardingpromising areas for future research. Researchers in autism and related areas;representatives of the Autism Society of America; the Autism National Com-mittee; and invited consultants contributed to the discussions reflected in thisreport.Follow-up sessions were held at the national conferences of the AutismSociety of America and the Autism National Committee. Thoughtful com-ments on the preliminary draft of this report were received from the Aprilconference participants, al the follow-up parent conferences, and over a4-month period from other professionals, parents, and self-advocates. Sci-entists listed as authors of the Report chaired one or more of the confer-ence sessions. Major presentations at the conferences are summarized inthe individual papers that follow the Report.The NIH and follow-up conferences were cosponsored by the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the NationalInstitute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), theNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Instituteof Neurological Disorders and Stroke (HINDS). In keeping with the Con-gressional mandate, questions of interest to the NIH formed the basis forthe conference and served as the framework for this report. These ques-tions were developed by the NIH Inter-Institute Autism Conference Co-ordinating Committee: Duane Alexander (NICHD), conference convener;Judith (NIDCD); Felix Cruz ( NICHD); Peter DIAGNOSISC. Lord Response 1: Is there a universally accepted definition of autism? Is theresufficient scientific evidence to support this current definition of autism spec -(mm disorders as separate from other developmental disorders? For the firstSluts al Ihe :inaneItr time, there are consistent criteria for diagnosis of autism sped.mienin both DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and ICL-10 (In-ternational Classification of Diseases, 10th ed., World Health Organization,1993). The working group agreed that there is both national and interna-tional support for these newly published definitions. The precision of thesedefinitions will continue to evolve as new research clarifies the phenotype(visible characteristics of autism). Identification of one or more biologicalmarkers for autism disorders is needed to diagnose definitely atypical cases.Strong empirical support in the DSM-IV international Field Thais andother NIH-funded research, however, indicates that the clinical diagnosisof autism remains one of the most reliable diagnoses in psychlook or devel-opmental research. Additional research is needed to establish the validityof the diagnosis in terms of criteria based on etiology, course, and responseto treatment.Definitions of Rett syndrome (RS) and childhood disintegrative disor-der (CDD) also yielded clear, consistent differences from Autism (A) andfrom other disorders in the DSM-IV Field 'Dials (cf. Volkmar, followingpaper) and in other studies. Current definitions appear adequate for esti-mates of the incidence andprevalence of these disorders in the UnitedStates. The new definition of Asperger syndrome (AS) makes the distinc-tion between A and AS clear and so provides the first opportunity to assessthe incidence and prevalence of AS separate from A. A category such asPervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)is still needed, but would be more appropriately entitled \"Atypical Autism\"for cases that meet some, but not all of the criteria for autism. Standardmeasures that yield these diagnoses across the age span from 3 years toadulthood are now available and used widely in research in North Americaand Europe.Question 2: How do the tharacterislics of autism, Asperger syndrome,Reit syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder change with develop-ment? There are a number of studies in which characteristics of A, RS,and CDD are compared in different age groups of children, adolescents,and/or adults (i.e., cross-sectional studies). However, there are few studiesfollowing the same children as they age so we have little evidence of howindividuals actually change across the life-span (i.e., longitudinal studies).Asperger syndrome is a term that has been used frequently with adolescentsand adults rather than with young children, so we have few cross-sectionalor longitudinal data on AS.Several relatively large-scale, high quality, follow-up studies exist ofpsychometric (mental measurement test) data for autistic individuals. Thesestudies have shown that the diagnosis of autism continues to apply as thechildren age and change, even after they have developed language. Longi- data are needed (or all autism spectrum disorders in orderto Irauals' paths of development. Such data would enable us to define thecourse of the disorders, to aid in projecting clinical outcomes, and to planfor clinical intervention at various ages.Question 3: What other disorders drat occur as separate disorders in con-junction with autism (conzarbld conditions) must be taken into account in thediagnosis and assessment of au dun, Aspesger syndrome, Rest syndram4 andchildhood &integrative dire:der? Most, but not all persons with A also havesome degree of mental retardation. There is now a very clear expectation inbelusviond research that degree of mental retardation and severity of lan-guage deficit must be considered in designing and Interpreting studies of theautism spectrum disorders. These co-occurring factors (mental retardationand degree of language deficit) have received less consideration In biomedicalresearch. Lack of control for mental retardation and language deficits maybe one reason why the replication rate of findings (Le., multiple investigatorsobtaining the same findings) within biomedical research has typically beenmuch lower than within behavioral research. Theimportance of diagnosis ofcomorbid (co.eccurring) conditions such as affective disorder (e.g., depres-sion) or obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly in adults with autism spec-trum disorders is also recognised, but standard procedures to do so are notwell established. These await further research. It is particularly important toclarify the difference.between true comorbklity and other ways in which symp-toms from autism and different disorders may overlap.Question 4: What additional research In autism, its related conditions, orrelevant nonnative behaviors it needed to clarify subgroups in this heterogeneouspopulation?Many investigators have proposed different subgroups in autismand these differ depending upon thetheory that the particular research groupespouses about the cause and/or central deficit in autism (e.g., language, mo-tor problems, immune and/or serotonergic system differences). However,often the neurobiologicul or other feature purported to differentiate betweenor among subgroups is itself of questionable reliability. Studies of subgroupsare important, but are premature if they are conducted using approachesthat are not reliable or well established. One or more biological markers (e.g.,genetic or neurocitemical) is urgently needed to distinguish autism from otherdisorders and to distinguish subgroups within the autism spectrum disorders. Recommendations of the Working Group on Diagnosis1. Use of standard diagnostic procedures that operationalize (specifyfor research) DEM-IV/ICD-10 criteria is needed to promote communication247among scientists, clinicians,and parents, and replicability netts.el.Di-agnoses are not beingmade consistently in clinical or research settings.2. Identification of individuals with AS and the investigation of externalfactors that validate the distinction between AS and A, and between ASand related learning disabilities is a high priority as well as investigationof the distinctions between severe autism and severe/profound rants, re-tardation.3. A central registry of persons with CDD is needed to enable re-searchers to find enough well - defined casts for the scientific study of CDDand for clinical information purposes. A standard protocol for clinical in-vestigations of children with disintegrative disorders is also needed.4. Longitudinal studies are crucial in order to provide data concerningdifferences and similarities in the individual developmental patterns (tra-jectories) of children with autism, particularly for the highest functioningindividuals whose accompliShments may have been,underestimated.5. Establishing diagnostic criteria for very young (under age 3) childrenwith autism is an urgent priority. The national trend away from specificdiagnosesfor young children in favor of generic terms such as \"develop-mentally delayed\" will result in a lack of appropriate early interventionservices for children with autism. Continued development of reliablescreening as well as diagnostic instruments is a critical need.6. Studies that allow more accurate description of adults with autism,particularly those that address issues in the transition from school to work,arc a high priority.7.lb be useful, studies of subgroups must be hypothesis driven (i.e.,address a specific research question) and must validate subgroups using reliable, well-established measures that are not part of the diagnostic features.8. Studies of subgroups that have been replicated across independentcenters and across time, and those that address significant aspects of diag-nosis such as course, response to treatment and well-defined levels of eti-ology (causes), pathophysiology (mechanism of structural and functionalchanges), and behavioral repertoire are a high priority. Studies of sex dif-ferences in autism are also clearly needed.9. Minimum standards for comparison groups in studies of autism in-clude comparability on mental handicap, degree of language impairment,and comorbidity (co-occurrence) of other conditions10. ht studies of comorbidity of other disorders such as depression orobsessive-compulsive disorder, there is an urgent need to develop standard,reliable procedures for diagnosis of such disorders in individuals withautism, particularly in those with insufficient verbal skills for typical meth-ods to be employed. (j. Research is urgently needed to assess the following interrelated qt.r) (a) Does having autism and another disorder change the nature andparticularly the response to treatment of the comorbld disorders? (b) Arepersons with autism more at risk than other people for certain other disor-ders? (c) Are there symptoms or other disorderi not currently included inthe phenotype of autism that arc so common in autism that they might betterbe considered part of autism, for example, certain movement disorders? EPIDEMIOLOGYE. J. CostelloEpidemiology is the branch of medical science that deals with the in-cidence, distribution, and control of disease in a population (Webster's).Prevalence refers to the rate of the disorder present In the population ata given point in time. Incidence refers to the number of new cases occurringin the population during a given period. Response to NM QuestionsQuestion I: What is the bed empirically substantiated estimate of theprevalence of autism spectrum disorders in children and adults In the UnitedStates, and in oilier countries? There are no prevalence estimates specificallyfor the United States, but recent studies from Canada and from Japan in-dicate that autism is not a rare disorder. Both studies found prevalencerates of autism greater than 10 per 10,000. However, these studies usedfairly small (<100,000) samples, and the confidence limits are wide (-15per 10,000). A rate of at least 22 per 10,000 has been estimated for thebroader autism spectrum disorders. Because of similarities between theUnited States and Canada, the Canadian data arc likely to be reasonableestimates of prevalence In the United Slates for most purposes. Given theavailable data, there is little justification for the potential costs of a nationalprevalence study of autism in the United States merely to estimate theprevalence of autism spectrum disorders. Money would be better spent ondevelopmental risk-assessment or cost-benefit studies.Question 2: What efforts are currently underway to improve estimates ofprevalence of autism in children? How can these studies as planned or withmodification, answer the Congressional question regarding prevalence in theUnited States? There are a few studies of the prevalence of childhood dis-orders underway or in the planning stage. It is possible that autism could243Susie ul Ile Smotebe included in one or more of these studies. The difficultiesnogsoare formidable.There are two main approaches to obtain prevalence estimates ofautism: population-based studies (finding persons with autism In the wholenumber of people in a country or region), or studies of treated populations(finding the number of persons with autism in the populations of treatmentsettings such as hospitals, clinics, special education settings). Population-based studies provide unbiased samples since everyone is potentially in-eluded, but require very large samples to identify reasonable estimate* adisorders like autism (e.g., 500-1,000 households would have to be surveyedto identify 1 child with autism). It is estimated that a sample of over 100,000children would be needed to produce reliable estimates of the prevalenceof autism with greater precision than is currently available in the interna-tional epidemic:tingle literature. Children with autism could be counted insmaller treatment-based studies since they are usually referred for services.However, problems Include the following: (a) itis difficult to be certainyou have foundall treatment settings; (b) not all settings will be willing toparticipate; and (c) well-functioning children will be underestimated sincethey may not be served In the special treatment settings. The NIMH hasrecently funded a network of university sites to conduct epidemiologic re-search on childhood disorders. This network of centers, called UNOC-CAPwill study the Use, Need, Outcomes, and Cost of Child and AdolescentPopulations. Both population-based and treated-sample studies will be car.rigid out in UNOC-CAP and specific diagnostic measures will be included.These sites are already funded and procedures specific to the screeningand diagnosis of complex disorders in children have been developed.The National Health Interview Survey is too small to yield valid na-tional estimates of autism. It also uses lay interviewers who may have dif-ficulty in administering a respondent-based interview to identify a disorderlike autism. The only U.S. study other titan UNOC-CAP known to usediagnostic measures, the Project on Human Development In Chicago neigh-borhoods, Is also too small and geographically too localized. Other ongoingnational surveys are too small, do not include the relevant information, orcould nut be adapted easily to identify autism reliably.Question 3: Whet contributions can epidentiologk research make to un-derstanding the etiology and/or treatment of autism spectrum dimniers? Know-ing how many and where cases of a disorder occur in the population(descriptive epidemiology) Is useful for assessing: (a) the number of individu-ate and families affected by a problem; (b) the size of the financial costs tobe expected; (c) the relative cost burden to families, states, and the federalgovernment, or to different service agencies (e.g., education, health, childwelfare, juvenile justice); (d) the distribution of the cost and need for serv- 'auto% hint el at. it,arious geographic, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups; (e) the rise andfall in rates of the disorder over time, and, potentially, the impact of newsocial policies and treatments on prevalence and outcomes.Some of the most powerful uses of epidemiology in medicine are asan analytic methodology, that is, ns a way of testing hypotheses about causesof disease and the consequences of prevention or treatment strategies. Theworking group believes that analytic epidemiology can make important con-tributions to improving understanding of etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.Etiology. Genetic epidemiology has already shown its importance forunderstanding etiology, and this importance will grow, not only as moregenes are identified but as the functional roles of those genes are under-stood developmentally. Preventive interventions have to be based on etio-logic theory; thus every intervention study is an implicit test of theory.Descriptive epidemiology can provide the basic hypotheses for interven-tions, as well as the methodology for testing the theory.Diagnosis. The process of turning a taxonomy such as DSM-IV intoinstruments for epidemiologic studies helps to tighten the diagnostic criteria,making them more reliable for both epidemiologic and clinical purposes.The process of developing screening instruments helps to refine diagnosisby identifying the core symptoms and the range of variability of the diag-nosis. Developmental epidemiology helps to track the developmental se-quencing of patterns of symptoms and the impact of symptoms at one timeon functioning at a later stage. Longitudinal studies also help to identifythe development of compensatory strategies to cope with earlier symptoms.Reatment. In an epidemiologic context, every, treatment is an experi-ment, testing the validity of a causal theory. Clinical epidemiology, a highlydeveloped aspect of research in many areas of medicine, has hardly gaineda foothold yet in psychiatry or child development, but can provide a frame-work for comparing the cost-effictiveness of various treatment approaches,and examining the outcome of treatment trials for what they say about thecauses of disorder and functional impairment. Recommendations of the Working Group on Epidemiology1, The Canadian data on prevalence arc adequate for most U.S. uses.Rather than funding a national prevalence study of autism, autism should beincluded as one of the childhood disorders in the screening stage of theNItval UNOC-CAP studies. A follow-up of all potential cases could then bedone through UNOC-CAP with a more intensive evaluation, perhaps usingexperienced clinicians and one of the standard assessment.packages currentlyin use in autism research. The UNOC-CAP population sample will not ex-249rsState of the &lame t29 ceed 20,000 in all, but can establish rates of autism spectrum d.ers forthe general population. It will be too small to produce reliable rates for mi-nority populations or to allow comparisons of stable rates for different agegroups. The treated samples will not exceed 4,000, and are likely to yieldlocalized rather than national estimates. However, the data from UNOC -CAPwould provide significant, cost-effective additions to current US. informationon autism, particularly since prevalence data will he collected in the contextof service use and need, cost, and treatment outcome.2. Research should be implemented to address the following issues:(a) Variations in the longitudinal course of autism, from early childhoodinto adulthood: Why do some children do well and some poorly? (b)\"Boundary conditions\" around autism: What is the rate of strictly definedautism relative to the rates of other types of pervasive developmental dis-orders, and teaming disabilities? (c) Patterns of autism-like deficits In fami-lies of children or adults with autism: What is the prevalence of theseproblems? (d) At what age do children who will develop autism becomeidentifiable? (e) Sociodemographic correlates of autism: What are they?(1) What other disorders (e.g., seizures, depression) may occur during dif-ferent developmental stages and in which subgroups in autism? (g) Costsassociated with the appropriate treatment of children with autism: Whatare the costs associated with different types of lifetime support of personswith autism and their families? The working group believes that these issuescan best be addressed indevelopmentally focused, longitudinalepidemiologic studies that follow families over time. Such studies need toinclude not only the child but also the family.3. There was support in the working group for a national autism reg-istry. Registries have proved to be invaluable tools in clinical epidemiology.Such registries have been very useful in some other branches of medicine(e.g., tumor registries, birth is the appropriate framework for studying autism? Arethere multiple genetic loci and would this present insurmountable obstacles to Width ri7 The consensus is that them must be heterogeneity (differemgenii being responsible in different families) within the autism spectrumdisorders end this will undoubtedly make the search for etiologic factorsmore difficult. However. the goal is obtainable. Even if numerous loci con-tribute to autism and the sibling relative risk is therefore much lower titanreported, it would take possibly 400 sib pairs and 300-400 marker loci tomap the gene. That is a sample which could be achieved with internationalcooperation and an NIH-directed effort.Question 2: Ave there genetic models andlor genetic tediniques that havebeen used successfully with other developmental disorders that may be appli-cable to autism? (hinny studies of affected pain of relatives is definitelythe method of choice for the time being as it avoids having to workup andclassify borderline and problematic cases. Actually locating the responsiblegenetic loci after mapping to a general gene region is a very difficult task.This work would be aided by association tests and linkage disequilibriumand therefore these tests are also applicable but must be applied in specialpopulations to be most informative. It is essential any time family data arecollected to consider, ahead of time, the restrictions imposed by geneticmethodology and whenever possible take those into account when design-ing the studies. Epidemiology has provided sufficiently accurate estimatesof the prevalence for the genetic analyses but also contributes by providingquality data on subtypes and comorbid conditions. Note also the query un-der Unresolved Issues regarding evaluating the need for a large twin study.(See recommendations for specific research below.)Question 1: Do genetic and environmental foams act Mrough commonmechanisms to trigger the pathophysiology associated with autism? It is rtotpremature to investigate gene-environment interactions. In fact. there wasn strong consensus at the meeting that there must be relevant environmentalfactors even in the face of the genetic evidence. Even ninnoxygotic (M7identical) twin pairs are not always concordant for autism (do not both al-ways linve or not have autism). immune irregularities also suggest a rolefor pathogens, and findings of minor physical anomalies suggest a delay ordisruption in curly development. Given the complexity of autism from a clini-cal neurologic perspective, it appears highly likely that there is a commonpathophysiologic sequence that is triggered in various ways by epigeneticand/or environmental factors. Clear identification of subtypes anti rigorousstudies on defining cornorbid conditions will be a major first step in researchlit this area. Longitudinal studies arc also an essential means of obtainingcritical information regarding gene-environment interactions. Additional re-search on environmental causes or precipitants is. clearly warranted.The natural course of the autism spectrum disorders and the early pre-dictors of later diagnosis are not yet well Identified and understood. Therer:r,ofu13IStale at Ow Schneeis a sense that studies in these areas arc making progress emsweld beencouraged for a variety of reasons. An important contributionof thesestudies will be a better understanding of the developmental stagesand criti-.cal times in the course of the disorders. This will be invaluable in under-standing gents-environmentinteractions.Question 4. How can the genetic basis for autism be confirmedand featheridentified? We are definitely ready to test gene linkage hypothesesbylnitiatinga formal genome searchfocused primarily on multiplex families (see below).However, there is no reason why these genetic family studies could not alsoserve as the primaryvehicle for obtaining all the essential clinical and treat-ment data possible on theaffected individuals and common relevant variableson the relatives. This procedure would avoid the expense of mounting bothgenetic and other studiesand also improve measurably the quality of thegenetic analyses. This multidisciplinary approach is exactly the onethat hasproven so effectivein other complex diseases (such as breast cancer) whichhave seen quantum leaps in knowledge in the past couple of years. Recommendations of the Igniting Group on Etiology The search for the etiology (underlying causes) of the autism spectrumdisorders is intertwined with research on diagnosis, pathophysiology,andtreatment. Information fromeach of these areas helps to point the waytoward possible causes. In turn, each of these other areas awaits discoveryof the biological marker(s) for autism needed to expand and confirm itsown findings. The working group on etiology recommendsthe followingresearch priorities.1. Genetic Analyses. There was remarkable consensus al the meetingthat autism is a genetic condition. Mapping studies should be undertakento identify the geneticloci that contribute directly to the disorder. Thefamilial relative risks are sufficiently large to indicate the action of geneticfactors and estimates of thenumber of loci involved are on the order of3-6. F o r those r e a s o n s it was suggested that studies be initiated wingaf-fected pairs of relatives methodology (probably sib pairs, I.e., pairs of sib-lings). The informationfrom the I lumen Comae Project, namely, thehuman fine-resolution genetic map, is exactly the required information toplan and carry out asuccessful gene= search for loci contributing to theautism spectrum disorders. In addition, the parallel development of desig-nated experimental organism maps and their sequencing will also contrib-ute if/when appropriate animal models for specific aspects of the spectrumare developed. However, there are several important concerns and issuesto be addressed 11 this research is to be sufficiently rigorous to have a rea- metald al sonable chance of success, especially in view of the expected genetic het-erogeneity (different genes being responsible in different families): (a) Avery strictly applied set of diagnostic and sceiodemographic criteria is es-sential In selecting individuals for these studies. Research on stand-ardization of screening and diagnostic techniques and definitions ofsubtypes is directly relevant here. (b) The best strategy for ascertainment(identification of subjects) is to focus on multiplex families (more than oneaffected Individual in the same family who independently meet criteria fordiagnosis) to minimize the problems with uncertain or borderline cases. (c)From the beginning, the available sample should be split into two sebum-pies, one for detecting the loci and another for validating the results. Thesefamilies are sufficiently rare that if most are inadvertently used to detectthe linkage it will not be possible to confirm the results without an unduetime delay. (d) Careful consideration must be given to the design of thestudy because of the vast amount of work necessary to have sufficient ge-netic markers to complete a thorough genome search (which is requiredin the absence of good candidate genes). Therefore, the design will needto carefully weigh the three points above as well as the possibility of col-lecting parents and single cases (trios) for haplotype relative risk analyseswhich will be essential in finding the specific loci responsible after identi-fying a region of the genome through linkage analyses.Pamibi Sandier. It is important to emphasize that studies of familymembers have roles in addition to tits linkage studies discussed above. Forexample, the gender ratio difference in autism is striking and families offemales with autism may provide clues for understanding this difference ifcarefully studied. The following are other possibilities, but not an exhaustivelist: (a) Geneticists should be included in planning any family studies sincesome (not all) of the more rigorous genetic analyses require that familiesbe identified in a manner that can be specified in the likelihood equations.This ascertainment must be defined before the families arc selected forstudy. By including this prior planning, families will be eligible for inclusionIn the genetic studies as well as providing data for other purposes. (b) Fam-ily studies provide a unique opportunity to test whether or not the definedsubtypes (e.g., clinical, drug response, language acquisition) also point todetectable differences in siblings and parents, recurrence risk (genetic sub-groups), or other important features. Several areas of research, includingneurochemistry and language studies, already have data indicating thatsome but not all families have nonautistie members who also display de-tectable differences when studied.3. Epidensiological Studies. Current estimates of prevalence of autismare sufficient for the genetic analyses and no further precision is requiredat this time. I tuwever, the epidemiology approach would provide invaluable251State of the Selma 533 information in the definition of subtypes, a:morbid conditions. anddocu-mentation of the range of variable expression of all of the spectrum dis-orders through the correct sampling and statistical analyses of the requireddata. Possible environmental causes or precipitants of autism may also berevealed. UNOC-CAP data would be useful in this regard.4. Sratistkal Issues: Throughout the conference, there were discussionsabout the need for statistical rigor in diagnosis, defining subtypes, identifyingrisk factors, designing studies, and determining sample sizes. All the pointsraised are essential for the quality of the data and directly affect the geneticstudies. These issues arc discussed elsewhere in the report (cf. Statistics be-low), but should also be considered in any discussion of genetics.5. Animal Models. Research in animal models, as with all good re-search, should be hypothesis driven (i.e,, designed to answer a specific, test-able question). However, there arc now several good reasons why timeshould be spent considering appropriate animal models with the possibilityof using them. to move the research forward more quickly. For many ofthe biological variables, and quite possibly for the behavioral variables (suchas cognition), study in animal models permits rapid breeding schemes whichlead directly to estimates of heritability and number of involved loci. Addedto that now is the directcomparability of the genetic maps among organ-isms (e.g., mouse and man) which facilitates the identification of genes inen experimental organism and their immediate location in man. There aretwo recent examples of thisapproach. First is the cloning of an obesitygene in the mouse and theidentification of the human homolog the sameday by computer search. Although no one knows the role of this locus inhuman obesity, there is now a specific candidate gene for etiology andpathophysiology studies. Second is the recent request for applications forstudies to develop the genetic map in the rat issued because the investi-gators in hypertension arc very close to mapping a number of loci thathave significant effects in the different forms of the disease. The hope againis to move directly from the rat results to test for the importance of thehomologous regions in the human genome.6. Unresolved Issues. There are several additional areas of possible fu-ture research that have been identified its the discussions of directions forgenetic studies: (a) The role of immune factors in the autism spectrumdisorders is not resolved and warrants sufficient studies to clarify the situ-ation. There may be indications that serotonin level and the immune re-sponse are correlated and this should be confirmed or denied as soon aspossible. (b) MZ (identical) twins provide a unique experiment since theymust share all Moir genes but are well documented to differ in importantenvironmental factors including prenatal and developmental stochasticprocesses. The comparison of twins either discordant (one with autism, one 0,4001 /ft alwithout) or concordant (both with autism) could provide insight into bothgenetic and environmental factors of importance. An issue for discussionis whether or not it is cost-effective and scientifically useful to mount alarge epidemiologic twin study to identify a sample of MZ and DZ twinsfor study, There are very/ few twin pairs in the literature, most from Euro-pean studies and single case reports (US.), Should the study be done inthe Unitcd States or is an international study needed? (c) Numerous casesof autism are reported with chromosomal variants (ins' may. translocatlons,etc.) but many of these were identified before the high resolution bandingstudies were available and before breakpoints could be cloned and uniquelyidentified. These cases should be collected and the newer studies performedto assess whether or not there are specific chromosome changes involvedwith the clinical features of this disorder. (d) Linkage (*equilibrium is alit-ked via haplotype sharing and association studies to more precisely pin-point the locution of genes than is possible through linkage studies. lbsuccessfully apply thls approach it is necessary to utilize populations thatare genetic isolates or those known to have descended from a few founders(i.e.. Finland). Are there identifiable populations that fit these require-ments in which autism spectrum disorders are documented to occur, andwhere the prevalence of the disorders would warrant initiating such studies? BRAIN MECHANISMSM. DencklaResponses to NIff QuestionsQuestion 1: What and fitnctional pathways appear to beaffected it, autism? What key steps in development (timing, type, and loci)that are particularly sensitive to genetic or environmental insults are likely tobe associated with autism? Research studies in autism in the last 15 yearsusing a wide range of technologies have provided evidence of a biologicalbasis for autism. Information from neuropathology indicates that there maybe abnormalities in the amygdata, hippocampus, septum, mandible), bodies,mind the cerebellum. Autistic brains arc slightly larger and heavier. (Clinicalmeasures also indicate a larger than normal head circumference.) In the!indite system, there is an excess of cells and they are too small. The neu-rons themselves seem developmentally immature with a truncation in thedevelopment of their deudritic trees, which provide the basis for connee-dons between neurons. Moreover, Purkinje cells arc affected in a wide-spread fashion in the cerebellum. The anatomic differences found are\")r4.rsaSloes of nu Sokoto n 135 consistent with a developmental curtailment that takes place at some pointearlier than 30 weeks gestation (before birth). The neuropathologic findingsare reasonably consistent and appear to dovetail with the lesion studies inprimates. Exactly which findings aro universal in autism and specific onlyto autism remain to be demonstrated.Contemporary imaging research coupled with sophisticated neuropsy-chologic tools also offers exciting research possibilities for studying brainstructure and function in vivo, particularly as new technology in both imageacquisition and image analysis is developed. As with all research in autism,standardized diagnosis and control for age, gender, degree of mental re-tardation, language, and comorbid conditions are essential in interpretingthese findings. The identification of reliably occurring subtypes and sub-groups will be absolutely critical with all methodologies, as we can expectthat a variety of brain structures and mechanisms may exist for subtypeswith differing etiologies.Across methodologies, studies reveal both higher and lower order areas that are dysfunctional.Neuropsychological studies have been uniformin finding deficits in certain aspects of higher order cognitive functions,Including abstract and pragmatic language, encoding of complex informs-don, and executive (frontal) functions. Other aspects of higher order cog-nitive functions, particularly those involved in verbal syntax and visuospatialorganization are often spared In higher functioning individuals. Deficits incertain aspects of attentionsl functioning also are common and lower func-tioning persons with autism may also exhibit severe receptive and expressivelanguage impairments, including mutism and a deficit in declarative memory. In contrast, rote memory often is intact. Evoked potential studies havealso provided evidence of abnormalities in late information processing re-lated to both frontal and parietal cortex. In contrast, evoked potential stud-les of early and midtatency potentials have demonstrated intact functionin tome subcortical areas. This profile motor, oculovestibular, and postural physiology methodology.However, in terms of the tinting, type, and locus of the originatingabnormality in autism, the data from neuropathology suggest that otherareas remote from the neocortex may be the beginning of the pathophysi-\u00b0logical cascade. The universal impairment in social cognition found inneuropsychologic studies of autism suggests involvement of certain brainregions known to mediate social and emotional behavior, namely, regionsof the limbic system, such as the antygdula and orbital frontal cortex. Ani-mal research indicates that limbic lesions my cause secondary dysfunctionin the neocortex. There is precedence in other diseases for rids pathway,for example, progressive supemucloar palsy (PSP). Autopsy results in PSPshow defects in the upper brain stem. However, PET scans in vivo show *twat...41tal area dysfunction. Frontal area functions arc closer to the surfaceand have an amplified effect on scans. The upper brain stem may not prop-erly activate the frontal area. What Is most obvious in in vivo imaging maynot necessarily reflect the basic defect.Thken together, the available evidence in autism suggests that, al-though certain aspects of brain functioning are often spiral in autism, thesyndrome nevertheless involves widespread brain dysfunction at both thecortical and subcortical levels. The originating site of the brain injury hasnot been identified. The competition of \"top down\" and \"Ixmont up\" hy-potheses for are pathophysiological cascade in autistic development pro-vides a fruitful area for future research.At the subeellular level, neurochemistry research has provided consis-tent evidence of an elevation in a major neurotransmitter, serolonin, whichaffects potentiation at synapses and may play a rote in the development ofthe nervous system. In terms of pathophysiology, It appears that there is ashared expression of a mutant gene in brain and platelet with respect tohyperserotonemia. Genetic analysis of the primary structure of the relevantneurochemicals is likely to be important for autism which has a sibling re-currence rate 4 to 10 times higher than that of insulin - dependent diabetesmellitus (IDDNI) which has been found to have a genetic basis. Identifiedmutations could provide the first useful animal models of autism by ho-mology, although animals will have a more limited behavioral repertoire.Question 1: What behaviors observed in autism are consistent with theneuroanatomic findings? Neuropsychological animal and human studieshave demonstrated the key roles that some of the brain areas affected inautism may play, particularly in social/emotional development. Studies ofthe amygdata indicate its importance in recognition of the affective (emo-tional) significance of stimuli, in social stimulus-reward associations thatallow understanding of the connections between behaviors and their con-sequences, in perception of body movements and eye gaze direction, inorienting toward social stimuli, and, together with the hippocampus, its rolein tong-term memory. Representation of action plans, motor planning andexecution, and working memory are associated with the frontal lobe andthe basal ganglia. There have been reports of late-onset symptoms in thefrontostriatal system in monkeys who experienced early limbic system le-sions. Rapid shifts in attention and modulation of sensory input have beenassociated with the cerebellum. Neurochemical strategies could be used tostudy specific behaviors in response to specific neurochernicals that aremost likely to have an impact on the developmeqt of those regions thoughtto be involved in autism.in terms of etiology, much deltaic has occurred regarding the identi-fication of a single primary deficit at the cognitive level. Rather than fo-2'13State at Ms Sdeate (1111.14,137 cueing on the Identification of n primary brain structure that is abnormal.it is important to recognize that multiple structures at multiple levels ofthe neuroaxis have clearly been implicated and all these structures partici-pate. in the neural systems that influence behavior. The patitophytiology ofautism, or the structural and functional abnormalities of the brain and howprecisely they result in the abnormal behavior of autism is for more complexthan what brain structures or neurochemicals are involved. Each level ofanalysis is highly complex and, at present, only pieces of this puzzle inautism hove been Identified.Question 3: What are the critical influences that the process of develop-ment brings to the design of experiments and the interpretation of findings?Development clearly changes the outward expression of the signs and symp7toms of autism. In addition, the changing signs and symptoms of authm.must be compared to the changing backdrop of normal development Inwhich the outward expression of normal abilities are also changing. In ad-dition to variability associated whit aging is the variability that occurs innormal humans in relation to general intellect and, is some cases, also gen-der and, in autism, in relation to severity of the disorder and developmentaltiming of onset, that is. congenital (at birth) or regression after apparentlynormal development. In assessing clinical functions, this means that differ-ent tests will be needed for different age- and ability-level individuals andthat comparison groups must be matched on these relevant variables. Withneurobiologic measures, these same variables of age, level of function, gen-der, and onset have a major impact and must be carefully considered indefining normative values and deviations from this norm. Several suchmethods including imaging and electrophysiotogic cohesion measures havedemonstrated that there are important and predictable changes in the re-lationships between measurements in different regions over the course ofnormal development. These factors require as careful attention to the se-lection of control subjects as to the rigor of diagnosis of autism.Primate models also illustrate the importance of the role of develop-ment in the pathophysiologie cascade. Depending on the exact timing ofthe lesion, early injury to one part of the brain may result in later deficitsin that part or in another part of the brain remote from the site of theoriginal lesion. With certain known animal brain lesions, there Wool muchdifficulty as an infant but there is significant social and working memorydifficulty in adulthood. How profound the autistic-like behaviors are inmonkeys depends on how early in the developmental process the brain le-sions were made. Only through longitudinal animal studies can one findout what was primary and what was secondary. Longitudinal as opposedto cross-sectional studies could indicate whether subcortical findings areearlier and cortical findings are secondary to those deficits or vice versa, Bristol et r(.81)uestion 4: Does the available evidence suggest that there are plena-tallperinatal events associated with autism? If so, are they specific to autism,are they likely to be causal. and can they be used for clinical prognosis andthe development of treatment strategies? The available evidence suggests thatthere may be more problems in pregnancy or at birth, or more health prob-lems immediately after birth. In children with autism than In control fami-lies. Risk fatuori such as maternal age, prematurity, bleeding in pregnancy,toxemia, viral infection or exposure; and poor vigor in the neonatal periodhave been studied.' However, there is little evidence that these problemsare consistent across cases of autism or that they are specific to autismsince they are also found in disorders such as dyslexia or developmentallanguage disabilities. Such problems do not predict to later autism, nor dothey appear to be related to asphyxia. These factors do not appear to causeautism, but may be reflections that fetal or neonatal development was com-promised in some way. Recommendations of the Working Group on Brain AgeohanisnisI. Investigation of brain structures in vivo with imaging methods is amajor priority. At present, there are few data on most brain structures inautism. Cross-sectional, whole-brain studies at various ages are an essentialfirst step in defining the relevant neuroanatomic focus for later studies.Functional MItI is a developing method that provides an opportunity forlooking at the function of neural circuits without the hazards of radiationinherent to PET scans. Longitudinal studies in this area may be prematureat this time until the rapidly changing technology stabilizes to allow forconsistent measurements across time.2. The use of the technology of neuropsychology, both human and pri-mate, can help sort out specific aspects of clinical functioning and refineknowledge of hypothesized relationships between cognitive deficits and be-havioral difficulties. Methodological developments in this research area arealso needed to define the testing paradigms necessary for nuclear magneticresonance imaging of the functional variety.3. 'lb expand knowledge of neuroanatomical findings, the need for ac-cess to a user-friendly brain bank was emphasized. Use of such a brainbank would lead to a greater number of appropriately age-, gender-, andcognitive-level matched controls being made available for study. Appropri-ate allocation of brain material to many different disciplines would allowthe fuller use of postmortem brain samples for the study of specific anat-omy and contribute to the urgently needed refinement of quantitative re-search methods for analysis, It would also permit staining of circuits that25Slate of the Schotttri139 are associated with certain neurotransmitter pathways for use 3,Meetlydriven studies about the action of protein.4. Studies of primary structure of relevant neurochemicals by geneticanalysis are needed, since genetic study is mainly a tool to study mare-chemicals in terms of determining which, when, and where prqteins areexpressed in the developing nervous system. For example, proteins involvedin the development of neurons shown to be abnormal from poilmortemstudies can be examined by DNA analysis available from Wood or salivafrom well-characterized patients who may be followed prospectively.5. In an effort to Identify key mechanisms in the pathogenesis ofautism, studies of nerve growth and nerve growth migratory substances Im-portant for the modeling and remodeling of basic architectonics of certaincenters of the human brain particularly important for language and socialskills could be carried out. For example, family histories of affective disor-der have been found in autism. In affective disorder, abnormalities havebeen identified in cell structure immediately adjacent to the inner surfaceof the cell membrane. This is also the site of action of neuronal growthfactors, such as Growth Associated Protein, which guide the growth of de-veloping neurons. This suggests an overlap or shared abnormal factor atthe neurobiologie level in the regulation of brain membrane developmentin autism and affective disorder, particularly with regard to the inner mem-brane associated cytoskelelon. The association between autism and tuber-ous sclerosis may also be a particularly fruitful one in understanding thepathogenesis of both disorders. Research is also urgently needed that dis-tinguishes two different developmental trajectories in autism, the one con-genital (from birth) and the other characterized by apparently normaldevelopment followed by regression and onset of autism.6. 1Wo important considerations for future research include the needfor developmental norms for many new methodologies and considerationof norms in relation to IQ, gender, and race. Much of what is known aboutbrain function and neuropathology is based on acquired brain damage inadults. If neurobiologic strategies are to be effective in correcting structuralabnormalities of the brain. then noninvasive technology for the study ofhigher order cognitive abilities and their neural substrate should be em-ployed over the course of development. The majority opinion was thatnewer functional magnetic resonance imaging will displace PET scans foractivation studies, particularly once the enlarged windows of brain visuali-zation are perfected.With regard to special considerations for such research, it Is particu-larly important that normative data across the age span be accumulatedwith these new and more sophisticated methodologies for studying thebrain such as volumetric Mill morphotnetry, functional imaging, and MR spectroscopy. ft is also important to define nortnal in consideration of sub-ject variables likely to have a major impact on neuronal organization in-cluding age, 10 (particularly Verbal IQ). gender, and nice (especially instudies of infants and toddlers where the acquisition of milestones variesby race). It is also important that controls be chosen and matched as care-fully as the autistic subjects and that they too be thoroughly assessed forevidence of current and past history of neurologic and psychiatric disordersas well as for family history status. Use of structured instruments for thesepurposes should be routine.7. Reports of abnormalities in higher order motor abilities(praxis) andhigher cortical sensory abilities are now emerging. These findings may pro-vide a basis for some of the unexplained aspects of the clinical syndromeof autism such as the sensory distortions (e.g., the relative insensitivity topain and the sensory sensitivities) and movement disorders. Apraxis couldprovide a neurologic explanation for the inability of very young autisticchildren to use sign language. Sensory and motorabnormalities may bequite disablingand intervention depends on a better understanding of theneurologic basis of these behavioral difficulties. There is a related need forresearch on movement and synchrony, building on some previous researchin this area and on new findings in Parkinson's disease and autism.8. Repticable findings and consistency across methodologies will onlyoccur when well- standardized methods are usedfor diagnosis, choice ofcomparisongroups that control for relevant demographic and developmen-tal variables, standardized protocols for imaging and psychological testing,and well-quantified methods of analysis. Such standardization is needed forall levels of inquiry neuro/pathophysiologicianatomic, and etiologic (geneticand environmental), but progress at one level wilt not automatically resultin solving questions at another. COMMllNICA'flON/SOCIAL/EMOTIONALDEVELOPMENTM.SIgmanResponse io NIX QuestionsQuestion1: What aspects of communicative, sochd, andiar specific and perhaps universal to audio, spectnim dis-orders(core deficits)? There is strong evidence that the capacity to shareattention and emotion with others is specifically. and universally impairedin autism. This is manifested in less joint attention and social referencing255Slate or the Schnee141 in young children with autism, less understanding of the feelings andthoughts of others in older children with autism, and lessinitiation of socialbehaviorsand responsivenessto others'feelingsat all ages. Simple recog-nition of facial expressions is intact in many individuals withautism. Slow-ever, understanding thatrequires the person with autism to take theperspective of another is generally limited. This deficit is also manifestedin serious difficulties in the functional use (pragmatics) of language bythose individuals who acquire language skills. Understanding and assess-ment of these deficits raiseparticular problems in research with nonverbalchildren.Question 2: What 1.1 known regarding the developmental trajectoriesofthese communicative and social behaviors In persons with earl= specialistdisorders?Only a few longitudinal studies of children with autism have beenconducted. Prom cross-sectional studies, itisclear that some of the prob-lems with joint attention and social referencing improve as children's cog-nitive abilities develop. liovrever, the deficits are manifested in higher levelsocial and language abilities.Longitudinal studies suggest that the capacityfor joint attention is linked to language acquisition but the child's sociabilitypredicts to gains in languageskills. There is stability in individual differ-encesin responsiveness to other's emotions and this is independent oflevelof intelligence. Additional longitudinal data are needed [or most aspectsof these children's verbal and nonverbal communication and socialization.Question 3: What is known about the specific con:Windom of biologicaland environmental factors to there behaviors? Very littleis known about howbiological and environmental (actors contribute to these deficits althoughemerging interventionsin thisarea show promise ofdemonstrating envi-ronmental impact other neurodevelopmental disorders that haveautistic-like behoWors (e.g.. temporal lobe lesions in early childhood; certainseizure disorders that involve behaviors reminiscent of autism which disappearwith treatment), what can be, teamed about the nature of autism and Its carsdeficits?Most studies of children with autism compare their behaviors todense of heterogeneousgroups of children withmental retardation or chil-dren with language disorders. These children do not share the social deficitsof the children with autism. Some of the same methodologies have beenused to compare children with seizure &orders and children with autism.In studios of samples with more serious seizure disorders, the children withseizures but not autism arc equally impairedinallformsof nonverbal com-munication. Children with autism are the most impaired in joint attentionand the least impaired in gestures used to regulate the behavior of others.The overlap of autism with seizure disorders, particularly seizure disordersthat result in regression after normal development, is an important area thistof rt vt.In general, onset of autism after apparently normal early de-velopment is poorly understood and underresearched. The literature onfrontal and temporal lobe lesions in both animals and humans is informa-tive regarding the timing and type of lesions that affect social development.Preliminary data from animal studies also suggest the possibility of recoveryfrom early brain injury with treatment. This research has implications forunderstanding plasticity and the efficacy of early interventions but is notyet directly applicable to autism.Question 5: Are there new models, methodologies, and /or statisticallanalyric techniques that show promise In answering these questions? These areproposed in the following section of Recommendations. Recommendations of the Working Group on Communication/SoriallEmmlonal DevelopmentFour types of studies are recommended by the working group to ad-dress the gaps identified above.1. Longitudinal Studies Which Follow Children from Early Childhood toMiddle Childhood and Then on to Adolescence. Studies that assess eitheridentical communicative and social behaviors over time or different meas-urements of the same constructs are needed. It would be humesting to dothese in tandem with measures of the child's relationships with family mem-bers as well as measures of neurological, sensory, and motor functioning.Groups of children should be followed who meet diagnostic criteria forautism as well as those who fit into the spectrum even if they do not meetall the diagnostic criteria. Outcome measures should be broadened to in-dude social understanding, competence, and relationships assessed in a va-riety of ecologically appropriate situations such as home and school. Studiescould be designed to address the following questions: (a) How persistentare early clacks? (b) What are the consequences of these deficits? (c)What are the mediators of variation in development? (d) What are thebest predictors of which children will develop speech and of which childrenwill lose speech and develop autism after apparently normal early languagedevelopment (up to one third of children with autism)? (e) Is there sec-ondary deprivation (i.e., because children are not biologically prepared torespond to and interact with their environment, their initial deficits areworsened because they do respond normally to the usual, growth-promotingexperiences in their environments.)? How do different faMilies, schools, antitreatment facilities act to prevent the deprivation that results from thechild's communicative and social deficits? Are. there different outcomes inthese eases? (f) Can communication/social subgroups be identified and how 4;USlate of the Science Lit stable are these subgroups? (g) How do relations between spy'deficitsand neurological and cognitive functioning change with age? Thesestudiescould be linked to family studies so that the severity and persistenceofdeficits could be assessed in light of the characteristics of the families..2. Studies of Early Diagnosis. Measures of early social and communi-cative functions (like imitation, joint attention, and social orientation) couldbe administered either to children with suspected developmental difficultiesby parents, pediatricians, or day-care workers or to the infant siblings ofchildren with autism. These children could then be followed to age 3-4 tovalidate the diagnoses.3. 'Draining Studies. Focused experimental interventions aimed at tar-geting abilities identified as specifically deficient in children with autism orpredictive of later languageand social skills could be carded out. Thesefocused training studies would be short-term, intensive efforts to alter thechild's communicative and social skills in a particular domain. They wouldsupplement existing intervention or educational programs in which bothexperimental and comparison subjects are enrolled. Baseline measureswould be made of neurological, sensory. motor, and cognitive functions.Muffling studies should beinstituted during three age periods: Early child-hoodFocus of intervention would be communicative skills, imitation skills,and/or aftlliative behaviors. A multichannel approach (more than one typeof sensory input, e.g., visual and auditory) could be used. Middle childhood(nonverbal children)Preliminary research is needed to specify target be-haviors since so few studies have attempted to identify deficits in commu-nicative and social abilities in this age period. Middle childhood toadolescence (verbal children) Focus of intervention would be under-standing of the knowledge, beliefs, and feeling of the self and others.4. Many individuals withautism lack speech and have limitatirms ingestural communication andin the use of augmentative communication sys-tems. These problems areas may be caused or complicated by specific sen-sory difficultiesand/or general motor or more specific motor/speechimpairment. There is almost no systematic research in this area.S. MuliklisciPlinatYlMulticenter Studies. In some cases, multidisciplinaryor multicenter investigationswould be most effective. For example, in lon-gitudinal studies of nonverbal and verbal conununication skills, such inves-tigations might allow examination of both biological and psychologicaldevelopment. This would make the research far more meaningful since con-tinuity and change could beexamined not only in each domain but also inthe relations across domains. Longer term, tuultidhciplinarylmulticenter,in-vestigations would also be necessary for linking family studies to longitu-dinal follow-ups of the autistic proband. Multicenter Investigations wouldnisi) be necessary when large samples are needed or to permit studies of thisa01ixed populations, for example, an early diagnosis study using a high-,we sample, such as the infant siblings of children with autism, because ofthe small samples at any site. MEDICAL INTERVENTIOND. Cohen Responses to AIM Questions QuestionWhat are the most important goals for fintore research onmedical interventimul There are two overriding objectives for future re-search on medical interventions: (a) rigorous evaluation of the effectivenessof currently available medical approaches to treatment; (b) facilitation ofthe creation of newer approaches to treatment that utilize advances in neu-roscience, genetics, immunology, and other associated fields.Evaluation of Treatment. The development and testing of biological in-terventions is a complex process that requires collaboration among clini-cians and basic biological and behavioral scientists, includingpharmacologists, psychologists, statisticians, and other neuroscientists. Thisprocess of clinical research should be embedded within suitable institutionalcontexts in which clinical care and investigation can be integrated, and inwhich there can be state of the art pharmacological and behavioral assess:merits of individuals with autism, at different phases of development andlongitudinally. The Infrastructure for this program includes the followingcomponents: (a) well-trained investigators familiar with the phenomenologyand natural history of autism and with sophisticated methods of psycho-pharnmcological research; (b) centers in which individuals with autism canbe engaged in tong-term biological research protocols, Including inpatientand outpatient facilities, laboratories for biological and behavioral assess-ment, nursing and other staff for monitoring overall response. concurrenttreatments, and support to assure long-term engagement of families in theresearch; (c) development and refinement of methodologies for assessmentand for monitoring changes in various domains of functioning (includingrating procedures, behavioral observational methods, studies offunctioning in important contexts, and laboratory-based assessments of cog-nition, attention, and other domains).New Interventions. Advances in genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology,and other areas will continue to suggest new approaches to intervention. Itis important to have investigators who are familiar with emerging areas ofknowledge that may be relevant to autism (e.g., to new agents that are under257Slate or the Schneedevelopment). Also, there should be increased emphasis on ta. :..ig treat-ments that are specifically related to the core problems of autism. Currently,all medications used with individuals with autism were screened on test sys-tems that are not specific for core symptoms of autism (e.g., screened Inrelation to aniipsychotic and antidepressant potential). They have been usedwith children and with individuals with autism, in particular, as orphan in-dications. There is no current program aimed at developing and testingagents that may specifically relate to core areas of autistic disturbanceso-cial and communicative impairments. The development of new approachesmay bo based on increasingunderstanding of the biological preconditionsfor social attachment, for example, the role of hormonal systems in moduluting attachment, on important systems (e.g., dupantinergic scrotonergic,nOradrenergie, and peptidergic systems and their interactions) that are im-plicated in specific classes of symptoms, and on genetic factors in behavioraldevelopment and disorder (as these are elucidated). In the future, the fieldof genetic pharmacology will play an increasingly important role. This fieldintegrates molecular genetics and biological interventions that are specifi-cally targeted at changing the expression of genes. With the localization ofspecific genes and characterization of gene products that may be related toautism, a new era of biological intervention will be opened. Recommendations of the Wanking Group on MedicalIntervention The design of biological intervention studies is complicated by hetero-geneity among individuals with autism, the Importance of following the ef-fect of treatments over long periods of time to determine changes indevelopmental course, the many different agents and procedures that areavailable for study, and questions of informed consent.A task force is needed to study improved approaches to the evalu-ation of treatment to complement the standard, double-blind, placebo-con-trolled trials. In addition to efficacy, it is important to have studies thatrelate to clinical effectiveness fur diverse groups of Individuals with autismand over longer periods. New statistical methods for assessment of devel-opmental course (e.g., individual growth curve analysis) may be helpful,and statisticians, methodologists, pharmacologists, parents, and cliniciansneed to be able to work together as teams to design suitable approaches.2. The use of medication is rarefy appropriate without other treatmentapproaches, Including educational and behavioral bterventions. This col-laborative approach will provide maximum benefit for the patients and datanormally collected in educational settings can prove useful In evaluating Dr Wel el'41interventions in 'real life.\" Once efficacy of a single aspect of treat-ment (i.e., medical or behavioral) is demonstrated, drug by behavioral in-tervention interactions can be tested, but increases in sample sizes neededto test such effects tend to be exponential in numbers and cost.3. Currently available assessment methodologies are perhaps more use-ful for baseline assessment than for monitoring change. New methods forassessment may be needed for \"lower functioning\" individuals and for care-fully following the course of treatment response in various positive domains(learning, social, emotional, cognitive) as well as on target symptoms (e.g.,aggression, activity level). Functioning in situations of daily living needs tobe assessed as well as symptom severity. Short- and long-term aide effectsneed to be monitored.4. Response to treatment may help define new subtypes of individualswith autism and lead to further understanding of biological subtyping.5, In the assessment of individuals with autism, epidemiological studyof dietary history and current functioning is needed. Studies are needed ofthe unusual eating behavior of individuals with autism (e.g., limited diets,craving for or avoidance of certain foods, eating unusual substances) whichhas been shown in other disorders to lead to elevated levels of lead orreductions In important dietary components. Such study may also revealpossible undiagnosed symptoms related to diet (e.g., MSO or lactose In-tolerance) or reflect metabolic disorders.6. Pharmacological interventions may require the use of more thanone medication at a time. For example, the treatment of some nonautisticindividuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may sometimes be improvedby the augmentation a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a neurolepticfluvoxamlne + pimozide). Similar clinical needs are presented bysome individuals with autism. Systematic research is needed to understandthe biological and behavioral effects of multiple drug use.7. A coordinated plan for supporting rigorous, sustained clinical re-search on biological interventions in autism is needed. This includes (a) fa-cilitation of training programs and career development in the field ofpediatric neuropsychopharmacology and associated fields of clinical re-search: (b) creation of centers for long-term engagement in the field of bio-logical clinical research. This initiative might be undertaken as an expansionof the current NICHD networks on pediatric pharmacology. Centers in-volved In this work should have the capacity for rigorous behavioral andbiologic-el assessment, Integration of biological and behavioral interventions,and long-term follow-up; (e) establishment of multicenter collaborations forevaluation of biological and behavioral interventions (in which studies canbe implemented, monitored, and carefully assessed over longer periods oftime, including short-term improvements as well as long-term effects of Me Skims (.7.711)net should work with advocacy and professionalorganizations to increase the awareness of parents, professionals, and gov-ernment about the importance of rigorous scientific research on biologicalinterventions. This includes helping parents and advocates recognize thevalue of volunteering for studies (including placeho-controlled de.gigns) thatmay delay the onsetof treatment for certain individuals but will ultimatelybenefit the individual involved as well as the advancement of the field bypromoting authenticscientific knowledge that can inform treatment. SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION W. J. McilvaneThe term \"behavioral\" in this context Is intended to distinguish theprimary thrust of thisresearch from that of biomedical studies. The term\"behavioral\" is not limited to research in the tradition of impliedbehavioranalysis or behaviormodification. but includes the study of human and sal-ai behavior from a varietyof theoretical and conceptual perspectives (em.g.,developmental). Response to NW Questions Question I: What it knownand what needs to be learnedabout the efectiveness of specific typesof interventions for specific types of children withauibm spectrum disorders? Although there is no cure, autism istreatablethrough educationalinterventions of various types. Early intervention maybe particularly effective, presumably because of the plasticityof the neuralsystems at thattime. When to initiate treatment, how intensive such treat-ment needs to be, and how long to continue it are importantresearch Tres.lions to be addressed. It is also clear that persons of alt ages an d levels ofability can benefit from access to consistently available, proven treatment.It is also known. however, that treatment response is not uniform withinthe population. Although many children may be brought to the point ofnear-normal functioning, others are much less responsive to sochWbehav-ioral intervention programs.Question 2: What Important outcome variables have been well studied?tiltat additional outcomes need to be considered? lleatmentresearch hasdemonstrated the feasibility of fostering significant gains in language, socialadjustment, preacademicand academic achievement, and other desirableoutcomes. The focus of many studies has been on compliance and on spe- (07)Bridal it e',eademie or preacademie achievements. Promising research has alsobeen done on the acquisition of functional abilities such as changes in spon-taneous communication and adaptive, flexible behavior over time which aremore meaningful than changes in measurements such os 10. Assigementto regular classes as the criterion for successful outcome is often meaning-less because it reflects local political and legal mandates more than indi-vidual child need or status. As in other domains of intervention research,studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of all interventions(particularly early intervention).Question 3: What are the diagnostic, methodological, and statistical issuesthat must be addressed in future behavioral and social Intervention research?Research thus far has demonstrated that intervention, and particularly earlyintervention. offers significant hope for lessening the effects of autism.Many questions remain unanswered, however. Research is needed that usesrobust experimental designs to evaluate and compare various approachesto treatment. Methods are needed that (a) involve random assignment todifferent treatment conditions; (b) use standard intervention protocols thatcapture a wide range of skills and symptoms, under both laboratory and\"real life\" situations; (c) make use of outside evaluators who are not in-vested in the outcome of the research; (d) assure high compliance with thedefined treatment protocols to be sure that the intervention as designed isactually and consistently implemented; and (e) use longitudinal designs thatevaluate treatment effect; both during the treatment itself, and at setpoints after the intervention has been accomplished.The social/behavioral working group felt the need to identify (and per-haps to develop) research methods that would increase the likelihood thatfamilies would agree to the participation of their children in research stud-ies. Newer statistical approaches (e.g., individual growth curve analyses)were encouraged. in particular. the working group felt that it was essentialto distill a set of outcome measures that would have broad appeal for evalu-ating treatment approaches. While them was recognition of the significantpotential for controversy in this area, it was felt that the problem could bemanaged and a reasonable set of measures might emerge if a broad con-stituency was involved In the development effortQuestion 4: What are the aspects of social policy that facilitate or impederesearch in this area? Recent developments in social policy, particularly themovement towards inclusion of individuals with autism (as well as otherdisabilities) In community schools, recreation, employment, and other ac-tivities of daily life are very influential on the ability to accomplish high-quality intervention research. While the goals of the inclusion movementwere acknowledged and supported, there was considerable agreement thatintervention should respond first to the needs of the individual with autism250Slats at the Sclease fill%145 (and his/her family), tailoring the approach to make it possible for eachindividual to achieve his/her full potential.Some concern was also expressed that sodal policy advancement wasneeded to streamline the process of obtaining human studies approval forintervention studies. Although the committee was dearly aware of and dulyconcerned about the need to protect individuals with autism and their fami-lies in accomplishing research studies, the growing requirements for some-times numerous, largely redundant reviews by multiple human subjectreview boards were seen as a possible obstacle in accomplishing certaintypes of interventionstudies. Reconunendations ofthe Working Group on SociallDehavioralIntervention 1. A high priority for future research is studies that relate Charac-teristics of individuals (or group subtypes) to treatment outcomes. Out-comes depend upon the interaction of the characteristics of the individualwith the characteristics of the treatment approach. What works for onechild may be ineffective or even counterproductive for another. Both cote-gorical and dimensional approaches were discussed and may prove appro-priate for defining suchcharacteristics.- 2. 'him little attention has been given to environments and to the in-teraction of affected persons with aspects of their environments that typi-cally affect child outcome. Particularly needed are studies of parent-childand sibling-sibling interaction over time, and of the effects of physical en-vironments, behavioral modeling, relationships, exposure to speech, andtechnology such as computers that could contribute to more or less suc-cessful outcomes.3. Another priority is research that would define the critical featuresof effective intervention programs, for persons at different ages. At the pre-sent time, data have been presented regarding effective intervention \"pack-ages.\" It is critical to determine what aspects of the particular program.including family variables, and what intensity and duration of interventionare needed for successful outcomes at various child/adult ages. Post hoctesting to generate hypotheses for future research for targeting interven-tions is needed as well as hypothesis-driven prospective studies.4. Collaborative. multisite projects appear necessary to obtain an ade-quate sample of childrenand intervention programs to assess subject bytreatment interaction (i.e., what works best for which children) and to de-termine if the treatment can be effective in other treatment sites and sam-ples with different persons implementing them, &Wet et of. As principles of effective treatment are increasingly well defined,research is needed to ascertain how best to encourage transfer of that learn-ing for individual children (generalization) from clinic to home, home toschool, school to community.6. It is clear that all persons with autism are riot currently receivingservices based on the most advanced knowledge available. Mechanismsshould be devised to expedite rapid transfer of research into practice.7. There was agreement that maximally effective intervention wouldhave to be a multidisciplinary effort. Without diminishing the value of well-focused individual research initiatives, high priority was accorded to re-search projects that could demonstrate truly effective, productiveinterdisciplinary interactions, For example, although methods derived fromapplied behavior analysis were acknowledged as especially effective in treat-ing autism, it was thought that incorporating perspectives from develop.mental psychology and neuropsychology, among other disciplines, mightenhance the effectiveness and acceptability of treatment methodologies.The importance of so-called \"state\" variables (nutritional status, drugstatus, etc.) was also deemed critical, and research to document stuteireat-ment variable interactions was recommended. Implicit in these recommen-dations is the need for an organizing framework that is broad enough toincorporate inputs from the many disciplines that can make a helpful con-tribution to solving the problems of autism spectrum disorders.14. If curly intervention dues substantially atter growth trajectories, asit appears, followup research will be needed to confirm that interventiondoes in fact produce fasting beneficial changes that would not be achievablewithout that intervention. Studies should be designed to ensure that thegains are not an artifact of subject selection or maturation. Some studiesmay incorporate imaging or other techniques that demonstrate potentialbiological (i.e., evidence of neuroplasticity) as well as behavioral change,particularly as higher-speed imaging techniques become available. BIOSTATISTICAL RECOMMENDATIONSIt. C. KraemerLittle more on be learned either from cross-sectional or from retro-spective research on many key issues in autism. Autism is a developmentaldisorder, with very early onset, and is chronic over the tifetime of the pa-tient There is n serious need to understand what are the stable ;mks ofpatients and to distinguish these from what are the stages of the disorder,and to distinguish both traits and stages from states and random variation.State of she &fence 1St 'lb do this requires prospective, longitudinal studies. The problem is thatsuch studies are costly in terms both of research time and research cost.New statistical methodologies are currently emerging to make suchStudies more informative as well as most cost-effective. Individual growthmodels have been mentioned frequently in this report, for example. Suchmodels acknowledge both the consistent individual differences (traits)within groups of persons with autism and those differences expressed indifferent trajectories (stages). Moreover, such approaches are.much moretolerant of unequal follow-up times, or Irregular scheduling of follow-uptimes, and are much more robust to the less than perfect reliability of manyavailable and pertinent outcome measures.Tb reduce both time and cost of such studies as well, accelerated life-time sampling methods are available, where subjects are entered into studyat different ages and followed for some period of time (say 5 years), Insuch a way that age span over which different subjects are followed overlapeach other, One can, by such methods, accumulate a depiction of the gen-eral growth patterns over the first 20 years of life, for example, using only5 years of follow-up per patient.There ars many other such strategies either currently known but sel-dom used, or under current development, or that could be developed thatare particularly appropriate to the study of this disorder. Development anddissemination of such methodological strategies might be supported for re-senrchers in the field.It is known that sonic persons with autism are high- and some low-functioning; that some are mute and some vocal; that some respond to acertain treatment and some not. Dr. Grandin made the point most stronglythat there is a great degree of heterogeneity among persons with autismthat is not well underefeod, and sometimes not even acknowledged.Identification of subtypes is important, that is, subgroups of those ap-propriately diagnosed with autism who may have different etiologies, dif-ferent course, and/or different response to treatment, If such subtypes exist,they are currently being lumped into one group. The heterogeneity so in-troduced by lumping\" diminishes the power to detect any signals, whetherthey be the genetic basis of the disorder, risk factors for the disorder, dis-crimination between persons with autism and those with normally devel-oped brain structure and function, or treatment efficacy/effectiveness. It iscrucial to future research and development of knowledge, that, if such sub-types really exist, they be identified. On the other hand, we do not knowthe boundaries of autism or any subtype of autism. For example, we canreliably distinguish autism, Reit syndrome, and childhood disintegrative dis-orders (CDD), but are these simply different expressions of the same dis-order or of different disorders (again, different etiologies, course, or MAI. I of(lemresponse)? It should be remembered that before the organismfor syphilis was identified, it was thought that there were multiple differentdiseases depending on which organ system was affected. lb \"split\" when there is no valid reason in do so may also undermine a researchstudy's results. The search for a biological marker(s) is critical here.Comorbidides are yet another problematic source of heterogeneityamong persons with autism, Some =morbidities are randomone mighthave a cold and corns at the same time, and they have nothing to do witheach other. Some contorbidities may be different expressions of the samedisorder, or one disorder might lend to another. In such caws, these arenot necessarily separate disorders, but perhaps different manifestations ofthe same disorder, or different stages of a single disorder. Some (*mor-bidities are indeed separate but related disorders, due to linked genes orrelated environmental effects, or with common risk factors, some causal,some not. When =morbidity exists, each disorder may or may not affectthe success of treatment of the other.Should we lump\" or should we \"split\"? Each is appropriate in air-resent situations, and whichever is inappropriate will compromise researchsuccess in understanding autism. It is essential to gain a greater under-standing of the heterogeneities among persons with autism, and a recog-nition of which sources of heterogeneity are clinically important and whichare not, for these issues have major repercussions in terms of research de-sign and research success.Another recurrent theme has been that of fostering closer connectionsbetween research efforts and real life. Patients, parents of patients, as wellas interest and support groups should be involved in clinical research studies,both for the traditional purposes of fund raising and help ith patient re-cruitment. but also to help researchers formulate the questions most impor-tant to patients. Along this line: (a) We should increase emphasis onlong-term effectiveness rather than short -term efficacy studies. (b) We shouldreconsider the appropriate choice of control group (When Is a placebo groupthe appropriate choice), which may not be the same in all studies. (c) Weshould include consideration of both financial and emotional cost to familiesas outcomes in clinical trials as well as quality of life measures.With the difficulty of defining samples that control for relevant vari-ables and the severity and impact of autism, dune should be special em-phasis on high quality research, for example, diagnosis, sampling,measurement. design, and power. Frequently, the argument is made in theopposite direction: Since MO issues are so important, we should allow re\"searchers more latitude In designing and executing their studies. It is Im-portant to realize that funding poorly designed research is not only a wasteof time end money that might better have been invested elsewhere but the261Stan atI*Schnee ,results may actually mislead the research field and misinform tcliniciansworking with patients with autism.Moreover, it may well be that new modes of research collaborationneed to be forged. Whistle trials are certainly one such example. Collegialagreements between independent research centers studying autism that afinding at one she should immediately be followed by an attempt to rep-licate and confirm that finding at another site, is another exacta*.

A cohort study raised the possibility that immunisation with live attenuated measles vaccine, which induces active immunity to measles infection, might also predispose to the later development of IBD, provoking concerns about the safety of the vaccine.Method We report a case-control study of 140 patients with IBD (including 83 with Crohn's disease) born in or after 1968. and 280 controls matched for age, sex and general practitioner (GP) area, designed toassess the influence of measles vaccination on later development of TBD. Documentary evidence of childhood vaccination history was sought from GP and community health records.Findings Crude measles vaccination rates were 56.4% in patients with IBD and 57.1% among controls. Matched odds ratios for measles vaccination were 1.08 (95% CI 0.62-1-88) in patients with Crohn's disease, 0.84 (0.44-1.58) in patients with ulcerative colitis, and 0.97 (0.64-1.47) in all patients with 1BD.Interpretation These findings provide no support for the hypothesis that measles vaccination in childhood predisposes to the later development of either IBD overall or Crohn's disease in particular.Lancet1997; 350: 764-66Previous.Most 104/052000 5:35 PIN. BEST confidence in MMRvaccineSend a response to this articleThis article bas been cited by other artickiSearch Medline for articles byBMX Reaoky- Z!- Alert me when:New articles cite this article Norman Begg and colleagues assess how adverse publicity damages vaccination programmes Once again the media have succeeded in denting parents' confidence in childhood immunisation. Coverageof the first dose of MMR vaccine in the United Kingdom fell last quarter after adverse publicity in the presslinking MMR vaccine to Crohn's disease (Communicable Disease Report 1998;8:41).The national fall in vaccine coverage was 1%, although in 25 (20%) districts and health boards coveragefell by 2% or more. Altogether, about 2000 fewer children were vaccinated than in the previous quarter.The weight of scientific evidence has subsequently shown that these media reports were unfounded (BMJ1998;316:166) and that there is no causal link between MMR vaccine and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless,the damage to parents' confidence has been done. The press rarely give much prominence to negativefindings that exonerate the safety of a medical intervention. As Jonathan Swift put it: \"Falsehood flies andtruth comes limping afte,r, so that when men come to be undeceived it is too late; the jest is over and thetale has had its effect?Adverse media reporting has previously affected coverage of MMR vaccine in other countries, notablyDenmark, where coverage dropped to a record low in 1993 after a television programme attacking MMR.vaccination. Unrepentant, the same TV channel broadcast another unbalanced anti-vaccination programmelast November.What the journalists do not report is that measles, mumps, and rubella still cause substantial morbidity indeveloped countries. Where vaccine coverage is low the incidence of disease is high. Deaths from measlesare common in some European countries, and this is directly related to poor vaccine coverage (see I).Measles has almost been eliminated in Britain, but high levels of population immunity (>90%) are neededto prevent the recurrence of epidemics. There are already warning signsoutbreaks of measles haverecently been reported in Steiner schools in Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, and Hampshire, where children arenot vaccinated for philosophical reasons. Transmission of measles among such pockets of unvaccinatedchildren has the potential to cause outbreaks in the general population. t of3 4/6100 11:17 larger (3 K):fin this windowlfin a new windowlCoverage of measles vaccine and deaths from measles (datafrom WHO) It would seem that MMR vaccine has become the victim of its own success. When disease elimination isclose, attention inevitably shifts to the side effects of the vaccine. The latest findings front the HealthEducation Authority, which has been tracking a random sample of mothers with children aged 0-2 yearssince 1991, found that 8% of mothers now consider that the MMR vaccine presents a greater risk than thediseases it protects against and that 20% consider the vaccine to have a moderate or high risk of sideeffects. Mothers in social categories ABCI were less confident about MMR safety and potential risks thantheir C2DE counterparts.Perception of the severity of disease has also changed substantially. Since 1991 there has been a 7% dropamong mothers who would strongly agree to have any future child immunised. Of these, 33% believeMMR presents substantial risks to their child, including brain damage, a rise of ry. since February 1997. InOctober 1994, just before the national immunisation campaign against measles and rubella, 55% ofmothers considered measles to be a very serious illness; now only 20% do so. We should learn from theexperience of pertussis, where a sustained, misinformed media campaign against the vaccine throughoutthe 1970s saw vaccine coverage drop from 81% to 31%. Pertussis immunisation was disrupted in manyother countries by anti-vaccination movements, and these countries experienced a disease incidence up to100 times greater than in countries where high coverage was maintained (Lancet 1998;351:356-61).We are fortunate in Britain in having strong surveillance systems that are able to rapidly detects changes invaccine coverage and disease incidence. We cannot, however, afford to let our guard drop. Now that theissue of MMR vaccine safety has been resolved in the scientific press, it is important to restore publicconfidence in the vaccine.Norman Begg, consultant epidemiologist, Mary Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist, Joanne White,principal scientist, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, Zoltan Bozoky,projectofficer, Health Education Authority, London 2 of3 416/00 11:17 At BEST COPYAVAILABLE 260 bmj.com Haag et al. 316 0130): 561This article has been cited by other articles:TRIPP, 3 H, MCNINCH, A W (1998).

It is therefore important toexamine, critically and with an open mind, the report byAndrew Wakefield and colleagues of several cluldrenwhose chronic bowel and behavioural abnormalities werelinked by their parents and physicians to measles, mumps,and rubella (Wilt) raCCitladOn.An adverse event can be said to be caused by a marine(se, a true reaction) if it is associated with a specificlaboratory finding' and a specific clinical syndrome' orboth. Afteroatively, a clinical or epidemiologiad study bneeded to find out whether the rate of a given syndrome invaccinated individualsexceeds that expected amongunvaccinated controls. Such studies require acquisition ofddta in an unbaised way' Because of the inhaenzmethodological epidemiological studies,biological plausibility, consistency, strength, and qtyof asocial= must also be considered in infestingcausation.\" How well then do the features of theassociation reported by Wakefield and =Beeves fit with'causality?First, hundreds of millions of people watidwide(including those in Scandinavia and North Arnerea,where there are excellent clinical fealties) have receivedmeasles-containing vaccine without developing eitherchronic bowel or behavioural problems since the mid -1960a. This finding provides important negative evidenceas well as an appropriate framework for the assessment ofthe cases described by Wakefield and colleaguesnamely,Maximum and current reported cases of vaccine-preventable diseases and adverse events, USADiseasePreveccIne 262 COMMENTARYthat if MMR vaccine does causes this syndrome, it does soextremely rarely.Is the syndrome reported today clinically unique? lleallymphoid hyperplasia is non-specific. Autism was knownwell befote.MMR vaccine became available. Are thereunique laboratory features, including detection of vaccineviruses in clinical specimens where they would not beexpected? Although Wakefield has reported the detectionof these viruses in patients with inflammatory boweldisease (DID), other investigators, using more sensitiveand specific assays, have not been able to reproduce thesefindings.\" Another negative report, by M A Azfal andcolleagues, is published in today's Lancet. There is noreport of detection of vaccine viruses in the bowel, brain,or any other tissue of the patients in Wakefield's series.This leaves epidemiology asthe other means ofevaluating causation. Is there selection bias? The Wakefieldreport is based on cases referred to a group known to bespecially interested in studying the relation of MMRvaccine with ISD, rather than a population-based study.A first dose of MMR vaccine is given to about600 000 children every year in the UK, most during thesecond year of life, the time when autism first becomesmanifest. Not surprisingly, therefore, some cases willfollow MMR vaccination. Biased case - ascertainment, as inthis study, will exaggerate the association.Was there recall bias? It is usually difficult to dateprecisely the onset of a syndrome such as autism. Parentsand others may attempt to relate in onset to an unusualevent such as coincidental pustvacdnai reaction. Thedearest example of such an association was the linkbetween infantile spasms and pernissis vaccines; thevaccine tends to unmask rather than cause the syndrome.'There are other reasons for doubt about the associationreported by Wakefield and colleagues. They suggest thatMMR immunisation may lead to 113D, which results inmalabsorption, consequent neurological damage, and\"autism\". However, behavioural changes preceded bowelsymptoms in almost all their reported cases. No clear case-definition was presented, a necessary requirement of atrue new clinical syndrome and an essential step in anyfurther research. Recent evidence also suggests thatmeasles(or MMR) doesnot contributetothe development of /BD; the antecedent necessary for autismaccording to Wakefield and colleagues. Moreover, theyhave not completed the critical virological studies in thesechildren needed to support their hypothesi; that persistentmeasles (vaccine) viral infection plays a part in thecausation of the illness.Vaccine - safety concerns gain prominence whenever theincidence of vaccine-preventable diseases falls to negligiblelevels and when the number of vaccine adverse events,whether true reactions or those coincidental to thevaccination but falsely attributed to it (table), rises as aconsequence of high vaccine coverage.' False attributionusually occurs because many developmental abnormalitiesfast manifest in the early years of fife, which is also whenseveral vaccineswhich can cause crying, fever, and,occasionally, febrile seizuresare given.Effective and credible systems are needed for thedetection of vaccine-associated adverse events throughphannarovigilance, for distinguishing causal reactionsfrom coincidental reactions by pharmacoepidendologicalor other studies, and for risk communication:-0' Withoutsuch a system, vaccine-safety concerns such as thatreported by Wakefield and colleagues may snowball intosocietal tragedies when the media and the public confineassociation with causality and shun immunisation. Thispainful history was shared by the UK (among others) overpertussis in the 1970s\" after another similar case- serieswas widely publicised,\" and it is likely to be repeated alltoo easily over MMR.'\" This would be tragic becausepassion would then conquer reason and the facts again inthe UK.Robert T Chen, Frank DeStefanoVaccine Safety and Development Activity National ImmunisationProgreso.

The assay is therefore nearly 1000-10000 fold moresensitive than assays for infectious virus. We further improved the system by assaying the nested PCRproducts with the digoxigenin antibody and Southern blots which provided a clear endpoint. With thissystem we have so far examined 93 colonoscopic biopsy specimens (of ulcerated and of apparently normalcolonic mucosa) and 31 peripheral blood lymphocyte preparations, from nine patients with Crohn's disease,nine with ulcerative colitis, one with indeterminate colitis, and 11 controls with non-inflammatoryconditions. All patients gave informed consent and study was approved by the local ethical committee.Five of the 30 patients had a history of measles vaccination (confirmed by their general practitioner). All30 had serum neutralisation antibodies against measles virus, and have therefore been exposed at sometime either to wild-type or to vaccine measles viruses. Positive control samples used in each assay run werea wild-type measles virus grown in tissue culture, and brain material of a patient who died with subacutesclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).No measles-specific DNA fragments have been detected in the nested PCR products generated from theblood lymphocytes or colonoscopic biopsy specimens of these 30 patients. All positive controls producedmeasles-specific DNA products of the correct size and had distinct nucleotide sequences. We also checkedthe validity of the RT-PCR-nested PCR system by spiking measles virus into the clinical materials andfound no difference in terms of positivity. This suggests that substances which may degrade measles RNAmolecules or inhibit RT-PCR activity were not present or active in the clinical tissues examined. Based onthe amount of human beta actin gene DNA detected in internal controls, each biopsy specimen contains 1million cells, therefore, compared with other techniques,'\" probably more cells were examined byRT-PCR methods for the presence of measles virus genome.Two further points illustrate the extreme caution with which studies of this type must be interpreted. Somenon-specific bands were present in the N-gene nested PCR products of the clinical material. These weresignificantly larger than the target fragment and became visible only in digoxigenin antibody assays. Theydid not react with a measles-specific probe in Southern blots and could not be sequenced with measles Ngene primers. We also had one incident of cross-contamination. Material from one biopsy sample gave apositive result which we traced back to cross-contamination from the positive control at the primary PCR 041092000 5:08 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 269 264 Remuch Absence of measles-virus gmiome in inflammatory bowel flisebstpdAvaw.thebmcet.cordnewlanceoregAssues/vol351no9103/bccly.research646.1u level. This has been confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the fragment, which had an identical sequenceto that of the positive control. Other specimens from this patienttwo colonic biopsies, one lymphocytepreparation, and one serum sample- -were negative by RT-PCR-nested PCR.We believe that the system established at NIBSC is sufficiently sensitive to identify measles virus genome,if it existed, in the clinical material examined. Our experience also demonstrates that even with the mostscrupulous attention to methodology and laboratory procedures, cross-contamination of specimens canoccasionally occur; and also that considerable experience and a range of methodologies may be needed torecognise non-specific reactions which might be interpreted as positive if confirmatory techniques are notapplied. We concluded that with the best available RT-PCR-nested PC technology, measles virus genomeis not present in gut mucosal biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.1 Ekbom A, Wakefield Al, Zack M, Adami Pounder Wakefield AL Is measles vaccination a forinflammatory bowel disease?

As the incidence of these diseases hasfallen vaccine safety has assumed greater importance,especially in parents' minds. Any safety issue requirescool scientific consideration' Here the hypothesis isthat MMR leads to a non-specific gut conditionpermitting the absorption of non-permeable peptides,which in turn cause serious developmental disorders.'Supportive evidence consists of cases referred to agastroenterology group. The data published comprises11 boys and one girl, each with bowel abnormalitiesand serious developmental regression (nine hadautism). In eight children parents reported regressionstarting shortly after the children received MMR'An editorial accompanying the article and a recentreview by the World Health Organisation list theconsiderable evidence against this and previous relatedtheories from the same group.\" Since each year over600 000 British children receive MMR in their secondyear, an age when autism can typically manifest itself,chance alone dictates that some cases will appearshortly after vaccination.' Cases will be selectivelyreferred to a group known for its interest in MMR,inflammatory bowel disease, and autism, so thehypothesis rests on clinical anecdote rather than anepidemiologically sound base.Proved serious vaccine reactions are characterisedby specific clinical or laboratory findings, Nit thenon-specific nature of the developmental and gut abnor-malities in these cases is striking, and no precise casedefinition is offered.' No vaccine viruses were reportedin the children's biological specimens, though theresearchers have previously reported viruses in boweltissues of children with inflammatory bowel disease,findings which others have been unable to confirm.'Epidemiological evidence is imsupportive: theWHO found no links between measles, MMR, andinflammatory boweldisease';and surveyofconditions associated with autism mentioninflammatory bowel disease.'

MMR immunisation rates have begun todecline and those at the \"sharp end\" of immunisationgeneral practitioners, health visitors, and communitypaediatricians are experiencing parental inquiries.'Any decline in immunisation, or the giving of MMR asthree injections at annual intervals (as suggested byone of the report's authors), will undo the recent nearelimination of measles and rubella in the UR!The experience with pertussis in the 1970s was alsobased on anecdotal case reports linking pertussisvaccination with infant brain damage.' Again a tempo-ral link between a 'vaccine and a devastating childhoodcondition whose natural peak onset was at the verytime when most children received that vaccine wasmisinterpreted as a causal relation. A national studyeventually showed that, while there was a temporalassociation with encephalopathy, any risk of lastingdamage was so rare as to be unquantifiable.\" But theinitial report, then as now, attracted media attention;parental and professional anxiety soared; and nationalimmunisation rates fell from 80% to 30%. The numberof susceptible children rose, and in the 12 years after1976 three major pertussis epidemics accountednationally for over 300 000 notifications and at least 70deaths. The suffering of families experiencing longmiserable illnesses was considerable, and in some caseslong term damage ensued. Some parents came tobelieve that an immunisation they had approved haddamaged their child.There are differences between then and now Theconnection of encephalopathy with pertussis vaccinewas biologically more plausible than the link proposedfor MMR and autism.

As a result, we fearthere may be a reduction in vaccineuptake in the UK and elsewhere. Themain thrust of the report is to add tothe record 12 possible cases of boweldisease associated with developmentalregression (including autism), which isa useful contribution to research.However, an association was alsoalluded to between these two factorsand environmental triggers such asreceipt of MMR vaccine.Wakefield and co-workers state \"Wedid association mumps, and rubella vaccinesandthesyndromedescribed \".However, there are enough referencesin the text to lead the reader to theassumption that thereissufficientevidence provided by the study, and byother scientific publications, to suggestthat there is a likely (although as yetunproven) link.The study suggests a temporalrelation between the so-called autism-bowel syndrome and administration ofMMR in eight of the 12cases.However, the interval between receiptof vaccine and onset of symptoms isprovided in only five cases (1-14 days),and the age at which the vaccine wasgiven was provided in only three (15months, 16 months, and 4.5 years).Parents identified MMR. to be theimmediate precursor of developmentaldelay in eight of the 12 children, butdevelopmental delay is likely to bedetected by a gradual awareness over aperiod of time, not on a particular day.Although autism is rarely diagnosedbefore 18 months, the insidious onsetof symptoms oftenpredatesthe diagnosisby many months.As described by Wakefield, parents hadtroublemaking atemporallink between the onset of autism and theonset of gastrointestinal symptoms forsimilar reasons. We therefore questiontheconclusion that there was atemporal association of the autism-bowel syndrome and MAULTo prove a causal relation is muchharderit requires aselection ofpatients and matched controls, and asample size that is capable of detectinga statistically significant differencebetweenthetwogroups.Theinvestigators may need to be blindedfor such aspects as clinical assessmentsandlaboratorytests. How doesWakefield's study match up? There wasno patient selection other than 12patients referred to him. There were nocontrols. There was no blinding ofinvestigators.Theaccompanyingcommentary by Robert Chen andFrank DeStefano' elegantly explainsthe difference between temporal andcausal association. We concur withthem that Wakefield's study fails atevery level to make a causal association.Is it possible that we are confrontedby a genuine causal association whichhas shown up by chance in these eightcases? Is it possible that these caseshave brought to light a previouslyunnoticedassociation?Wakefieldclaims that the association betweenautismandMMR hasbeen documented in the pastan importantpoint to clarify. However, the tworeferences they cite from Fundenburgand Gupta (refs 16 and 17 in theirreport) need further scrutiny. The firstdeals mainly with the association ofautism and transfer factor (DLyE) andalso mentions \"live rubella immuniz-ation at 15 months has precipitatedfever convulsions followed by autisticsymptoms; so has live hepatitis Bvaccine in 2 infants at 2 years\". Theseanecdotal associations do not advancethe argument for causality. We couldnot obtain the Gupta reference throughusual library channels.Wakefield and colleagues' findingsconfront us with a new hypothesisthat measles-containing vaccine maytrigger developmental regression. It isknown that such speculation mayseriously damage important publichealth programmes, causing a declinein vaccine uptake and a rise in thetarget disease.' We can now tecilectsuch damage to occur in manycountries. We question the merit ofpublishing this particular study.Publication of this study is especiallytragic because WHO and all consultednational public health authorities agreethat it does not alter in any way thecontinued recommendation to usemeasles-containing vaccines through-out the world.Current measlescontaining vaccines are highly Kane, \"EK 356-61.SirAndrew and colleagues'report a case series of 12 patients anduse this to generate a hypothesis thatgastrointestinaldiseaseandanassociated developmental disorder maybe related to MIR.

Acase-control study with four controlsfor every case and an 80% power todetect a two-fetid increase in the risk recording were similar tothat of West Glamorgan (population370 000) this would require combiningresuhs from a general population of14-3 million people. We suggest thatthis is a practical way of rapidly investi-gating this speculative association. 'Christopher and pervasive developmentaldisorder in children.

For 8 of the children a time correlation was seen between debut ofsymptoms and vaccination against Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR. vaccine). The authors statethat there is no evidence of a connection between the vaccinations and the symptoms. In spite of thisstatement, the article has drawn much public attention. This is very remarkable since Lancet in thesame issue are publishing a comment by Chen and DeStefano, CDC, Atlanta, USA who e.g. note:Hundreds of millions of children all over the world have received MMR vaccine since the 1970sand 1980s without developing intestinal diseases or behavioural disorder.It cannot surprise that some cases of autism will accidentally occur in close connection to MMRvaccination since almost all children in e.g. England and Scandinavia are vaccinated at a time wheresymptoms on autism usually become noticeable.Several independent studies during recent years have shown no connection between measles anddevelopment of chronic intestinal inflammations, which, according to Wakefield, should beprerequisite for the development of autism.On 8th February 1998 WHO's weekly journal (WERREH) published a thorough review of theinformation available and actually writes off the suspicions aroused by Wakefield et al. A leader inBritish Medical Journal of 17th January 1998 declared the hypothesis of a connection between MMRvaccination and inflammatory intestinal disease to be unfounded.Consequently it is timely to warn that a campaign against vaccination may entail dramatic, and froma public point of view, very sad effects for the vaccination programme. Parents must continue to lettheir children be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella - diseases that are somewhatforgotten but still may cause serious disabilities.Patrick OlinThe Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control DoctorMeasles, Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR)Vaccine, Crohn's disease and AutismYou will be aware of the continuing media reports andpublic concern that have arisen over the purportedassociations between MMR vaccine and Crohn'sDisease and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).Reports of such associations have caused parentsconsiderable anxiety. Some are now refusing toaccept MMR vaccine for their children. The purposeof this letter is to provide you with more informationthat may help in advising parents.I have taken advice from the Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation, and the Committee on'Safety of Medicine and asked the MRC to convene anexpert group. This group included experts invirology, epidemiology, immunology, paediatrics,child psychiatry and gastroenterology and met on 23rdMarch to consider all recent work on measles,measles vaccine, MMR vaccine, Crohn's Disease andASD. Proponents of the associations were given fullopportunity to present their data. Along withpublished material the MRC expert group wasprivileged to see as yet unpublished material. Based on the previous material that I have seen,and on the opinions of experts present at the MRCmeeting, I have concluded that there is no linkbetween measles, measles vaccine or MMRimmunisation, Crohn's Disease, and ASD.Together with others at the meeting, I was notliktonvinced thatany of the studies support--suggestions that measles or PublicHealthDistrict Directors of Public of NHS TrustsMedical Directors ONES TrustsRegional Nurse AdvisorsHA Pharmaceutical AdvisorsRegional Principal DingInformation PharmacistsCommunity Service Pharmacists 277 272 I therefore recommend that -children should receiveMMR vaccine at the appropriate times, and shouldnot be given the separate component vaccines, sincethere is no evidence that doing this has any benefitand it may even be harmful. I believe that moreresearch is needed to identify the causes of Crohn'sDisease, and AS I), but I do not think that MMRvaccine is in any way implicated in the cause ofthese conditions.On measles and MMR the MRC John Pattison concluded:The available virological and epidemiologicalevidence does not support a causal role for persistentmeasles virus infection in Crohn's disease.rO There is no evidence to indicate any link betweenAMR vaccination and bowel disease or autism.There is therefore no reason for a change in thecurrent MMR vaccination policy.In the remainder of this letter, I will summarise thepieces of research relevant to the above.Does early measles infection increase the risk ofCrohn's Disease?A case series of four mothers and children fromSweden suggested that children born to women whohad suffered from measles at the end of pregnancymight be at higher risk of developing Crohn's Diseasein later life (1). Two large studies, one from thiscountry and one from Denmark, with appropriatecontrols, showed no increased risk of Crohn's Disease(2,3) under these circumstances.Ank Early exposure to measles virus does not appear toincrease the risk of Crohn's Disease.Measles, MMR Vaccine, Crohn'sdisease and Autism PL/CM0/98/2 27 March 1998 Page 2 of 8 For further information and amore detailed bibliography, pleasecontactDr David SalisburyRoom 707, Wellington House133-155 Waterloo RoadLondon SEI BUGRequests further West YorkshireLS23 code and serial numberappearing above. For correction of anydiscrepancies in changes ofaddress, practice or name,please from 1964 with an unimmunised cohortfrom 1958 suggested an increased risk of Crohn'sDisease in the immunised cohort (4). This study was severely criticised on the selection of cases withunmatched controls, differential dropout rates in thetwo groups, and different means of case ascertainment(5-10). A second study, with Crohn's Disease casesand appropriately matched controls, found no increase in the risk of Crohn's Disease following measlesimmunisation (11). This finding is confirmed by datafrom Oxford and from Finland where no increase inCrohn's disease could be linked with the introductionof measles or MMR immunisation. In 1994 around 7million children in the UK received a combinedmeasles and rubella vaccine. National data from\"hospital episode statistics show no increase in new.:ases or exacerbation of existing cases of Crohn'sdisease folloviing this immunisation campaign. Thissurveillance will continue.Measles vaccination does not increase the risk ofCrohn's Disease.Have measles viruses been demonstrated in Crohn'sDisease tissues?Using a variety of different techniques (12,13), theRoyal Free Hospital Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseStudy Group (RFH- IBDSG) has suggested thatmeasles virus can be shown to be present ininflammatory bowel tissues affected by Crohn'sDiseaseUsing reagents provided by the RFH-IBDSG, an independent group could not replicate theRFH-IBDSG results (14). Using the most sensitiveand specific molecular techniques (reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR));Ank three groups of researchers, including the RFH-D3DSG, have not been able to detect measles virusgenetic material in either Crohn's Disease affectedtissues, normal or in peripheral bloodlymphocytes (15-18).Measles, MMR 'Vaccine, Crohn'sdisease and Autism PLJCMO/98/2 27 March 1998 Page 3 of 8 274 demonstrated sensitivity of the RTPCR methodsgives reassurance that if measles viruses were indeedpresent, they would have been detected. Measlesspecific antibodies do not appear to be raised inindividuals with Crohn's Disease (19,20).The most sensitive and specific techniques havefailed to detect the presence of measles viruses inCrohn's Disease tissues.It remains to be resolvedwhy less sensitive and less specific techniques appearsometimes to give positive results.Is Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) linked withMMR immunisation?It has been suggested that the incidence of autism andASD has increased since the introduction of MMRvaccine, particularly involving a presentation ofintellectual deficit in children who were developingnormally previously, with onset after MMRaccination.\\--.1he true incidence of autism is uncertain, since thediagnostic criteria have changed over recent years,and children whose conditions were diagnosed asother than autism in the past are now likely to beincluded within ASD. Autism with developmentalregression was well recognised before MMR vaccinebecame available, and children may present in thisway with signs of regression being recognised bothbefore and after receipt of MMR vaccine. The firstsigns of an autism-like disorder generally appear inthe second year of life.This coincides with the timewhen most children will receive their MMR vaccine.Such coincidence does not imply a causal link.Since autism has never been linked with measlesvaccine, and the only difference between it and MMRvaccine is the addition of rubella and mumps viruses,there is little biological plausibility for these twoOa% additional viruses to cause autism, as has beenproposed. Similarly, it is difficult to accept that therubella and mumps components of MMR have causeda bowel disturbance allowing leaked proteins todamage the brain within hours of immunisation, withno features of an encephalopathic illness, especially,vns ne alone.Measles, MAIL Crohn's diseaseand Autism PUCM0,98/2 27 March 1998 Page 4 of 8. 275 rita from this country, and from Sweden, show0arly, that whatever the trends in incidence of ,1autism, they bear no relationship to the introduction ofMMR vaccine (21, 22).It is also clear from UK and French data that there isno increase in the incidence of Crohn's Disease inchildren with autism (23).There is no evidence to indicate any link betweenMMR vaccine and autism.There appears to be nolink between autism and Crohn's Disease orulcerative colitis. It is possible that children withautism have a bowel disorder, and this warrantsfurther examination.What is the newly reported association of ileal-lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, autism, and MMRvaccine?I have considered carefully the recent paper byWakefield et al, published in the Lancet. This paperscribes 12 children with ileal-lymphoid nodular._jperplasia. This condition has previously beendescribed by Walker Smith, a co-author on the Lancetpaper, as benign\"due to the frequency of itsdemonstration in asymptomatic children\" (24). Otherauthors have found this condition to be common,occurring in 24% of barium follow-throughexaminations when investigating for suspectedchildhood chronic inflammatory bowel disease(25.26). Williams and Nicholls warn againstmisdiagnosis leading to inappropriate medication (27).Cumulative evidence suggests that this is indeed abenign condition, which disappears spontaneously,with no long-term sequelae (28). Since lymphoidnodular hyperplasia occurs commonly, it is notsurprising that it occurred commonly in these autisticchildren, especially as they were referred to apaediatric gastroenterology unit.Four children, of the twelve reported, were said tohave abnormally low levels of some immunoglobulinsInd this observation was used to propose an increasedsusceptibility to the effects of the viruses in MMR.However, the reference ranges reported were for adultlevels.If appropriate paediatric standards were used,only one child had a low IgA level, all of theMeasles, MMR Vaccine, Crohn'sdisease and Autism PLJCMO/98/2 27 March 1998 Page 5 of 8 276 0iuch criticism has already been published of the..._.aces inherent in the study,:.such:that no reliabilitycan be placed on the relevance of the association withMMR vaccine (29). Since the hypothesis offered toexplain the mechanism for the neurodevelopmentalproblems of these children is inconsistent andbiologically implausible, the purported link withMMR vaccine should be ignored.This study has demonstrated normal variants in ahighly selected sample, with no reason to believe thatMMR vaccine played a part in their condition.Should measles, mumps and rubella vaccines begiven separately?A number requested separate viruscomponents rather than combined MMR vaccine,based on media reporting of the opinions of one of theRFH-IBDSG researchers. There is no evidence thatMMR vaccine causes inflammatory bowel disease orApoutism, and there is no evidence that even if it did,,.,..jiving the vaccines separately would prevent theiroccurrence. Since there is no evidence for such a riskfrom MMR vaccine, and it is clear that giving thevaccines separately would leave children and theircontacts unnecessarily exposed to preventableinfectious diseases and their consequences, I cannotendorse an opinion that jeopardises child health.Parents should realise that separating MMR vaccineinto separate components is not, as has beenportrayed, a safer option: on the contrary, it is ademonstrably riskier option.Children should not be given separate measles,mumps and rubella vaccines in place of MMR, sincethere is no evidence for benefit and a clear risk ofharm from following such a practice.

Characteristically, all children described developedintestinal symptoms within days or soon after vaccination.The National Board of Health and National Public HealthInstitute launched a long-term vaccination project in 1982,which aimed at the elimination of MMR diseases fromFinland.' All children are vaccinated twice, as age 14-28months and 6 years; further vaccinations are carried outamong recruits of the defence forces and in some schools ofnursing. Only one type of live-virus vaccine (MMR orVirivac (Merck, West Point, PA, USA)) consisting rubella,respectively, has been used since beginning of the projectAdverse events in temporal relation to MMR vaccine wererepotted prospectively to the Institute. A form was filled andposted to us, followed by another form with furtherinformadon 2-3 weeks later. We traced those vaccines whodeveloped gastrointestinal symptoms or sips lasting 24 h ormore at any time after MMR vaccination (apart from withinthe first hour). We checked hospital or health centre recordsor interviewed the local public-health nurses.By the end of 1996, about three million vaccine doses hadbeen delivered by the Institute. 31 children developedgastrointestinal symptoms after vaccination (table); all except one after the first vaccine dose. Ifaemophilusinfloamae type b conjugate vaccine was given concomitantlyin four cases. 20 patients were admitted to hospital.Antibiotics were given in 11 cases, symptomatic relief innine, and intravenous 1-globulin was given to one child withGttillain Barr6 syndrome.The time between the reported event and our check ontheir health varied from 1 year and 4 months to 15 years and1 month. The mean interval was 9 years 3 months, themedian being 10 years and 8 months.Diarrhoea, frequently with vomiting, was the mostcommonsymptom(55%,n=17),followedbygingivostomatitis (23%, n=7), vomiting only (16%, n=5),and abdominal pains (n=2). The time from MMR vaccine toonset of symptoms varied front 20 h to 15 days. Duration ofsymptoms was not always Stated or recalled by nurses, butsubsidence within a week was usual, except in a 1-year-oldboy (patient 23) whose diarrhoea lasted for 6 weeks. Thechild recovered and was healthy when checked almost 6years later.

Three groups of researchers found no evidence of detectablevirus genome in clinical specimens from patients with inflammatory boweldisease using highly sensitive molecular approaches such as the reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Analysis ofserum from patients with Crohn's disease and of measles virus IgM by ELISAfound no evidence for a role of measles virus in the aetiology of Crohn'sdisease.Hypothesis 2. Exposure to measles in pregnancy or perinatal period presents a riskfor Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A case series of four mothers and childrenfrom Sweden suggested that infection during pregnancy may adversely affect foetusesincreasing the risk of Crohn's disease in the offspring.Discussion. Two case control studies, one from Denmark and the other fromthe United Kingdom, have not found an association between measles inpregnancy and IBD. In the United Kingdom case-control study involving47 individuals, no cases of IBD were found in the subjects exposed to measlesin utero, although one case of Crohn's and one case of ulcerative colitiswere found in controls.Hypothesis 3. Live attenuated measles vaccine is associated with increased risk ofCrohn's disease. The significant differences in the rates of Crohn's disease andulcerative colitis between people receiving active immunization with measles vaccineand unvaccinated controls provide evidence that measles vaccine virus has a role inthe aetiology of IBD. One study by Thompson et al. that compared a cohort ofimmunized children from 1964 with an unimmunized cohort from 1958 suggestedan increased risk of Crohn's disease in the immunized cohort.Discussion_ An increase of Crohn's disease predates measles vaccine. Recentincidence goes flat in under 20s who have had measles vaccine. The studyby Thomson et al, has been severely criticized regarding the selection ofcases with unmatched controls, differential drop-out rates in the two groups,and different means of case ascertainment. Another case-control study bythe East Dorset Gastroenterology Group showed no link between liveattenuated measles vaccination and the subsequent risk of developing eitherCrohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.Hypothesis 4. MR and MMR are risk factors for Crohn's disease, and the threeviruses given together have harmful effects. The long-lasting immunosuppressivequalities of the measles virus indicates that viral interaction may be plausibleconstituting a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease. It has been alleged that\"the incidence of Crohn's disease has increased since 1994 MR campaign\": and that\"since the introduction of MMR in 1988, the risk of IBD has increased threefold.\" 54 Report of the Techniad Review Group meeting, 1998 283 Discussion. The immunosuppressive effect of measles vaccine is slight. Data from Oxford and Finland studies show that no increase in Crohn's disease were linked with the introduction of MMR immunization. In 1994,approximately seven million children received a combined measles and rubella vaccine. Data from hospital episode statistics show no increase in new cases or exacerbation of existing cases of Crohn's disease following immunizationcampaign. MMR has been used for 25 years in the US; more than 150 million doses have been administered with no evidence to support allegation of harm. There is no biologically plausible mechanism; each virus elicits its effects at different times.Hypothesis 5 .MMR is a risk factor for autism. The incidence of autism has increased since the introduction of MMR, especially regressive autism. A Member of Parliament (United Kingdom), declared in a parliamentary debate in 1997: \"The work of three researchers has proven a link between MMR vaccine and autism.\"Discussion. The actual incidence of autism is uncertain, since diagnostic criteria have changed in recent years and children whose conditions were diagnosed as other than autism in the past are now likely to be includedwithin autistic spectrum disorder. Autism, with developmental regression, was well recognized before MMR vaccine was available, and children may present in this way with signs of regression being recognized both beforeand after receipt of MMR vaccine.The first signs of an autism-like disorder generally appear in the second year of life. This coincides with the time when most children receive theirMMR vaccine. Such coincidence does not imply a causal link. Data from the United Kingdom and from Sweden, clearly show that whatever the trends in incidence of autism, they bear no relationship to the introduction of MMRvaccine. It is also clear from United Kingdom and French data that there is no increase in the incidence of Crohn's Disease in children with autism.There is no evidence to indicate any link between MMR vaccine and autism, in the threeresearch studies mentioned. The author of one study declared\"My studies have not scientifically addressed this issue.\" The second study reported that, since autism has never been linked with measles vaccine, thereis no biological plausibility to admit that rubella and mumps components of MMR have caused a bowel disturbance allowing leaked proteins to damage the brain within hours of immunization. In the third study, cases after MMR did not have urinary excretion of 'substance specific for autism'.Hypothesis 6. A recent paper published in Lancet that included investigations in 12 autistic children reported an association between ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and developmental regression and is common, follow-through examinations when investigating for suspectedchildhood chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Cumulative evidencesuggests that this is indeed a benign condition, which disappearsspontaneously, with no long-term sequelae. Since lymphoid nodularhyperplasia occurs commonly, it is not surprising that it occurred commonlyin these autistic children, especially as they were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit. Four children, of the twelve reported, were said to WHO/VRD/GEN/911.02 55 284 have abnormally low levels of some immunoglobulins and this observationwas used to propose an increased susceptibility to the effects of the virusesin MMR. However, the reference ranges reported were for adult levels. Ifappropriate paediatric standards were used, only one child had a low IgAlevel. AU of the remaining values were within normal ranges. Much criticismhas already been published on the biases inherent in the study, such that noreliability can be placed on the relevance of the association with MMRvaccine. The hypothesis explainingthe mechanismfortheneurodevelopmental problems of these children andbiologically implausible.Conclusion: Measles, MMR, Crohn's Disease, and AutismMore than 30 experts met at the Medical Research Council (MRC) on 23 March1998 to consider the available data relating to a possible link between measles virusinfection, inflammatory conditions of the bowel, and autism. Evidence was presentedin the fields of virology, epidemiology and gastroenterology. Conclusions wereconsidered and conveyed to the Chief Medical Officer for England.The MRC expert group concluded:(1) Available virological and epidemiological evidence does not support a causalrole for persistent measles virus infection and Crohn's disease.(2) There is no evidence to indicate any link between MMR vaccination and boweldisease or autism.(3) A better understanding of the causes of Crohn's disease and autism is needed.The Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine (where the studies on Crohn'sdisease and autism were conducted) has agreed that the Department of Healthshould not alter its present policy for the vaccination of children with MMR.Handling of problemAnticipatoryEfforts to stimulate national and international studies to examine proposedhypotheses.Reviews by national advisory committee.Review by independent experts via MRCagenda arranged by The RoyalFree Hospital School of Medicine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group.ResponsiveLetter from the Chief Medical Office to all doctors.Active response to media enquiries.New, reassuring advertising and materials. 56 Repo of the Technical Review Group mean 1998 285 Lessons learnedThe media are attracted to scare stories and may appear to champion singleworkers against the establishment.The support of international agencies, e.g., WHO, is very helpful.Unlike the pertussis scare of the 1970s, answers were obtained in parallel, notin series.

Insert Leaflet for parents autism and Crahlet diseaseare oat averted 61 a detailed review of tam and a newepdemialasital surdOn the basis of their research findings, a group at theRoyal Free Hospital, London led by Dr AndrewWakefield has suggested that both measles infectionand measles vaccination may be associated with anincreased tisk of Crohn's disease, and that MMRvaccine may be associated with the development ofautism (a disorder frequently diagnosed in the secondyear of life). MMR vaccine was introduced into theroutine C K immunisation programmes in 1988, sincewhen around 10 million immunisations have beengiven to children at the age of 13-15 months, as wcUas at 4 years of age.All the available evidence relevant to these concernshas been carefully reviewed by the independentexpect committees which routinely advise on thesafety of medicines and on immurusation pobcy (theCommittee on Safety of Medicines and the JointCommittee on Vaccination and Immunisation) andby an independent expert group convened in March1998 by the Medical Research Council (MR.C). Theview of aU these groups is that the evidence cited byWakefield and colleagues does not support theconcerns raised.Page No.9 However it is inevitably difficult to refute completelysuch claims and they have understandably causedconcern to parents and health professionals. In particular.there is a substantial number of individual reports frompatents whO believe that MMR vaccine is responsiblefor the subsequent development of autism or Crohn'sdisease in their children. During 1996-7 the MedicinesControl Agency was informed by a firm ofsolicitorsthat they had received several hundred such reports. Awide Variety of other conditions had also been reported.CSM Working Partyin order that more information could be obtained aboutthese possible adverse effects, purpose-designedquestionnaires were sent to parents via the solicitors -To validate information received from parents, furtherquestionairc:2 were sent to the doctors (the GP and atleast one specialist) who had cared for these children.On the advice of the Committee on Safety of Medicines,a Working Parry was formed to assess these parentalreports togerbet with medical evidence received fromthe GPs and specialists. The Working Party includedmembers with specialist expertise in the fields ofgastroenterology, genetal paediatrics, paediatricneurology and child psychiatry. Based on their review ofcase information described shove, the Working Partyreached the conclusions shown in the box overleaf. 9 Volume 2S, June 1999 BEST COPY AVAILABLE of 287r%al A. 4nagner An Conclusions of the Working Patty on MMR Vaccine1.The exercise undertaken in respect of cases ofchildren with adverse effects attributed by parents toMMR or MR vaccine and reported to a Coln of soficitatshas yielded a considerable volume of medicalinformation which was extremely variable in qualityand completeness.2.The information evaluated has importantintrinsic limitations as regards assessing whether thevaccines are, or arc not, causally associated with theattributed adverse effects. Notably these are: bias inthe selection deans for which it would be impossibleto compensate, and a kek of any control (unimmunised)group with which the frequency and characteristics ofthe attributed illnesses could be compared. Also thesewas frequent divergence between patents and doctorsregarding specific details of the illnesses.3.Detailed evaluation of 92 cues with autism andall IS cases with confirmed Crohn's disease revealedno extraordinary features which suggested a novelsyndrome, nor did it support causal associations withMMR co MR vaccines. In particular, no cue of autismdeveloped following an acute unexpected and/orunexplained neutologicd event in the post - vaccinationperiod.4.For only 8 cues of the 92 with autism and 4 of the 15 with Crohn's diseasewas satisfactory evidenceavailable to infer () medical confirmation of the diagnosis (u) a close temporal association between administration of the vaccine and onset of the illness(di) no relevant prior history and (tv) absence of an attentive cause. The numbers of such cases identifiedwas therefore small. Furthermore these factors aloneare insufficient to prove causation, particularly as she onset of autism is frequently recognised around thetime MMR vaccine is given. The pattern of the illnessesrepotted for the 8 cases with autism and 4 wids Crohn'sdisease cited above did not appear to differ from that of other children with these disorders. Mute was noevidence to suggest that administration of MMR orMR vaccine was associated with particular variants ofpervasive developmental disorder or inbutunatorybowel disease.5.k was impossilate to prove ot =firm the suggestedassociations between MMR vaccine and autism orinflammatory bowel disease because of the nature ofthe information, the self-selecnon of cases and thelack of comparators. Nevertheless, the Wading Punfound that the information available did not supportthe suggested causal associations or give cause forconcern about the ssfery of MMR or MR vaccines. Epidemiological evidenceEvidence ftorn other countries does not support anincreased incidence of autism or Crohn's disease whichcan be attributed to the introduction of MMRvaccke'\". Howevec in order to further study thesuggested association with autism, the MedicinesConsist Agency conatrussioned an epidemiologicalstudy in the North Thames region which has recentlybeen completed and is published in The. Lancetthisweekend'. This study linked diagnostic informationfrom cluucal records with independently collectedimmunisation data.The study indicates that there wasno sudden -step.up\" or change in the incidence trendline of autism after the introduction of MMR vaccine.In individual cases, the age of diagnosis was notrelated to vaccination status and there was no cleartemporal clustering of new cases of autism in relationto immunisation. The authors concluded that theiranaly.es did not support a causal association betweenMMR vaccine and autism.ConclusionsThe review conducted by the Working Party and dieNorth Thames study provide important new evidencewhich was not available when the MRC expert groupwas convened. Neither supports the hypothesis thatMMR or MR vaccines are causally associated withautism or Crohn's disease.

The World linalth Organisation, like the Department of Health inthe United Kingdom, is interested in learning of any suggestion that a vaccine might not be safe.Having reviewed the papers by Taylor et al (I) and the Working Party of the Committee on Safety ofMedicines (2), we note that they are accurate and add farther to the scientific evidence already misting.There is no link between the vaccines containing measles (particularly MM R) and these two groups ofdiseases. The reports represent another step in strengthening the position of WHO which we have alreadypublicly stated (3).We rennin open to any fresh scientific evidence that might be generated to provide new insights. Thecurrent evidence clearly demonstrates however that there is no proof of association between administration\"of WAR and these two clinical entities. It would be morally indefensible of WHO to do anything otherthan continue promoting the widespread we of these vaccines which save million of lives each year, andprevent millions more from suffering terrible complications of the diseases.Yours sincerely,References 1.Taylor B at aL no epidemiological midi:flee formissal association.Committee on Safety of Medicine.

The authors of the 10-yearretrospective study of children with an autistic spectrum disorder in the Noah Thames regioncon:luded that them was no association between autism and the vaccine (to be published inThe Lancet. 9 June 1999). A smaller scale study of 200 children (to be reported in Current problems in pharmacovigitanee) similarly found no association. Parents are often confused by media reports on this subject. A leaflet summarising the issuesis available from the Health Education Authority. However, the NAS has been contacted bylarge numbers of parents concerned about the possibility of their child contracting an autisticspectrum condition following the MMR vaccination. If parents are still concerned about thepossible risks (particularly if they already have a child with autism or the child to bevaccinated already shows some risk factors) they should consult their GP for futtber advice.The National Autistic Society shares parents' concerns that vaccines used should be as safe asis possible. The general medical consensus. supported by the Department of Health and the World HealthOrganisation, is that childhood immunisation has provided vast benefits to millions of peopleboth in the UK and world-wide and should be continued. The general medical advice is tohave children vaccinated. It is difficult to assess temporal trends in the incidence of autism due to changes in referralpattern and diagnostic criteria. More basically, however, the epidemiological data is simplynot collected in the UK. The National Autistic Society would welcome the collection ofepidemiological data on the incidence of autistic spectrum disorders. Rigorousepidemiological study of large populations of children would help to resolve the manyquestions of prevalence and causation in autism. Date: AUTISM11.~mooV.0.00011/0011.4114. w ...11.

MMR is a combined vaccine usually given to children between 12 and 15 months of ageand again at around four years, as protection against measles, mumps and rubella. MMR wasintroduced into the UK immunisation programme in 1988 and has substantially reduced theincidence of death and disability due to these three infections. A combined measles andrubella vaccine (MR) was given to 90 per cent of children aged five to 16 in October 1994 toavert an anticipated epidemic.2. Autism is a developmental disorder that usually appears in the second year of life.

Although there is noscientific evidence to support this claim,'' neither arethere robust data on the prevalence of autism in childrenborn before and after the introduction of MMR vaccineto the UK in 1988. The postulated causal link betweenMMR vaccination and autism was based on a reportedclose temporal association between these two events.'Since MMR vaccine is given at around 12-15 months ofago and the mean age at which parents of children withautismfirstreportconcernabouttheirchild'sdevelopmentis18-19 months,'aclosetemporalassociation in some autistic children would be expectedby chance,We undertook a population-based study in the NorthEast Thames region to investigate trends in the incidenceof autistic disorders before and after the introduction ofMMR vaccine in October, 1988, and the immunisationhistories of children with these disorders. We used case-series analysis methods to test for clustering of onsetswithin defined posnraccination periods.Patients and methodsChildren with mimic disorders born since 1979 were identifiedin eight health districts in mid-19e8 from computerised specialneeds/disability registers at child development centres and fromrecords in special schools. Information on children with suchdisorders who were younger than 16 years of age was extractedfrom clinical records by one of three experienced paedlauicregistrars. The information extracted included the age at whichthe autistic disorder was diagnosed, the recorded age at whichtheparentsfastbecame concernedabouttheelsikl'sdevelopmental sore, and the age at which the regression becameobvious, if that was a feature.By use of criteria of the International Classification ofDiseases, tenth revision (IMW), the diagnosis of autism waschecked against information in the available records an thechild's present condition and his or her condition between theages of 18 months and 3 years.

Because of the skeweddisuibution of the age at diagnosis of autism, the analysis wasdone on logarithms of age, with linear regression to compare themean log ages in the three vaccine categories, and with controlfor the effect of birth cohort.Third, possible temporal associations between vaccinationsand the age at diagnosis of autism, the recorded age at parentalconcern, and the age of onset of regression west analysed by thecase-seeks method.*' This method is mild for rare chronicdisorders of acute onset. For autism diagnosis, we investigatedperiods within 1 or 2 years after vaccination as the risk periods.For date at parental concern, we looked at periods of within 6months or 1 year after vaccination. Because of the suggestionthat regression may be an acute event after vaccination' weconsidered periods of within 2 months, 4 months, and 6 monthsof vaccination. Where vaccination and the event of interestoccurred in the same month, we assumed that vaccinationpreceded theevent. Two analyseswere done for eachcombination of endpoint and risk period; die took rubella vaccine ignored; and thesecond included all three types of vaccine. In each analysis, thereference period for each individual consisted of every monthfrom birth to the end of August, 1998, that did not fill during apostvaccination risk period. All analyses were finely stratified forage,particularlyin youngerage-groups, becauseof themulti:nodal age distribution of recorded events. 17 age-groupswere used for autism diagnosis, 30 for parental concern, and 21for regression.Results498 children with autism were identified: 261 with typical(core) autism (prevalence rate in children under 16 yearsof age 5.3 per 10 000), 166 (3.4 per 10 000) with atypicalautism, and 71(1.4per 10 000) with Asperger'ssyndrome. The diagnosis could be confirmed withICI)10 criteria, from information recorded in the clinicalnotes, in 214 (82%) cases of core autism, 52 (31%) casesof atypical autism, and 27 (38%) cases of Asperses'ssyndrome. 441 (89%) children were documented ashavingbeenassessedbyaneurodevelopmentalpaedlatrician, 411 (83%) by a speech therapist, and 422(85%) by a child psychiatrist or a crudest or educationalpsychologist. 192 (39%) were recorded as having alsobeen assessed at a centre specialising in autism.The median ages at diagnosis, first parental concern,and regression according, to diagnostic category areshown in table 1.

There was asignificant clustering of parentat concern within 6 monthsof vaccination (p=0.03) but no significant excess risk inany of the other of parental concern byinterval in months since latest MMR vaccination showeda peak at 5 months (22 cases compared with a range offour to 14 for the remaining intervals up to 12 months).This excess was largely attributable to the peak recordedage of parental concern being 18 months, combined withthe peak in MMR vaccination at 13 months. When thedata were reanalysed without cases with recorded age atparental concern of 18 months (n=61), all statisticalsignificancedisappeared.Forease-seriesanalysesrestricted to CM'S of core autism, the results (not shown)were similar to those in table 2 with the exception of ageat onset of parental concern within 6 months of MMRvaccination, which showed no significant excess risk(relative incidence 115 (95% CI 0-81-1.95)); the relativeincidence when analysed separatelyremained raised at 1.99 (1-08-3-68).DiscussionVaccination and vaccine safety are issues of majorconcern to the public, their elected representatives, andall health-care workers. Possible adverse reactions tovaccines have a particular attraction to various pressuregroups and to the media, with important, and possiblycatastrophic,effectsonpublicconfidenceinimmunisations and on vaccine uptake.\" The study byWakefield and others' and earlier work from thoseinvestigators suggesting an association between measles-containing vaccines and inflammatory bowel diseas\"(not confirmed in their subsequent studies\") receivedmuch media attention and have had an adverse effect onimmunisation uptake.\" The consequences of these eventsare that many children are now at risk of measles,mumps, andrubella,andthatthepossibilityoferadication of measles has been delayed.Our study was designed to test the hypothesis thatMMR vaccination is causally associated with autism. Thestudy has some limitations: two of these are that we couldnot verify the diagnosis according to ICD10 criteria insome cases, and that the ascertainment may have beenincomplete. The clinical notes were of variable qualityand many did not contain systematic or regularly updatedinformation which would have allowed independentvalidation of the diagnosis, particularly in the childrenwith atypical autism or Asperger's syndrome. However,we have confidence in the overall reliability of thediagnosis of autism in our study. Most cases weredocumentedas having been assessed by specialistclinicians, and the remainder are highly likely to havebeen as well. There was close similarity between theICD10-confirmed and non-confirmed cases, and all theanalyses showed almost identical results when repeatedwith only ICD10-confirmed cases. We made substantialefforts to capture all cases of autism in study districtsfrom multiple sources, but inevitably some cases will havebeen missed, particularly children educated outside theirborough and not known to local health services oreducation authorities. Nevertheless, our prevalence ratesfor autism are similar to those reported in othercontemporary studies.\" Incomplete case ascertainmentwould not affect the validity of our results for the case-series analyses unless the unidentified children withautism were more likely than those we identified to havehad onset in close temporal association with MMRvaccine; this possibility seems unlikely.There is uncertainty about whether the prevalence ofautism is increasing.\" Our study is consistent with anincrease in the incidence of autism in recent birthcohorts. This increase may be real or a reflection of otherfactors such as better recording arrangements in recentyears, the increasing recognition of higher functioningchildren with autism and Asperger's syndrome, togetherwith an increasing number of professionals trained torecognisethe disorders. However, whether real orartifactual,thetrend inincreasingincidence withsuccessive binh cohorts to 1992 was not related to theintroduction of MMR vaccine or to vaccine coverage,which reached a plateau during a period in which autismincidence was apparendy increasing.We looked for evidence of a possible causal associationbetween MMR vaccination and onset of autism byinvestigating whether, after adjustment for birth-cohorteffects on incidence, age at diagnosis of autism variedwith vaccination status. The age at diagnosis was foundto be independent of whether MMR vaccine was given,or in those vaccinated, whether the vaccine was givenbefore or after 18 months of agethe earliest age atdiagnosis of core or atypical autism.

None of theseanalyses suggest a causal association between MMRvaccination and autism.The case - seriesanalyses showed no evidence oftemporal clustering between MMR or other measles-containing vaccines and diagnosis of autism. Regression,as reported in other studies,' occurred in nearly a third ofthe cases of core autism; regression was not clustered inthe months after vaccination. For age at first parentalconcern, no significant temporal clustering was seen forcases of core autism or atypical autism, with theexception of a single interval within 6 months of MMRvaccine associated with a peak in reported age at firstparental concern at 18 months. This peak is likely toreflect the difficulty experienced by parents in definingthe precise age at onset of symptoms in their child,particularly those with atypical autism, and consequentapproximation with preference for 18 months.Our results do not support the hypothesis that MMRvaccinationiscausally related to autism, eitherits initiationor to the onset of regressionthe mainsymptom mentioned in the paper by Wakefield andothers.'Thedataonclinicalpresentationandimmunisation status of the cases in our study wererecorded before the retest publicity suggesting a possiblelink between MMR vaccine and autism.

Counterbalancing these side-effects were 29 fewerinvasive breast cancers and 17 fewer in-situ carcinomas.For every 19 women treated with tamostifen, one eventwas avoided. Over half of all ipsilateral recurrences weretreated with mastectomy. By extrapolation from the datapresented, 22 mastectomies were prevented by tamoxifen,with one mastectomy avoided for every 40 women treated.From a biologicalstandpoint, ER function andexpression are fascinating and of direct relevance toprimary prevention as well as to treatment of DCIS. ERexpression is not routinely tested for in DCIS, but perhapsit should be now. Data cited by Fisher and colleaguesshow that ER-positivity rates in DCIS are high, althoughless so where comedonecrosis is present' Parallels withNSABP P-1 come to mind, since in that prevention trial,tamoxifen seems to have delayed or prevented Eli-positivecancers preferentially. If this finding were to apply inDCIS as well, it would strengthen the notion that ERexpression (and subsequent phenotypic behaviour) is anearly event in the development abreast cancer. Since notall DCIS is ER positive, this disorder might be a goodmodel for targeting non-ER-mediated molecular pathwaysinthe searchfor new preventive and therapeuticstrategies.Where to now? The next generation of studies needs torefine the outstanding achievements of NSABP B-17 andB-24. Specifically, information is needed on whether adefined group of women with DCIS can be treated withbreast-conserving surgery alone, and whether anothergroup can be treated with surgery and radiotherapy butwithout tamoxifen. For nous putting it all together is amatter for negotiation between patient and clinician. Areasonable view of the data presented should be that thebenefits of tamoxifen far outweigh the risks.

A special panel of the UK Medical ResearchCouncilalsofoundtheevidenceunconvincing.'Nonetheless, thehypothesisgenerated much martsattention in the LTK, with a subsequent drop in acceptanceof MMR vaccinations.'Less noticed were reports by the same group (andothers) that highly specific laboratory assays in patientswith inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the postulatedmechanism for autism after MMR vaccination, werenegative for measles virus'\" This week sees the publicationof two 'other reports that do not support a =satassociation between MMR (or other measles-containingvaccines) and autism or MD. One report is by the WorkingParty on MMRVaccine of the UK's Committee on Safetyof Medicines.' The Working Party was charged with theevaluation of several hundred reports, collected by a firm ofsolicitors, of autism, Crobn's disease, or similar disordersdeveloping after MMR or MR vaccination. The WorkingParty conducted a systematic, standee-cased review ofinformationfromparentsandphysicians. Althoughacknowledging that It is imposuble to prove or refute thesuggested associations (because of variable quality of data,biased selection of cases, and lack of a control group), theWorking Party conducted that the information available didnot support the suggested causal associations or give causefor concern about the safety of MMR or MR vaccines.In today's Lancer, Bran Woe and colleagues providepopulation-based evidence that overcomes many of thelimitations faced by the Working Party. Taylor andcolleagues identified all 498 known patients with autismspectrum disorders (ASD) in North EauThames who hadbeen born in 1979 or later, and linked them to anindependent regional vaccination registry. ASD includestypical (core) autism, atypical autism, and Asperger'ssyndrome, but the results were similar when cases of coreautism were analysed separately. The investigators firstshowed that the known number of cases of ASD cases hasbeen increasing since 1979 and that there was no sharpincrease after the introduction of MMR vaccine in 1988.Second, they found that, among affected individuals, theage at diagnosis was similar whether the child had beenVaccinated before a after age 18 months, or had not beenvaccinated, which indicates that vaccination does not resultin =lief expression of autinie charactaisties. Third, theyshowed that at age 2 years MMR vaccination coverageamong the children with ASD was nearly identical with thatin children in the 38131e birth cohorts in the whole region,which provides evidence of an overall lack of assosiationwith vaccination.Taylor and colleagues then used an innovative \"case-series\" method to assess the relative incidence of autismwithin predefined time periods after vaccination. Theseanalyses Involved three different measures of onset ofautism (date of diagnosis, date of first parental concan,anddate of regression) and two vaccine categories (MMR andany measles-containing vaccine). No statistically significantassociations were found in the 14 comparisons, except fora slightly increased relative incidence (148) for theassociation of MMR Vaccination and initial paternalconcern (which access to have been due to parents'difficulty in recalling the precise age at onset and hence apreference for approximating the age as 18 months).Although the cast-series method may be better suited forthe study of an acute disease than of chronic disorders withan insidious onset, such as ASD, the resuln are buttressedby the lack of associations found in the other analyses. THE LANCET WI 353 quite 12,1999 1987 301 Thefindingsalsoareconsistentwithcurrent understanding of the pathogenesis of autism, a syndrome definedbycertainbehaviouralanddevelopmentalcharacteristics that may have a verity of causes. In fewcases, however, is a specific cause identified. Autism has astrong genetic component, and associated neurologicaldefects probably occur early in embryonic development.'Thus, in most 'cases, autism represents a birth defect,although it may not be diagnosed until bier in Ole whencommunication delaysandcharacteristicbehavioursbecome apparent. It seems unlikely therefore that avaccination that is given after birth could cause autism.Rare cases have, however, been described, of a normalchild regressing and acquiring autistic characterisdes. It issuch cases of regressive disorders for which a biological linkwith vaccination is plausible' The onset of developmentalregression tends to be clearly demarcated, making thedisorder more amenable to the case-series method- Thus,Taylor and colleagues' analysis showing no associationbetween vaccination and onset of regression providesespecially persuasive evidence against the hypothesis thatMMR may cause or exacerbate autism.Taylor and colleagues conclude with the hope that theirresults \"... will reassure parents and others who have beenconcerned about the possibility that MMR vaccine is likelyto cause autism and that they will help restore confidence inMMR vaccine\".

Yet the popular mediatrumpeted the study as providing evidence that MMRvaccination may cause 1BD. In such an environment it iscritical to strengthen vaccine safety monitoring systemsand risk-communication strategies to maintain publicconfidence in immunisations.Frank 311:966,4 Maass D Rh, Salmon Limas 1998;351:1927.SChadwick N.

Now, a little more than 10 years afterpublicationof the Cooperative North ScandinavianEnalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS); which firstindicated the survival benefit of inhibition of angiotensha-converting enzyme (ACE) in severe heart failure, theadditional benefit of a- blockade is also well proven.Withthe publication today of the mortality results of theMeroprolol CR/XL Randomised Intervention Trial inCongestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HT) by the Crikebomgroup who pioneered this approach, there are nowsufficient data to indicate certainty of benefit and toprovide a basis for recommending B-blocket use in-appropriate patients.Between 1980 and 1997, 24 randomised controlledtrials of a- blockers in heart failure were reported. Thesetrials included a total of 3141 patients with ischaemic ornon-ischaemic causes of heart failure: more than 80%were on standard ACE-inhthitor treatment.

However, I would liketo know a little more detail about the first two analyses in the study.For their first analysis, Taylor and colleagues state in the Summary that \"there was a steady increase incases by year of birth with no sudden 'step-up' or change in the trend line after the introduction of MMRvaccination\". The visual support for this statement is given in their figure 1, which apparently shows casesincreasing before the introduction of the vaccine to the 1987 birth cohorts, the \"first birth cohorts eligiblefor MMR vaccine in the second year of life\"; and the statement is supported statistically by anon-significant test for a \"step-up\" at this time point. The persuasiveness of the graph and the choice of thistime point rest presumably on the idea that cases born before 1987 either would not have been vaccinatedor would have been vaccinated after they were diagnosed as having autism. But children born before 1987were also eligible for MMR vaccination, albeit after their second year of life. I have not been able todeduce from the numbers presented how many of the 109 study children born before 1987 received MMRvaccine. Could Taylor and colleagues supply the relevant details of this group of 109 (in particular thenumber vaccinated before diagnosis)? They could also helpfully give some idea of the proportion of thepopulation vaccinated by year of birth, starting at the 1983 birth cohort, the earliest which in principlecould have been vaccinated before a diagnosis under age 60 months. Readers could then assess whether asingle \"step-up\" or a more gradual increase should be expected if there were a causal association.As regards the second analysis, there are two issues on which further clarification is desirable. Taylor andcolleagues found that age at diagnosis did not differ between the three groups (children vaccinated before18 months, at or after 18 months, or never vaccinated). However, this finding is useful only if age atdiagnosis is closely related to the true age of onset of symptoms. There is some evidence that this may notbe the case. Research by the National Autistic Society found that 40% of parents wait more than 3 years fora diagnosis.2 Indeed, Taylor and colleagues allude to delays in diagnosis. There is therefore some need forcaution in interpretation here. Although the variable age at parental concern is heavily prone to bias, use ofage at diagnosis in this context may introduce an important bias in the opposite direction (ie, towardsobtaining a negative finding).An equivalent analysis with age at parental concern, which showed no evidence of a difference between thethree groups, would be particularly reassuring, because it would be despite a bias working towards apositive finding.Secondly, because Taylor and colleagues presented evidence for an absence of association, regressioncoefficients and Cls would be helpful, rather than just the p value (0-41) for what I guess is the F test forthe null hypothesis of no difference in the (geometric) means of the three groups. In the absence of explicitpower calculations, I would like to know that any differences in means were small as well asnon-significant.I am surprised that so much of the burden of public reassurance is made to fall on attempts to show thatthere is no association between autism and MMR vaccination. I have been persuaded to have my own childvaccinated mainly by the fundamental idea that the risks from not vaccinating are substantially higher than 1 04/05/2000 5:06 P6/ BESTCOPYAVAILABLE Correspondence Autism rubella vaccine hoplitsvwseshelancetcongnewlancetiregri...vol3SSno9201/bodynomaspondence409.ht those from vaccinating.

Lancet 1999; 353: 2026-29.2 Stirling A, Prior A. Opening the door. London: National Autistic Society, 1999.Authors' replySir--Dan Altmann is correct in noting that some children born before 1987 received MMR vaccine. Thisjssue was raised by Wakefield .1 We responded2 by identifying the 36 children in our cohort born before1987 who received MMR vaccine. Age at parental concern was recorded in 29 of these; in all cases thiswas before MMR vaccination was given. Thus the \"catch-up\" programme could have had no effect on ourfindings. Nor do these findings support Wakefield's assertion) that the apparent rise in the prevalence ofautism up to 1992 can be linked to the introduction of MMR vaccine.We agree with Altmann that there may be delay in the diagnosis of autism. He suggests that such delaysmight have affected the power of our analyses on age at diagnosis by vaccine group. We presented thatanalysis in our paper, with parameter estimates and CIs as well as p values. We have undertaken a furtheranalysis, as Altmann suggests, of age at parental concern by vaccine group; this presented some difficultiesbecause parental concern predated vaccination in many more cases than did age at diagnosis. We restrictedthe analysis to the 244 cases with age at parental concern between 15 months and 48 months (excludingtwo unvaccinated outliers with first parental concern at 84 months and 132 months). We found nosignificant difference in mean log age at parental concern between children receiving MMR vaccine beforethe age of 15 months (n=108), those receiving vaccine at 15 months or later (n=88), and those notreceiving MMR vaccine (n=48). The p value for the F test was 0-61 and the parameter estimates, expressedas fold-differences in geometric mean ages, were: vaccinated before 15 months over unvaccinated 0.96(95% CI 0-86-1.09); vaccinated after 15 months over unvaccinated 0-94 (0.84-1-06). Similar results wereobtained (pm-0.35) for the 229 cases with age at parental concern at 18 months or later, with vaccinerecipients categorised into those receiving MMR vaccine before or after age 18 months.We agree with Altmann that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks. The purpose of our study wasto address a specific hypothesis on a possible association between MMR vaccination and autism raised byWakefield and colleagues.3 These investigators were careful to emphasise that they had not proved such anassociation. The three senior paediatricians involved subsequently emphatically endorsed currentvaccination policy.4 The negative findings of our study reinforce these messages.*Brent Taylor, Elizabeth Miller, Paddy Farrington \"Community Child Health, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Royal Free Campus,London NW3 2PT; Immunisation Division, Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, London; andDepartment of Statistics, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK 2 04/05/2000 5106 Pl BEST COPYAVAILABLE 304 Correspondence : Autism and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine lutp://Www.tbelancet.cominevolancetiregA...vol355no920l/body.coire-spondence409.h 1 Wakefield AJ.

The group'smain conclusions are:Between March 1998 and September 1999 there was no new evidence tosuggest a causal link between MMR and IBD/autism (confirming the earlierview of the ad hoc group)Much remains unknown about inflammatory bowel disorders and autism andmore research in these areas is neededThe group was chaired by Professor Alan McGregor of the GKT School of Medicineat King's College, London. The report is published on the MRC's web site atwww.mrc.ac.uk/Autism report.htmlThe MRC also announced today that it is to fund one of the largest studies of autismever attempted. The study, to be led by Professor Andrew Hall of the London Schoolof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will attempt to find out what causes the condition.The researchers will study whether autistic children have a history of otherconditions or medical problems, for example, problems during birth. They will look atwhether viral infections in the womb or soon after birth appear to play a role inproducing autism. By looking at a representative sample of health records drawnfrom over two million people registered with 300 general practices across the UK,the researchers will also be able to examine any possible association betweenautism and the MMR vaccine.Professor Hall said: \"Partly because of its rarity, we know very little about whatcauses autism. Most of the studies to date have been small and have notconsidered all the possible risk factors simultaneously. We hope our study will beginto answer some of the questions about this important developmental disorder.\"The study is one of 85 new grants totalling almost \u00a344 million announced by the 1 of research programmes in many areas of health and medicine.MRC's total support for medical research in the 1999-2000 financial year isapproximately \u00a3331 million.For more information contact the MRC press office on 020 7637 6011.NOTES TO EDITORSThe Medical Research Council (MRC) established in 1913, alms to improve healthby promoting research into all areas of medical and related science.

Background In March 1998, the MRC had held an ad hoc meeting of experts to examineevidence relating measles vaccine to chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Themain conclusions of this meeting had been that: i.the balance of available virological and epidemiological evidence was againstthe persistence of measles in Crohn's disease;ii. there was no correlation between measles or mumps infection alone andCrohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis (UC); andiii.there was no current evidence linking bowel disease or autism with MMRvaccine and there was thus no reason, arising from the work considered, for achange in the current MMR vaccination policy.Following this meeting, Council had decided to set up an Expert Subgroup (as aSubgroup of the Strategy Development Group) to steer and monitor research inthese areas.6.

Conclusions.Based on their discussions during the four meetings, the main conclusions of theSubgroup were that:i. much remained unknown about inflammatory bowel disorders and autismii.MRC support for research in these areas, and IBD in particular, was relativelyweakiii. between March 1998 and September 1999 there had been no new evidence tosuggest a causal link between MMR and IBD/autism, (confirming the earlierview of the ad hoc Group).6.2 Recommendations6.2.1 ResearchIn the course of discussion of current and future research strategies, the Subgroupidentified a number of areas of study that might serve to elucidate the aetiology andpathogenesis of IBD and autism, and to evaluate treatments or managementapproaches.

The measles epidemic of1989-1991 in this country affected more than 55,000 people; 11,000were hospitalized and more than 120 died. A major cause of the epidemic was failure to vaccinate childrenon time at 12-15 months of age.The congressional hearing is focusing on autism, including an unsubstantiated link to vaccines such asMMR (measles, mumps and rubella).\"While I support any effort to discover the reason a child has autism, current scientific data indicate thatvaccines are not the cause,\" Dr. Cook said.Autism manifests itself in the first three years of life, which is the same time a child is being vaccinated,but timing is the only link. A study in the British medical journal Lancet found similar autism rates amongchildren who received the MMR vaccine and those who had not. A report commissioned by Britain'sMedical Research Council and released this week found that there was no link between MMR and autismor bowel disorders.The American Academy of Pediatrics supports aggressive research into the causes, treatment andprevention of autism as many questions remain. The perceived increase in autism cases could be attributedto a number of factors, and additional study is needed.Vaccines are developed through rigorous research designed to ensure safe and effective products. Theseproducts are then subjected to another level of intense scrutiny in order to assure that recommendationsabout immunization practices and procedures reflect the best available science. Once approved for use,there is a robust system of checks and balances that monitors the safety and efficacy of vaccines.A child's chance of being harmed by an infectious disease like measles or mumps is far greater than anyrisk of being harmed by the vaccine. These diseases have not been eliminated, only kept at bay throughwidespread childhood immunization. Measles, for example, can lead to pneumonia or an infection of thebrain and can cause death. Mumps can cause an infection in the lining of the brain and death.To help inform parents about the benefits and risks of vaccines, the American Academy of Pediatrics hasdeveloped brochures that are distributed by pediatricians. Vaccine information can also be obtained on theAAP web site: www.aap.org.

Our organization of parents and professionals must somehow enable crucial autism research to be done. Certainly, meaningful results will come only from the efforts of organizations like ours which are independent o ofon ustry. Dr.Vying was t e tnspira ion or t e roject, and I feel that his research of morethan twenty years will be the key to obtaining definitive answers for our children withautoimmune indicators. I am sure that his work, and that of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, will in time make medical history. Our organization has already supported several New Jersey-based autism initiatives: witness the recent passage of the $1.5 million New Jersey Autism Biomedical ResearchAct.This Act will channel funding toward immunological research in autism, within thestate of New Jersey. Through my position on the Governor's Council I am working tosecure significant funding for Dr. Oleske of the University of Medicine and Dentistry, NewJersey. via the Act. Still, these earmarked funds for autism education and research are unlikely to support the kind of research important to the Project: we must continue our efforts to fund research in immunology.

BEST COPYAVAILABLE3214/6/00 2:01 The Autism Autoimmunity Project httpliwunu.gti.netitrue DEFINITION Autism: An Immunological Perspective by Laura J. Ruede, M.L.S.Board Member, Autism Autoimmunity ProjectAutism is an increasingly common developmental disability that typically appears in childhood, usuallyduring the first three years of life, which curtails the normal development and functioning of the brain inthe areas of reasoning, social interaction and communication. There may be emotional, motor and/orsensory disturbances which exacerbate these deficits. Frequently a developmental pattern is describeddepicting a period of normality, followed by either a sudden, or slow-but-steady, regression or loss ofskills. Autism is typically defined by practitioners no further than a reference to its neurological basis,together with a list of its outward characteristics or symptoms. Coupled with this is an admission that thecause of the disability is unknown--for, tragically, the cause or causes of autism have been sought only inthe area of genetics, from the time the condition was first described by Kanner in the 1940s.Recent scientific findings have shown, however, multiple immune system abnormalities in autisticindividuals. Scientists have also embraced the idea of the complex integration of the immune, nervous,endocrine, and other systems of the body; in particular the notion that early and severe derailments of theimmune system can lead to profound neurological damage. Such derailments have been known to occur inconjunction with severe environmental insults, such as pre- or post-natal viral infections, or throughvaccinations. The principal means by which such derailments can occur, however, is through geneticpredisposition to immune system malfunction; such a predisposition has been described in autism byWarren, Singh, and others. The presence of viral or bacterial particles and/or antibodies in body tissues orfluids from persons with immune and/or neurological disease has been documented by A. J. Wakefield, inthe case of autism, and repeatedly by many other scientists. A viral \"insult\" in predisposed persons canultimately lead to a state of autoimmunity, or continuous immune reaction against the body's own tissues.Antibodies against brain and other body elements have been detected in autism by V.

Children with autism have been shown to have a high incidence ofcirculating autoantibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP) and to neuron-axon filament protein (NAFP)compared with healthy controls or controls with other disabilities. Subacute viral infections of the centralnervous system have been postulated to play a role in children who develop normally before undergoingautistic regression. In this instance, a healthy boy having a typical case of roseola (HHV-6) at 15 monthsexperienced severe regressions of language and social behavior soon afterward. \"The presence ofantibodies against MBP and NAFP along with the clinical course and elevated levels of HHV-6 antibodiessuggest an autoimmune response to this neurotropic virus[,] resulting in the autistic regression.\"\"Circulating Autoantibodies to Neuronal Glicil Filament Proteins in Neurology,vol. 17, number 1, July 1997, pp. 88-90. A significant increase in incidence of anti-NAFP[neuron-axon-filament-protein] and anti-GFAP was seen in autistic subjects, but not in mentally retardedsubjects. Clinically, these autoantibodies may be related to autoimmune pathology in autism.\"Hyperserotoninemia and Serotonin Receptor Antibodies in Children With Autism but Not MentalRetardation.\" Biological Psychiatry, vol. 41, number 6, March 15, 1997, pp. 753-5.\"Elevated Serotonin Levels in Autism: Association With the Complex.\"Neuropsvchobiology, vol. 34, number 2, 1996, pp. 72-5. Two of the most consistently observed biologicalfindings in autism are increased serotonin levels in the blood and inununological abnormalities (includingautoreactivity with tissues of the central nervous system). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)regulates the immune system, and is associated with autoimmune disorders. In this study, a positiverelationship was observed between elevated serotonin levels and the MHC types previously associated withautism.\"Plasma Increase Interleukin-12 and Interferon-gamma. Significance in numbers May 1996, pp. 143-5. Immune factors such as autoinamunityhave been implicated in the genesis of autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Since autoimmune responseinvolves immune activation, the plasma levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), 4/6/00 7 of 9(1L-12), and IL-6 were measured, along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and soluble intercellularadhesion molecule-1 (sICAIVI-1). The levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma were significantly higher in autisticpatients than in controls (the remaining measures were not significantly different). It is suggested thatIL-12 and IFN -gamma increases may indicate cells pathogenetically linkedto autoimmunity in autism.\"Immunogenetic Studies in Autism and Neuropathology, vol.28, numbers 1-3, 77-81. The major histocompatibiligy complex comprises anumber of genes that control the function and regulation of the immune system. One of these, the C4Bgene, encodes a product that is involved in eliminating pathogens such as viruses and bacteria from thebody. A deficient form of the C4B gene, termed the C4B null allele (no C4B protein produced) waspreviously seen to have an increased frequency in autism. In this study, this finding was confirmed, andthis same condition was detected in related [neurodevelopmental] disorders as well. In addition, two allelesof the DR beta I gene also had significantly increased representation in autistic subjects.\"Antibodies to Myelin Basic Protein in Children With Autistic Behavior.\" Brain, Behavior and Immunity,vol. 7, number 1, March 1993, pp. 97-103. Approximately 58% of the sera of autistic children were foundto be positive for anti-MBP [anti-brain antibodies]. This result was significantly different from that of thecontrols, among whom were children with normal health, idiopathic mental retardation, and Downsyndrome. It is possible that anti-MBP antibodies are associated with the development of autistic behavior.\"Possible Association of the Extended MHC Haplotvpe The complement C4B null allele appears to be associated with infantileautism. In this study, the incidence of B44-SC30-DR4 was increased by almost six-fold in the autisticsubjects as compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the total number of extended haplotypes expressedon chromosomes of autistic subjects was significantly increased as compared with those expressed onchromosomes of healthy subjects. Conclusion: a gene related to, or included in, the extended majorhistocompatibility complex may be associated with autism.\"Increased Frequency of the Null Allele at the Complement C4b Locus in Autism.\" Clinical Experiments inImmunology, vol. 83, number March 1991, pp. 438-40. Associations between C4 deficiency andautoimmune disorders have been found over the past several years. In this study, autistic subjects and theirmothers had significantly increased phenotypic frequencies of the C4B null allele, compared with controls.The siblings of the autistic subjects also had an increased frequency of the C4B null allele, but this was notsignificant. The fathers did not display this allele. All family members had normal frequencies of the C4Anull allele, all normal C4A and C4B alleles and all BF and C2 alleles.\"Changes of Soluble Interleukin-2, Interleukin-2 Receptor, T8 Antigen, in the Serum ofAutistic Children.\"Clinical Inununopathologv, vol. 61, number 3, December 1991, pp.448-455.

I see this as a little bit different situation. Thepharmaceutical companies who are producing jobsand they do a great job for the countrybut they have a financial interest in get-ting things approved.The New England Journal of Medicine has recognized this in arecent publication, on the front page. They said that they had somepeople on their advisory committees who had made some commentsand made some recommendations that had financial interest, andthey had not scrutinized them properly, and they apologized for itand said it would not happen again.So what I asked Dr. Boyle and what I am inferring here todayis that there can be a bias if people are being paid or reimbursedby pharmaceutical companies when they start making a decision ora recommendation on an advisory panel.Now, you said that if they represent Merck or Bristol Meyers orsome other laboratory, they will probably excuse themselves fromvoting, and there may be a requirement for that. That does notalter the fact that they are sitting on that panel, and they are talk-ing to everybody else on that panel, and they have influence onthat panel, and they do have a tremendous impact on whether ornot certain things are approved or disapproved. And I think thatthat is a conflict of interest. I do not see why we cannot have peo-ple on advisory panels who have no financial interest whatsoeverwith pharmaceutical companies when they are approving those, be-cause we are talking about the health of the Nation. And that issomething which ought to be investigated very thoroughly by thisCongress.We are talking today about autism, but there is something of asgreat stake here as the autism question and whether or not theMMR vaccine and other vaccines may be contributing to autism,and that is are we letting pharmaceutical companies have too greatan influence on the decisionmaking process that affects very one ofour lives?Right now, we are talking about the anthrax vaccine. They aregoing to inoculate every one of our military personnel, and thereare all kinds of questions about the anthrax vaccine, all kinds ofthem. We have had all kinds of side effects that we have talkedabout, and I have talked to people who have had them. And theformer chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is on the board of thatcompany that makes the anthrax vaccine. They are manufacturingmillions of doses of this vaccine, and every member of the servicewill have to get six shots of that. If the decisionmaking process in-volves people who have a financial interest in it, and that out-weighs the potential side effects of any drug, then I think there issomething amiss.So I have great concerns about that, and I would just say to youthat HHS and CDC and FDA and all of them ought to take a hardlook at whether or not they have people on their advisory panelswho have a potential conflict of interest by getting money or some-thing else from a pharmaceutical company that they represent.Now, I was not trying to impugn the integrity of Dr. Offit, butI did want to point out that he does get money from Merck andgets some benefits from Merck. So for anybody to say that he can 323be totally unbiased is questionable. Maybe he would be totally un-biased, but it is questionable.So I think that this whole issue of whether or not the MMR vac-cine is a problemthe measles vaccine has been found in the gut,it has been verified, and we still have this problem, and the ques-tion was whether or not it goes from the gut up to the brain andis a contributing factor to autismbut the companies that makethe MMR vaccine have people on the advisory boards who are par-ticipating in the decisionmaking process.So it makes me wonder whether we are going to really get to thebottom of it unless we go to outside entitiesand that is not ques-tioning anybody's integrity. It is just saying that if I am payingsomebody money for some product or something, and there is some-thing else that I am going to make money off of, and they are ona board that is going to participate in a decisionmaking process, tosay that they do not at least think about me and think about wherethe money is coming from just boggles my mind, and I think itwould most people.With that, do I have any further questions? Let us see what elsewe have here.[Pause.]Mr. BURTON. OK. Dr. Boyle, for your information, at a publicmeeting in Brick Township in January 1997and you should knowthiswith CDC and others present, several audience membersasked about the vaccines and the possible autism link, and theyasked that vaccines be checked. That is from Andy Napoli, the leg-islative director of Representative Chris Smith.So, I again want to stress that we want to have an answer fromCDC. If parents from that township were wondering about the pos-sible connection between these vaccinations and autism, why didn'tCDC check on it? Why not? You are checking on everything else,the other environmental concerns around there. Why not check onthe vaccine?And I submit that maybe, just maybe, it is because the pharma-ceutical company that manufactures it had some influence on thepeople who were in that meeting, and they said, Hey, we do notwant to get into that. And if that is the case, that is damned nearcriminal.With that, I will be happy to yield back the balance of my timeand let Mr. Waxman have his 5 minutes. Then we will go to thenext panel.Mr. WA)CMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I would like to have Dr. Spiker come forward, if he would.Dr. SPITZER. Spitzer. S-p-i-t-z-e-r.Mr. WAxMAN. Oh. I am sorry.

I did so indirectly, to the best of my knowledge,through a person named Ms. Barbara Fisher.Mr. WAXMAN. And could you identify Barbara Fisher? Is shehere?Dr. SPITZER. She is here in the audience.Mr. WAX1VIAN. Is she a staffperson for the committee?Dr. SPITZER. No. She is in the vaccinationMr. WAXMAN. When did you talk to her? Was it today .or earlierthan today?Dr. SPITZER. I spoke to her yesterday and the day before yester-day by telephone and met her hereMr. WAXMAN. And you met her here?Dr. SPITZER. I met her this morning.Mr. WAXMAN. But you talked to her yesterday and the day beforeabout coming here to testify?Dr. SPITZER. Yes.Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much.Dr. OffitDr. SPITZER. I am sorry. It was primarily for the press con-ference, but with the possibility of being able to testify as well.Mr. WAXMAN. Yessome extenuating circumstances for whichthe rules did not have to be observed.Dr. Offit, the chairman says he is not impugning your reputa-tion, but it sounds to me like your reputation has been impugned.You get money from Merck. They make the vaccine. You are on anadvisory committee for the CDC about vaccines. That is an appar-ent conflict of interest. Again, why isn't it a conflict of interest?Dr. OFFIT. Because as I sit on the Advisory Committee on Immu-nization Practices and make recommendations for children in thiscountry, the only thing I consider is exactly how I would treat myown children. I mean, I take the job very seriously. So the rec-ommendations that I make are based solely on a careful review ofthe data that are presented to us, period. I do not have any conflictwith regard to that decisionmaking process. It is simple in thatsense.Mr. WAXMAN. Dr. Boyle and Dr. Schwartz, what would happenif you excluded people from your advisory committee who workedin the area of research on vaccines or in some other area for apharmaceutical company?Dr. SCHWARTZ. Those with the greatest expertise on vaccines andthose who are best able to make recommendations that will protectthe health of American children have frequently done research invaccines. They are the ones who know the issues best and who canmake the best recommendations. By including them on the advi-sory committee, but implementing appropriate controls to makesure there are no apparent conflicts of interest, the CDC feels that3 0.-; 325they get the best advice to make the best public health rec-ommendations.Mr. WAXMAN. How about people who are funded by the AutismAutoimmunity Projecthave you ever heard of that group?Dr. SCHWARTZ. The ACIP meetings are all open public meetings.They are allMr. WAXMAN. What is \"ACIP?\"Dr. SCHWARTZ. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices meetings are all open meetings and are announced in the Fed-eral Register. If someone from that particular institute wanted tocome and share information or present to the ACIP, they wouldcertainly be welcome to do so.Mr. WAXMAN. And would you feel they have a conflict of interestif they are funded by an organization that wants to have scientistsestablish a certain conclusion?Dr. SCHWARTZ. I think the most important thing that we need toconsider is the quality of the scientific data and whether those datahave been peer-reviewed, whether they have been considered byother scientists, and whether they have been replicated in otherlaboratories.Mr. WAX1VIAN. So you think the most important thing is that Dr.Wakefield and Dr. Singh ought to disclose if they are funded bythis group, and Dr. Offit ought to disclose if he is funded by Merck.Dr. SCHWARTZ. I think disclosure is important, yes.Mr. WAXMAN. And then you evaluate their science?Dr. SCHWARTZ. Yes.Mr. WAxMAN. Because ultimately what is at stake are the sci-entific questions that we want answered.Dr. SCHWARTZ. That is exactly correct, and preserving the healthof American children.Mr. WAxMAN. Well, that, it seems to me, should be the goal ofall of us, and I hope that hearings like this are to try to get to thatresult and not simply to further a particular point of view whichcould well be wrong, and if it is wrong, as I fear it may be, by ad-vertising this particular point of view and scaring the public, wecould see a drop in immunization rates. And we do not know if au-tism will dropin fact, we have evidence from Great Britain thatit did not drop when immunizations didMr. BURTON. I am allowing you extra time because I have onemore question. I am allowing you extra time.Mr. WAxMAN [continuing]. I am getting extra timefor good be-haviorthat when we do have an example in the real world of sen-sational press about the link between autism and vaccinations, vac-cination rates dropped, and we knew that caused an increase inmeasles, but we saw no decrease in autism.It is troubling to me. I appreciate all of the views that have beenexpressed here, and I hope that we can get an independent groupto look at this, because I do not think this committee is an inde-pendent group trying to reach an honest conclusion.I yield back the balance of my time to the chairman.Mr. BURTON. Let me just make one final comment, and that isthat the people who are doing the independent studies here do notsit on any advisory boards that are making decisions on what kindsof vaccinations we are going to be giving to the people of the331ti 326United States of America. The people who represent the pharma-ceutical companies and siton those boards do. That is the dif- ference.And let me just conclude by saying that I really appreciate allof you being here. This is avery difficult issue. I think it was un-avoidable that there would be this kind of contention today becausewe have a lot of parents and grandparents, like myself, who feelvery strongly about the life that our kids and grandkids are goingto have to lead; and on the other side of the issue are the people who are saying there is no impact from the shots that are being given to our kids.So the bottom line is that there are going to be strong differences of opinion, and we want to get all those differences of opinion on the record, and then we will all go out and have a cup of coffee to- gether and debate it in private.The American people need to know the facts. Lincoln said, \"Letthe people know the facts, and the country will be saved,\" and Ithink that is just as true today as it was at the beginning of thisRepublic. So that has been our goalnot to fight with everybody,but to get the facts out. And we are all for vaccinations. It is justdo we want to give a child nine vaccinations in 1 day; do we want to give them 31 or 32 or 33 vaccinations between the time they are born and age 6? Isn't that maybe a little bit of overload? That isthe whole question.I want to thank this panel. We have one more panel. I really ap- preciate all of you being here, even though we may have some dif- ferences with some of you.Thank you.I apologize to the next panel for having to sit there for so long. While the next panel is coming up, we will take a couple-minute break. The next panel consists of Dr. Bernard Rim land, Dr. Mi-chael Goldberg, Dr. Mary Megson, Dr. John Up ledger, Dr. Cath-erine Pratt, Dr. Deborah Hirtz, and Dr. Edward Cook.We will start in just 1 minute.[Recess.]Mr. BURTON. The committee will reconvene.Would everybody please take their seats and shut the doors,please?I appreciate very much your patience today. Would the panelplease rise?[Witnesses sworn.]Mr. BURTON. Have a seat, please.We will start with you, Dr. Rim land. 321STATEMENTS OF BERNARD RIMLAND, Ph.D., AUTISM RE-SEARCH INSTITUTE, SAN DIEGO, CA; DR. MICHAEL J.

COOK, JR., 'UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGOMr. RIMLAND. Thank you very much for the opportunity to behere. It is a great honor and a great privilege.I want to start by commenting that there has been a lot of dis-cussion during the past few hours about the supposedly unprovenhypothesis that vaccines may cause autism. There is anotherunproven hypothesis which has been unchallenged and unques-tioned, at least relatively so, and it is really a very important hy-pothesis, and that hypothesis is that vaccines are safe.The real hypothesis which should have been tested years andyears and years ago by much more scientific research than hasever been devoted to it is the proposition that vaccines do not causedamage. The Vaccine Information Adverse Reaction Reporting Sys-tem has not been studied; it has not been looked at at all carefully,and therefore, the assumption that many people are making is thatthe vaccines have been looked at carefully for adverse reactions,and they have not been.The other point I want to make has to do with the testimony ofDr. Brent Taylor, who spoke here on the last panel. I was verybothered by the lack of information and the confusing informationin his paper. My entire life has been spent as a professional re-searcheralmost 50 years of my life has been as a full-time profes-sional researcher. I am a fellow of the division of statistics, meas-urement and evaluation of the American Psychological Association.I wrote a friendly letter to Dr. Taylor indicating that I wouldvery much like to take a look at his data, because I did not under-stand part of it, and there were some questions that I wanted toraise. He ignored my first letter. I sent a second letter, and he re-sponded to that by saying no, I could not have a look at his data.I then wrote to the editor of the Lancet urging that a blue-ribboncommittee be appointed to take a very close look at the data of Dr.Taylor. So I am delighted that you have asked for it as well.My own son Mark was born in 1956 as a severely autistic childfrom birth. Our pediatrician, who had been in practice for 35 yearsat that time, had never seen such a child or heard of such a child.When Mark was 2, my wife and I found the word \"autism\" forthe first time in a textbook. I was at that point 5 years beyond myPh.D. in psychology, never having heard of or seen the word \"au-tism\" before. It obviously was a very rare disorder, extremely rare.None of us had heard of it.Today it is extremely common. There is hardly a high school kidin the country who has not heard of autism. It is a household wordnow, and that is not because of the movie \"Rain Man,\" but becauseit is extremely prevalent.Despite denials from some experts, there is a terrible worldwideepidemic of autism. In the mid-1960's, after my book \"Infantile Au- OGOtism\" was published, I began hearing from parents throughout theworld whose children had been normal until given the DPT shot.I began to make note of it and ask questions about it in the formletters I sent out to parents seeking infoimation about autism.In the past few years, the Autism Research Institute, which I di-rect in San Diego, has been flooded with letters and faxes aboutchildren whose parents say and can prove very well with video-tapes and photos that their kids were normal until getting anothertriple vaccine, the MMR shot. In my view, the evidence is over- whelming that vaccines, especially the triple vaccines, and among the triple vaccines especially the MMR, can and do cause many cases of autism.It is also alarming but true that 90 to 99 percent of adverse reac- tions to vaccines are never reported. There is no penalty for a doc-tor's failure to report a bad vaccine reaction, so they simply do notdo it. Why should they engage themselves in paperwork if there isno requirement that they do it and no penalty for not doing it?This being so, how can the authorities claim that the vaccinesare safe, given that only 1 to 10 percent of adverse events are everreported? Doctors must be trained to recognize, and required, notjust requested, to report adverse events.With regard to the question of genetics, they say that autism hasa large genetic component, and therefore, vaccines must play aminimal role. My book, \"Infantile Autism,\" published in 1964 wasthe first systematic attempt to marshal the evidence for a geneticrelationship to autism, so I am certainly not hostile to that idea.However, genes do not begin to account for the huge increase in theincidence of autism. There is no such thing as an epidemic due togene problems. The increase ranges from 250 to 500 percent in var-ious places, as other people have pointed out here.As the editor of the Autism Research Review International, Ihave just reviewed a very large number of studies on the geneticsof autism. The next issue of the Autism Research Review is goingto contain our review study. The results of our review are spectacu-larly inconsistent. The best guess is that there are at least 20 dif-ferent genes that may be involved in the causation of autism.Genes are not the answer to the question, even though, at onetime, I was very much in favor of looking at that hypothesis. I amstill interested in the hypothesis, but it is certainly not responsiblefor the increase in autism.The people who claim that the vaccines are safe claim that au-tism naturally occurs at about 18 months, when the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine is routinely given, so the association ismerely coincidental and not causal. But the onset of autism at 18months is a recent development. Autism starting at 18 months rosevery sharply in the mid-1980's, when the MMR vaccine was intro-duced. For the previous 30 yearswe have been collecting informa-tion from children born in the fifties, sixties, seventies, and soforththere were twice as many kids reported with the autismstarted at birth as there were kids whose parents reported that theautism started at 18 months.Starting in about the 1980's, when the MMR vaccine was intro-duced, those two curves converged. Over a period of several years,the number of kids whose autism started at 18 months rose to 329twice as high as the number starting at birth. On the last page ofmy handout, I have a graph that shows those curves based on the records of over 31,000 children in our San Diego institute. So thatparticular argument against the MMR hypothesis is obviously avery poor one.Autism is not the only severe chronic illness which has reachedepidemic proportions, as the number of very profitable vaccines hasrapidly increased. Children now receive 33 vaccines before theyenter schoola huge increase. The vaccines contain not only liveviruses, but also very significant amounts of highly toxic sub-stances such as mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. Could thisbe the reason for the upsurge in ADHD, asthma, arthritis, Crohn'sdisease, lupus, and other chronic disorders? It seems as though weare trading protection against acute diseases such as measles andmumps for a huge epidemic of chronic diseases like autism, asth-ma, and the others I mentioned.As a parent and a full-time professional researcher, I am bitterlydisappointed with the medical establishment's dismal record withregard to autism over the past 60 years. The medical schools aswell as the Government agencies have consistently supported out-moded, unproven and even disproven ideas, including the one thatautism was caused by \"refrigerator mothers\" who did not love theirchildren, thus causing autism. The medical establishment was op-posed to behavior modification, or what is now called the ABA ap-proach. They said that this was not a way to treat autism, becauseautism was based on deepseated emotional problems, so a tech-nique that is used to train animals cannot be used to improve au-tistic children. That was untrue. They have ignored and continueto ignore the long series of studies conducted both in the UnitedStates and Europe showing that the elimination of foods containinggluten and casein from the diet brings about marked improvementin many autistic children. They have consistently ignored the seriesof 18 consecutive studies conducted by researchers in six countrieswhich show that almost half of all autistic children and adults re-spond favorably to high doses of Vitamin B6 and magnesium, withno adverse reports from any of these studies. Eleven of these stud- ies were double-blind placebo-crossover experiments. There is nodrug which comes even close to B6/magnesium in terms of safety,efficacy, and positive research findings, yet it is not being exploredat all.Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on nonproductivelines of research while virtually no money at all has been given toresearch on methods of alternative medicine which are far morepromising in terms of both safety and efficacy.The most interesting questions are not being asked. Why doesthe majority of any population survive such epidemics as autism,the bubonic plague, Legionnaire's disease, polio and AIDS, whilerelatively few succumb?The very obvious answer and the most probable answer is thatthe survivors have healthy, effective immune systems. Would en-hancing the immune system decrease the likelihood of adverse re-actions to vaccinesincluding, by the way, the anthrax vaccine. Ihope that DOD will pay some attention to that. There is good rea-son to think about anthrax in this context. 330It is well-known that the immune system must be adequatelysupplied with many nutrients if it is to function properly, includingespecially Vitamins A, C, E, B6, and a number of minerals, includ-ing zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Nutritional levels of these sub-stances are not only harmless, but they are essential to goodhealth.Since people do not change their diets readily, I believe thatfoods should be fortified with these nutrients, especially foodswhich will be consumed by infants and children. Research alongthese lines, as well as on the safety of the vaccines, is desperatelyneeded.Recently, Professor Clementson published a paperhe is the au- thor of a three-volume treatise on Vitamin Creviewing the evi-dence showing that individuals who are vaccinated without havingadequate supplies of Vitamin C in their bodies are far more likelyto suffer an adverse reaction to the vaccine than those who havehigher levels of Vitamin C.Dr. Archie Kalokerinos of Australia, a pediatrician assigned bythe Government to the outback people there, found an infant deathrate of 50 percent among the children he cared for. They died soonafter the vaccines. He found that they were extremely Vitamin C-deficient, and he learned that by giving them some extra VitaminC, he could prevent their deaths. The death rate went from 50 per-cent to zero in a very short time. Dr. Kalokerinos was given amedal by the Australian Government.We should be giving our children Vitamin C as well as other nu-trients to make sure that their immune systems are well-fed andfunction well. I think we would see a lot fewer of the problems thatwe are experiencing today.As a parent and as a researcher, I believe there should be amarked redirection of effort and funding along the lines suggestedabove.Thank you.Mr. BURTON.

I am a research psychologist (Ph.D.), and amDirector of the Autism Research Institute, which I founded in 1967. I an also thefounder of the Autism Society of America (1965), and the editor of the AutismResearch Review Inte..tional. My bookInfantile Autism: The Syndrome spd Its4(1964)iswidely credited with changingthe field of psychiatry from its claim that autism is an emotional illness, causedbydestructive mothers, to its current recognition that autism is a biologicaldisorder.I have lectured on autism and related problems throughout the world, andam the author of numerous publications. I served as primary technical advisor onautism for the film Rain Man.lit =9%== My son Mark was born in 1956. It was obvious from birth that this perfectlynormal-looking infant. had something drastically wrong with him. I had earned myPh.D. in experimental psychology 3 years earlier and had never encountered the wordautism.Our pediatrician, with 35 years of experience, had never heard of autismeither.Autism was extremely rare than -- it is extremely common now.Some supposed experts will tell you that the increase reflects only greaterawareness.That is nonsense. Any pediatrician, teacher or school official with 20or more years experience will confirm what the studies tell us: There is a =alIncrease in autism and the numbers are huge and growing. The epidemic is seriousand world-wide.Soon after my textbook on autism was publisbed'in 1964, I began to bear fromother parents. Many parents told me that their children were normal until getting atriple vaccine -- the DPT shot. In 1965 Ibegan systematically collecting data onthe symptoms and possible causes of autism: In 1967 I began querying the parents --33 years ago -- specifically about the child's response to the DPT shot. Many hadreported marked deterioration.During the past few years the Autism Research Institute has been flooded withan upsurge in pleas for help from parents throughout the world -- from Wherever theWorld Health Organization vaccine guidelines are followed. The majority of theseparents say their children were normal until getting the MMR -- another triplevaccine.Let me dispel several myths promoted by those who deny the autism-vaccineconnection;1.They claim the vaccines are safe, but physicians are indoctrinated todisbelieve claims of harm and are not trained to recognise nor required to reportany adverse reactions. From 90% to 99% of the adverse reactions reported to doctors A non-profit corporation established in 1967 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 332 are never reported by those doctors to the government's extremely lax VaccineAdverse Event Reporting System, known as the VAERS.2.They say that the suspected linkage betwean the MMR vaccination and autismhas been disproved by a study conducted by Brent Taylor and his colleagues inLondon, and published last year in The Lancet. The Taylor study is seriously flawedin many ways, as has been noted in a number of letters to the editor of The Lancetand in a number of additional letters on the subject which have been posted on theinternet.It was subject to strong attack at a recent meeting of the BritishStatistical Society. I have been a full-time researcher my entire professionallife, for almost 50 years, and I respectfully asked Dr. Taylor for a copy of thedata so that I could reanalyze them. He refused this ordinary professionalcourtesy, and I have subsequently written to the editor of The Lancet requestingthat an impartial committee be asked to reexamine Dr. Taylor's statistical methods.If he refuses again, I urged the The Lancet to retract his paper.3.They say that autism has a large genetic component, and therefore vaccinesmust play a minimal, if any, role in the causation'of autism. My book InfantileAutism, published in 1964, was the first systematic attempt to marshall the evidencefor genetics as a contributing cause of autism, so I am certainly not hostile tothat idea.However, genes do not begin to account for the huge increase in theincidence of autism, ranging from 2501 to 5001 in various places. I might add thatwe have just reviewed all of the recent genetic studies for the next issue of theAutism Research Review International which I edit.The results are spectacularlyinconsistent.The best guess is that there are at least 20 different genes involvedin the causation of autism. Gene therapy is decades off, and may be infeasible. 4.They claim that autism naturally occurs at about 18 months, when the MMR isroutinely given, so the association is merely coincidental and not causal. But theonset of autism at 18 months is a recent development. Autism starting at 18 monthsrose very sharply in the mid-1980s, when the MMR vaccine came into wide use. Acoincidence?Hardly!See the graph below.Autism is not the only severe chronic illness which has reached epidemicproportions as the number of (profitable) vaccines has rapidly increased. Childrennow receive 33 vaccines before they enter school -- a huge increase. The vaccinescontain not only live viruses but also very significant amounts of highly toxicsubstances such as mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. Could this be the reason forthe upsurge in autism, ADHD, asthma, arthritis, Crohn's disease, lupus and otherchronic disorders?As a parent and as a full-time professional researcher, I am bitterlydisappointed with the medical establishment's dismal record with regard to autismover the past 60 years. The medical schools, as well as the governmental agencies,have consistently supported outmoded, unproven and even disproven theories from thevery beginning, and have actively opposed the most promising approaches for thetreatment of autism. They supported the psychoanalytically-based theories which BEST COPYAVAILABLE 333 held the mother responsible for causing autism through her supposedly hostileattitude toward the child. They opposed the use of behavior modification, the mostuniformly beneficial treatment for autism, by claiming that it neglected thedeep-seated emotional blocks that were supposedly at the root of autism. They haveignored, and continue to ignore, the long series of studies conducted both in theU.S. and Europe showing that the elimination of foods containing gluten and caseinfrom the diet brings about marked improvement in many autistic children. They haveconsistently ignored the series of 18 consecutive studies, conducted by researchersin 6 countries, which showed that almost half of all autistic children and adultSrespond favorably to high doses of vitamin B6 and magnesium, with no adverseeffects.Eleven of these studies were double-blind placebo-crossover experiments.There is no drug that comes close to B6/magnesium in terms of safety, efficacy andpositive research findings.Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on non-productive lines ofresearch, while virtually no money at all has been given to research on the methodsof alternative medicine, which are far more promising in terms of both safety and.efficacy.The most interesting questions are not being asked: Why does the majority ofthe population survive such epidemics as autism, the bubonic plague, Legionnaires'disease, polio and AIDS, while relatively few succumb?The answer is that the survivors have a healthy, effective immune system.Would enhancing the immune system decrease the likelihood of adverse reactions tovaccines (including the anthrax vaccine -- DOD please note!)? Very probably.It is well known that the immune system must be adequately supplied with manynutrients if it is to function properly, including especially vitamins A, C, 8, B6and a number of minerals, including zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Nutritionallevels of these substances are not only harmless, they are essential to good health.Since people do not change their diets readily, I believe that foods should befortified with these nutrients -- especially foods that will be consumed by infantsand children.Research along these lines -- as well as on the safety of thevaccines -- is desperately. needed.As a parent and a researcher, I believe there should be a marked redirection cfeffort and funding, along the lines suggested above.

To examine this issue, Riniland analyzed the datacollected by the Autism Research Institute from many thousands of parents of autisticchildren since the 1960s.The data reveal that the onset of autism at 18 months is a recent development.Parentreports show that through the 1960s, '70s and early '80s children autistic from birthoutnumbered by 2 to 1 those with onset at 18 months. Starting in the early-1980s, whenthe MMR triple vaccine was introduced, the picture has reversed: now the \"onset at 18months\" children outnumber the 2 to 1.340 335Dr. GOLDBERG.Mr. Chairmanand,members of this committee, thank you for allowingme the opportunity to speakhere today. I wish to takea moment to examine theurgency of this epidemic. I am Dr. MichaelGoldberg, a practicingpediatrician forover 20 years in Los Angeles, andI am on the clinicalteaching staff of UCLA. I am also thefounding member of theNIDS Research Insti- tute, a parent-physicianpartnership developedto research on behalf of children withspecial needs.Out of necessityand a desire to help,my practice is comprised primarily of childrenwith autism, ADD,and other specialneeds. I am here beforeyou today to sharemy everyday ence with these children,experience that hasoverwhelminglycon- vinced me andmy colleagues that this isa disease that can be treated.In turn, I hopeto proposea unique medical researchmodel that combines tenetsof academics withan unprecedentedsense of clinicalurgency.To understand thisnew autism thateveryone keeps speaking mustactually back andlook at the increasedun- derstanding andincidence of autoimmunediseases across the board from themid-1970's to thepresent date. All thatone has to do is look at themedical literatureto realize thatevery disorder we have associatedas become recognized as in part an autoimmuneprocess or illness. As Dr. Galpin, an authority in infectious diseaseimmunology anda pioneer in the application of immune-modulatorsand a member of theNIDS Medical Board likes to say: Thefriendly fire ofour own bodies causes thedamage. We either haveto assume that theincrease in these hysteria,mass phrenia and/orbehavioral-developmentaldisorders, aswas thought in old days,or we need to step backand realize thatmaybe we have a large numberof adults and childrensuffering a disease process that is affecting howtheir brain andnervous system func- tions. I have familyafter family withinmy new practice in which there is a motheror a father with chronicfatigue syndrome,an older child withADD/ADHD, anda young child or two withau- tism/PDD.Unless weassume that this is all random, unfortunately, there is a logicalconnection between theabove disorders andthe rapid emergence of this crisis. Wemust rapidly realizethat almost all of these disorders resultfrom a treatablediseaseprocess. When you look atthe factorsamong the children that Iam see- ing, many of themhave low naturalkiller cells. Theseare part of the findings beingreported inmany of those other disorders. An- other frequent findingis thepresence of active HHV-6 virus and other related herpesviruses insome of these children. find- ings are beingreported for variousadult autoimmunedisorders, and focusingon our emerging knowledgeof HHV-6 andrelated disorders. 336Fortunately, while people talk about the unknown entity of au-tism, I can show you picture after picture after picture that has al-lowed me with the help of researchers, Dr. Ismael Mena and Dr.Bruce Miller, to look at NeuroSPECT scans and understand whatis going on in the brains of these children. For the majority, thereis a decrease of blood flow and function of the temporal lobe of thebrain, areas that are consistent with that predicted by neuro-anato-mists.We have a large collection of scans that show a decrease in bloodflow that is reproducible, quantifiable. Blood flow corresponds di-rectly to function. When compared to MRIs and CAT-scans, theyhelp to confirm no pre-existing damage but rather point toward aneuro-immune direction etiology. In fact, as we learn more throughimaging and scans and technology about the brain, in a recent NewEngland Journal of Medicine article a year ago, they discussed theimmune-brain-endocrine connection in the hippocampus, a systemthat, with the CAl and CA2 nuclei and neuron, affects cognitivefunction, fatigue, and memory.Today I have come to look upon this as a reversible condition.Thankfully, many children return to normal/above normal function-ing by combining steps reflecting diet control, a combination ofantivirals, antifungal, and low-dose SSRIs.Parents who are told that their children will never be independ-ent, will never be able to earn a living, will 1 day might have tobe placed in an institution, have seen their children become top oftheir class academically. I have children within the practice scoringin the 97th and even the 99th percentile in California and IllinoisState testing. This past week, a mother came to me with her 5-year -old child, who has been with me in the practice for about 8months. She related an instance where the child said, \"Mom, doyou want me to pretend I cannot talk? Remember when I could nottalk?\"We have so misunderstood and misjudged these children. Whatharm are we doing to these children as a result?Hopefully, tomorrow, we will see new agents which will let uswork better with the immune system. If we can focus a unified ef-fort to identify a subspecialized set of immune markers, that willlet us understand which patient is the most likely candidate forwhich immune agent, separate out this mixed group of childreninto logical subgroups.In my written submission to the committee, the NIDS MedicalBoard outlines a hypothesis which is supported by over 60 journalreferences on children with autism and the neuro-immune diseaseprocess that is potentially reversible.It is interesting to note. that that hypothesis has been reviewedby at least four pharmaceutical companies, and there are no holesor deficits in that hypothesis.Within the NIDS Institute, our researchers are all heavilycredentialed, and many are involved in current NIH projects andother activities at the NIH and the FDA. Using this technology,their past experience, and a computerized data base, we can unifyresearchers in institutions across the country. We can literally pickand choose top physicians and researchers around this country andaround the world to focus on the crisis it has become. 06For instance, I am pleased to announce that members of theMind Institute are hopefully looking at joining and combining ef-forts, and my hope would be that many independent groups can focus in a scientific manner on answering the questions beingraised by this committee today.Another significant benefit of exploring this disease process with a sense of urgency would be the unprecedented ability to screenchildren who might be susceptible to vaccines or any other factors which have been implicated as potential roles in subsets of thesechildren. Any injury or loss of a child that could have been pre- vented remains unacceptable. There is no way to adequately con- sole the parent of a lost or damaged child.If focused correctly, we do have the ability to accelerate under-standing and identification of potentially high-risk children. If we can identify these children, adjust their vaccine schedule appro-priately, we have begun the process of stemming this epidemic andwill have created a preventive health policy which would be partof a collective legacy for generations to come.In 1996, I was a speaker at the Autism Society of America, at-tended by over 2,000 parents and professionals. My wife made thecomment: \"Where are the M.D.s?\" The medical community had es- sentially abandoned these children once they became labelled as autistic.The NIDS Medical Board is designed to help logically, academi-cally, scientifically circumvent the expected learning curve as we see physicians coming back into this field make a radical shift indirection and orientation from what we might have been taught as physicians.I plead with you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.These children are supposed to be a productive part of this coun- try's future, not a health cost and burden. These children have thepotential for full, productive, intelligent lives. Contrary to the oldidea, their genetics are not the determining factor. A child cannotdevelop normally, develop some language, and lose it all, except ina disease process. We can apply good, sound science and logic tohelp solve the crisis now.We must embrace what is literally a paradigm shift in the worldof medicine and begin to view autism and other related classifica-tions like we do Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, childhood can- cer, and multiples sclerosis. Tragically, if we accept the status quo,we will be sacrificing millions of kids and will likely lose more insubsequent generations.I implore you to investigate the concepts I have introduced,evaluate them, test themdo whatever it takes to convince you that we have a crisis for which inaction is politically and medicallymore risky than action.I am extremely fortunate to have three healthy children and one healthy grandchild. I selfishly want the rest of my future grand- children, all of yours, and others out there to have the same chance. X336Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Dr. Goldberg. As I think you can prob-ably guess, we are going to pursue this for a long time.Dr. GOLDBERG. I hope so.[The prepared statement of Dr. Goldberg follows:] 339 Michael J. Goldberg, M.D., F.A.A.P.5620 WILBUR AVENUE, SUITE 318TARZANA, CALIFORNIA 91356TELEPHONE (818) 343 -1010FAX (818) 343 - office\u00aeneuroimmunedr.comOn the web: www.neurohnmunedr.comADHD/ADD LEARNING 6, 2000 Gentlemen,I am Dr: Michael Goldberg,a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics and Director of the non-profit NIDS Medical Board and Research Institute. I wish to thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to speak here today and for taking the time to examine the urgency of this epidemic.I have put together a packet of articles detailing my scientific hypothesis and current treatment philosophy. I suggest they be included in the record. I have also provided information on the emerging science and technology describing Neuro Immune Dysfunction whosecommon pathway is involved in many immune or autoimmune diseaseas including the development of the Autistic Syndrome. We finally have an understanding of how the brain interrelates with the endocrine and immune system. We are confident that we can apply this new understanding rapidly to evolve a treatment plan within the next six to twelve months, through an unprecedented blend of private enterprise and government-supported research.The purpose of this hearing is to investigate why we have a large increase in this phenomenon that we have called autism. But to understand that, one must step back and look at the increased understanding and incidence of auto-immune disorders across-the-board, from the early/mid 1970's, when I completed my medical training, to the present day. All one has to do is look at the medical literature to realize that nearly every disorder we have associated as immune connected, immune-mediated, defects in the immune system- lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, lupus, Ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid disease, and even aging - have all become recognized as in part autoimmune diseases or illnesses where the friendly fire of our own bodies causes the damage as my colleague Dr. Galpin, an infectious disease and immunology authority, often is quoted to, say.If we are going to save thisgeneration of children froma lifetime of suffering the incurable stigma of being diagnosed with autism and other cognitive delays, we must rapidly realize that all of these disorders result from a treatable rather than untreatable disease process. As written in the enclosed articles, and as apure basic fact of science, it is medically impossible to have an epidemic of a genetic or developmental disorder. Further, while many have spoken of an \"epidemic of autism,\" the truth is: the disease 340 process many of these children have is not autism (as taught to physicians 30 40years ago).If a child is born developmentally miswired, \"damaged\", something happened inutero. But, a child cannot learn to speak and use language and then lose these abilitiesif the cause of their disorder is developmental, structural, etc. Such a child cannotrespond to treatment and become a regular child once more, as has been the case inmy practice over and over again, if the cause of their disorder is a \"fixed\" process,congenital or genetic disorder. It has been repeatedly apparent that 4, 5, 6 yr. oldchildren are starting over where they left off at 18 months, 2 years of age. Parents whowere told their children would never talk, could never be social, could never havefeelings, now have children who are normal functioning or who are still struggling tocatch up and get back to that fully normal functioning child, in either case these parentscan see or are beginning to see a future for their child. It is my intent and hope in thetime I have here, and through the articles I have submitted, to sow the realization that weare not talking about saving the next generation of children, but rather that we mustfocus our efforts on saving this generation of children before it is too late. Theramifications are enormous.At the end of a research symposium in October 1997, one which broughttogether top researchers from around the country to discuss Alzheimer's, adultdementias, social brain, and Autism/Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), thisstatement was made: if a child developed normally during the first twelve, fifteen,eighteen months of life, developed any language/words, and then somehow went intothe autistic spectrum, it was a 100 percent certainty that the process had to beimmune/viral. IF a child developed normally the first 12, 15, 18 months of life and hadNO words, 99% it was an immune / viral process, and no one there could rationalize anyother possible mechanism.While there is ongoing controversy regarding past brain biopsy findings and theirimplications, if any, to this generation of children, we do have NeuroSPECT Scans,which show reproducible, quantifiable blood flow in the brain. Blood flow correspondsdirectly to function. When NeuroSPECT Scans of children diagnosed as autistic/PDDhave been correlated with MRI's and CAT Scans, the combination consistently shows nopre-existing damage to the brain, but rather points toward an immune shutdownconsistent with that found in adults with Chronic Fatigue Syndromes and other adultdementias and with children diagnosed as quiet ADD and mixed ADD.I stumbled into the field of autism somewhat by accident. My wife had hadChronic Fatigue Syndrome for over ten years. Jokingly, my son asked me \"Why are yousending Mom all over the country to doctors? Why don't you just fix her?\" That beganmy journey into clinical research. It rapidly became apparent we were dealing with somecomponent of the immune system, an autoimmune like reaction. During that time, as Iwas investigating all options for my wife, a few \"Autistic\" children were referred to mypractice. Much to my surprise, these children had blood work comparable to that of mywife and other adults with this undiagnosed disorder, and to that of children I had beenseeing diagnosed with quiet ADD and mixed ADD. I remember thinking then, \"Whatcould the immune system have to do with autism?\"Paralleling this, beginning in the 1980's was the initially slow, now epidemicincidence of disorders in children labeled as Autism/PDD and the increase of reports of 341 autoimmune diseases in the animal literature, of altered ecological balance, immunesystem abnormalities in various species. We either have to assume that this increase ofdisorders in the human population is mass-hysteria, mass-psychosis, schizophrenia,and/or behavioral developmental disorders in children or we must step back and realizethat maybe we have a large number of adults and children suffering from a diseaseprocess that is affecting how their brain and nervous system functions, in ways thatphysicians had never understood (or had the technology to understand). I have family after family within my \"new\" practice in which there is a mother or father with ChronicFatigue Syndrome, an older child with ADD/ADHD, and a younger child or two withAutism/PDD. As noted, unless we assume this is all random, there is unfortunately a logical connection between the above disorders and their rapid emergence as a crisis.We are looking at what appears, supported by increasing data and reports in the literature, to be auto-immune, Neuro-immune disorders or what my associates and Ihave termed Neuro Immune Dysfunction Syndromes or NIDS. If you are an adult withan intelligent, developed brain or an older teenager, when this process attacks, you will likely end up being diagnosed with the illnesses known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Adult ADHD, etc. If you are a younger child, five, six, seven, or eight years old when thisprocess is triggered, with some cognitive, social and language capabilities alreadydeveloped, you will likely develop what is called quiet ADD or mixed ADD. If you aretwelve, fifteen, eighteen months old, however, when this process begins, you will havebarely begun to develop cognitive, language, and social skills and you will wind up with what has been called Autism/PDD.The good news is that this concept is supported by common sense medical logic.The bad news is that we must unify and focus efforts or we will continue to see more adults that are supposed to be paying taxes and earning a living, finding themselves onwelfare, unable to function, unable to produce. Even graver is that if nothing changes,we are currently raising an entire generation of children to this fate.There is hope. Research from many prominent institutions support the idea that the brain is pliable at least into adolescence, maybe into early adulthood. It has beenmy rewarding experience as a pediatrician to see five, eight, ten, and even a twelve year old boy who could not talk, begin to use language. Parents who were told theirchild would never be independent, never be able to earn a living, and who one day mighthave to be placed in an institution, have seen their children become top of their class academically.I have children within the practice scoring in the 97th, even the 99th percentile on California and Illinois state testing.The potential multiple triggers for this illness, we are calling. NIDS, will needmany, many years of ongoing research to learn how multiple factors such as stress, viral, or environmental may play a role. The key is to focus treatment efforts, rapidly, effectively NOW to keep from losing an entire generation of children while the ultimate \"answers\" are still being investigated. We can use technology to accuratelydefine \"subgroups\" of these children and adults now, setting up the possibility of new therapy approaches in as little as the next 6 8 months, rather than after years of furtherinvestigation and study. Technology exists to help these children and to help many of the adults out there to become productive individuals again. At this time, as noted in the enclosed articles, I have been using a combination of diet elimination, anti-viral therapy, anti-fungal therapy, and application of low-dose SSRI's (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors), based on our NeuroSPECT findings, immune markers, and viral titers in 342 these children. Thankfully, I have had many children return to normal and above-normalfunctioning, but this is not yet fast enough, simple enough, or perfect enough. This maybe a holding approach thus far wherein balancing the many neurological immuneregulating proteins known as cytokines and chemokines may in turn rebalance behavioritself. As many others are noting, I would propose there is a future for logical applicationof \"alternative\" medicines and combination treatment protocols with goodpharmaceutically pure agents and medications.In 1996, I was a speaker at the Autism Society of America Conference.Approximately 2000 parents and professionals gathered for this event. My wife, millingaround, questioned me \"Where are the doctors? The M.D.'s?\" Sadly she had figured outthe truth in a matter of minutes. The medical community had abandoned these childrenonce they became labeled as \"Autistic.\" These children were regarded as defective,mentally un-trainable, even retarded!Sadly, with the label of autism, many children were not even given a simple bloodtest for anemia/iron deficiency (a simply-counteracted, possible cause of braindysfunction). Reviewing case after case of children labeled as having Autism/PDD, I amhorrified at how little has been done medically for these children, as they are notconsidered to be \"normal.\" Their pain, their misery, their \"illness,\" goes essentiallyunrecognized. Many are though of as insensitive to pain, but how many are actually just\"numb\" to the pain that their brain/system is constantly in? Simple steps that could betaken, are not taken to help these children or their parents.I have been fortunate to work with Dr Israel Mena and Dr. Bruce Miller, who helpedshow through NeuroSPECT Scans, that these children had a physiological dysfunctiongoing on in their brains. For the majority, there was a decrease in blood flow andfunction of the temporal lobe of the brain consistent with that predicted by neuroanatomists.I have many, many more scans that show the same decrease in blood flow.I would shudder to think of what dysfunctions you might have if your brain had lack ofblood flow in those areas. In fact, if one listens to an adult with Chronic FatigueSyndrome, or the \"typing\" of a child unable speak, one can only begin to imagine howtruly horrible this is.Many of these children have a low number of Natural Killer (NK) cells, which are amore primitive immune system cell, responsible for clearing \"radicals\" in our body,clearing foreign cells / cancerous cells, and considered a strong marker for a healthy orstressed immune system. These cells, when low in number, are now linked to viralreactivation in many auto-immune illnesses, and low NK cells has become an extremelystrong marker in a subgroup of these children with NIDS.Another frequent finding is the likely presence of an active HHV-6 virus (a humanherpes virus) or other related Herpes viruses in these children. Similar findings are alsobeing reported for various adult auto-immune disorders and recently even the Center forDisease Control published an article focusing on our emerging knowledge of HHV-6related disorders.The issue of vaccines is an important one. Again, one must understand theproblem in terms of the new altered immune state (part of the bigger picture), rather thannecessarily the vaccines themselves. Most doctors would agree that not vaccinating inthis country would be a disaster. As I remember the Academy of Pediatrics and the fights in the 70's over the DPT vaccine, in the end the statistics of children supposedly damaged by the vaccine were no more then the \"natural\" incidence in life or 1 in 300,000. In fact in England and Japan, where for a time the DPI vaccinewas stopped, the incidence of pertussis (whooping cough) resulting in serious illness and death, far exceeded any possible \"vaccine connection.\" Likewise, in discussing the current \"Autistic\" I NIDS epidemic, while there may be a possible \"triggering\" factor with Rubella, Measles, \"multiple\" vaccines, one must understand this as only one of a possible combination of stresses causing dysfunction, within the concept of a preexisting \"immune reactive\" or \"stressed\" state. Vaccines (by themselves) remain an unlikely cause of Autism.BUT injecting common sense, general awareness of health and appropriate \"past\" considerations of separations of vaccines, \"stresses\", choice of age, etc might save untold children potential reactions/disasters. Consistent with the question of whether there is a peculiar or unusual immune reactivity when a child is younger, waiting till a child is 3 or 4 could not be faulted, but with ongoing measles outbreaks occurring at times, it is not something easy to recommend routinely at this time. Infancy unfortunately represents a child's most vulnerable time to measles (but there is no real risk from rubella or mumps at that age).Any injury or loss of a child that could have been prevented remains unacceptable. There is no way to adequately console the parent of a lost or damaged child.If \"focused\" correctly, we do have the ability to accelerate understanding and identification of potentially higher risk children. That would help immensely in considering the risks versus the gains of modifying vaccination schedules, diet advice, treatment choices, etc. We must work together with organized medicine and the pharmaceutical companies as allies to solve these questions, not as\" adversaries, fighting to defend principles, which in the end we all believe in.It has been my personal experience within the practice to literally have \"high risk\" children with \"one foot in, one foot out\" of the NIDS disorder, and prevent it from becoming full-blown Neuro immune dysfunction solely through use of \"preventative\" pediatrics. Via dietary eliminations, selective usage of antihistamines, \"bacteriostatic\" antibiotics (when indicated), aggressive allergy prevention and \"health maintenance\" providing a simple, preventative program to a seemingly-increasing number of families with high-risk factors for NIDS. While only an anecdotal observation, to date, NO family with whom I have instituted a preventative program for NIDS has had another \"autistic spectrum\" disorder child.The bottom line is that these children have a disease, open to fascinating research on all its potential causes and triggers, but one that currently warrants and deserves immediate medical intervention. In my clinical practice, \"miracles\" seem to be happening routinely. One must realize, recoveries and significant cognitive improvements could not happen IF these children were truly born \"defective\"- thankfully, they were not.I have an increasing number of children who have been with me 2or 3 years now and as they return to their regular pediatricians for their annual checkup, their pediatricians are seeing the children growing better and developing better, motor, body and brain wise. In a nice manner, while still not understanding thisprocess (but smiling at the child they see before them), these pediatricians are advising the parents to continue therapy, as I continue to monitor medications appropriately. A child I began treating at five is now in sixth grade, getting straight A's, was theVice-President of his 5th grade class not how most people view an autistic child. Ihave an increasingly large number of these children where. \"academics\" are the least ofanyone's worries for the child. Many are in regular if not honors classes and many arehappy, well adjusted, indistinguishable from their peers. In reality these children arelikely just the opposite of what this country and the world of medicine had come to thinkof them: as retarded, unable to develop fully, with some hope of compensation, but notreal treatment or recovery (for one can not recover from a developmental disorder).Recovery and improvement in my patients, as previously mentioned and as explained inthe attached articles, has been accomplished through a combined program of dietaryelimination, anti-virals, anti-fungals, and low dose SSRI's. I have attempted to do thisfollowing good pediatric principles, while \"combining\" steps/therapies based on theemerging science of \"Neuro-immune .\"This past week a mom came in and told me her 5 yr. old child (who has been withme about 8 months now), said to her, \"Mom do you want to pretend I can't talk?REMEMBER when I couldn't talk?\" We have so misunderstood and misjudged thesechildren. What harm are we doing to these children as a result?If we can channel the technology that we have today and employ immunemodulating agents, we could begin objective testing of new therapy protocols in as littleas 68 months, with one (or more) related agents. Immune modulators, will give us thetools to regulate the Neuro-immune system as has never before been possible, help tocreate a \"normal,\" essentially healthy state. A healthy immune system has the potentialto \"normalize\" brain function, enabling the brain to turn back on and begin developingagain.If we can focus a unified effort to identify the specific immune markers (e.g. lownatural killer cells, high alpha interferon's, high or low cytokine / chemokine profiles) thatwill let us understand which patient is the most likely candidate for which immune agent,separate this \"mixed\" population of children into logical subgroups, allowing more rapidunderstanding of vaccine or other potential related factors, and if we can proceed withthe linking of a country wide, potentially world wide network of NeuroSPECT centers, toour already existing database of NeuroSPECT scans, the immediate pay-off will be tohave a chance at saving this generation of children.There is good, solid science in the NIDS Hypothesis. It has been reviewed andverified by at least four pharmaceutical companies to date. We need to see the urgencyof this situation: we are already spending approximately 13 billion dollars annually onAutism and related disorders and this figure is projected to be significantly more in thenear future. In reality, if treated young enough, most of these children could still becomehealthy, productive members of society, with full, rich lives of their own. I would daresay, many of these \"Autistic\u00b0 children are in reality supposed to be this country's \"future\"leaders, having starting off with that capability and background, and not as *defective\"children (as had been previously thought). With the reported 263% increased incidenceof autism in California, and a 500% increase in Florida, among other statistics, I cannotemphasize enough that we are truly losing a generation of children.What may have often been presented to you as impossible or can't happen, inreality, can happen, but to occur, we must approach this as it's never been done before.In the normal course of medicine, with multi-million dollars of research, this is a slow 345 evolution that will take an estimated five, ten years or longer to come together, to even begin to think of how can we treat this and deal with it. Within the NIDS Institute, our researchers, who are all heavily-credentialed, many are involved in current NIH and other activities and, with the NIDS Hypothesis, there is logic that says we can take this knowledge, these abilities, unify other researchers in institutions across the country, using technology, instead of being limited to colleagues or materials available within a given institution. We can literally pick-and-choose top people around this country, around this world to focus on this as the true crisis it has become. With that ability, we can look at applying these new therapies, new agents, within the next six months to a year at most. Instead of thinking about what are we going to do for the future, we can change this now.I plead with you, Mr. Chairman and members of this Committee. These children are supposed to be a productive part of our country's future, not a health cost and burden. These children have the potential for full, productive, intelligent lives; contrary to the old idea, their genetics are not the determining factor. A child can NOT develop normally, develop some language and lose it all except in a disease process. We can apply good sound science and logic to help solve this crisis NOW. Unless we act NOW, we will continue to lose this generation of affected children, and will potentially watch the \"bankrupting\" of our current education and social system. Today's ill children cannot wait for the \"normal\" path of academic science to catch up (it has begun to move in the right direction, but all too slowly). We must leap forward in a way/model never done in medicine before.I am extremely fortunate to have three healthy children andone grandchild.I selfishly want the rest of my future grandchildren, all of yours and others out there, to have the same chance.Thank you. Michael J.oldberg, M.D., F.A.A.P. 346NIDS Neuro-Immune Dysfunction Syndromes (NIDS) Research Institute isto facilitate autism research and expeditiously identify effective medical treatmentoptions for children with autism and other related neuro-immune and/or auto-immuneconditions through the development of various private and public partnerships.The ChallengeAutism affects over one-half million individuals and therefore is more prevalent thanCystic Fibrosis (30,000), Down's Syndrome (250,000), Multiple Sclerosis (350,000) andpediatric rheumatoid arthritis (50,000). However, the funding for research into cures forthese conditions is up to ten (10) times greater than that of autism, which receives lessthan $20 of research funding per individual. This inequity is due primarily to anemphasis on behavioral diagnostic and treatment tools in lieu of the development of ascientific/medical model for autism treatmentMoreover, the incidence of autism has exploded over the last decade and now occurs in atleast 40 births per 10,000 (compared to 1-2 births per 10,000 only a decade ago). NIDS'demographic analysis also shows that special needs classifications like autism, ADD andspeech and language disorders are increasing three times faster than the generalpopulation for children ages 5-19. Developmental disorders do not increase at theserates!!!Thus, the only plausible explanation for such data is a medical diseaseprocess triggered by a combination of factors, including the environment.In addition, only one medical agent is under formal FDA review for the treatment ofautism compared to 44 for childhood cancer, 14 for cystic fibrosis, nine for epilepsy andthree for rheumatoid arthritis. NIDS wants to close these research gaps and provide ourchildren with the future they deserve.The Hypothesis.The NIDS Medical Board has developed a Clinical Hypothesis Statement (available uponrequest and through the NIDS website at nids.net) with over 60 peer reviewed journalreferences to support its research mission. The fundamental premise of the hypothesis isthat these children are suffering from a dysfunctional relationship between the immuneand neurological systems and require immune modulation to restore their cognitivepotential.In addition, the following medical studies have been published in peerreviewed journals since the development of the Clinical Hypothesis Statement that Working to Give Our Children a Future 347 further support the presence of neuro-immune and/or autoimmune dysfunction in children with autism:In the June, 1999 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics, a group of six researchers concluded that \"the presence of (brain autoantibodies) raises the possibility that autoimmuity plays a role in the pathogenesis of language and social development abnormalities in a subset of children (with autism and LKS)\". (J Pediatrics 1999; 134:607-613)In the June, 1999 issue of the Journal of Child Neurology, researchers led by Dr. Anne M. Comi of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland concluded that \"autism appears to be more common in families with a history of autoimmune disorders\". The study included 61 autistic patients and 46 \"healthy\" patients.(J Child Neurology 1999;14:388-394)In the September, 1999 issue of the Journal of Pediatric Neurology, Hornig et alpresented an infection-based model of neurodevelopmental damage. In this study, a Boma disease virus resulted in behaviors such as hyperactivity, inhibition of open- field exploration and stereotypic behaviors. The resemblance of these functional and neuropathological abnormalities to human neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that this model may have utility for defining the biochemical and functional outcomes of interactions of environmental influences with the developing central nervous system. (J Pediair Neurol 1999; 21(3):619-21)Physicians at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York reported in the New England Journal of Medicine this year that men with testicular cancer and brain damage had a particular type of antibody in their blood that may have caused the brain damage. They believe the brain damage was not caused by the cancer, but by an overly aggressive attack by the body's own immune system on a protein produced by tumors. This is the third study to link brain damage to an immune system attack on cancer.IftEciaTo this end, the NIDS Research Institute has developed a business plan that will attemptto expedite the research process on behalf of these children in an unprecedented fashion. This will be accomplished by developing the necessary clinical focus through the medicalboard, developing partnerships with private funding resources for our short-term financialneeds ($750,000) and ultimately integrating public funding and research resources for the long-term needs ($5 to $10 million and government-sponsored research). The short-term tactical plan is as follows:Develop a clinical database (with appropriate control subjects) that evaluates the medical aspects of autism, including any immune system dysregulation that maycontribute to the symptoms seen in autism ($150,000) Working to Give Our Children a Future 348 Identify clinical sub-groups of children with autism based on the immune systemfactors catalogued in the medical database to more accurately target the types ofagents for review (included in database development costs)Conduct animal trials with the agents that offer the most potential to evaluate andmaximize patient safety during clinical trials ($125,000)NOTE:Animal trials have been conducted within FDA standards for adults.Additional studies may be necessary prior to child trials.Conduct trials of immune modulators on adult patients with NIDS conditions toevaluate their efficacy and confirm that these patients present similar immune profilesto those of children with autism ($150,000)Securethelicensingrightstomultiple immune system agents,includingneuropeptides such as VIP and Peptide T, that have the potential to remediate thedisease process in a defined sub-set of children with autismDevelop a network of research sites (which include NeuroSPECT brain imagingcapabilities) to facilitate the review of these agents. Sites will likely include UCLA,UMDNJ in New Jersey, University of Miami and a medical facility in Sydney,Australia ($250,000)Present the data and research noted above to the pharmaceutical industry andcommission interested parties to facilitate FDA approved clinical trials that complywith all federal safety and efficacy guidelines ($75,000)NOTE:Glaxo-Wellcome, Smith Kline Beecham, Advanced ImmunoT and Rochehave each requested additional information as outlined above.The NIDS Research Institute believes that execution of this short-term tactical plan willposition it to change the course of treatment for NIDS patients and ultimately improve thehealth of this population. Working to Give Our Children a Future 349 THE NIDS MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD PRESENTS: A DRAFT PROPOSAL OF ITS NEURO-IMMUNOLOGY HYPOTHESIS STATEMENTCONCERNING AUTISM Clinical Hypothesis - Immune \"Dysfunction / Dysregulatlon\" - A Reason forChildhood Neuro-Cognitive Dysfunction:Autism, as classically defined, is a devastating disorder that often robs children of theirability to communicate and thrive in society. It is characterized by primary alterations insocial interactions and receptive/expressive language, and is often accompanied bysymptoms including ritualistic behaviors and a lack of imaginative play. Additionally,many \u00b0autistic\" children exhibit a craving for sensory (vestibular) stimulation that oftenmanifests itself in self-stimulatory behaviors (e.g., spinning and hand-flapping).By definition, autism has an early onset before 30 months of age (which has now beenextended to 36 months under the DSM-IV guidelines), while disorders appearing later inlife have been thought to be symptomatically and medically different from \u00b0autistic\"conditions. However, publications over the last 13 years have cast some doubt on thisassumption, and it has been noted in the literature that there is no firm evidence thatsimilar or identical syndromes might not develop in older children.'From an epidemiological standpoint, autism has migrated from a rare disorder to onethat is now ten (10) to twenty (20) times more likely to be diagnosed. Ten years ago,'autism' occurred in 1-3 per 10,000 births. Now, current estimates suggest an incidencerate of 2040 per 10,000 births.In fact, \"cluster groups' throughout the world arecurrently being analyzed due to even higher Incidence rates. It is also worth noting thatother neuro-cognitive conditions such as ADHD and Inbred\u00b0 ADHD havereceived a renewed focus and attention among children and adolescents due to theirperceived Increase in incidence rates. Although a portion of these increases can likelybe attributed to better and earlier recognition by the medical community and parents, theNIDS Board believes that this increase must prompt a change hi how we approachthese children.Specifically, we must begin to consider that these are not congenital, 69-622D- 01 - -12BEST COPY AVAILABLE -350 brain-damaged conditions but instead are medical disease processes acquired early inlife.In accordance with this premise, recent discussions have focused on the differentiationbetween \"congenital autism\" (induding \u00b0classic' Kanner autism) and disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, phenylketonuria,congenital rubella, and Down's syndrome. However, a third form has emerged which isbeing referred to as \"acquired or regressive autism\" (perhaps the largest sub-groupof these children).For purposes of this hypothesis statement, \"acquired autism\u00b0 is acondition in which the child develops normally for the first 12 to 18 months of life andthen regresses into the increasingly wide spectrum of \"autistic' disorders.These children challenge the previous belief that 70% to 80% of autistic children arementally retarded. They crawl, sit up, walk, and usually attain 'normal\" motor milestoneson schedule. Until the age of symptom onset, they are affectionate and appear to haveabove average intelligence. Children with acquired autism may begin to develop somespeech but then, without warning, cease to progress, and begin to regress. Suddenly,these children become withdrawn. They vacillate between being quiet and hyperactive.Often self-stimulatory behaviors (i.e. arm flapping, rocking, spinning, or head banging)may develop. Over time, some manifest symptoms that are both similar and atypical ofchildren previously diagnosed as having congenital autism. The authors propose thatmany of these children with acquired autism fall into the medical category ofN.I.D.S. (Neuro-Immune Dysfunction Syndromes), and need to be viewed assuffering from an auto-Immune medical illness that Is potentially treatable.The Past:Unfortunately, without the tools or the technology to accurately investigate the humanbrain, the label of \"autism' evolved as a set of symptoms in a young, dysfunctional child.In its most severe form Cdassic autism\"), effective speech was absent and cliniciansoften saw symptoms of repetitive, highly unusual, aggressive and sometimes self-injurious behavior. Those afflicted had extremely abnormal ways of relating to people,objects, or events. Parents noticed that something was 'not right,' often within the firstthree to six months of life.These children typically did not smile and often resistedaffection.Most researchers and clinicians did not look for \u00b0medical' answers to autism becausethey believed it was a disorder that was medically untreatable. Without the technologyto understand these children, pediatricians and pediatric psychologists accepted theconcepts of poor parenting, childhood psychosis/schizophrenia and classified \"autism\"as a psychological and/or developmental disorder. Treatment was typically delivered bypsychologists and psychiatrists. NIDS MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARDPO BOX 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (888) 540-4999 BESTCOPYAVAILABLE2 351 Eventually, it became well documented that known medical disorders such as tuberoussclerosis, PIN, congenital rubella, and others could cause autism. However, to date,these remain rare disorders and a small sub-group of autism. Given that researchersare just now beginning to understand the medical origins and implications of thepotential therapies for these children, autism Is still treated primarily by psychologistsand educators (with mixed results).Past Medical Research:A review of the existing medical literature relative to autism research reveals evidence ofan emerging medical disease process in these children. For instance, researchindicates that autism can follow infectious disorders affecting the central nervous systemincluding encephafitis.245 Multiple studies have focused on various anatomic locationsof suspected dysfunction.\"11.4 It Is important to note that emphasis is often put on themedial temporal lobe.Pertinent to this new `model' of dysfunction, are the multiplepublished reports of autistic symptoms developing in association with encephalitis inchildren.(Ref: 1981 DeLone. 1986, Giliberg,\" 1989,12) Most of these reports siteinjury to the temporal lobes as part of their findings. This is consistent with the areas ofdecreased function identified on NeuroSPECT scans initially by Or. Ismael Mena fromthe NIDS Board and now by Dr. Bruce Miller and Dr. Fred Mishkin, both of who haveclinical research in progress.New research techniques are increasing the rates at which Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)sequences are being identified in temporal lobe lissues1311 (i.e., locales likely to besubstrates for various aspects of autism). In 1975, an article was published in Cortex\"describing a syndrome similar to autism in adult psychiatry. The condition Involves theloss of emotional significance of objects, the inability to adapt in social settings, the lossof recognition of the significance of persons, and the absence of sustained purposefulactivity after temporal lobe damage.The literature also comments on the cognitive and behavioral deficits caused bytemporal lobe damage in Herpes encephalitis. There are many reports, particularly inthe British literature,\" suggesting a connection to coxsackleAsnteroviruses, while in theUnited States it has been suggested that many cases mPy be finked to the Herpesfamily of virusesEBV, HHV6, HHV7, CNN, etC.).1741419.2(421 Neither theory has beenconclusively proven, nor has the evidence for a contagious disorder been conclusive(although some have inferred it based upon incidents related to e outbreaks22.23)However, HSV in humans has long been known to prefer temporal lobe and limbic sites.One theory focuses on the olfactory nerves as a possible route for Infection, but oralcavities may also provide entry. In 1996, O'Meara at al postulated that \"Inoculation ofmurine tooth pulp with HSV selectively infected the mandibular division of the trigeminalNIDSMEDICAL ADVISORY BOARDPO BOX 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (888) 540-4999 BEST COPY AVAILABLE3 352 nerve and caused encephalitis predominantly affecting the temporal cortex and limbicsystem, &pattern of disease similar to human HSE themes simplex encephalitist...\".\"While other studies have also knplicated-the temporal lobes in the pathogenesis ofaufism,2526 a direct association between temporal lobe pathology 'and autism has notyet been proven conclusively. In fact, research has found a variety of lesions in the'autistic\" brain, particularly in the cerebellum.\" These variable findings may be due tothe heterogeneity (differences) In the possible etiologies or time/duration effects withinthis syndrome.Although Herpes virus has a predilection for the temporal lobes,\" the course of autismdoes not suggest an acute infection with traditional Herpes viruses. 29 However,delayed temporal lobe development early in life May produce different symptoms fromthose arising from deteriondlon or destruction of previously normal lobes.in summary, although not conclusive, past research further strengthens the linkage ofthe temporal lobe and 'autistic' symptoms. Boucher and Warrington noted similaritiesbetween behavioral deficits reported In animals with hippocampal lesions and'autisticbehavior.3\u00b0 Medial temporal lobe damage on pneumoencephalograms ina of autistic children.\" Damasio and Mauer proposed that \"the syndrome resultsfrom dysfunction in a system of bilateral neural structures that includes the ring ofmesollmbic cortex located In the mealst frontal and temporal lobes, the neostriatum, andthe anterior and medial nuclear groups of the thalamus. At least two other studies havealso implicated the temporal lobes in the pathogenesis of autism.3233The PresentWith new and more precise tools and technology available to us now, the medicalanatomy of 'autism\" is gaining definition after years of conflicting findings. Currently,EEG abnormailtles34, immune markers, and NeuroSPECT findings support the conceptof a medical disease process occurring in these children's brains. For example, it isgenerally recognized that an EEG finding of 'slow' waves or 'abnormal\" brain waveactivityisoftenconsistentwiththeIdeaof an underlyingand unknown\"encephalopathy/encephalitis.\"In addition, recent work with the NeuroSPECT strengthens the connection of blood flowabnormalities and neuro-dysfunctional states, particularly in situations in which patientsappear to have Immune and/or possible viral etiologies. NeuroSPECT scans captureblood flow throughspecific areas of the brain. Blood flow correlates withfunction/activtty.33.36 As noted, NeuroSPECT scans on children with autism have showna decrease in blood flow in the temporal and parietal areas, which is consistent with pastreports of temporal lobe dysfunction in such children. Neurological models of the braincorrelate right temporal lobe areas with social Skills and left temporal lobe areas withspeech and auditory dysfunction, all of which are compromised in autistic children. ItNIDS MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD 4PO BOX 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (888) 540-4999 BEST COPY AVAILABLE should also be noted that there is no good explanation for our finding of increased blood flow In the frontal lobes of a group of these children, which is more consistent with ADD and Hyperactivity.Further research is required relative to this finding.Also, the Board has been monitoring the emerging body of evidence related to the immune system and its Interactive messengers: interteukins and cytokines. It appears that a dysregulated immune system state, whether triggered by a virus, genetic disposition, intrauterine, prenatal, neonatal stress or trauma, may account for the cognitive processing and other deficits seen in some children with autism. This concept Is supported by the lack of consistent neurological/anatomical abnormalities and metabolic abnormalities in these children. We now know that neuro-polypeptides called cytokines can and do restrict brain blood flow under certain conditions. In these children, we may be looking at an Immune system continually sending out signals to restrict brain blood flow. Whether this continues as an 'auto-immune' reaction (whereby the immune system continues this pathway with no active reason to do so) or is due to the presence of a retro-viral or other viral process is open to further research. However, the concept of an immune-related disease process in a large number of these children appears unquestionable at this point in time.Futherrnore, many autistic children have major allergies or intolerances to many chemicals and foods.While occasionally these reactions may turn into urticaria or asthma, the effect in the majority of these children is the worsening of autistic-like behavior.Family history often reveals eczema, migraines (especially in mothers) hay fever, asthma, and histories of other disorders, which are often immune-mediated. These external symptoms may well prove to be signs of a 'hyper- reactive\" / stressed / dysfunctional immune system underlying the biochemistry of these children. Many anecdotal reports of successful therapies for autistic 'children (e.g., gammaglobulin, allergy-free diets) can most likely be explained through the concept of regulating a dysfunctional immune system and/or altering metabolic sensitivities and dysfunction.Examples of autism's probable connection to Immune dysfunctional states are:Extensive clinical work over the last four to five years further supports the Board's hypothesis that we are facing an immune-mediated disease state affecting the central nervous system (CNS) in these children. The literature is replete with articles connecting immune system abnormalities to autism, ADD, ADHD, CFS and CFIDS. Among the main examples are: 1.Multiple researchers have found evidence that autoimmunity is a possible mechanism to explain autistic symptoms.3\"8394\u00b0.\"2. An increased incidence of two or more miscarriages and infertility\" as wet as pre-eclampsia\" and bleeding during pregnancy\" have been shown to occur in mothers of autistic children. There are also multiple studies in the obstetrical literature connecting these events to immune autoantibody production.NIDS MEDICAL BOARDPO BOX 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (888) 540-4999 BEST COPYAVAILABLE5 3.Studies have been done comparing the maternal antibodies of mothers with theirautistic children,\" suggesting an association of abnormal maternal immunity withautism. Antibodies reactive with lymphocytes of fathers of autistic children havealso been found. 1.Multiple researchers have shown an interaction of maternal antibodies withtrophoblast or embryonic tissue antigens, and a cross-reaction with antigensfound on lymphocytes. 64745.492. Researchers have also shown a significant depression of CD4+ T helper cellsand their suppresser-Inducer subset5\u00b041 with an increased frequency of the nullallele at the complement C4B locus52 in children with autism. As similar changeshave been known to occur in other autolmmune diseases,\"'\" these researchershave postulated that Immune activation of a T-cell subpopulation may beimportant in the etiology of the disorder in some children with autism. (Note:Many of the autistic children evaluated by the Board have shown very high CD4and CDB counts, low natural killer (NK) cells, or other consistent withimmune dysfunction/ dysregulation).3.Abnormalities of Cell Adhesion reported.4. Antibodies to neurofilament axonal proteins (NFAP) have been noted in autisticchildren 5\" and have been reported in neurotropic slow virus diseases (Kuru andCreutzfeid-Jacob disease) In adults.\" Other studies\"6 have suggested anassociation of an infectious agent (slow virus) in the etiology of these diseases.This Is considered indirect evidence that some cases of autism may also beassociated with the concept of a \"slow virus.\"5.Anti-central nervous system serum immunoglobin reactivity has been reportedthat was specifically directed against the cerebellum. 5\"6. A small percentage of autisticchildren with demonstrable immunologicabnormalities have normalized their autistic symptoms withintravenousimmunoglobulin treatment. 5\" 5\" This result shows that immune abnormalitiescan cause autism in a subset of children and that \"acquired autism\u00b0 can beeffectively treated.7.Singh et al. hypothesized that autolmmunity secondary to a virus infection maybest explain autism in some children.S9 Congenital rubella causative factorsin autism.Given this support from the medical research literature, the concept of Immunedysregulation as a medical disease process In childhood neuro-cognitivedysfunction is an emerging reality. Thls concept could easily account for aportion of the increase of neuro-cognitive diagnoses over the last ten years.Whether the etiology of this dysfunction is related to environmental factors (e.g.,ozone layer depletion, local toxins, etc.), new retro-viruses, stealth, MEDICAL 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (883) 540-4999 BEST COPY AVAILABLE6 other viruses (or altered viral responses), we now have a medical hypothesis thatcan facilitate the definition of clinical sub-groups and lead to the treatment ofthese patients without first determining the origin or etiology. If an infectious etiology indeed exists, it may be as ordinary as the common cold, or sorare that we have not yet developed the tools to either Identify or study it. Whether anongoing agent is present, or the body simply remains in a dysfunctional state, it seemslikely we are confronted with a phenomenon/illness that has multiple etiologies, multipleorigins, and various clinical manifestations. At this point, they appear linked by animmune dysfunction or possible viral-mediated state. Genetic predisposition to thissyndrome may have a great deal to do with why certain individuals suffer with thesesymptoms.However, we must begin to consider these apparently heterogeneousexpressions as linked and potentially treatable through the common pathway of animmune dysfunctional/CNS .dysregulated state. For example, in a recent study62 onChronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), two NIDS Board members reported a significantdiminution of blood flow in both the temporal and, to a lesser degree, the parietal lobesin children suffering from CFS and Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome(CFIDS). These findings are similar to those previously noted in children with acquiredautism.Based on the evidence presented herein, the NIDS Board believes that developing afocus on the inter-relationship of autism, ADD, ADHD, CFS, CFIDS and other Immune-modulated conditions is a key to helping groups of these children in ways never beforepossible.If we can address the physiologic part of the dysfunction In these children(irrespective of its specific etiology), educational therapy, counseling, study techniquesand most/all other current therapies have a far greater probability of success. Inaddition, research focused on developing and initiating new therapies for autism arelikely to be useful In treating these other inter-related childhood disorders.The Future:As outlined, we have witnessed the evolution of what Is now being recognized andaccepted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control(CDC), and academic institutions world-wide as a \"neuro-immune\u00b0 epiphenomena.Studies are now confirming the concept of physiologic immune-mediated diseasesunderlying an abnormal physiologic state for these patients. This, in turn, creates bothphysical and neuro- cognitive deficits and dysfunction, usually of long-term duration.The NIDS Board believes that many of the characteristics ascribed to autistic (and\u00b0quiet\" ADHD) children overlap with the multiple complaints of adults afflicted withcomponents of CFS/CFIDS and adult 'ADHD\u00b0. As previously noted, all of these groupshave reports of various immune abnormalities including T-cell changes reflected, forN1DS MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD 7 PO BOX 542SUFFERN, NYPHONE (888) 540-4999 BEST COPYAVAILABLE JaJV example, by increased or decreased CD4/CD8 cells, increased / decreased NK and Bcells, and altered viral titers. It is this common denominator of Immune alterations thatgives hope for potential new therapies In the near future for these children. However, while this hypothesis now has support In the literature, there are manyimportant questions to be answered. How many \u00b0autistic\" children have evidence of orare linked to an Immune-dysfunctional state or a conclusive viral etiology? Can thesechildren be viewed and treated differently than the \"classic autistic\" child of 20 to 30years ago? Is their prognosis for recovery significantly better than the \"classic autistic\"children from the past?It is time to recognize that these children are likely suffering from a medical diseaseprocess and need our clinical and research efforts now! Current treatments need to bemodified and adjusted to account for this finding. The symptoms of the \"quiet\" ADDchild (who is likely connected to this phenomenon) is not consistent with the pasttraining or processes used to \"explain\" and address the \"hyper\" ADD child. It seemslikely that the cognitive defects described in adults and children with CFIDS may bethought of as milder, later-onset form of \u00b0autism\", as they are similar in symptomatologyand possible etiologies.The continued exploration of an immune - dysfunctionalepiphenomena, and the potential etiologies linked to it, is a door we must walk through ifwe expect to change the future of this generation of children!it is the proposed mission of this Board to accelerate the integration of the aboveclinical and research findings to facilitate the employment of new (and perhapssome older) immune-modulating therapies in the treatment of \"acquired autism\",ADD/ADHD and CFS/CRDS.We believe that by helping to \"regulate\" or\"normalize\" the immune system, we can restore health to these children. Throughour unique acceleration of clinical knowledge and academic research, there is achance to recognize and treat this disease process while these children are stillyoung and while there is still time to effectively help their cognitive development.

Not by waiting for thescience of \u00b0Autism\u00b0 to catch up, but by applying to these children nowwhat has thankfully been evolving \"scientifically\u00b0 in other fields to date.As trials are about to get underway with new immune modulators for adults, we have achance to help see children evaluated along with the adults, rather than years after.This has NEVER happened before, but can happen NOW, this year. BUT, as I havewritten and discussed, as has been always true, NO Company is going to \"gamble\" oninvesting potentially millions in new drug protocols, especially with children, UNLESSthere is a hard, scientific process to make possible very \"objective\" data, for the FDA,etc. Thanks to the expertise represented in the NIDS Medical Board, this is possibleNOW.As new information emerges strengthening our understanding of the \"neuro-immunesystem\" and its influences, regulatory responses, feedback loops, etc., it has become 363 logical and undeniable that this will ultimately be the route to understanding the keydysfunction in the children being labeled \"Autistic Spectrum\" (and many other cognitivedysfunctional states in children and adults). The only question is, will it be applied tohelp children now or will the children (and their families) have to \"wait\" many more years till the 'system\" is ready.Unfortunately, under the normal evolution of science (evenaccelerated), our \"system\" is still many years away before thinking agents like this would be \"ready\" to be investigated \"knowledgably' in these children. ONE day that willhappen, it is inevitable, it has only become a question of how soon. Why not NOW?Happily (or sadly depending upon what happens), the NIDS Board can help make thischange and happen now, but continues to wait for funding and support to move ahead.The NIDS Board represents researches that have already been working in the field of \"Neuro-immune\" for the last 15 20 years, and together with the rapid application ofsolid science represent a chance to \"leap frog\" the \"system\" for your children. So, as we enter the new millennium, what's wrong?At a recent research meeting I attended, it became obvious that we need to be able toreach out to groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, hopefully help them wakeup to the gravity of the situation, and then be able to get their support (and other groups in organized medicine) to deal with this as the crisis, the grave epidemic it has surelybecome. But instead we lose chances for their support, alienate them by \"unscientific\"allegations, and \"convoluted\" hypothesis being currently proposed by many autistic\"experts.\" Do we want to spend years fighting \"battles\" that needn't be, that in the endare not going to be the \"big picture\" anyway. (Note: at this \"mainstream\" pediatricupdate conference were discussions of the \"expanding\" role of HHV6 disease in childrenand discussion about an \"allergic autoimmune encephalitis,\" topics that would neverhaVe been discussed even a few years ago.) in the coming years, there are going to bemany fascinating \u00b0side\" connections, new information and details to define, but the keynow, is to focus on \"therapy application,\" build upon what makes sense now, while wepursue these further details, not while we fight over them (due to many \"false\"accusations or assumptions), or prepare to study them (many good researchers arebeginning to pursue many of the \"pieces\" of this puzzle), but would still wait to applytherapy tilt WE \"understand\u00b0 things further.We need to focus behind the NIDS Medical Research Board as a path to trials with new agents within the next 68 months, not 10 years. Unfortunately, IF this fails, then itmay well be 10 years or longer (the number used at recent conference) before anysignificant new safe, \"directed\u00b0 therapeutic approach is possible. If we start from\"scratch\" then that time course is certainly realistic. The \"autistic\" field is still scattered inmany directions, unfortunately increasingly chasing ideas that will likely be dead ends, or\"pieces\" of the truth, but not attacking the \"big picture.\" Why is that true? With the rapidacceptance that this has become an \"epidemic,\" science says, you cannot have anepidemic of anv type of developmental or congenital disorder, it is IMPOSSIBLE, ithas become Illogical! Therefore, any researcher currently looking and submittingresearch projects based on \"Autism a developmental disorder is not looking at what isreally happening in a vast majority / ?? all the children being labeled \"Autistic SpectrumDisorder.\"This no longer makes any sense.There are additional huge implications from the statement, \"this IS a disease\" (NOT adevelopmental disorder, a congenitally \"miswired\" brain, etc.) 2 369 364 1. \u00b0Disease\" means these children were born with normally functioning brains thatbecame dysfunctional. That means they can be fixed, in theory they can worknormally, again.1. You cannot \"fir / recover from a developmental disorder, you can from adisease.i.This has profound implications in light of the work from leadinginstitutions showing the brain is more pliable than we thought(implying late redevelopment is still possible) and the Importance ofearly, correct laying down of pathways / tracts as the brain evolvesand develops.ii. WE need to focus on the idea of \"redeveloping\" a child's brain, not\"training\" an \u00b0autistic\u00b0 brainiii.Parents are told there children can never fully \"recover,\" - as adisease, we must expect recovery, hopefully be able to one day usethe word \"cure.\"2. An educator or child development specialist looking at these children, mustunderstand the concept of a \u00b0dysfunctional, but potentially normal brain\" if they aretruly going to be able to look at how to maximize each child's development.1.I have personally been appalled over the last few years at the lack ofexpertise in the \"autistic\" field available to truly help parents redevelop, re-educate their child's brain.I am sure these specialists exist, but in generalthey have not been in the circles accessible to parents at present, OR havenot looked upon these children for what they really are.i.To listen to an educational therapist who truly understands how toassess and work with the various \"highs and lows\" in how thesechildren's brains are working, is impressive; much less a speechpathologist who understand the apraxia, and how to work with the oralmotor dysfunction dominating these children (when you stop thinkingof them as \"autistic\").2.Unlike the \"old\" ideas of NOT expecting speech development past ?? 5 or 6years old, this means older children (10 14 years old / clinical experience todate) can be helped to redevelop speech.i.When looked upon as a disease, this should be expected, not hopedfor or discounted as \"impossible.\"3.Behaviorally, it has become apparent that one must treat these children ageappropriate for where they are psychosocially, not chronologically, not as \"retarded.\"1.With the realization that most of these children are truly intelligent . ..i.Much of the negative behaviors seen, are because these children arenot \"disciplined\u00b0 as one would discipline a normal 2, 4, 6 years oldchild (again where is the child psychosocially, not current \"calendar\"age) or are outright miserable, in pain, frustrated, angry, and NEVERlooked at or truly understood in that wayOne day we are all going to realize what a true tragedy this has become. How many /most of these children are \u00b0miserable\" / physically suffering. If it's going to happen (andevery scientific pathway is toward neuro-immune, an understanding of this as a disease)one day, why not NOW (before many more children are truly not recoverable).Unfortunately, \"problems\" continue to exist, which are working to slow down the rapidlyneeded change for all the children and families out there: 3 365 1. As illustrated above, every \"assumption\" made not based on good, solid medicalscience only serves to mobilize \"academic\" medicine against these efforts, instead ofhelping correctly focus on this crisis (and potential real solutions).2. Many current efforts report \"improvements\" rsuccess\"a.Unfortunately, many \"remedies\" can create some 'success' IF graded Interms of their child starting off \"autistic,\" metabolically dysfunctional, etc. butthese \"success\" stories in general do not come close to a real \"normalization\"of an Ill\u00b0 childii.Again, sights, expectations, measurements of \"success\" are changeddramatically if one recognizes the disease process going on here(scientific), not the old idea of a developmental disorder,developmentally mis-wired brain (now illogical, sci-fi).3. Since this is not starting as a developmental or metabolic disorder (immune I viralare the only possible \"causation\" pathways scientifically), then treatmentmetabolically may help, but does not have the potential to truly fix this type ofdysfunctiona.IF thought of as a disease, then again, the bar of judging success (ANDsafety) changes dramaticallyb. You only beat, solve, potentially cure a disease by treating the etiology /causation, NOT the after effects4.Parents are afraid:a. Yes, it has now come up in many discussions that one of the reasons for thefailure to focus and mobilize quicker around the NIDS effort, is the fear of allthe promised answers before, the false hopes of the past. I have had parentsdiscuss the \"pain\u00b0 of having to \"again\" reevaluate a child's life, expectations,problems, 'knowing\" higher goals are possible / realistic, NOT impossible. butstill so difficult to obtain.iii.Unlike any effort in the past, the NIDS effort is based on science, newinformation, new technologies1. While I can be pointed to merely as another \"clinician,\" theNIDS medical board is composed of researchers who areleaders in their fields, who would never gamble their reputationor prestige on doing any study that was not based on hard,good, science and logic.a. As noted above, the NIDS hypothesis has beenvalidated by every pharmaceutical company that hasreviewed it to date.2. At this point in time, unfortunately, it is far more likely parentsare one day going to be very upset for \"believing\u00b0 the currentAutistic efforts, and at those groups / leaders for not\"focusing\" on neuro-immune faster, or recognizing its role /place, rather than those who have begun to follow a NIDSdirectiona.This is SCIENCE, this is becoming / will become realitySo how do we make this change?:Enough parents must focus around the NIDS effort that we can overcome,bypass the unfortunate \u00b0opposition\" / negative momentum to change that existspresentlyo This is finally possible, but as noted above, will not happen without effort,help and support for the NIDS Medical Board, 4 366 IF financial goals are met (a total business package of - $750,000 - seewww.nids.net ) there is a standing commitment for at least one (optimisticallymore) company with an immune modulator, to initiate trials for the children in amaximum of 6 - 8 months (from when the money is in place, and the networkbegins to come together)oThis is an unheard of opportunity for all the children out there, but will notoccur without successful implementation of the NIDS Business plan, andsupport for the NIDS Medical Research Board's efforts,,We must all demand, insist that any significant allocation of funding, etc. bebased on the \"disease\" state occurring, and focus funding on researchersbeginning to look that direction, not still pursuing the old ideas of adevelopmental disorderAn unprecedented opportunity is possible as we enter the new millennium, IF we can\"focus\" upon a radically different, but now scientifically logical approach for the children,rather than continue to pursue old ideas, that no longer hold scientific logic. Changescan occur quickly. While I have said and written \"patients, parents, have never beforetruly changed the course of medical therapy,\" that can be made to happen now.Through application of solid, good science, but via the connection (thanks to technology)of outstanding, leading researchers (not limited to one university set of connections), weenter the new millennium with a chance to truly radically, make this change happen,succeed now. As noted many times, the formation of the NIDS Medical Board was doneto assure all of you by the level of researchers involved, that there will truly be ascientific level that will be appropriate, unchallengeable, but accelerated clinically infavor of your children.What happens at this point is purely up to those of you able to read this (sadly, manyorganizations and groups continue to resist posting or presenting information, facts, thatdo not fit what they want their supporters, members to hear). There are NO medical orlogistical obstacles (short of adequate funding and finding the appropriate researchassistants, staffing, etc.) stopping this from occurring in the next 6 - 8 months, BUT ifmany parents remain unaware of this option, or continue to be told \"it can't occur,\" whenin reality (as presented at the NIDS conference Bethesda, June 1999) this can occur, ittruly will not just happen (this is not how the \"system\u00b0 normally works). This STILLrepresents a major jump in academic focus and assumptions. It will not just happen bywishing or by itself (this is not the \"natural' evolution of medicine), but with support, help,it CAN occur. With it will hopefully come the increased focus by new therapists with anunderstanding of rehabilitation in children, and a change in focus by existing therapistsand the education system, such that we truly begin to understand how to maximize achild's development and potential, not hope to \"train' a child with Autism (remember:you can't cure / fix a developmental disorder, but you can a \u00b0disease\" state!) As anotherparent recently noted, a child with \"Autism\u00b0 is not suppose to be able to recover, develop'functions\" they are not suppose to have, rather one tries to compensate and work withthe dysfunctions. A child with a disease can be treated and expected to recover,especially if caught early enough, before the \"disease\" state can create permanentdamage or injury.In the past I had been told don't give false hope to parents. Perhaps, as has beenexpressed, it remains that fear (played upon by many old organizations), skepticism, thatwill keep this effort from achieving the support it needs. IF that happens, that will trulybe a major crime (recognized 5 -10 years from now). Again, focusing on SCIENCE, 5 367 (not false promises, convoluted explanations or ideas), science now says this doesmake sense. There is reason for all of you to have hope, NOW, as we enter the newmillennium.So, with increased hope for the year 2000 this can be made to happen7444uxu,Michael Goldberg, MDAddendum: Parents have asked what to do if 'friends\" or others wish to support theNIDS effort.1.The NIDS Research Institute is fully \"non-profit\" / tax exempt.

This tool may open the door to a morephysiologic/medical approach to this process in children. Comparisons are made with thefinding in children with CFIDS and those \"labeled\" Autistic Syndrome / PDD. Theobservation of temporal hypoperfusion in adults and children with CFS/CFIDS, may helpdefine Autism as a disorder of impaired relations with the surrounding environmentdetermined by the temporal hypofunction leading as a consequence to a diaschetichypofunction of visual cortex and cerebellum. The mechanisms for this abnormality need tobe investigated using activation techniques and other approaches i.e.: evaluation of possibleimmune dysregulatlon, etc. 374 369 Complete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD Page DISORDERS: ADHD AND OCD Michael Goldberg, M.D Ismael Mena, M.D., Bruce Miller, M.D. Clinics Las Condes, Santiago,Chile, Dept of Neurology, UCSFMedical Center.Correspondence: Cita/Reference:Goldberg, M. Disorder (ADHD), and Obsessive and Compulsive Disorder(OCD) involve significant frontal and temporal lobe dysfunction. Thisconclusion is based on NeuroSPECT work now in progress on childrenafflicted with these disorders. We have been using NeuroSPECT to Imagecerebral abnormalities of perfusion/function in Autism, ADHD, OCD, andother neuro-cognitive disorders.With the increased focus and presentation of children labeled AutisticSyndrome / PDD, has come a greater need to understand and define thedysfunction in these children by objective \"functional\" quantification, nowpossible with new imaging technology such as NeuroSPECT.The children have been evaluated by means of Xe133 for SPECT,expressing the results three-dimensionally and rCBF quantitatively means of Tc-99 HMPAO. The correlationof cerebral perfusion with brain function has been established, asNeuroSPECT Is a useful tool for cerebral function assessment.In this review paper, we will discuss our clinical observation and our rCBFfindings for Autism and these related disorders. The New Definition of AutismAutism as classically defined was a severely incapacitating disability thatwas relatively rare. Its onset was In early childhood. This disorder wascharacterized by delays in language development, marked social deficitsand a limited range of stereotyped repetitive behaviors. It occurred inapproximately 1-2 out of every 10,000 births. Boys were afflicted morefrequently than girls at a 3:1 ratio. ... \\Completeversion, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM ANE3/30/00 370 Complete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD AND OC Pagc 2 of 11 In this severe form of \"Classic Autism\" effective speech was absent ft couldinclude symptoms of repetitive, highly unusual, aggressive and self-injuriousbehavior. Those afflicted had extremely abnormal ways of relating topeople, objects, or events. Parents noticed that something was not right\" Inthe first three to six months of life.Autistic infants did not demand attention, they didnot enjoy being picked up,nor did they cuddle or cling when someone held them. They rarely smiled atother people or looked directly at them. In fact, they often appearedhappiest when left alone. They resisted affection and did not interactnormally. Mothers of autistic children often noted an understandablelessened pleasure in their maternal efforts. They complained that they feltthey were caring for an \"object\" rather than a person. In the last decade, another type of autism has surfaced that is often referredto as \"Autistic Syndrome.' Children suffering from this disorder appearnormal In the first 15-18 months of life. They do not present signs orsymptoms pediatricians or neurologists would find atypical. These childrencreate an inconsistency with previous held beliefs that 70-8096 of autisticchildren are mentally retarded. They crawl, sit up, walk, and usually hitnormal motor milestones on schedule. lip until the age of onset, they areaffectionate and appear to have above average intelligence.Children with autistic syndrome may begin to develop some speech butthen, without warning, they cease to progress, or begin to regress.Suddenly, these children become withdrawn. They are quiet sometimes andhyper at other times. Often self-stimulatory behaviors (i.e. arm flapping,rocking, spinning, or head banging) develop.These children begin to display various abnormal behaviors in thepreschool years often including: A need to preserve samenessMarked language abnorinalitiesIndexes of developmental disorder - strange body movements,posturing and 'soft' signs of neurological impairment In time, some manifest symptoms that are both similar and atypical tochildren previously diagnosed as \"classically autistic.' What was once arelatively rare disorder is now twenty times more likely to occur.In the past, autism was considered a 'psychiatric' disorder. We now knowthat autism is a 'medical condition,\" not a mental disorder. Perhaps one ofthe reasons no one has come up with an answer for autism is the way wehave thought of it (or rather did not think of it in medicine).Most researchers did not look for the answers to autism because they feltthis was a disorder that was untreatable medically. Treatment for thisaffliction was primarily left in the hands of psychologists and a fewpsychiatrists.Even though children with classic autism might be helped medically as ourknowledge of the brain's physiology expands, for now ft might be 'helpful toseparate children afflicted with autistic syndrome from those with classicautism.

Some doctors believe autism is a result of ametabolic, enzyme, or genetic defect. Although a few children may suffer abuilt-in genetic or functional defect present since early gestation, our clinicalobservation and our rCBF findings for Autism do not support these theoriesfor the majority of children afflicted. These theories do not fit or began toexplain the large increase In the number of children diagnosed with autismtoday. ..AComplete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM AN 3/30/00 3 7 372 Complete version,FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD AND OC Pap 4 of 11 RESEARCH TO SUPPORT IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION THEORYSimilarities between behavioral deficits reported in animals withhippocampal lesions and autistic behavior have been noted by Boucher andWarrington (1). They found memory deficits in infantile autism similar to thememory deficits found in the amnestic syndrome. Medial temporal lobedamage on pneumoencephalograms has previously been repotted in asubset of autistic children (2). These findings were particularly evident onthe left side. Damasio and Mauer have also proposed that \"the syndromeresults from dysfunction in a system of bilateral neural structures thatindudes the ring of mesolimbic cortex located in the meslal frontal andtemporal lobes, the and the anterior and medial nuclear groupsof the thalamus.\" (Noteworthy, is that much emphasis is put on the medialtemporal lobe). By definition, autism has an early onset before 30 months of age, whiledisorders appearing later In life have been thought to be symptomaticaRydifferent from autistic handicap conditions. Publications over the last 13years have cast some doubt on these relationships. It has been pointed outthat there Is no firm evidence that similar or identical syndromes might notdevelop in older children (3).Autism can be associated with a variety of disorders affecting the centralnervous system including encephalitis. In 1981,.DeLong, Bean, and Browndescribed three children between 5 and 11 years of age who developedautistic features while having an encephalitic illness. One patient had highserum herpes simplex titers, CT scan revealing a lesion of thetemporal lobes, mainly on the left side. The other two patients had normalCT scans.Giliberg in 1988 described the case of a 14-year old girl who developed a'typical' autistic syndrome after an attach of herpes simplex encephalitis (4).Widespread bilateral destruction of the brain parenchyma and the temporallobes was found on CT; there was also some involvement of the lower partsof the parietal lobes. The autistic symptoms persisted long after the acutephase of the encephalitic Illness.In 1975 an article was published in Cortex (5) describing a syndrome similarto autism in adult psychiatry, Involving loss of emotional significance ofobjects, inability to adopt in social relationships, loss of recognition of thesignificance of persons, and absence of sustained purposeful activity aftertemporal lobe damage.In 1989 an article appeared in the Journal of Autism and DevelopmentalDisorders (6), describing a 14-year old boy, with a normal history until thesecond grade, when he was admitted to the hospital with herpes simplexencephalitis. Later he developed significant language, social, and memorydeficits. The research group commented on the cognitive and behavioraldeficits caused by temporal lobe damage in herpes encephalitis. Whileother studies have also implicated the temporal lobes in the pathogenesis ofautism (7)(8) this does not prove a common association between temporallobe pathology and autism. Research has found a variety of lesions in thebrain, particularly the cerebellum (9) since Herpes virus has a predilectionfor the temporal lobes (10) It is possible to hypothesize that there is anassociation between temporal lobes and autism, but not necessarily a directcause and effect relationship (11). It is equally important to note that failureof development in temporal lobes early In life may produce differentsymptoms from those arising out of a later destruction of previously normal ...\\Complete version,FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM AN 3/30/00 373 Complete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL and Immunopathology, Singh et al.hypothesized that autoimmunity secondary to a virus infection may bestexplain autism in some children (12). Congenital rubella virus (13) andcongenital cytomegalovirus (14) have been indirectly involved as causativefactors in autism. Researchers found evidence for autoimmunity as a.possible mechanism to explain autism, based on a cellular immuneresponse to myelin basic protein (15), antibodies against putative brainserotonin receptors(16), and neuron-axon filament proteins of the nervecell. (17) Autism and the Immune SystemIt is our belief that 'Autistic Syndrome\" probably is a state of dysfunctionInduced in the brain by a dysregulated immune system. It is possible thatthis dysfunction may occur in individuals that have a genetic predisposition.In theory, this predisposition could be triggered by various stresses placedon the child's immune system. It's seventy varies with the individual and ageof onset.It can be compared to blindness. There are many people who are blind, butthe cause of their blindness may be very different. For whatever the reasons(genetic, environmental, a combination of viruses, etc.), what is occurringappears to be an Immune mediated, abnormal \"shut down\" of blood flow inthe brain and therefore central nervous system function. In adolescents and adults, this dysfunction may manifest itself as CFIDS(Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome), ADHD, and various otheratypical auto-immune disorders associated with neuro-immune dysfunction.In older children, it is seen as variants of ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) /ADHD. And in younger children/infants, it appears as autism, autisticsyndrome and PDD (Pervasive Development Disorder).The multiple metabolic, physiologic, and Immune markers that are abnormalIn these children, 'make sense\" when you think of the bigger picture andconsider the primary cause of autism as immune dysfunction, creatingmultiple cellular / mitochondria] dysfunctions.This offers an explanation for the progressive process of the autisticsyndrome that occurs sometime between 15-24 months of age. It is thisimmune mediated, abnormal \"shut down\u00b0 of blood flow in the brain thataffect the language and social skills area of the brain and central nervoussystem function.Clinical Manifestations Typical characteristics include: nondeveloped or poorly developed verbal and nonverbalcommunication skillsabnormalities in speech patternsimpaired ability to sustain a conversationabnormal social play ...\\Complete version,FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM AN 3/30/00 Completeversion, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD AND OC Page 6 of11 lack of empathyan inability to make friends Also frequent seen are: stereotypic body movementsa marked need for samenessvery narrow Interestspreoccupation with parts of the bodychange of hand or becomes ambidextrous, as they turn autistic. With several different etiologies or biological causes, autism is considered asyndrome rather than a disease. Some researchers have proposed geneticdefects (18),viruses (19)(20) and immunological ties(21)(22)(23) to be thecause.While the literature has speculated regarding the above hypothesis andmany others, at this time there appears to be an enlarging group of children,whose origin seems linked to the concept of an Immune-Dysregulatoryphenomenon. The dysfunction / lack of blood flow can eventually lead toinjury of nerve cells, which offers a possible explanation for the abnormalbrain waves and the large numbers of autistic syndrome children suddenlybeing labeled as \u00b0Landau-Kleffner.\u00b0Whether due to an underlying viral, retro-viral, or other related entity, a likelyunderlying genetic disposition, and/or other 'environmentalfactors, thenumber of children affected seems to be rapidly increasing. Many of thesechildren do not fit dassic autistic profiles, but are frequently labeled highfunctioning autistic, atypical autistic, PDD, etc. NeuroSPECT ResultsQuantitative rCBFmeasurements with Xenon 133 were found to besignificantly higher than normal in autistic children, with maximal values inthe frontal lobes and visual cortex. Minimal perfusion was observed in thetemporal lobes. Decreased flow was also noted in the cerebellum andoccipital lobes. The areas of increased perfusion, most frequentlylocated in lateral frontal lobes, are similar compulsive disorder(OCD children). 99m FIMPAO images perfusion,and demonstrating also temporal, occipital andcerebellar hypoperfusion. Figure 1. Figure 1 (clIck=zooralIn children with OCD there Is a significant increase in frontal perfusionobserved bilaterally in a large number (- 81%) of the children andunilaterally in a limited number (6%) of the children, with a total of 87% cifchildren demonstrating increased frontal perfusion. Among 50% of thesechildren there is also increased perfusion in the posterior cingulate gyros.Of note, there is furthermore hypoperfuslon of temporal lobes mostly in themesial aspects in 93% of OCD children examined to date.( Mena et al) ... \\Complete version,FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM AN 3/30/00 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 375 Complete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD AND OC Page 7 of 11 Increased frontal perfusion was also reported (Rubin et al.) in adults. Mostprobably this phenomenon denotes a co-morbidity phenomenon also that isclinically observed between autism and obsessive compulsive disorder. Discussion of NeuroSPECT Results NeuroSPECT scans are becoming extremelyinformative, as they show blood flow throughareas of the brain. Blood flow implies function /activity (24)(25). As noted, the autistic childrenhave presented consistently with a decrease inblood flow in the temporal area, various degreesof hypoperfusion in the parietal / occipital areaand the cerebellum vermis. There has often beenan increase of blood flow in the frontal lobeswhich is consistent with ADD on the hyperactivityend. Figure 2.Figure 2. (zoornE Opt) The clinical implications of these findings has been heightened by the factthat the \u00b0anatomic\u00b0 areas of the brain involved on the NeuroSPECT havecorrelated with predicted areas of dysfunction when reviewed by neuro-anatomists (research work in progress). In fact, the areas of dysfunction onNeuro-SPECT, have helped explain readily the physiologic dysfunction ofthese children.These children present with a symptomatology consisting primarily ofsevere speech and language development (Left temporal lobe) and severesocial difficulties (Right temporal lobe), often some fine, not usually gross,motor difficulties (cerebellar involvement), and various learning difficultiesand attention deficit dysfunctions consistent with involvement of frontal andtemporal lobes, and links to areas of parietal-occipital dysfunction. Theymay also have many symptoms consistent with OCD characteristics,associated with these areas of dysfunction.In 1995, Katholi and Liu reported their HMPAO findingsin 6 children with severe autism and demonstrated with semi-quantitativetechniques temporal and parietal hypoperfusion with lateralization to the lefthemisphere, while in two of the three images published there is a maximalperfusion in the lateral frontal lobes.Georges, Costa, Coniz, Ring and Ell reported In four autistic adults with Tc-99 HMPAO diminished rCBF in temporal and frontal lobes. The temporalabnormality appears to be confirmed mostly in adults, adolescents, andchildren suffering of autism. Thus, damage to temporal lobe in an earlydevelopmental stage may result in autistic manifestations.The results are otherwise heterogeneoustranslating the heterogeneity of the autisticpopulation, denoting the presence of occipitalhypoperfusion and cerebellar hypoperfusionmostly in the mesial aspects corresponding to thevermis area. This later observation correlates withreports in the literature of atrophy of the cerebellarvermis demonstrated by MRI technique.

(Figure 3)Conclusions and Discussion: Autistic children are an heterogeneous group. Increased frontal perfusionmay be related to \"hyperfrontalftr disorder, and cerebellar hypoperfusion tomotility impairment. Temporal lobe hypoperfuslon and other areas ofdysfunction remains in spite of multiple various therapies used by thesechildren. We are looking at anatomical markings, defining autism / PODdysfunction, correlating to models proposed by behavioral neurologists. Past focus for autistic children has been on trainability, cooperation,behavior, NOT on improving the cognitive processing. A shift to the idea of\"rehabilitation' is already in motion, a full review of techniques and goals isurgently needed. Based on NeuroSPECT findings, implications are that medications or effortsto 'calm' the brain and child down, may further shut down the areas inwhich we want to improve blood flow and function and down regulatedblood flow. Clinical experience to date has noted with medical intervention to help'normalize their dysregulated immune systems many of these children up to5 or 6 years of age will often \"turn-on* and pick-up where they stopped,generally about 18 - 24 months old. On the other hand, as childrenapproximately 6 -10 or 11 years Improvement Is a slower process, oftenrequiring more 'help' to \"learn' the basics, grow-up developmentally, andthen move ahead successfully. For most children, it will probably take the advent and usage of new drugsthat are immune modulators, to truly shut off their dysregutated Immunesystem. Although these drugs are already in existence and are nowundergoing new usage testing in adults, they still await testing for children.Hopefully, they will have the ability to adjust the dyeregulated function andput the Immune system back on track. The clinical implications andconcepts related to past hypotheses of brain develop and maturity, areintriguing to say the least. It was and still is believed by noted neurologists that nothing can be donemedically to treat these children. FortUnately, as these children are. changing with therapy, respected neurologists and other pediatricresearchers, are beginning to feel it Is time to 'take a second look.\u00b0 The good news Is that children afflicted with autism whose Immune systemshave been helped are showing they are bright thinking individuals who arenot what the world expected. Children with the Taber of Autism / PDDusually are not retarded. They may have normal or above normalIntelligence. They are not throw away kids that cannot be helped. They arechildren who are suffering from temporal hypoperfusion / hypofunction,likely auto-immune mediated dysfunction, that can possibly recover. While identifying and looking at different neurotransmitters, neurosdentistshave also found different problems with too much or too little of one or theother. In people with too much norepinephrine everything is pumped up;every stimulation demands a response. The other side of the coin is that a ...Tomplete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IN AUTISM AN 3130/00 377 Complete version, FRONTAL AND TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUN...: ADHD AND OC Page 9 of 11 shortageof norepinephrine seems to rob people of the ability to knowwhat's important.

Altered central dopaminergic function in the midbrainhas been implicated in the pathogenesis of Tourette's Syndrome. Finally,shortage a serotonergic defect involving the basal ganglia. Summary:The observation of temporal hypoperfusion in adults and children with CFS /CFIDS, may define autism as a disorder of Impaired relations with thesurrounding environment determined by the temporal hypofunction leadingas a consequence to a diaschetic hypofunction of visual cortex andcerebellum. The mechanisms for this abnormality need to be investigatedusing activation techniques and other approaches i.e. evaluation of possibleimmune dysregulation, etc.With the general finding of a physiologic hypoperfusion / hypofunction onNeuroSPECT, with generally normal MRI's and CAT scans, we areoptimistically looking at areas of dysfunction amenable to therapy andimproved return of function. Work is beginning (clinical research inprogress) to define reasons for this function and in turn potential avenues oftherapeutic intervention. REFERENCES1.

While in the past\" a rare condition with a \"disputed\" incidence of just 2-5 in 10,000 live births, it is seen as a devastating handicap on psychologic andneurologic development, with potentially long-term serious consequences. Asdescribed in the past, Autistic infants did not demand attention, they did notenjoy being picked up, nor did they cuddle or cling when someone held them.They rarely smile at other people or look (Erectly at them. in fact they oftenappear to be the happiest when they are left alone. Mothers of autistic childrenhave noted an understandable lessened pleasure in their maternal efforts. Theycomplain that they feel they are caring for an \"object' rather than a person.Sometimes this condition Is not noticed at first, because physical developmentgenerally appears normal in the autistic infant These infants are often viewedas \"placid\" babies.These children begin to display various abnormal behaviors in thepreschool years often including:1. A need to preserve sameness2. Marked language abnormalities3. Indexes of developmental disorder - strange body movements,posturing and \"soft* signs of neurological impairment EtiologyWhile the cause of autism is speculative different theories have surfacedin the past including:a) Brain injuryb) Constitutional vulnerabilityc) Developmental aphasiad) Deficits in interplay between psychogenic andneurodevelopmental factorsf) Structural cerebellar changes 381 With several different etiologies or biological cause's, autism isconsidered a syndrome rather than a disease. Some researchers haveproposed genetic causes,' viral causes,2'3 and immunological ties4'5f 6 to be thecause. An increased incidence of two or more miscarriages and infertility,' aswelt as preeclampsia8 and bleeding during pregnancy,9 have been shown tooccur in mothers of autistic children. Perhaps the disorders occurring inpregnancy are affecting the fetus and showing up as autism in the children.Studies have also been done comparing the maternal antibodies of mothers withtheir autistic children.\" These findings suggest that abnormal maternalimmunity may be associated with autism because plasma reactivity againstlymphocytes was found in several of the mothers. Antibodies reactive withlymphocytes of the father were also found, suggesting the target antigen of thereactivity was a parental antigen inherited from the father. Assuming maternalantibodies may be associated with the development of autism, McConnachieand McIntyre suggested maternal antibodies of mothers with repeatedpregnancy losses caused fetal demise, causing immunopathy by reacting withantigens expressed on the trophoblast or extraembryonic tissues of thedeveloping embryo.\" It has been shown by some researchers that onthe trophoblast cross-react with antigens found on lymphocytes.12' antibodies could react with trophobiastic tissue, causing atransitory obstruction of blood flow to the fetus resulting in nonlethal braindamage. Equally, the abnormal behavior seen in autism might be caused by theimmunopathological damage done to the developing neural tissue of the fetus bythe maternal antibodies.While the literature has speculated regarding the above hypothesis andmany others, at this time there appears to be an enlarging group of children,whose origin seems linked to the concept of an Immune-Dysregulatoryphenomenon. Whether due to an underlying viral, retro-viral, other relatedentity, a likely underlying genetic disposition, and/or other \"environmental\"changes, the number of children affected seems to be rapidly increasing. Manyof these children do not fit classic autistic profiles, but are frequently labeledhigh functioning autistic, atypical autistic, PDD, etc. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:Similarities between behavioral deficits reported in animals withhippocampal lesions and autistic behavior have been noted by Boucher andWarrington.\" They found memory deficits in infantile autism similar to thememory deficits found in the amnestic syndrome. Medial temporal lobe damageon pneumoencephalograms has previously been reported in a subset of autisticchildren.\" These findings were particularly evident on the left side. Damasioand Mauer have also proposed that \"the syndrome results from dysfunction in a 2 69-622D-01--13337 382 system of bilateral neural structures that includes the ring of mesolimbic cortexlocated in the mesial frontal and temporal lobes, the neostriatum, and theanterior and medial nuclear groups of the thalamus.\" (Noteworthy is that muchemphasis is put on the medial temporal lobe).By definition, autism has an early onset before 30 months of age, whiledisorders appearing later in life have been thought to be symptomaticallydifferent from autistic handicap conditions. Publications over the last 13 yearshave cast some doubt on these relationships. While the rationale for an agelimit for the onset of autism has been discussed, it has been pointed out thatthere is no firm evidence that similar or identical syndromes might not develop inolder children.'6Autism can be associated with a variety of disorders affecting the centralnervous system including encephalitis. In 1981, De Long, Bean, and Browndescribed three children between 5 and 11 years of age who developed autisticfeatures while having an encephalitic illness. While these autistic featuresresolved after clinical recovery, one patient had high serum herpes simplextiters, and a CT scan revealing a lesion of the temporal lobes, mainly on the leftside. The other two patients had normal CT scans.Gil lberg in 1986 described the case of a 14-year old girl who developed a\"typical\" autistic syndrome after an attack of herpes simplex encephalitis.17Widespread bilateral destruction of the brain parenchyma and the temporallobes was found on CT; there was also some involvement of the lower parts ofthe parietal lobes. The autistic symptoms persisted long after the acute phase ofthe encephalitic illness. This case contributes circumstantial evidence that a fullblown autistic syndrome may be produced by temporal (and parietal lobe)damage. (This author would note that this is consistent with the areas ofdecreased function being seen on NeuroSPECT scans with Dr. Ismael Mena -clinical research in progress.) It also furthers the evidence that herpes simplexencephalitis can cause an autistic syndrome. In 1975 an article was publishedin Cortex\" describing a syndrome similar to autism in adult psychiatry, involvingloss of emotional significance of objects, inability to adopt in social relationships,loss of recognition of the significance of persons, and absence of sustainedpurposeful activity after temporal lobe damage.In 1989 an article appeared in the Journal of Autism and DevelopmentalDisorders,\" describing a 14-year old boy, with a normal history until the secondgrade, when he was admitted to the hospital with herpes simplex encephalitis.Later he developed significant language, social, and memory deficits. Theresearch group commented on the cognitive and behavioral deficits caused bytemporal lobe damage in herpes encephalitis. While other studies have alsoimplicated the temporal lobes in the pathogenesis of autism\"' 21 this does notprove a common association between temporal lobe pathology and autism. 3 383 Research has found a variety of lesions in the brain, particularly thecerebellum.22 Confusion and differences may be due to the heterogeneity(differences) in possible etiologies or time/duration effects within this variedsyndrome we label \"autistic\". However, since Herpes virus has a predilection forthe temporal lobes,23 it is possible to hypothesize that there is an associationbetween temporal lobes and autism, but not necessarily a direct cause andeffect relationship.24 It is equally important to note that failure of development intemporal lobes early in life may produce different symptoms from those arisingout of a later destruction of previously normal lobes.NeuroSPECT scans are becoming extremely informative, as they showblood flow through areas of the brain. Blood flow implies function/activity_28'28As noted, the Autistic children that I have been able to obtain NeuroSPECTscans on (limited by age and affordability), have shown a decrease in bloodflow in the temporal (and parietal) areas. Consistent with the reports oftemporal lobe dysfunction in Autistic kids, this is a_very logical finding.Surprisingly, and without good explanation, is the finding of increased bloodflow in the frontal lobes which is consistent with ADD on the hyperactivity end.(Note: While this may explain occasional success in the usage of Ritalin withsome Autistic children,.Ritalin has the effect of decreasing blood flow on thewhole brain. Therefore, while helping the child if there is too much flow in thefrontal area, you may not be helping \"over all\" if you are cutting flow in areasthat are already low, such as in the temporal or parietal areas).It is also interesting to note that in my working with Chronic FatigueSyndrome, \"Immune Dysregulation\" for the past 12 years, in a recent study(pending publication) we have observed a significant diminution of blood flow inchildren suffering from CFS/CFIDS in both temporal and, to a lesser degree,the parietal lobes. It is this researcher's opinion that there is a strongconnection between various immune dysfunctional/dysregulatory statesappearing over the last 12 -13 years and the emergence of an onslaught of\"atypical\" autism.From the Journal of Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology,Singh at al. hypothesized that autoimmunity secondary to a virus infection maybest explain autism in some children.n Congenital rubella virus28 and congenitalcytornegalovirus28 have been indirectly involved as causative factors in autism.Researchers found evidence for autoimmunity as a possible mechanism toexplain autism, based on a cellular immune response to myelin basic protein,33antibodies against putative brain serotonin receptors,31 and neuron-axonfilament proteins of nerve About 67% of the autistic sera containedantibodies to NAFP. They were present in almost all patients with abnormal cell-mediated immunity(CMI). An interesting observation was that the sera fromhousehold contacts was also positive for anti-NAFP (46% of the siblings or 55%of the parents). Antibodies to NAFP have been previously reported in 4 384 neurotropic \"slow virus\" diseases (Kuru and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease) in man.\"Other studies of household contacts of patients with degenerative disorders ofthe brain have revealed anti-NAFP to be highly prevalent,34'\" suggesting anassociation of an infectious agent (i.e. slow virus) in the etiology of thesediseases. With this hypothesis, eight patients (six with abnormal CM, and twowithout the defect) were placed on immunomodulant therapy. In six patients,parameters in T-cell function and defects in AMLR were partially corrected.Improvement was noted in terms of clinical status, speech, sleep, and attention.After 8 weeks they could speak more than one command; after 16 weeks theywere able to write a complete sentence; and all had increased attention spanand or ability to sleep. The two patients without abnormal CMl werenonresponders.This research has also shown a significant depression of CD4+ T helpercells and their suppresser- inducer subset\"' 37 with an increased frequency ofthe null allele at the complement C4B locus38 in children with autism. As similarchanges have been known to occur in other autoimmune diseases,3914\u00b0 theseresearchers postulate that the increase of serum concentrations of slL -2(soluble interleukin 2) and sT8 antigens indicates immune activation of a T-cellsubpopulation that may be important in the etiology of the disorder in somechildren with autism. In a fashion similarly proposed for Alzheimer's disease,'\"it is possible lhat an anatomical alteration in the brain, particularly thehypothalamus (because of its role in controlling emotions and behaviors) ofautistic children, may result in a functional disturbance of the neuroendocrine-immune axis. Further investigation is necessary. Many of the Autistic children Ihave been evaluating have shown very high T-4 and T-8 counts.While reactions to MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine are in generalmild,42 cases of meningoencephalitis occurring in the third and fourth week post-vaccination have been reported in the UK and elsewhere.43' 44' 4'46' a Startingin February of 1990 the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit asked allpaediatricians to report all cases with one or more reactions occurring within sixweeks of MMR vaccination. Reactions they were asked to look for included neckstiffness (or sign of meningism), extreme irritability, convulsions, alteredconsciousness, unexplained screaming attacks, motor or sensory deficit, visualdisturbance, visual deficit or speech disturbance. In some of these cases mumpsvirus was cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . Nucleotide sequencing of virus isolates has enabled strains of vaccineorigin to be separated from wild strains.48 Definite cases of a vaccine-like strainof mumps virus were cultured from CSF.49 While there was no sex differencesin the cases reported overall, an excess of males (2:1) were reported in thedefinite or probable categories. Even though mumps occurs equally in both 5 385 sexes $0 complications of meningoencephalitis following both mumps vaccination or wild infection has been reported more frequently among males than females,51' 52 with ratiosranging from 3:1 to 5:1. Onemust bear in mind that the natural occurrence ofmeningoencephalitis following mumps infection is estimated to be 1 in 400 cases.\u00b0 Before the MMR vaccinewas introduced in the UK, mumps was responsiblefor a fifth of all reportedcases of viral meningitis,54 Mumps vaccine relatedmeningoencephalitis is generally short lived or mild\u00b0, but some permanentsensorineural deafness has been reported.\u00b0 Published evidence indicates that vaccine reactions are rare and unlike the natural disease, does not leadto permanent sequel.In this author's opinion, whilethe UK and Canada have focused on the MMR vaccine, both itsmumps component and Rubella, there is much skepticism regarding the \"true\" incidence of mumps meningoencephalitis as reported above, and vaccine risk remains very doubtful, if existent at all. This country has not experiencedor reported any significant problems with the MMR vaccine. While there may be a possible \"triggering\" factor with Rubella and an immune active state, thisremains an unlikely cause of Autism. Unless further research creates a strongerconnection, it remains safer to vaccinate a child than-not. Consistent with the question of whether there isa peculiar or unusual immune reactivity whena child is younger, waiting till a child is 3 or 4 could not be faulted, but with ongoingmeasles outbreaks occurring at times, it is not something easy to recommend routinely at this time.Another difficult position to address, is the possible role of fungi in the pathophysiology of Autistic dysfunction. Candida albicans is arguably the single most important fungal pathogen. Because it is a commensal organism present in virtually all human beings from birth, it is ideally positioned to take immediate advantage of any weaknessor debility in the host, and probably has few equals in the variety and severity ofthe infections for which it is responsible.\u00b0Clinically, there is abundant inferential evidence that both mucocutaneous and systemic candidiasis are typically associated with defectsor weaknesses in the cell-mediated immune response.\u00b0 They may reflect specificdeficiencies in this context, such as in chronic vaginal candidiasis5960 or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.61 (Onemust note, that while one might anticipate neuro-cognitive dysfunction in these states, it is not a primary focus of discussion. Significantly, these states do not account for or induce an \"Autistic\" state of CNS dysfunction, seeming to negate many metabolic theories that abnormal metabolic products, seen in exceptionally high volume in these type of patients, induce Autism.)Epidemiological studies of C. albicans have been hampered by the lack of precise and reproducible methods for identifying isolates. Whatever the ultimate role and pathogenesis-of Candida, there seems to be no doubt that it can play a role in many pathologic conditions. Yeast is certainly a potential pathogen in any immune dysfunction/dysregutated state. Yeast may be seen as a secondary 6 386 phenomenon due to a generalized immune dysfunctional state. A yeast\"overgrowth\" in the GI tract can interfere with nutrient absorption, altering AminoAcid and protein metabolism and thereby altering multiple body functions. I dobelieve that it is logical, if you are in an immune dysregulatory state, you may getan overgrowth in the G.I. tract. It is likely Candida may play a role in what isreferred to as the \"leaky-gut\" phenomena. Some physicians believe youactually have a toxin released by the yeast and absorbed into the body, affectingthe nervous system. Clinical ManifestationsTypical characteristics include:a) nondeveloped or poorly developed verbal and nonverbal communication skillsb) abnormalities in speech patternsc) impaired ability to sustain a conversationd) abnormal social playe) lack of empathyf) an inability to make friendsAlso frequent seen are:g) stereotypic body movementsh) a marked need for samenessI) very narrow interestsj) preoccupation with parts of the bodyk) changes handness or becomes ambidextrous, as they turn autistic. Role of food allergens/sensitivities:From the Department of Biochemistry, Birmingham University, UnitedKingdom; Dr. R.H. Waring, along with B.A. O'Reilly, coordinator of the Allergy-induced Autism Support and Self-Help Group is doing some exciting work(pending pub.). They are currently carrying out studies to see if children withknown food/chemical sensitivities, along with autism, have a deficiency ofphenolsulphotransferase-P enzyme and/or a low capability to oxidize sulfurcompounds. From the results they have obtained so far, all 18 children showedto have a low enzyme level, and some had little capacity to oxidize sulfurcompciunds. Now, after 40 children have been tested, the results show theenzyme is low in every child. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize aminesand phenols. So it makes sense that with a reduced level children will not be 7 387 capable to fully metabolize chemicals and foods that contain phenol. Autisticchildren typically have adverse reactions to many medications. Sedatives keepchildren awake, antibiotics worsen behavior even anesthesia may be a problem.Equally, a build-up of substances such as dopamine, serotonin, andnoradrenaline is possible as amines are also metabolized with the sameenzyme. M it is well documented that high serotonin levels are found in someautistic children, if other body chemicals build-up they may be metabolized andproduce a substance similar to phytoxins (plant toxins). In unpublished resultsDr. Waring ran blood tests on 14 children and found that all had low levels ofsulfate (the substrate which is used by the phenol-sulphotransferase-P enzyme).These results show that there may be a fault in the manufacture of sulfate, or itis being used up by an unknown toxic substance the children are producing.[The test for this enzyme is simple; one administers a dose of paracetamol(acetaminophen) followed by a urine collection test for eight hours duration.]Parents reported feverish, off-color children who's urine output was limited.Moreover, some children were not able to urinate too close to the eight hourpoint. [Caretakers should be aware of the potential side effects of this drug onautistic children, asit is given freely for minor illnesses.]Many autistic children have major allergies or intolerances to manychemicals and foods. The main offenders appear to be wheat, cow's milk, andsalicylates. Occasionally these reactions may turn into urticaria or asthma, butin the majority of these children the effect is the worsening of autistic-likebehavior. Interestingly, family history reveals eczema, migraines (especially inmothers), hay fever, and asthma. These children crave the very thing that doesthem damage. They do this not only with foods, but also non-food items theyingest, mouth suck or chew (e.g. metal, plastic, perfume, soap, plastic, etc.).Nearly all autistic children become picky eaters at the time they \"change,\" eatingonly a few different foods and both craving some and avoiding some. Someautistic children begin to eat non-foods items with notable-immoderation.There has been speculation that diet may effect other factors of the body.in a double blind placebo controlled trial children were put on a restricted dietfor a period of three to four weeks. The foods allowed were two meats, twocarbohydrate sources, two fruits, a range of green and root vegetables, bottledwater, sunflower oil, and milk free margarine.\u00b0 The child's preference was takeninto consideration, and suspect foods or foods the child craved were avoided.Worsening of behavior was connected to all relapses with reintroduction offoods, except for four relapses caused by cow's milk and two by cheese, whichproduced physical symptoms only. This trial proved diet can contribute tobehavior disorders in children, and that their parents were able to report on abehavior change caused by food that could be reproduced in a placebocontrolled trial. Although the way in which the diet works is not clear, allergic,toxic or pharmacological mechanisms may be involved. It is possible that diet 8 388 (foods) might induce changes in brain perfusion similar to those found by Lou etal. reporting on attention deficit disorder.\"Many parents have commented after just the initial food/dietary phase,that their children had become more manageable and more amenable to reason.Some to the extreme of beginning to talk, that did not talk before. One shouldnot underestimate or ignore the potential reactivity of the immune system, andvarious foods, proteins, peptides, or other sensitivities. If a parent notices agood effect from a diet elimination, effort should be made to support the family intheir search for other \"logical\" exclusions. Again, unless there is anothersignificant jump, \"extremes\" are usually not necessary or justified. What I haveexperienced clinically, is that as a child begins to do better, it is easier to judgewhat throws him/her off. You should be expecting a continuous upswing and ifthere is a fall back, try to think what did he/she have to eat before the decline.What was done differently? Stay \"tuned-in\" that way .It is also useful to keep adiary, particularly tracking \"off' times.At the Autism conference in Las Vegas, July 1994, Dr. Luke Y. Tsaipresented information on neurotransmitters and psychopharmacology in autism.While identifying and looking at different neurotransmitters, neuroscientists havealso found different problems with too much or too little of one or the other. Toomuch dopamine in the brain's limbic system ( the brain's emotion center) ,andtoo little in the cortex (the seat of reason), may cause suspiciousness and aninability to process the information in the rhythms end cues of social interaction.Inhibited children may have excessive levels of norepinephrine. In people withtoo much norepinephrine everything is pumped up; every stimulation demands aresponse. The other side of the coin is that a shortage of norepinephrine seemsto rob people of the ability to know what's important. Working memory (the partthat stores information while the mind considers if it is worth keeping and whereto file it) fails without enough dopamine. Altered central dopaminergic functionin the midbrain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Tourette'sSyndrome. Shortage of serotonin in the frontal lobes and in the brain's limbicsystem (where emotions come from) seems to relate to impulsivity; the personmay not be able to connect disagreeable consequences or what provoked them.Obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be caused by a serotonergic defectinvolving the basal ganglia.Several drugs which either enhance or block the action of neurotransmittershave been looked at in Autism and other neuro-processing disorders.Haloperidol (Haldol) is a dopaminergic terminalsand cause re-uptake in the caudate Clonidine (Catapres) is alpha-adrenergic agonistTrycydic antidepressants inhibit the uptake of neurotransmitters atadrenergic nerve terminals - this results in an increase (Anafranil) and CNSNaltrexone - an opiate antagonistAlso at the Las Vegas conference, Dr. E. Gene Stubbs hypothesized thatinterferon alpha (INF), a product of many cells, but especially cells of theimmune system, may be a major factor in the cause of autism. When INF isgiven in large doses to children with cancer, the result is that they withdraw andbecome noncommunicative. These are primary symptoms of autism. Also,children with autism have higher pain thresholds, and elevated endorphins intheir cerebral spinal fluid. INF can activate endorphin receptors and is a potentanalgesic. In addition, INF has been reported to contribute to autoimmunedisorders and allergies. An increased incidence of antinuclear antibodies hasalso been reported in these children. Children with autism frequently have animpaired immune function: high levels of INF could impair the immune function.In a preliminary study, 10 autistic children were tested for their level ofserum INF. All 10 children with autism had a higher incidence of serum INF thanthe control adults. Normally, levels of INF are not detectable unless one had aninfectious disease or illness. While the levels of the autistic children were high,they were not as high as expected. (Note: My experience thus far has showninconsistent/scattered levels, with some Autistic children being high, while othersare low or normal. Interferon could possibly be a potential marker to distinguishdifferent groups, but is routinely subject to multiple influences.)Other preliminary evidence suggests that a subgroup of autistic childrenhave elevated levels of other cytokines (INF is considered a cytokine, a solublesubstance that is secreted by cells that affects other cell functions). It is thisauthor's opinion, that the \"true\" pathophysiology lies in these other cytokines,rather than alpha interferon. Research is urgently needed to sort these factorsout and open new doors for potentially dramatic therapeutic changes within thenext year or two, longer if not pursued urgently and correctly now.William Shaw, Ph.D., presented Organic Acid testing which showedabnormal metabolites in the urine of autistic children. Closely resembling normalproducts of metabolism, these metabolites are presumably toxic and mayinterfere with normal cellular energy production. Also, an increase in the yeast-specific sugars arabinose and arabinitol has-been found.Several explanations are possible:a) These metabolites are due to a metabolic block caused by a newinborn error in metabolism analogous to PKU. 10 390 b) These abnormal metabolites are produced by systemic orgastrointestinal yeast in the human host due to yeast overgrowthcaused by a deficiency in cellular immunity and/or extensive antibioticuse. If so:1These metabolites are toxic and may be involved in causing autismand/or worsening some of its manifestations .2. These abnormal metabolites are produced by yeast in the host butare nontoxic and their presence is insignificantc) The abnormal metabolites are fake due to yeast or microbialcontamination of urine.(This last possibility is not very plausible because the normal childrenonly excreted very minute quantities of these compounds in their urine.)Dr. Shaw's test may prove valuable in the diagnosis and/or treatment choices inautism. THIS AUTHOR'S CURRENT POSITION ON AUTISM:It has been my direction to \"backdoor\" into working with Autistic children(and other learning disorders). While ADHD (Attention Deficit Disorder) caughtmy interest in medical school and during my Pediatric training in the mid-seventies, we had very few answers, and very little objective data to makedecisions on within the field. Therapy was very \"symptomatic\" with littleunderstanding or knowledge of the physiologic events occurring within the brain.During this time, Autism was considered a psychiatric disorder, with mostchildren assumed to be \"untrainable\" or \"barely\" trainable, to have low IQ's, andlittle reason, if any, for optimism in the future.In 1983 my wife came down with an undefined illness, marked byrecurrent flu symptoms, fatigue, sore throat, cervical lymph glands, and, as wasultimately noted by researchers studying my wife and other adults with thisdisorder, cognitive dysfunction, characterized by short-term memory loss anddecreased \"processing\" ability. While desperately trying to figure out how tohelp my spouse, and by that time other \"mothers\" and children within mypractice, I took a strong look at the principle of nutritional supplementation andamino acid metabolism. During this time, some Autistic children were referred infrom West LA. To my surprise, upon testing they had \"Candida\" titers higherthan most patients I was evaluating at the time, and Amino Acid profiles withmany similarities to those I was seeing in other patients, with this \"mysterious\"new phenomena. As I was already beginning to view this phenomena as\"immune system\" related, it made no sense based on all previous teaching,What did Autism have to do with the Immune system? 11 391 As I began attending and taking part in conferences looking at advancedwork on neuro-cognitive dysfunction, NeuroSPECT, other advanced neuroimaging techniques and newer quantitative measurements, there was/is anemerging understanding of the Neuro-Immune axis and the concept ofPsythoNeurolmmunology (the rapidly developing field concerned with complexmulti-dimensional interactions between the immune system and the \u00b0entrelnervous system). These discussions and presentations raised the idea withinme what if a more extreme version of this was \"Autism\"? The idea of Autismbeing linked to a severe Neuro-Immune Cognitive Dysfunction is logical, one cansay more than probable, at this point.In addition to the articles noted above, there are many papers already inthe literature, noting various immune abnormalities or potential markers. Witheach passing day, there is less reason to doubt the potential significance of thisfor \"Autistic\" syndrome children (?? all or some) and probably other cognitivelearning disorders. While metabolic factors certainly play a rote in thesechildren, and need to be approached and understood far better than they arenow, it is extremely unlikely that the origin of this dysfunction lies in ametabolic/genetic defect as we currently understand them. At this time, I wouldpropose that these metabolic abnormalities are secondary to a dysfunctionalbody. [ A process affecting the mitochondria (energy factories) of potentially allcells in the body.] It seems likely that the linkage here is a dysregulated immunesystem, and the effects created by \"out of control\" cytokines. As noted above,the ultimate origin or etiology may lie anywhere from genetic factors, a \"geneticdisposition\", to viral, retro-viral, or \"other\" environmental factors. The good newsis that patients do not need to wait years for these answers to emerge, and thenyears longer for testing of potential agents to develop/occur and gain approval;thanks to research of the last 10 -12 years there are agents developed as\"immune-modulators' which can \"adjust\" various cytokine levels and otherfactors. However, these newer, generally extremely safe pharmaceutical agents,cannot be used without first establishing a \"justified\" population to try them with.While the literature and my personal experience and observations supportswithout question the concept of an \"Immune Dysregulatory\" dysfunction withinAutism, there exists no solid, medically valid publication, showing \"controlled\"differences in Autistic Syndrome children.Within my own practice, in running a series of tests including Immunemarkers and general function, viral titers/exposure, general chemistry andmetabolic markers, one sees informally the branching of this group of childrenlabeled \"autistic\" into at least 3 patterns, maybe more. It is important to defineappropriate metabolic and immunologic markers/parameters, so that we mightbetter separate and understand children's different response to therapy, etc.In reality, most \"anecdotal\" reports of \"successful' therapies for autisticchildren can be understood through the concept of a dysregulatory Immuhe 12 392 System and/or altered metabolic sensitivities and dysfunction. In fact, I woulddare say that the only unanswered question in this concept is whether one willbe able to correct all neuro and metabolic abnormalities via \"Immune-ModulatorTherapies\", or whether there will be a need for combined Immune and Metabolicapproaches over time.Seeing children make dramatic cognitive progress on modified Eliminationdiets, anti-fungal therapies, and anti-viral/immune active therapy heightens theurgency to move forward into controlled trials with definable markers. With therecent recognition of the fact that if the brain \"misses\" certain stages ofdevelopment, you may never make that up fully in the future, the urgency ofhelping these children can not be overstated. As noted above, we can\"accelerate\" the medical/therapeutic process greatly, but only if approached withthe correct resources and manner. In the meantime, there is some logic worthfollowing in approaching a child therapeutically at this time.To start with, it's always best to start with the concept of removing\"negatives\", clearing away \"debris\". In that position, removing potential foodsensitizing agents makes sense, as any agent/protein stimulating a negativeimmune reaction in the body will create more CNS dysfunction, via the Neuro-Immune pathways. It is logical to attempt to normalize a child's nutritional state,and often, since one is looking at a \"stressed\" body, there is logic in providingextra nutritional supplements.As a pediatrician, I feel it is very important and logical to provide andreplenish the bodies basic nutrients. However, at present, parents mustapproach this area with skepticism and caution. There are no controlled trialsshowing appropriate dosing or long term safety of many \"harmless\" agents.While there is logic in the concept of nutritional, \"supportive\" approaches, thereare dangers and there are product concerns (re absorption, purity, over-dosage,etc.). Any nutritional manipulation in children is open to dangers or new/inducedmetabolic problems, vs. potential gains. It has been this authors experience thatmegadosages usually seem to provide little if any gain vs. risk, and that any\"extreme\" is subject to many problems in children.Basic replenishment certainly includes a good basic vitamin / mineral Ifluoride supplement, additional Iron, Ca++, Mg++, Zinc++ as indicated, a diethigh in protein (the source of natural amino acids, the \"building\" blocks of thebody), low in sugar, good nutritional value, but for the concerns of allergyreactions or sensitivities, best to avoid whole wheat, whole grains, \"health-food\"store eating. A product such as Nu-Thera, while anecdotal, has been evaluatedand observed in a reputable manner, such that it seems a good supplement formost children, with a general caution not to dose at maximum dosing. 13 393 The area that a lot of mistakes have been made in, is that of Candida oryeast. Yeast is not the answer to this problem/syndrome. or perhaps anyclinical syndrome it is frequently associated with, but seems an opportunisticorganism, that can create or accentuate problems in an already dysfunctionalhost or immune system. You can help a child by treating them for yeastovergrowth or infection, but it and all current therapy should be viewed as astep along the way of getting them better, it is not an answer to the wholeproblem.As diet plays a large role in the control of Candida, reducing sugars,wheat products, and other yeast promoting foods is logical within reason. Ingeneral, I dO not see enough clinical gain to justify \"extreme\" approaches viadiet. There are some children in which \"extreme\" diet eliminations oradjustments may be logical.Once basic diet needs are met, there seems good logic, although againvery little \"hard\" medical data, in looking at some type of anti-fungal/anti-Candidaapproach. (Tests that are being developed may help monitor therapy progresswith quantifiable markers in the future.) I prefer a trial of Nizoral (Ketoconazole),using as indicated Diflucan, oral Amphoterecin B, and occasionally Nystatin.While logical to continue if clinically successful, care must be taken to monitorthese medicines appropriately, and likely \"rotate\u00b0 around, not stay on anyindividual medication for too long a time period. Along with medication, it isobviously beneficial to avoid sugar loads (e.g.. fruit, fruit drinks, candies, sugarcontaining soda, etc.), but, as noted, I do not believe it is necessary or overallbeneficial to go to \"extreme\" diets. Again, follow an approach of common sense.Solving the \"yeast\" problem is not the answer to Autism, and yet in somechildren it may be very helpful. Therefore, a therapeutic trial (changing onevariable or treatment approach at a time - a critical concept for all therapeuticchanges or steps for any child) is justified per the above discussion.Until \"controlled\" groups are identified and therapies evaluated, anytherapy is anecdotal.I encourage each parent to look upon their child as theirown control.It is critical to be patient and allow enough time to thoroughlyevaluate an agent for \"gains\" or \"losses\" (to this author, one should not continueusing any agent which introduce \"negative\" and should avoid or approach withgreat caution, any agent with potential negatives). With the appropriate urgencyto want to help these children, it is nevertheless a great mistake not to\"organize\" your approach and proceed logically, with time for appropriatejudgments along the way.I would again stress the need to remove identifiable\"negatives\" if one expects to adequately evaluate \"positives\".-While there have been many \"metabolic\" approaches and remediesdiscussed over the years, there must be a far greater effort at controlled trialsbefore any \"special\" approach or product can be endorsed. If a parent can be 14 394 sure of no harm, then cautiously trying some of the products or supplements outthere may be useful, but must be evaluated closely on an individual basis.I have great hope for the possibility of what are called \"Immune-modulators'. The anecdotal reports of success with DMG (an apparently goodproduct at \"low\" dosing) and lsoprinosine (?? Success) are examples of agentsworking via the immune system. Zovirax, an anti-viral agent I have used withsome children positive for Herpes viral titers, may be successful via an anti-viraleffect, or an unrecognized immune-modulatory effect. As noted, most successfulanecdotal therapies are explainable or understandable through the immunesystem. With acceleration of efforts, it is this author's hope that \"controlled\"trials with newer, medically developed \"immune modulators\" might be possible inthe near future. Until that point, an overall approach, looking at maximizing thehealth and function of any individual patient, remains helpful to many children.While always feeling the overall approach is far more constructive byeliminating negatives, and \"positively\" helping the body via supplement orimmune modulators; once one has done the best possible at present with what isavailable and useful, there are existing \"medications\" that may offer help, someof it/them perhaps even \"positive\" metabolically.As controversial a term as it might be, Prozac, at low dosages, may havea very beneficial effect on cognitive functioning and sleep cycle (off in so manyof these children) via its serotonin mediated effects and by increasing blood flow,particularly in the temporal lobe/limbic system areas. Paxil and Zoloft are inthis class of SSRI's (Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) which may be particularlyuseful in the child who seems to space out a lot, loose focus. On the other hand,the child who comes across as very hyper, if continuing to be so after dietarytrials and therapy approaches noted above, may do very well with the help ofCatapres (preferably via the patch rather than tablets), or the older children witha low dose of Cylert. Opioid blockers such as Naltrexone may play aconstructive role in some patients, but have not been investigated or pursuedmuch by this author to date. While the goal must be \"normalization\" of the bodyby directed therapy, some of these agents can be useful if used judiciously andappropriately.It has been my privilege and pleasure to see many children improvesubstantially by the above measures. This has only increased and emphasizedthe need to take these approaches into controlled trials, and to hopefully makepossible the introduction of new agents in a very short time. In the meantime,work with a physician or therapist that will work with you and your child. Goslowly, with a concept that when things are better, it takes time for the brain andbody-to change physiologically. Look for combining and building upon safeapproaches and your child's \"positive\u00b0 clinical responses, being careful not tocreate \"negative\" effects or to act too quickly to document changes. 15 395 Any parent's anxiety and desire \"to find the answer for their child\" isunderstandable and commendable, but at this point, slow/progressive clinicalobservation and trial is the best probability of success, while we hopefully speedup the day of new therapy's and understanding. I might add that this is not a\"pipe\" dream or need be 5 -10 years off. Agents exist now that may havetremendous potential to help. They can become available for trial, as soon asmedically credible protocols and justification exist. There are a lot of us trying tomake this happen.We all know it is time, we all know it should happen. We need to make ithappen, for all of you as parents, physicians, and children. Michael J. Goldberg, M.D. Addendum:Literally, as each day and month passes, we are loosing children who by allrecent indications, are both \"savable\", and likely \"recoverable\" if dealt with soonenough. At a critical time like this, there is a general slowness in approach, withdebate raging louder between Immune and Metabolic schools of thought, andthe \"no\" medical problem thinking of most of \"Academics\" still. Sadly, much ofthe accelerated attempt of funding patients are fighting for, will be spentpursuing \"more of the same\" rather than looking at the new possibilities for thefuture. At a time like this, with technology and new biomedical advances at ourdisposal, there is only one way to succeed (I define \"succeed\" as makeadvances in therapy for \"autistic\" syndrome children). If we do not make use oftools and techniques_ that have evolved in the last five to seven yearsappropriately, and at academic, peer-reviewable levels, we will never succeed inchanging the pace of therapy for these children. Happily, as I know word isbeginning to circulate, I am attempting to initiate a controlled cytokine project, inan attempt to open the door for major therapeutic change within twelve toeighteen months (sooner if resources mobilize faster).There are many advances possible now, but they will NOT occur/succeed unlessdata and studies are done at a peer-reviewable level (clinically designed andcoordinated to speed up the emergence of new ideas, new concepts). Any otherefforts will ultimately be more \"spinning of wheels\". 16 396 At the DANN conference in Dallas, January 1995, there was a wonderful comingtogether of ideas and exciting new directions, but a sad split between\"metabolic\" and \"immune\" camps. Also evident was the absolute \"distaste\" forthe mention of academics.I stand strongly behind the convictions expressedabove.I would politely challenge anyone to produce a model that hassucceeded for any disease in the past, without ultimate evolution and definitionby defined studies, acceptable at Academic levels.Without objectivity, no therapy can be appropriately evaluated, nor will newtherapies (already in existence) become accessible. While metabolic vs.immune discussions are interesting, the only major change on the near horizon,will be if the idea of immune-modulators (agents already in existence, but forwhich we must provide an objective basis to open the doors to their usage) canbe tried, and is optimistically successful (many researchers I have been involvedwith over the last five to ten years, believe success is likely, but remain skepticaltill proven). While we \"debate\" other ideas and options, I believe it is urgent toaccelerate efforts to make possible testing of these agents in autistic syndromechildren as soon as possible! As noted, with increased discussions alreadyappearing relating to \"auto-immune\", \"inflammatory\",origins for \"sub-populations\"of children, I would propose without hesitation, that \"immune-modulating\" agentsif effective, will be far safer than steroids or other agents now discussed, andneedless to say, a better alternative than discussing surgery or severe behaviortherapies for these dysfunctional children.Examining the last ten to twelve years, it has become obvious we are looking atnew patterns of disease and illness, that do not fit previously describedsyndromes, etc. Attending conferences over the last 7 years, being exposed tomany \"cutting edge\" technologies and ideas, one trend emerges. We arelooking at a process, appearing to decrease flow/function in the temporal lobe ofthe brain (other areas may be affected, but the temporal lobe I would propose isthe key and common denominator in this process) affecting individualsdifferently based on their age, and maturation of their immune system. Thecommon denominator making sense through these discussions has been theimmune system and a state of \"dysregulation\".I would propose to all of you, that while many metabolic and other phenomena,make sense when thought of in a state of or propensity for immuneactivation/dysregulation, no known pediatric or adults metabolic process makessense as a model for a \"primary\" metabolic defect in these children and relatedpatients. Therefore, while we may to some degree help the body metaboliciy,develop new markers, and even answer some very interesting questions overthe next ten years, we are unlikely to make major medical changes or evenapproach a cure while focusing on and dealing with what appears to be\"secondary\" metabolic phenomena, explainable fully by altered cellularmetabolism (a fact brought out in many respectable articles over the last 5 17 397 years, and accepted at NIH/Academic levels, etc.). This is a dysfunction that islogical secondary to altered cellular mitochondria and immune reactivephenomena. In this light, why are many physicians and researchers trying to\"reinvent the wheel\", when there are models and evolving technologiesexplaining all we are discussing logically and with more and more factualphysiology. Because, there are still gaps in the above physiologicunderstanding, basic science will still take (if left alone) probably five to tenyears to get into any meaningful therapy discussions. These children do nothave \"years\" to wait.Dr. Gupta and Dr. Nancy Klimas (Univ. of Miami), are ready to finish andproceed with a protocol to do a controlled study of cytokine levels in \"Autistic\"syndrome children. These are professors, who if the study is successful, wouldbe unchallenged at the NIH, Academic levels, many have come to disdain. Andyet, as I tried to say at the DANN conference and in many other discussions, ifwe do not move at \"Academic\" levels, few wilt listen, and little will really be done.If we do not unite as physicians and patients to speed up funding for at least thebasic cytokine project, we are as guilty as the \"establishment\" at slowing up,rather than speeding up this process.Potentially worse, as this \"epi-phenomena\" has grown, there are more and, moredesperate parents and suffering patients. As noted above, sadly, while there isthe potential to bring into play safe, essentially non-toxic medical agents,physicians and researchers are turning to \"old\" ideas, (i.e. steroids and otherpotentially toxic metabolic agents) instead of looking at newer and safer ways totreat this phenomena in children (and adults). In addition, while agents likeProzac and Paxil have the ability to actually help the brain if used physiologically(at low dose they can increase temporal blood flow, and work as very mildimmune modulators), physicians, as has been done in the past, are usingmedications at non-physiologic dosages and accepting multiple side effects orpartial results, because something seems like a good idea. As much as I havebecome an advocate of Prozac and Paxil, this has come only afterunderstanding that they could serve a role in normalizing CNS function, andwere very safe class B agents if continued. However, I do not believe this or anyother currently available agent is going to be successful without an \"overall\"sound metabolic, nutritional, and immune approach prior to its usage. Likewise,even with the potential emergence of immune modulating agents for therapy, Iam not sure whether they will be effective by themselves (as implied by some) orneed to be used in a \"combined\" approach, something that could be designedinto controlled trials, if we have the right input and \"control\" (this is not the usualway Academic's or Drug companies have wanted to design or fund trials in the.past).Watching this \"epi-phenomena for the last ten to twelve years, other factors areobvious. If patients are not appropriately identified by scientifically validted 18 398 markers, we will never sort out or be able to understand the reasons whydifferent patients respond to different agents (pharmaceutical, nutritional,metabolic, etc.). The truth is what we call Autism, ADHD, CFIDS, etc. are all\"heterogeneous\" populations, in which any drug or therapy trial appears doomedto frustration and failure, without newer, appropriate \"objective\" markers.At the Dann conference, the idea that we needed to pursue Academicallyacceptable studies at peer-reviewable levels, was met with very mixed feelings,and some open hostility. Without this approach, I challenge anyone to tell mehow we are going to have significant impact for patients on the medicalestablishment. In fact, unlike the past, the situation with \"restricted\" medicineand 'fixed guidelines\" by HMO and insurance companies, is going to deny careto these children and unless we all help prove the system wrong. Unlike thepast, there are ways to do that now that did not exist.As noted, parents are desperate, reaching for straws, and may be directed oradvised into long-term negatives, rather than gain. A metabolic dysfunction byaltered cellular metabolism and immune dysfunction, is not likely to correct byany excess of agents introduced to the serum of the bodies. A backup of theseagents, may, as noted, be in themselves toxic. Along with others, I have beenlooking at the idea of an agent called Trental. In theory, it could be an excellenttemporary agent, but I have yet to be able to get an answer, regarding long termsafety for children. Any therapy proposed must be safe without a doubt. Manyof the physicians at the DANN conference had questions with respect to somecurrent therapy usage, and many of us are aware that while some agents maybe helpful, some can be toxic, even those called nutritional or metabolic.To all of you reading this, I apologize for the \"personalized\" emotion of this lastentry, but it has become obvious that with time, many of the negatives expressedabove are happening to children, and if appropriate steps do not begin, thefuture remains ominous for most of these children. While much of \"mainstream\"medicine remains convinced that many of these children are retarded, it hasbecome evident that at least currently, most of these children are very bright,and their dysfunction is likely a medical problem, unlike any routine diseaseprocess in the past, but just as logical, and optimistically, just as treatable. 19 aou 1Folstein, S. & Rutter, M.

It was a severely incapacitating disability that was relatively rare. It occurredin approximately 1-2infants per 10,000 births.In this severe formof\"Classic Autism\" effectivespeech was absent. Itcould include symptoms of repetitive, highly unusual, aggressive andself-injutirtus behavior. Those afflicted had extremelyabnormal ways of relatingto people, objects,or events. Parents noticed that somethingwas \"not right\" generally within the first three to sixmonths of life. These children didnot coo or smile. Theyresisted affection and didnot interact normally. In the last decade, anothertype of autism has surfacedthat is often referredto as \"Autistic Syndrome.\" Children suffering from this disordergenerally appear normalin the first 15- 18 months of life. Theydo not present signsor symptoms pediatriciansor neurologists would find atypical.These children createan inconsistency with previous held beliefs that 70-80% of autistic childrenare mentally retarded. Theycrawl, sit up, walk, andusually hit normal motor milestoneson schedule. Up until theage of onset, they are affectionate and appear to have aboveaverage intelligence.Children with this autisticsyndrome may beginto develop some speech butthen, without warning, cease toprogress, or begin to regress. Suddenly, these childrenbecome withdrawn. Theyare quiet sometimes and hyper at other times. Oftenself-stimulatory behaviors (i.e. arm flapping,rocking, spinning,or head banging) develop. In time, some manifest symptoms thatare both similar and atypicalto children previously diagnosed as \"classically autistic. \"While trainingas a pediatrician, Iwas told ifI saw one autisticchild in a lifetime of practice it would beone too many. What 1 am seeing today is not the autism Iteamed about in medicalschool twenty yearsago. What was once a relatively rare disorder is now twenty times more likelyto occur. Before, \"autism\"was 1-2 per 10,000 births. Now, current statistics suggesta frequency of 20 per 10,000births (rates of 40per 10,000 or higher have beensuggested).In the past, autismwas considered a \"psychiatric\" disorder. We now knowthat autism is a medical condition, nota mental disorder. Perhapsone of the reasons noone has come 3EST COPY AVAILABLE 409 404 up with an answer for autism is the way we have thought of it (or rather did not think of itin medicine).Most \"MD\" researchers-did not look for the answers to autism because they felt this was adisorder that was untreatable medically. Treatment for this affliction was primarily left inthe hands of psychologists and a few psychiatrists.\"Autistic syndrome,\" though still treated mainly by psychologists and psychiatrists, is alsono longer considered a psychiatric disorder. It is a biological disorder that requiresmedical intervention. Physicians are now just beginning to understand the medical originsas well as the actual and potential treatments for autism.Even though I believe children with classic autism might be helped medically as ourknowledge of the brain's physiology expands, for now it might be helpful to separatechildren afflicted with autistic syndrome from those with classic autism. As children withautistic syndrome increasingly become categorized as a \"medical\" problem, separatingthem from the many negative connotations and hopelessness associated with \"classic\"autism could be advantageous to promoting research and funding to help these children.The differences between the two groups may be summarized as follows: Classic AutismA rare disorder affecting 1-2 children / 10,000Some/many individuals may have early signs of neurologic injurySome may have \"physiologic/immune\" factors / variables, \"treatable\" medically bycurrent and future immune medicinesGenerally \"abnormal\" early (i.e. 3 - 6 months of age)\"Classic\" Autistic symptoms / presentationPresumed \"static,\" / unchangeable Autistic SyndromeAn increasing population of children with \"Autistic/ PDD\" behavioral characteristicsCurrent estimate 20-40 children / 10,000 (incidence may be as high as 1-5% ofthe population based on estimates for chronic fatigue syndrome in adults)Does NOT have \"objective\" physical signs of neurologiC damage / injuryMajority (?? All) are immune mediated, appropriately looked upon as .a medicaldysfunction - open to potential medical therapyGenerally \"normal\" early (usually until 15 - 18 months of age)Atypical symptomsAsperger's 2 405 Landau Kleffner'sADHD / ADD variantsA potentially progressive disorder (if not treated / corrected)May explain the origin of many cases of \"Landau-Kleffner\" syndromeAutism and the Immune SystemI have been in clinical practice for the last twenty years. When my wife developed an\"unknown\" chronic illness in 1982, I began to explore and research neuro-cognitivedysfunction and immune dysfunction / dysregulation in an effort to help my wife.Eventually she was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, to what is now CFIDS(Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome).The first suspicion I had that autism might be immune-related occurred in 1985. I was inthe middle of exploring various alternative therapies in hopes of helping my wife andothers afflicted with CFIDS. About the same time, some autistic children were referred tome for evaluation. These children had never had any blood work-ups because no onethought of their \"problem\" as a medical one. Much to my surprise, they had similarprofiles on amino acid screens as the adults I was seeing with CFIDS. I couldn't help butwonder \"What did Autism have to do with the immune system?\"The Causes of AutismWith the relatively new thinking that autism has medical origins have come severaltheories.Some doctors believe autism is a result of a metabolic, enzyme, or geneticdefect.Although a few children may suffer a built-in genetic or functional defect presentsince early gestation, I do not believe this is the case for most children afflicted. Inaddition, the old theories do not fit or began to explain the large increase in the number ofchildren diagnosed with autism today.I believe \"Autistic Syndrome\" probably is a state of dysfunction induced in the brain by adysregulated immune system. It could be possible that this dysfunction may occur inindividuals that have a genetic predisposition. This predisposition is somehow triggeredby various stresses placed on their immune systems. It's severity varies with the individualand age of onset. The triggers may be different (or similar) in each child.If it is looked at in relation to the causes of blindness, it is easier to understand. There aremany people who are blind but the cause of their blindness is very different. This isconsistent with the idea of an immune dysfunction / dysregulation. For whatever thereasons (genetic, environmental, a combination of viruses, etc.), I believe what isoccurring is an immune mediated, abnormal \"shut down\" of blood flow in the brain andtherefore central nervous system function. In adolescents and adults, this dysfunctionmanifests itself as CFIDS and various other atypical auto-immune disorders. In olderchildren, it is seen as variants of ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) / ADHD (AttentionDeficit Hyperactive Disorder). And in younger children/infants, it appears as autism,autistic syndrome and PDD (Pervasive Development Disorder). 3 406 When these children are given a NeuroSPECT (a test to measure blood flow to variousparts of the brain) and clinical blood work, this connection becomes more than reasonable,it is logical.The theory that Much of autism / PDD is probably an immune-mediated auto-immunedisorder is gaining rapid acceptance. It explains the progressive process of the autisticsyndrome that occurs sometime between 15-24 months of age. The dysfunction / lack ofblood flow eventually leads to injury of nerve cells, which explains the abnormal brainwaves, and the large numbers of autistic children suddenly being labeled as \"Landau-Kleffiier.\"The multiple metabolic, physiologic, and immune markers that are abnormal in thesechildren, \"make sense\" when you think of the bigger picture and consider the primarycause of autism as immune dysfunction, creating multiple cellular / mitochondria'dysfunctions. A distinction often misunderstood is that dysfunction starts out of theimmune system, not out of casein, gluten or other metabolic sensitivities. Children withautism have a lot of metabolic abnormalities, but that is a result of the problems with theirimmune systems.If a metabolic dysfunction were the cause of a disorder, correcting it would eliminate thedisease. If casein or gluten caused autism, eliminating them from the child's diet wouldcure them, but that does not work.If metabolic dysfunction is a secondary factor of autism, you rarely, if ever, are going tohave a patient recover, by treating the \"secondary\" rather than \"primary\" problem.Similarly, if it were true that adults with chronic fatigue have a metabolic defect, howcome most of them were normal and generally high functioning for years?In medical school I was taught to, get to the reason, and to-get to what's underneath it.It's important not to just treat a symptom, or what appears to be on the \"surface,\" butrather it is necessary to treat what is causing the problem.Medical TreatmentsMost of the children 1 see have healthy bodies with reactive and volatile immune systems.The first step, is to check functioning of various systems in the body. Unless another\"medical\" problem is found, the immune system is what is creating the misbalance /dysfunction in the brain.Unfortunately, new, potentially safe immune modulators (steroids, IVGG, are old immunemodulators, neither generally safe or effective with this type of immune disorder) are notyet available. Until these immune modulating drugs are scientifically tested in controlledstudies, the way to help these children must focus on an overall approach using efforts /steps and medicines available now. By the time a child is referred to my office, theirimmune systems have not been functioning well for a very long time. This dysfunctionalprocess did not occur overnight and it takes time to \"cool\" down / help \"normalize\" thebody and the immune system.The closer you can bring the body towards normal, the better the chance that the bbdymay shut off this reactive and dysfunctional immune system. It is a difficult and 4 407 complicated process to make the body heal itself especially after years of dysfunction. Butif you remove some of the \"offenders\" that cause the immune system to fire when itshouldn't, you're making it easier for the body to normalize.The Role of Allergens and DietI usually begin by testing the blood to determine allergies that could possibly trigger the immune system to react. Often autistic children come up allergic to a large number offoods, not necessarily because they are actually allergic, but rather because their immunesystems are so \"revved-up,\" they react to everything.This reaction may or may not occur as a traditional allergic reaction of asthma, a rash orhives. But what does occur is an immune mediated, abnormal \"shut down\" of blood flow in the brain that affect the language and social skills area of the brain and central nervoussystem function.I generally start to improve the immune system by placing the patient on a diet free fromdairy products, chocolate, and whole wheat. The reason for this is to help reduce thestress on the immune system. If dairy, chocolate and whole wheat are taken away, 96 -98% of probable \"food\" allergies are alleviated. However, I do not believe that you cancorrect this condition by diet alone. If this were possible, parents (and physicians) by now, would have heard of multiple, \"unbelievable\" successes over the years. Reputable\"institutions\" would be conducting clinical trials to investigate the \"successes.\"Since nutritional therapies have not resulted in cures, or even published reports ofsignificantly improved cognitive function, it is illogical, in fact potentially detrimental, toput these children on extreme diets. However, sometimes these children put themselveson extreme diets by only eating a limited number of foods. I don't think there arealot ofnormal children who would be healthy on some of the diets these kids put themselves on.For most of the children, all that is necessary is to eliminate the \"main offenders\" in their diets that will cause the immune system to react. It is not necessary to eliminate all wheat.Some doctors and homeopaths recommend the elimination of all gluten and wheat. I thinkthese children show improvement because when they are put on a gluten / wheat free diet,they no longer eatwholewheat. Usually, all that is really needed is to eliminate wholewheat and otherwholegrains (due to allergenic potential) from the diet.I do not normally focus on casein beyond eliminating the primary milk products. Becauseeven though they may, in theory, play a slight role in the background, if the allergiesoverall are lowered, it will decrease the immune system firing off.It does not matter if \"allowed\" processed products are used, as long as they do not appearto be a \"trigger.\" But, avoiding the \"main\" offenders is extremely important. Eliminatingtoo many products from a child's diet, increases the risk of disturbing a child's metabolicbalance, rather than helping to normalize it. (Note: Many supplements meant tocompensate for the diet extremes, may in themselves have allergenic components, actingas negatives triggers to the immune system and the child overall. They may fail to beproperly absorbed or contain dangerous impurities. Children may be at far greater risk 5 408 from diet and \"supplements\" than any perceived risk from properly usedpharmaceuticals.)The G.I. tract is loaded with lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection anddisease). Those lymphocytes communicate with the brain. What has always made senseand is \"logical\" is if the body is sensitive to milk protein and whole wheat protein, cominginto the G.I. tract it could cause the immune systenito fire.As research evolved, it was found that milk and dairy can actually cause a microscopicblood loss in the intestine by a \"reactive\" inflammation of the bowel. It is interesting tonote that most of the world's populations get violently ill when given cow's milk.Apparently, it's not a normal human trait to digest the cow's milk proteins.Asian people have much healthier arteries than we do. One of the major assumptions forthis is that they eat soy protein instead of dairy protein. Dairy is the number one source ofcholesterol. The entire family can be helped indirectly if milk is eliminated from the meals.Parents often worry if their child is getting enough calcium. Soy and rice milk often havecalcium and vitamins A and D added. However, if a child (girl or a boy) is eating a normaldiet, they will get enough calcium.In the teenage years, girl's diets should be supplemented, if you're not giving them a lot ofdairy. But usually, this is not necessary in these first three or four months. As time goeson a calcium supplement may need to be added. Often I will suggest Turn?. Turns\u00ae area very safe source of calcium for a child and they taste good.Inter-related is the fact that many children and adults who are sensitive to milk but stillcontinue to drink milk products, often have iron stores that are low. Their Hgb. / Hct. arechronically on the low side of normal, even if they were not truly \"anemic.\" This istypically because of a microscopic blood loss.occurring through this \"inflamed\" mucosa.If dairy and milk were eliminated from the diet, and then a biopsy of the intestine wasdone, the mucosa (the mucous membrane that lines a structure e.g. mouth and lips) wouldlook normal. If milk and dairy were then reintroduced, the mucosa would look raw andinflamed. (Therefore, in approaching the idea of \"leaky\" gut, helping the body byremoving negatives, is more important than \"supplements\" and nutritional \"fixes.\")As a pediatrician it has been fairly routine for me to see a child do well on formula (even acow's milk based one) for 12 months, but when the child is switched to real milk, the childexperiences congestion, stuffiness, upset stomach, and a whole realm of symptoms notseen before. Whole protein, unprocessed food is much more allergenic and has a higherincidence of causing the immune system to react.The truth is, there is not as bad an allergic reaction out of a processed product. When afood is processed, the protein structure is changed. So a child that might go berserk onmilk... may not have a reaction to \"processed\" cheese. When the protein structure ischanged, the food will not give as large an allergenic reaction.Products from the health food stores are not necessarily the best for autistic childrenbecause they are less processed and more pure. They have a lot of whole wheat and 6 409 grains. For these kids, the cheapest white bread (without milk, whole wheat, or whey) isoften the best choice.To illustrate how peculiar the immune system is, when parents seen the results of thefood test come back, a routine phone call is, \"How come you did not say 'no eggs'?\"You'll almost always see egg white and egg yolk with very high numbers, and yet I willusually say \"ignore it.\" The reason being, unless a child has eczema where yolk or eggare triggering off a skin reaction, for some reason the immune pathway fired off by eggsdoesn't seem to play a role in what we are talking about in the brain. I rarely have toworry about taking a child off of eggs, even though you may have this \"huge reaction\" onthe food \"screen.\" This illustrates how parents need to become aware of what doctorshave known and \"fought\" about for years, there is no \"perfect\" food test / screen, resultsmust always be interpreted in their clinical context. Too often, parents are being \"guided\"by interpretation of food and metabolic screens that do not have the capability to do whatthe parents wish. Many mistakes are potentially being made, that may be \"metabolically\"and physiologically hurting these children.Although processed food might give a lesser reaction, the importance of avoidingallergens cannot be stressed enough. In the beginning, it is especially important to avoidfoods that might trigger the immune system. If the immune system is triggered, the body isaffected for a minimum of a week to ten days (or longer). So it's necessary to beparticularly strict at the start of the treatment, when the goal is to cool down the immunesystem.If it comes down to choosing a food (cheat) with milk or sugar, choose the sugar. Fromthe sugar the child may get hyper for a few hours, but it wears out of their body relativelyquickly. From milk protein or other allergens, the immune system can be affected for upto two - three weeks. However since sugar feeds yeast, it is a good practice to minimizesugars in general.It is also important to encourage the children to eat more protein. This will help balanceout their own amino acids, which in turn will help alleviate some of their problems. Allthese children need protein. It is also necessary to restrict the starches. Healthybreakfasts, lunches and dinners should be served.Sometimes this process of restoring the immune system to normal can be very deceptive.The child is doing extremely well, and appears almost well or \"cured\" to a parent, wheneverything suddenly falls apart.A child may appear to be well, but unless the body has shut off this process, they still havea reactive, volatile immune system in the background. Even if a child is functioning at aextremely high level, a child should not be regarded as \"cured\", unless the immune systemhas truly returned to normal.While a few rare children will actually outgrow this process, especially if you have takensteps to help normalize their bodies; realistically, it will probably take the advent and usageof new drugs that are immune modulators, to truly shut-off their dysregulated immunesystem. 7 _410 This treatment needs to be thought of on a continuum. The closer the child gets tonormal, the better the chance that the body may shut off this process. But unless you'vegone that last little step, unless this process shuts off, it must be assumed that the immunesystem is still volatile and potentially reactive.The only principle I have continued to find logical over the years, is the idea that I'm tryingto just help a child \"normalize\" their body (and brain). Can I help them balance out theirbody? If 1 can change the diet, their own body can help balance itself There continues tobe no evidence in these children of any pre-existing, built-in enzyme or metabolic defect.Therefore, by focusing on the overall intake, encouraging more protein, less starch, achild's body will help balance out and replace needed amino acids ( the building blocks ofthe body) and other nutrients.With rare exceptions, I will never say don't do something if you truly see a child do betterand it's safe, but in most cases I have found that you can get to the right point if you justthink of it as cool down the body's immune system, help \"safely\" where medically andnutritionally possible, and extremely important, avoid offenders or triggers. If a child isdoing better and their allergy test said they were not allergic to apple, but you give them adrink of apple juice and the child is bouncing off the walls, it doesn't matter what the testsaid, that child should not have apple juice. And this is the way parents have to work withtheir own child.Until new immune modulators are tested and ready for use with patients, 1 regard eachstep of treatment as an attempt to help \"cool-down\" the immune system, and help thebody \"adjust\" itself in a healthier manner. While the principles are becoming veryconsistent, each child (his/her body and brain) must be \"individualized.\"Candida or Yeast and AutismWhile taking the risk of opening a medical controversy, this author certainly believes thereis a logical connection between yeast and a dysfunctional immune system. However, thistheory is not yet widely accepted by the medical community, but over the last few yearshas become easier to talk about and \"discuss\". Candida is a yeast-like fungus that ispresent in all our bodies. Presumably, yeast / Candida is in every normal G.I. tract. Thatis where the confusion begins.Normally, a healthy immune system keeps the yeast in check. If the immune system is notworking properly, the yeast have a chance to overgrow and become a problem. Yeast isone of the likely pathogens contributing to a metabolic imbalance that is a secondaryresult of a dysfunctional / dysregulated immune system. It is NOT the primary reason orcause for autism.There is logic in saying that if an immune system is dysregulated, a secondary problempotentially due to Candida needs to be treated. Some doctors hypothesize that autism iscaused by.a \"leaky gut.\" With this theory comes the assumptions that withdrawingallergens and treating a yeast overgrowth, will help the GI tract to return toward normal.The problem with this thinking is that if yeast is not the cause of autism or PDD, thentreating Candida is not going to end the autistic or PDD state. I believe it is only one ofthe many steps needed to help normalize the body. 8 Many children afflicted with autism have had frequent ear infections as young children andhave taken excessive amounts of antibiotics. This has exasperated the yeast problem inthese children. Other possible contributors to Candida overgrowth are hormonaltreatments (ii.e. steroids, BCP pills, ?? secondary exposure), immunosuppresant drugtherapy; exposure to herpes, chicken pox, or other \"chronic\" viruses, or exposure tochemicals that might upset the immune system. There is an increased probability, that a\"general\" environmental factor affecting our immun\", systems (i.e. ozone layer depletion,\"toxic\" chemicals, etc.) may be operative, affecting many children and adults.Because it is impossible and not practical to expect anyone to stay on a totally yeast-freediet, ongoing medication, anti-fungal supplements, and avoidance of dietary negatives arenecessary to control Candida. Even with the use of anti-fungal drugs, it is still importantto limit sugar when there is a yeast problem, because yeast grows 200 times faster in thepresence of sugar.If a potent anti-fungal such as Diflucan or Nizoral is used, it can be assumed that within 1- 2 months most all of the yeast will die off. I do not use Nilstat or Nystatin. For mostchildren Nystatin is ineffective. And yeast, like bacteria with antibiotics, have becomeresistant to Nilstat (and other antifungals).Usually, I will use Naomi or Diflucan for about four to six months while trying toalleviate other stresses on the immune system and \"maximize\" a child's function. In 7- 12days some patients experience \"die off.\" This is the only time, a \"negative\" reaction to amedication can be a good sign. When the yeast is being killed one experiences either a\"sensitization\" reaction to \"products\" of the yeast being killed, or there is release of\"formaldehyde\" like products or other potentially toxic derivatives, that can contribute tonegative symptoms in a patient, including bouncing off the walls, miserable, and irritated.I know it is ironic, because it actually is a good sign that the child has a yeast problem that can be corrected with medication.It is important that the parents check in during \"die-off' so I can be sure what is occurringis indeed die-off and not a reaction to the medication. Die-off usually lasts about 7-14days and after that time the change in the child can be rather dramatic. If the die-off doesnot end in 14 - 17 days, it is generally a reason to change choice of anti-fungal.If the treatment is successful, usually eye-contact improves. The children seem moretuned in and less \"foggy.\" Parents report that after the yeast is under control thefrequency of inappropriate noises, teeth grinding, biting, hitting, hyperness, and aggressivebehavior decrease. The children no longer act almost drunk by being silly and laughinginappropriately.While on Nizoral or Diflucan, I have the patient take monthly blood tests to monitor liverfunction before any damage might occur. I tend to be on the cautious side, \"officially\"testing is recommended every 2 - 3 months.I change Medication at six months, though in theory one could go longer. The reason Istop at six months is because Nizoral has a very mild effect on the adrenocortical axis. It'spart of the internal steroid mechanism. While this may even be part of how \"Nizoral\"helps the body, it also limits how long one should be on Nizoral. Generally, I will try to 9 switch to Amphotericin B, which has recently been licensed as an oral liquid in thiscountry, can now be legally compounded by certain pharmacies in the U.S.If the antifungal therapy is stopped completely, and the body's immune system has notreturned to normal, the yeast will return. Ultimately, the key is the body's own ability tokeep in check an organism that it doesn't want to have there to start with.Some doctors mistakenly give medication to control the yeast for only a few weeks oreven a month. Then the treatment is stopped because the child is doing better. Theproblem with this kind of therapy is that if a child is helped for a short time and then thetreatment is withdrawn, the yeast is going to come back, perhaps even as a stronger, moreresistant strain. Whereas if the treatment took that child to normal, and their immunesystem became normal, it would be possible to withdraw all treatment and the child wouldremain healthy.AntiviralsIf the blood work suggests that a herpes related virus or \"unidentified\" retro-virus mightbe in the body, a therapeutic trial of the antiviral drug Zovirax is given. The only thing (intheory) treated with Zovirax is a herpes related virus. If a virus is present and it is gottenunder control, it's one of many.major steps necessary to help the body and the immunesystem.On a few of the older children I am now starting to use Valuer, which is an improvedversion of Zovirax.I never recommend something for a child unless I can say, \"It issafe.\"When herpes virus is discussed, we all think of cold sores, vaginal sores, but may notconsider chickenpox, CMV (cytomegalovirus), or Epstein Barr. These are also herpesviruses. Being in the herpes family, they have the unique ability to sometimes stay aroundeven after the overt symptoms are long gone. They hang around the body and live in thenerves. Perhaps a \"new\" Herpes related virus or retro-virus may be playing a role in someof this epiphenomena. However, at this time we do not have the technology to exploreand understand how all of this works.Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors (SSRPs)The only medical agent out there that's routinely available and directly seems to help thetemporal lobe are called the SSRls, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. The drugsthat come under this category are Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft. What these drugs do is, forthe first time, work on aspecificpathway in the brain. They block the reuptake of theserotonin released.If the serotonin released \"stays around longer / more effectively,\" part of the brain worksbetter. Prozac may also alter part of the \"neuro-immune\" axis, working to increase bloodflow and function in the temporal lobe. This increased blood flow and improved functionof the temporal lobes, helps many behavioral and processing problems in these \"autistic\"children. By helping restore and preserve temporal lobe function, one may be helpingmaintain a healthier brain. 10 413 Importantly, this is not an effort to control the children with medicine. A very small dose,usually 2-4 mg, is used with a four or five year old. If controlling a child's behavior wasthe goal, a dose of 10 - 20 mg would be used. Instead all that is needed to help function inthe brain is a very small (but consistent) dose.The purpose of using these drugs is an effort to get a child's brain to work better. In thepast, if you talked about an antidepressant you were thinking Valium, Librium,Phenobarbital, that's how you \"calmed\" someone down. That's not what you're doingwith Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to design drugs thatwill help the brain more physiologically than the agents out there did before. SSRI'srepresent the first of new \"designer\" drugs, with the capability of acting physiologicallywithin the brain.These drugscanhelp a child medically to function better. They help transmitter effect andlikely increase blood flow to the area of the brain that was not functioning properly before.And if the brain starts working, the results with these children can be phenomenal. Thesechildren are usually extremely bright. (Note: While capable of helping medically, thisauthor believes strongly that one cannot judge their positive effects, avoiding negativesat low dosages, without controlling / combining diet and other steps at the same time.)Immune Modulating AgentsThere are agents that have already been tested and developed, and are now undergoingnew usage's testing in adults that will let us adjust the immune system: Hopefully, theywill have the ability to fine tune the body and put the immune system back on track.These drugs are already in existence, but are available only through appropriate researchprotocols. They could potentially correct all of the processing problems associated withautism (and possibly other childhood learning disorders) where \"immune-mediated.\"The-trouble is, children are the last. in line. Even though trials are now starting for adults,no agency wants to test children. The liability is too much. It is only after you've proventhings extensively in adults that treatment for a child is even considered. If medicinefollows its usual course of action, trials for children would be at least another four or fiveyears away.That is too long to wait. We must find a way to make this happen sooner. Even if theagents are identified that will \"normalize\" function or stop abnormalities from occurring inautistic children, these agents must be used before children pass important functional anddevelopmental steps that might not be regained if these agents are administered later inlife. Funding for this research is of the utmost importance. We can not lose children toautism, who have the potential to lead a normal life.Even in older children, it appears parts of the brain can be helped significantly. Ifcognitive function improves, the \"equation\" for the future changes. But, educators,therapists must start thinking \"rehabilitation\" rather than just \"training.\" Often it isextremely slow and difficult to sort out compounding behavioral issues ( perhaps after somany years of being bright but frustrated and dysfunctional secondary to the non-working parts of the brain). 11 69-622 D-00--144:19 414 Vitamins - Nutritional Supplements - Natural TherapiesI do believe the B Vitamin mechanism is off in children with autism (again, secondary tomitochondria) / immune dysfunction, not the primary reason or cause): Perhaps this is thereason that large amounts of Super Nu Thera have not seemed to cause any measurabledamage. Perhaps a lot of the Super Nu Thera is not being absorbed, and the small amountbeing absorbed may be helping some children. Some neurologists are worried that if someof these children are absorbing too much it is not healthy. There needs to be controlledtrials to determine the correct dosage and real safety or dangers of this agent.I believe in the product, but I don't believe in blindly giving it to a child. Any agent(nutritional, natural, medical) must be judged on effect (good or bad) and long term safety.It dangerous to push a child's body to any extreme with mega-dosages of supplements.Common sense does not mean \"mega\" dosages of anything. More is not necessarilybetter.Since nutritional factors do not account for the cause of autism, as noted above, it isillogical, and in fact potentially detrimental, to push a child's body, to any extreme withmega-dosages of supplements.Gamma GlobulinYou don't in general cure someone afflicted with autism or C.NDS with IM gammaglobulin, but it may play a helpful \"supportive\" role. Gamma globulin does have its placefor various other acute autoimmune processes. Unfortunately, IV gamma globulin, is notthe same as IM. With IV gamma globulin, a human product of blood goes directly intothe veins, and must be prepared / processed differently than IM (Intramuscular). There isa danger of passing hepatitis and / or any number of unidentified retro-viruses with thistype of therapy. Presently we have no reliable screens for hepatitis C (some screeningbecoming possible), D, E, F, G. etc. If there is an allergic reaction in a child with low IgA,the possibility of either getting very sick or even dying is very real.This type of therapy has the potential to be very dangerous. Recently, in the Midwest (Ibelieved Minnesota and/or Michigan), there were 12 cases of hepatitis C contracted froma bad batch of IV gamma globulin. This and other risks are not justifiable with such a lowprobability of \"success\" with this agent.There are some people who will get a little better from IV gamma globulin, because onceagain a dysfunctional immune system is the culprit for these children's problems, and thisproduct can help the immune system. But the trouble is that it is not a sustained gain.Until newer immune-modulators are available for these children, a combined plan ofimproving the immune system, the body, and the brain, has a much higher probability ofsuccess. If you help the immune system, the body will work to repair itself.TherapyFocus - Goals - IssuesEven if we had that instantaneous answer to normalize the body, a child still needs to becaught up on what they missed and \"re-educated.\" In the past, the focus for autistic'children has been on trainability, cooperation, behavior, NOT on improving the cognitive 12 415 processing. Hopefully, a shift to the idea of \"rehabilitation\" is already in motion, a fullreview of techniques and goals is urgently needed.Sadly, medications or efforts to \"calm\" the brain and child down, may further shut downthe areas we want to improve. What is necessary to ask about every medical treatment ormedication is whether it results in a child who is brighter eyed, processes better, functionsquicker? Are there negatives associated with what has been prescribed?The hard part is often discriminating between what is behavioral and what is medical. Ifyou get a change where a child is more tuned in, processing better and literally gives theparents, or the teacher / therapist a \"bad\" time, that needs to be dealt with behaviorally,not medically.What I am continually seeing in these children is the better their brain works, the morethey act out like a two or three year old kid that never had the \"reins\" put on them. Ifthat's in the context of the brain working better, it's not a negative.Clinically, my experience has been to literally watch a young child (below 4 or 5) \"pick-up\" where their brain development ceased to function normally. They need to go throughthe same developmental steps all children do, but they are doing it at an older age. Theydevelopmentally act like a 2 year old child, but have the body and skill of a 4 or 5 yearold.An older child, can be helped significantly if cognitive function improves, but as notedabove, it is a longer rehabilitation process and catch up effort. Often it is extremely slowand difficult to sort out the compounding behavioral issues (perhaps this is due so manyyears of being bright but frustrated with their inability to communicate).It has now become common practice to hear a parent of a four or five year old tell methat their kid literally is doing things that they stopped doing at two. In these cases this isnot regression. It as though you literally turn the brain back on where it stopped at 1.8months or two years of age. This is what is expected and is fine as long as you get themthrough those stages and you help them catch up.As a child is functioning better and even when they are dysfunctional, they like any normalchild need praise, limits and consistency. The problem is that parents are dealing with achild with the physical ability to get into the trouble a five year old child would, butwithout the lines and limits parents would have set previously for a 2 or 3 year old child.(Note: All children go through normal testing phases, where they need to learn what isokay, what is not okay, etc.)There is a critical time limit for helping these autistic children. If a child does not developor use certain tracts in the brain, he may never do so. If the child has not used thesetracts in the temporal lobe you may never get them to develop \"fully.\" Usually, theyounger the children are when you start to \"normalize\" the body and the immune system,the better the prognosis will be. These kids are young brains, the longer they don't gethelp, the worse off they're going to be. However, the discussion of \"deadlines\" must betaken in context by our past (and generally present) inability to adequately measure andevaluate areas of brain function objectively. 13 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 416 There are some physicians who will argue that the body is still \"fixable\" at eight or nine,but realistically there is a line. It has been this physicians experience to note children up to5 or 6 will often \"turn-on\" and pick-up where they stopped, generally about 18 - 24months old. On the other hand, as children approximately 6 - 10 or 11 improve, it is aslower process, often requiring more \"help\" to \"learn\" the basics, grow-updevelopmentally, and then move ahead successfully.All of these observations reinforce the fact that we can not wait the normal cycle of 10 to20 years for medicine to find the answers for these children.. If we're going to maximizethe probability of success, we still must mobilize efforts to focus on \"realistic\"! probablemedical solutions available within I or 2 years, versus \"genetic\" therapies, perhapsavailable in 10 - 15 years.We must never underestimate the unknown, and the power of the body when dealing withthese children. An illustrative case is a physician's child who is now 10 years old. Thechild came to me literally wild, I mean the parents were that close to realizing they weregoing to have to institutionalize him. Currently, the boy is now up to a couple ofsentences. He is in school and is starting to learn. Although I can't say to these parentsthat I have the same top hope for a patient who is 9 or 10 that I may have for a 4 or 5 yearold, that doesn't mean there can't be a lot of improvement. This child NOW has a goodopportunity to develop skills. He certainly is showing he's bright and can learn. The Image of Autism and Its ImplicationsUnfortunately since doctors believed autism should be treated by psychologists andpsychiatrists there has been an absence of pediatricians in this field. it was and still isbelieved by noted neurologists that nothing can be done medically to treat these children.Fortunately, as these children are changing with therapy, respected neurologists and otherpediatric researchers, are beginning to feel it is time to \"take a second look.\"Psychologists and behavioralists, sometimes give parents advice based on the assumptionthat a child with autism is a retarded child who \"doesn't know any better\". While theadvice given is meant to help, these are often bright children that are not being expected toconform to or understand rules and limits. Because of these well-meaning professionals,these children often become a bigger problem behaviorally. Without proper discipline andexpectations by teachers and parents, any child will be a problem, these children will be adisaster.A overwhelming obstacle to changing the image for these children is the failure of toolsavailable to date to \"objectively\" evaluate CNS (Central Nervous System) functioning, inturn perpetuating the subjective screening tests and procedures currently used. To thisday, good researchers often take a position, if they can't measure it, it must not be real.Perhaps, it is far more appropriate to acknowledge there are areas of physiologic andmetabolic-function that we have not yet developed the tools or techniques to measure, butthat does not mean they should be discounted clinically / medically.As time goes on it becomes more evident by clinical confirmation and research that autismis an auto-immune disorder (see previous review article \"Autism and the Immune 14 'I J. I Connection\"). With this knowledge I have become extremely concerned that some of thepreviously used drug, metabolic, and psychological therapies that have had little or nohistory successfully treating this type of disorder in adults, are not likely to be successful inchildren. In fact, many may be potentially harmful.It is one thing to try a potentially dangerous therapy or one with many unknown orundesirable side effects on a brain-damaged or retarded child. It is quite different toexperiment or operate on children with dysfunctional, but potentially healthy, normalbrains.There is work being done by doctors with medicines and homeopathic therapies, that I amnot sure is safe for children. They are prescribing extreme diets and mega-doses ofsupplements. In part these doctors are.correct that metabolic processes in these childrenare not working properly. But I believe the evidence is mounting daily that they are asecondary result of a stressed / dysfunctional immune system, NOT the cause of autism.While some dietary restrictions and nutritional supplements may help to \"cool down\" theimmune system, more is not necessarily better. Often these remedies are given becausethey will \"do no harm.\" But harm is occurring by the failure to recognize and expeditepotential new therapies with immune modulators that could possibly help normalize theimmune systems of these kids. And harm is occurring when parents and physicians areusing potentially dangerous therapies and even operating on these children's brains withlittle probability of success.In contrast, the good news is that children afflicted with autism whose immune systemshave been helped are showing they are bright thinking individuals that are not what theworld expected. Children with the \"label\" of Autism / PDD are not retarded. They havenormal or above normal intelligence. They are not throw away kids that cannot be helped.They are children who are suffering from auto immune dysfunction that can possiblyrecover.But the label of autism still continues to carry old \"negative ideas, negative implications,\"and in turn lowers the urgency and priority to help these children. It is time to changethat label, that image, and the future for these children.It is this physician's hope that 1997 is the year of that change. Throughfocusing and combining efforts, this can happen; for the children's sake . .. .it must happen. MJG/eg1/97 15 418Mr. BURTON. Dr. Megson.Dr. MEGSON. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my name is Mary Megson. I am a board-certified pediatrician, fellow-ship-trained in child development, a member of the American Acad- emy of Pediatrics and on the clinical faculty at the Medical Collegeof Virginia.I have practiced pediatrics for 22 years, and the last 15 years, I have worked only with children with developmental disabilities, which include learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism. In 1978, as a resident at Boston Floating Hospital, I learned that the incidence of autismwas 1 in 10,000 children. Recent surveyshave suggested an incidence in several parts of the country of be- tween 1 in 300 and 1 in 600 children.Over the last 9 months, I have charts now in an office that I opened last June on 1,900 patients, well over 1,200 of whom have fullblown criteria for autism. I have 70 autistic children in a clini- cal trial and I am beginninga second clinical trial to look at treat-ment on these children.At the same time, the State Department of Education says there are only 1,522 children with the diagnosis of autism in the Stateof Virginia.Mental health and mental retardation agencies have scrambled to set up infant interventionprograms and have had a hard timekeeping up with the numbers of delayed infants and toddlers. I have served as an advisor for the city of Richmond and the sur- rounding counties as they set up these infant programs and also set up special education programs for children with autism. Now there are autistic classes in each county and several classes in sev- eral schools. There has beena very rapid rise over the last severalyears, The segment of children with \"regressive autism\"who de-velop normally and thenregress usually between 18 and 24monthshas increased dramatically. This past week, I was in- volved in four cases of children who were perfectly normal in their development until they had their school-age shots at age 5DPT, hepatitis vaccine, MMR. Within weeks, they were autistic. In the past, this was unheard of.In the vast majority ofcases, I have discovered that one parentor another reports night blindness or other rare disorders associ-ated with a defect in something called a G protein. G proteins are proteins inside the cell that join receptors that sit in the cell mem- brane. They are cellular proteins that upgrade or downgrade sig- nals in their sensory systems all over the body that regulate touch, taste, smell, hearing, and vision. They are important also in turn- ing on or off multiple metabolic pathways, including those for glu- cose, lipid, protein metabolism. They also turn on and off pathwaysfor cell growth differentiation and survival.Close to the age of autistic regression, we are adding a second defect to the G proteinnamely, pertussis toxinwhich completely disrupts these G protein pathways. The opposite G protein path- ways are on without the off switch.In my research, I have discovered that some children are pro- tected if they have the lipid-soluble form of Vitamin A, that's found in natural sources. Those children, especially those who are breast- 419fedget the early vaccines in spite of having the genetic defect anddo fine. However, the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine at 15 monthsof age depletes the body of all Vitamin A. When they get the DPTthe same day or several months later, many of these children dis- connect.There are several metabolic problems that I am seeing repeat- edly in these children. The pathway to break down the storage form of glucose in the body is on without opposition. These childrenhave elevated blood sugars. In the past week, I have been madeaware of four cases of autistic children who developed juvenileonset diabetes. There is a 68 percent incidence of diabetes in theparents or grandparents.Lipid breakdown is turned on without opposition. I have diag-nosed many 21/2-year-old children with autism who have serum cholesterol of 240 and above. There is an incidence in one of three of these families of heart attack of a parent or grandparent under age 55 and diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.Of great concern, cell growth, differentiation, and survival isturned on, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. In the first 60families I examined, there were 62 cases of malignancies associated with the RAS oncogene.I have also discovered that the measles antibody that the bodymakes, once they are exposed to the measles vaccine, cross-reactswith intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments are the glue that hold the cells that line the gut wall together, so when they get that MMR vaccine, they develop a leaky gut. Intermediate fila-ments are also important in areas of high stress. One of the areas of highest stress in the human body is the upper small intestine right below the stomach. They develop a chronic autoimmune dis- order at that point.The loss of the cell-to-cell connection also occurs in the blood- brain barrier and in the cells that surround the bite annicul: wheretoxins are excreted from the body. So any toxins that they are ex- posed to, leak through the gut wall, and they cannot pump them out of the body.The loss of cell-to-cell connection interrupts another process in the body which is very important called aproptosis, or the ability of neighborhooding cells to get rid of abnormal cells. The MMR vac- cine at 15 months precedes the DPT vaccine, which turns on un- controlled cell growth differentiation and survival.Most families have reported cancers in parents or grandparents. The genetic defect found in 30 to 50 percent of adult cancers is a cancer gene, the RAS oncogene. This is the same defect that is thedefect for congenital stationary night blindness.In Harrison's Textbook of Internal Medicine, which is the stand-ard textbook in medical schools 411 across this country, it is stated that it is absolutely contraindicated to give the MMR vaccine or a measles vaccine in the face of Vitamin A deficiency. I am afraid that some of these children are facing that vaccine when they are already deficient in their Vitamin A stores, and then they cannot reconnect pathways.Most of us in our current diets have the lipid-soluble form of Vi-tamin A taken out. This lipid-soluble form is found in liver, kidney,milk fat and cod liver oil. In lowfat milk products, however, it is 420taken out, and another, water-soluble form is added which they are unable to absorb.Mr. BURTON. Pardon me, Dr. Megson.You heard all those buzzers. That means that I have to run to the floor and vote or else I will be voted out of office, which I donot want to happen.Dr. MEGSON. OK.Mr. BURTON. So if you will please bear with me, I will get over there and vote and get back just as quickly as I possibly can, be- cause I am very interested in everything that you folks are saying,and I do want to get answers to a number of questions.We have two votes, and I will be back just as quickly as possible, so we will stand in recessthere are how many votesI think ev-erybody had better get a cup of coffee, because there are four votes. It is probably going to be half an hour before I get back. I apolo-gize.We stand in recess.[Recess.]Mr. BURTON. I really want to apologize to those of you who have been so patient today hearing all the debate. It must have been dif-ficult for you, but I am sure it has also been entertaining.Would you close the doors in the back after everyone comes in? OK. We left off with Dr. Megson in a very impassioned moment of her talk.Dr. MEGSON. Briefly, I was saying that in the vast majority ofthese children, I get a history from one parent or another of a dis- order associated with a defect in these major signalling proteins,the G proteins.As I approached my research, I looked through the eyes of these children and tried to figure out what their world was like. Now that I have talked with them and know what questions to askthese children, I understand how these G protein defects affecttheir perception.They have a severe loss of rod function in their eyes. There are four beautiful studies that have been published and out there forseveral years that show this. They are then left with cone function in which to see their world. Cones give us color and shape in our environment. The only situations I could imagine having only colorand shape to organize my world are those \"magic eye puzzles,\" where you look beyond and back up, and then you get a box of 3D. That is the only place in their visual field where they get a 3D im- pression of objects.Mr. BURTON. Everything else is flat?Dr. MEGSON. Correct.Only then, when they look at a box, like television or a computer, or a therapist who is sitting right in front of them, do they consist-ently hear the right words for what they are looking at. So that most of the day, they are not hearing the right words for what theyare looking at, because they only have one area of their visual fieldwhere they see 3D.I have treated some adults, and one adult I am treating in Ala- bama calls me every week and gives me the measurement of his \"box\" as it grows, and he gets better, which is really fun. 421The other areas of perception and sensory perception are con-trolled by G protein pathways as well, and adding a second defectto these children, who on a genetic basis probably have a first de-fect, changes multiple sensations. Their avoidance of eye contact isan attempt to have light land off -center in the retina, where theyhave some rod function. So when they look away from Mom, theyare actually looking at Mom. When we make them force their pu-pils directly in front of us, we are making them look away from us.With this form of natural Vitamin A treatment, within days, theylook right at you.The other things that happen in these childrensuddenly,Mom's touch starts to feel like sandpaper on their skin because ofmodulation of touch; common sounds sound like nails scraped ona blackboard. These are words that autistic children have given meas they have gotten better.We think these children cannot abstract, when actually, we aresinking them into the middle of an abstract painting at 18 monthsof age, and they are left trying to figure out if the language theyare hearing is connected to what they are looking at at the sametime.This defect for congenital stationary night blindness is on theshort arm of the X chromosome, which explains the male-to-femaleratio autism, and it affects cell membrane calcium channels thatDr. Goldberg just referred to in the hippocampus. These are theNMDA/glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. These pathwaysare where major pathways processing language cross from the leftside of the brain to the right. The pathways then go back throughthe hippocampus. The frontal lobe is where attention is added, ex-ecutive function, inhibition of impulse, and all social judgment.When stimulated, these NMDA receptors through their G pro-teins stimulate other receptors in the nucleus of the cell, rightthere at the hippocampus. These receptors were discovered by RonEvans in December 1998. In the animal model, when they areblocked, the mice are unable to learn or to remember changes intheir environment; they act like they have significant visual per-ceptual problems, and they have significant spatial learning defi-cits.Of great concern to me is that when the hepatitis B virus wasinitially isolated, the protein sequences were isolated and insertedinto the gene for one of these Vitamin A receptors, RAR beta. Thisis the critical receptor important for plasticity and retinoid signal-ing in the hippocampus in this area of major pathway intersection.We will have to look at the vaccine and see if there is any defectbeing produced by that related to the recent increase in autisticspectrum disorders.What I am treating these children with is the natural, lipid-solu-ble form of Vitamin A. I am giving them their recommended dailyallowance only of Vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil to bypassthese blocked G protein pathways and turn on these centralretinoid receptors.In a few days, a lot of these children look at me, focus, they re-gain eye contact, and they talk about their box of vision growing.After 2 months on this Vitamin A treatment, I give them a singledose of a medicine called bethanechol, which stimulates pathways -k.GGin the parasympathetic system in the gut. What I have discoveredis that there are nerve receptors in the gut called acetylcholine re- ceptors, or muscarinic receptors which are blocked in these chil-dren. This medication mimics acetylcholine. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier. I give it to these children in the office, andsometimes, 30 to 40 minutes after the initial dose, after havingpathways corrected for several months of Vitamin A, when I bringthem in and give them this medicine and observe them, they con- nect in the office. I have had children look at me, talk, act out, talkback to their mothers, and use vocabulary above their chronologicalage. This is a disconnect, and I have seen this again and again andagain. Bill Walsh in Chicago has seen it; Woody McAinnis in Ari-zona has seen this change.In one child I have treated beginning last April, her IQ score has gone up 105 points, from 60 to 165.This treatment improves cognition, but these children are still really physically ill. Their Vitamin A stores are depleted, often- times before and if not before, at the time of the MMR vaccine, andthey cannot compensate for these blocked pathways.Vitamin A has been called the anti-infective agent. It leavesthem immunosuppressed when they are depleted. They lack cell-mediated immunity. Adding a second defect to this GI alpha pro- tein blocks a very important pathway in the body where you con- vert retinol into something called 14-hydroxy retro-retinol. 14-HRRis needed to turn on T-cells.I give these children cod liver oilcold water fish oil is the onlynatural source of 14-HRR--and the children get well.The parasympathetic nervous system which is blocked in the gutis part of what I call the peripheral nervous system. We think ofthe nervous system as having two major parts. The central nervous system is the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral system is di-vided- into two parts. The sympathetic nervous system is your fight- or-flight responseeverything that happens to your body when you run away from dangeryou dilate your pupils, increase your heartrate, and increase your blood pressure. The parasympathetic sideof the peripheral nervous system allows us to sit back, relax, focus,and digest our food. We are blocking the parasympathetic side ofthe nervous system, and these children are in fright or flight all the time.I have asked someone to bring these panels out so you can look at these children and see their faces.I live in a small middle-class neighborhood with 23 houses. I re- cently counted 30 children who were on stimulants for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder. One week ago, my oldest son, who is gifted but dyslexic, had 12 neighborhood friends over for dinner. AsI looked around the table, all of these children but one had dilated pupils. After 21/2 months of taking his recommended daily allow-ance of Vitamin A and D in cod liver oil, my son announced: \"I canread now. The letters do not jump around the page anymore.\" Hecan focus, and his handwriting has improved dramatically.In a survey in his private high school for dyslexic students whoare bright enough to go to college, 68 out of 70 of those childrenreported night blindness. They see headlights like starbursts, andthey get a whiteout when their picture is taken. 423I think we are staring a national disaster in the face which isaffecting thousands of American children. The children with au-tism, ADD, dyslexia are lucky in a way, because they are identi-fied. There are many other children out there who are not identi-fied and who have just been disconnected.We must direct all of our resources and efforts to establish multi-disciplinary centers to treat these children. Insurance companiesshould pay for evaluations, both medical and psychiatric, and treat-ment.For over a year, I have been paying for speech therapy for thesechildren. They are able to talk, but they do not know what to dowith their mouths. I have had 10-year-olds wake up and talk. In-surance companies do not pay for rehabilitative services for thesechildren. These children are physically ill, immunosuppressed, have a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting multiple organ sys-tems. We must get funding to look at the etiology of autism andidentify these children prior to autistic regression and prevent thisdisorder. Implementing vaccine policies which are safe for all chil-dren should be our first priority.Mothers from all over the country have brought pictures of theirautistic children to Washington this weekend. Most of these chil-dren were born normal and lost to \"autistic regression.\" Look intotheir eyes, and you will hear their silence.Mr. BURTON. Thank you very much.

Over the last ten years I have watched the incidenceof autism skyrocket to 1 1300-11000 children) Over the last nine months, I have treatedover 1,200 children in my office. Ninety percent of these children are autistic and fromthe Richmond area alone, The State Department of Education reports that there are only1522 autistic students in the s,.. to of Viriinia.MILMR agencies have created local infant intervention programs, and have had ahard time keeping up with the numbers of delayed infants and toddlers. I have served asadvisor to the City of Richmond and the surrounding counties have established entireprograms for autistic children that fill multiple classes in several schools in each district.The segment of children with \"regressive autism,\" the form where children developnormally for a period of time then lose skills and sink :nto autism most commonly at 18-24 months of age, is increasing at a phenomenal rate. I am seeing multiplachildren in thesame family affected, including in the last week tour cases of \"autistic regression\"developing in four year old children after their MMR and DPT vaccination.

Studies need to be donto determine if this plays an additive roll in the marked increase in autism,I am using natural lipid soluble concentrated cis form of Vitamin A in cod liveroil to bypass blocked G protein pathways but, turn on these central retinoid receptors.

Thankyou.I am John Up ledger. Iam an osteopathic physician, and I thankyou for inviting me to come and present today.I should probably tellyou a little bit about my background first,because you will understand that I am coming at autism not in dis- agreement with anyone but by adding another parameter to it. First of all, I used to teach biochemistry, so the molecular things are not new to me. I practiced general medicine and surgery for about 11 years in Clearwater, FL and then got into the rather avant garde things, and they invited me up to Michigan State Uni- versity, where I becamea clinician researcher in the Departmentof Biomechanics.Being a researcher in biomechanics, I was researching a system which ultimately became called the craniosacral system. The craniosacral system is simply a semi-closed hydraulic system. The boundary of the hydraulic system is the dural membrane which en- cases the brain and spinal cord and provides sleeves for all of thecranial nerves and for the spinal nerve roots. The fluid inside it is cerebrospinal fluid, essentially. Of course, there is blood flowing and so on and so forth within vasculature, but it is not really part of the system. And it is called \"semi-closed\" because the inflow of the volume is controlled, and it is rhythmical, and the outflow is rather constant and reabsorbs the fluid; so you have a circulation of fluid with a rhythmical rise and fall of fluid volume and pressure within the system.If one looks at advancesas we go along, we used to think thatcerebrospinal fluid bathed the surface of the brain, and that is what it did. About 8 yearsago, it was very definitely shown usingradioactive tracers that cerebrospinal fluid is formed in the ventri- cles of the brain, and within seconds of its formation, it not only bathes the surface but it penetrates all the spaces between all the cells that form the brain; it also goes down the spinal cord inter- nally as well as externally.More recently, in a symposium called \"Neuroprotective Agents\" by the New York Academy of Science, I came across a piece that had just been discovered, that is, that cerebrospinal fluid not only circulates nutrients and carries away waste products, but it also has chelating agents in it, so it cleanses the brain of metallic de- posits, which would be the mercury, the aluminum and that kind of thing.So it is very important, and if you look at it this way, it is ex- tremely important, that cerebrospinal fluid flow be kept moving. Stagnation of cerebrospinal fluid is going to lead to brain dysfunc- tion.In my work at Michigan State in developing this department, de- veloping this whole system, what happened was that it was decided that I would be working with brain-dysfunctioning children to see the applications. Autism happened to be one of the things that I was assigned to, so ,for 3 years, I spent 2 days a week at the Genessee County Center for Autism, and I went in there not even understanding the first thing about what autism was. We did work with what was called hyperkinesis in those days, and we found out on a structural level that the hyperkinetic child could be relieved of his hyperkinetic activity if we released a corn- 431pression at the base of his skull between the first cervical vertebraand the occiputal base. Tracing this backward, this happens a lotduring delivery. The baby is face down, the obstetrician assists thebaby coming out under the pubic bone, the head comes base or for-ward, and the cervical vertebra goes that way, and they jam to-gether. You release that jamming, and you get rid of your hyper-kinesis in a matter of minutes many times.That is not the only cause for hyperkinesis, but when it is there,and you release it, it is very definitely going to show you clinicallythat it is over.We also found out that in newborns we could treat colic this way.When I got into looking at autistic behaviors, there were severalthings that we noticed, and being a novice, I was not about to ac-cept anybody's word for anything. I went over there with a neurophysiologist and another fellow who was a generalist inscience, a design specialist, and we started going every week,Thursday and Friday.Our observations showed first of all that a lot of the kids werebanging their heads. There were 28 kids in that first year we wentthere. I noticed their head-banging, and they were chewing on theirwrists; they would get all the way down to the tendons sometimes.We were also told they sucked on their thumbs, and I saw that, butthey were not making an airtight things with their lips; what theywere really doing was pushing up on the base of their skulls. So we thought about this a lot, and one would say, OK, they arebanging their heads, and this happened at a behavior modificationcenter that we were working at, so I had them take the helmetsoff, and we let them bang their heads and watched very carefully,and it looked like they were trying to knock something loose intheir heads, as if something was jammed together.When we started looking at their wrists and everything, Ithought, OK, maybe they are inducing a controlled pain for a painthey have in their head that is uncontrolled, because I think any-body here would agree that sometimes when something hurts, andyou just cannot get to it, you will give yourself a pain somewhere else, and it at least gives you some sense of comfort. And the otherthing that might be happening is when they are chewing, they areinducing endorphin production and getting that natural analgesia,because endorphins are like a natural morphine.The thumb-sucking clearly, to the point where it was causing theteeth to protrude forward over a period of time, the thumb-suckingclearly was an attempt to mobilize the base of their skull.Anatomicallyand now I am in biomechanics, so I am thinkinganatomically, and what I am doing a lot of on the other days offis getting very fresh cadavers, dissecting them, studying mem-branes and all of that kind of thing on the inside of the head, soI am tying these two things together. So we began to get the ideathat the cranial rhythm or the movement inside that head was notgiving the amplitude that we were looking for in other children.The autistic head just did not have the craniosacral rhythm, the ac-tivity, so it was not pumping cerebrospinal fluid.Hence, you would get an accumulation of toxic metals. You wouldalso get a deficit in the delivery of fluid carrying nutritional agentsand carrying away metabolic byproducts. You would also get a 432thing that we began to understand clearly, and this became the model we put forth after about. the second year, and that is that something occurred to denature the membrane biochemically so that it would not expand and accommodate the normal growth pat- tern of the skull as it was trying to expand in the brain and trying to grow. If the brain is trying to grow against the resistance of a membrane that is having difficulty expanding, you are going to cut down cerebrospinal fluid exchange and you are going to cut down blood flow.We finally got into it and started decompressing heads forward to backward in this directionforehead forward, back of the head backward. We would just sit there and hold it, a small forceover a long period of time, and ultimately, the head would begin to ex- pand in that direction. When it did, those things that looked like they were trying to create their own painthe thumb-sucking stopped, the head-banging stopped, and the wrist-chewing and that kind of thing stoppedthey stopped spontaneously after we re- leased that particular forward-to-backward compression. That was probablyvery close to 100 percent response. Now, you had to spend a lot of time to get an autistic kid to lie on a table in an autistic center and letyou work on them and have them bequiet, but after we saw them three or four times, they would actu- ally come in, lie downon the table, take your hands and placethem on their head where they wanted them. And I would go along with that.The next thing I wanted to do was expand the head side-to-side. I had a lot of graduate students with me all the time and did not know what to do with them,so I would put one student on each leg and one student on eacharm, and I would just start expandingthe head laterally. Well,we found out that after we got that expan- sion done laterally, first of all, the child would very, very much relax, and the body wouldgo into all kinds of contorted positionsand stay there. As they stayed in that contorted position,you could feel energetic changes goingon throughout their body, and whenthey finished that particular thing, they were very liable to turn around and kiss you and giveyou a hug. And after that, they be- came sociable.So what I am looking at isa model here that says, OK, decom-press these membranes. What caused the membranes not to ex- pand? And then, historically,we started looking at it. Febrile epi- sodes were extremelycommon. The fever could be due to a vaccinereaction, it could be due toa viral infection, it could be somethingin utero that occurred when Mom had a little fever when she was still pregnant. And it seemedas though it was taking about 2 to 3 weeks historically for most parents to discover the signs of the changes occurring which were later called \"autism\"after the feb- rile episode.So we chalked up the idea that most likely febrile episodes could cause a change in the biochemistry of the membrane so that it did not accommodate the growthprocess as readily as it could. Now, that does not fly in the face of genes at all, because I am sure that genes control some of the accommodative process of the dural mem- brane, and therefore, if they have a genetic predisposition to a membrane that is vulnerable, it takes a smaller shock to make the 433membrane become less accommodative. That does not bother me atall.We also foundafter I got this going, I was invited to London tostart an autistic treatment program for children in a craniosacraltherapy clinic, and again, in Brussels. And in London, I have to tellyou that I wound up evaluating children that I thought were autis- tic from a craniosacral evaluation perspectiveI wound up with 42children in that clinic, and I was there for about 4 days evaluatingthemand 38 of the parents out of the 42 said the febrile episodeswere subsequent to a vaccine. And most incriminatingand this would be in the late seventiesthe vaccine most incriminated bythe parents in their opinion was pertussis.When I went to Brussels, it was an entirely different thing. Thefeel of the head, the energy patterns in the head, everything wasdifferent. Almost all of the autistic kids I picked up there had beendelivered by vacuum extractionthat is where they put the suctioncup on the head and just pull. If you consider a plumber's tool, and you clamp it on the top of the head and pull, what you are going to do is extravasate a lot of capillary blood, and when blood breaksdown and deteriorates, it becomes bile in one of its stages, whichis extremely irritating, so the tissue that has these red blood cellsthat are deteriorating begins to contract and cause scarring andlose its accommodative ability. In Belgium, that was the maincause we came across.In this country, there is a great variation. At the autistic centerwhere I spent the first 3 years of my experience, I would have tosay that two-thirds of those kids were in foster homes, so we did not know much about their backgrounds. But when I finished thecontract for autism at the Genessee County Center in Flint, weopened a clinic at the university, and there, I have to say thatprobably 50 percent of the parents were totally convinced that theautism was secondary to a febrile episode which more often thannot, they related to a vaccine reaction. And I do not say that thatis yes or no, but I say it certainly does deserve a healthy look.Some of the things that I would like to share with you that wedidand it is interesting that Dr. Megson talked about parasympa-thetic, because one of the pieces of research we did on our autisticchildren was to monitor with a thermograph the hand as we werestretching the membranes in the head. And as we got some re-leases, the temperature of the hand would go up 2 or 3 degreesFahrenheit, which indicates that the blood vessels in the hand arerelaxing; you are getting better blood flow. And in order to get bet-ter blood flow, you have to reduce the activity level of the sympa-thetic nervous system which she was referring to, and that is theflight-or-fight system.So we were able to reduce their sympathetic activity by workingon their head and stretching their membranes. Now, the whole thing begins to make a lot of sense if you con-sider, then, the things that we were watching happen. If we got achild's membrane stretched in all directions, and he was feelingpretty good, he would take on a lot of good behaviors; and if wegot that to happen and thenour research was always held upfrom June until September when school was out, getting the con-tract renewed and all that kind of thing, so we had a lot of children439 434who did not receive treatment for 2 or 3 months, and they wouldregress. I look at it this waytheir head is trying to grow, andtheir brain is trying to grow, but they need a mechanical stretching activity which is craniosacral work to keep the membrane spread- ing enough so that it will accommodate that intended growth proc- ess. And if you do not have that for a while, then you begin to re- gress because the pressure on the brain and the reduction of fluidactivity, the reduction of blood flow, all begin to recur. So the next thing we try to doand we have done this success- fully I would say with 30 percent or so of our parent groups, and I did not have the opportunity to do it the way I would really like tobut we taught them to do this treatment process once a week and maybe see a therapistevery 6 weeks or so. That seemed towork if the parents were willing and able to learn how to do it. It is not hard once you get the initial job done; then it is a question of maintenance, which is not too difficult. And that is one of the things we look for.I left the university in 1983 and took time out to develop a proto- type for a holistic health center for Unity Churches, and then we started our own institute in 1985, at the end of 1985. Since that time, the way we handle the problems is, first of all, we do not al- ways focus on autism, because the kind of difficulties we have withthe craniosacral system can involve anything from autism to hyper- kinesis to chronic painseizure activity is a big one we work withand all those kinds of things, but about four times a year, we will have a special intensive program for just autistic children.That is what we do, and we try to help the parents learn how to work with it. And when I say \"intensive,\" it is a week, and it is from 10 a.m., until 6 p.m., and it is hands-on work almost all the time. During that week, we get things pretty well taken care of. And I do not think we have had a child yet who did not show at least 50 percent improvement during that period of time, and most of them do significantly better than that.That is about where I am.Mr. BURTON. Very good. That was a very good lecture. I enjoyed that, and we will have some questions about whether or not any of our health agencies have picked up on your procedures. Dr. UPLEDGER. Thank you.Mr. BURTON. Dr. Pratt.[The prepared statement of Dr. Up ledger follows:] 440 435 An Etiologic Model for Autism The following model was first formulated based upon hands-on experience with autistic children,historical information gained from their parents, observations of the children's behaviors, theirresponses to treatments, and our laboratory results. During the normal, physical growth period of the child's brain and cranium, it is necessary that themeningeal membranes that line the cranial vault and cover the surface of the brain grow and expandin synchrony with the growth of these structures in order to accommodate the natural maturationprocess. For some reason the meningeal membranes, especially the dura mater, lose theiraccommodative growth abilities, thereby disrupting the normal expansion of brain and cranial vault.This loss of accommodative quality of the dura mater is most likely due to biochemical changes inits make-up. These biochemical changes may be the result of febrile stressor episodes for anyreason, such as Viral infections, vaccine reactions and so on. The manual stretching of the restrictive dura mater by the use of CranioSacral Therapy techniqueshas provided impressive improvement in autism. The therapy must be continued until the child hasreached full growth, because once the dura mater has lost its accommodative ability, it must bephysically stretched by a therapist. CranioSacral Therapy accomplishes this task non-invasively byusing the various related bones to which the dura mater attaches as handles to stretch themembranes. 11211 Prosperity Farms Road, Suite 0-325, Palm' upledger@upledger.comInternational Affiliates: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Braid, Caribbean.

Up ledger, D.O., O.M.M.April, 2000 Background2 In the fall of 1976, as a clinician-researcher at Michigan State University (MSU), I began a study ofautism at the Genessee County Center for Autistic Children in Flint, Michigan. My co-investigatorsincluded Ernest Retzlaff, Ph.D. in neurophysiology, Jon Vredevoogd, M.F.A. associate professor ofdesign at MSU, and a wide array of graduate students in the MSU colleges of osteopathic andallopathic medicine, as well as a few in the department of psychology. Our research project lastedthree school years (September June). We worked onsite two days per week during these schoolyears. The center for autism was a day school and it was closed during the summer. Weconsistently averaged 28 to 30 autistic children in our program. About two-thirds of these childrenwere in this study for at least two of the three years. The grant support for the study was awarded on an annual basis. It is my understanding that themonies originated from NIMH and were funneled to me as principal investigator via the state ofMichigan and Genessee County. The funding ended at the end of the third year quite abruptly. Myunderstanding at that time was that the state chose to put the monies into other more pressingprojects. I was told by the Genessee County officials that autism was not the highest priority andthat the tax base in the state was not very stable. During these three years and subsequently, I saw private patients diagnosed as autistic coming froma variety of sources. These children were seen at the university clinic. After leaving MSU in 1983 I moved to Florida where, in 1985, we founded The Upledger Institute.During the interim, 1983 to 1985, I developed a prototype wholistic healthcare center for UnityChurch of Palm Beach. During this period with Unity Church I treated only a few autistic children.Shortly after The_Upledger Institute was begun we developed a one-week intensive treatmentprogram for autistic children, which is still in operation. It is offered three or four times each yearfor only autistic children. The program is a five-day week, with approximately six hours per day ofhands-on treatment. Parents are included and offered training in the treatment and management oftheir autistic children. 437 AutismObservations, Experiences and ConceptsJohn E. Up ledger, DD., O.M.M.April, 2000 Since the beginning of my work with autistic children, CranioSacral Therapy has been the maintherapeutic focus, coupled with nutritional supplements as they seem indicated. Observations Since my first experiences with autistic children I have made several observations that have beenconsistent and have influenced my concepts of etiology and therapeutic management. These observations are as follows: 1.Historically, the onset of autistic behaviors is often preceded by some sort of febrile episode.This febrile episode occurs most often about two weeks prior to the parent noticing behavioralchanges. However, the time between the fever and the onset of noticed symptoms may vary from afew days up to a few months. Certainly, the length of time reported is dependent upon the powersof observation by the parents, their level of denial and so on. The fever could be resultant to viralinfection, a vaccine reaction or any other cause. Our historical information comes from parentsinterviewed by me personally in the US, Canada, England and Belgium. In all of these places I tookhistories from parents. I also evaluated the children from a craniosacral system perspective. 2.Some of the behaviors observed in autistic'children are attempts to change/correctphysiological and/or anatomical dysfunctions that may be causing pain or discomfort. Manyautistic children are known to bang their heads, chew on their wrists and/or the bases of theirthumbs until deep tissue (tendon sheath) is visible, and/or they may suck on their thumbs sovigorously that the front upper teeth begin to displace forward. Actually, these thumb-suckingchildren are pressing on the roof of the mouth as hard as they can. We have observed that, when specific corrections of the craniosacral system are successfully carriedout, these behaviors spontaneously cease. It is my opinion that the head-banging child is trying to BEST COPY AVAILABLE 438, AutismObservations, Experiences and ConceptsJohn E. Upledger,O.M.M.April, 2000 release a compressive force in the head that is quite painful. When we release this compression,head banging stops. This compression is from the front to the back of the head. Regarding the chewing on the wrist and thumb base, there are three theoretical possibilities thatmay be valid: First, this self-mutilating activity may be a substitution of a controlled pain thatoverrides and is more acceptable than a head pain that is not controllable. Second, the self-mutilation may also serve to stimulate the synthesis and release of the natural pain.relievers(endorphins) that are nature's way of offering relief from pain biochemically. Also, there is a gatetheory of pain developed by Melzack and Wall that suggests that, when the quantity of painimpulses coming into the brain exceeds an upper threshold, all impulses are blocked from entry intopain-perception centers in the brain. The autistic child may have found that when he/she inflictsmore and more injury/pain upon himself/herself, the pain is no longer present. I have seen consistently that, when we are able to release reactions of the membranous lining of thefloor of the cranial vault in a front to back direction, these \"autistic\" behaviors (listed above)disappear \"spontaneously.\" 3.It was consistently observed that CranioSacral Therapy directed at alleviation of abnormaltransverse (side to side) compression of the cranial vault resulted in the child immediatelydemonstrating love and affection. The child will often hug and kiss the therapist after thecompression has been released. Subsequently, improved socialization is often demonstrated byshowing love and affection to parents and caretakers, as well as beginning to interact with otherchildren and adults, whereas previously their interactions were with inanimate objects.Additionally, during the CranioSacral Therapy session the child often releases a lot of emotion. 4.Thennogiaphic monitoring of the autistic child's hand during successful but basicCranioSacral Therapy sessions demonstrates hand warming, often as much as 2 to 3 degreesFarenheit. This offers evidence of increased blood flow to the hand resultant to the CranioSacralTherapy that is applied to the head. The increased blood flow is necessarily related to relaxation of 439 AutismObservations, Experiences and ConceptsJohn E. Up ledger, D.O., O.M.M.April, 2000 the autonomic (sympathetic) nerve control of the blood vessels. This sympathetic nervous systemrelaxation results in a reduction of internal physiological and emotional stress factors. 5.It has been noted that most autistic children are very shallow breathers. While working atthe Genessee County Center for Autism, I had the children breath 10% carbon dioxide in 90%oxygen for about five minutes in the morning, five days per week. This seemed to enhance thebreathing activity for an extended period of time after the five-minute session was completed. 6.Hair analysis for toxic minerals was done on all children in the Genessee County study. Wecould see no consistent patterns of abnormality in mineral levels in the hair of the children. 7.Extensive blood analysis was done on all children in the Genessee County study. Thisanalysis included standard blood-cell counts, routine blood-chemistry studies, isoenzyme studies,and protein electrophoresis studies. No consistent patterns of abnormality were seen. 8.Ultimately, all of our examinations consistently revealed that the intracranial membraneswere very tight. Our findings suggested that for some reason the meningeal intracranialmembranes, especially the dura mater that is very tough and waterproof, were not expanding alongwith the normal growth of the skull bones and the brain. I tested this concept by examining 63children who had been rated as either autistic or childhood schizophrenic by Dr. Bernard Rimlandwho directed the Child Behavioral Research Center in San Diego. I had seen none of thesechildren, nor their records, previously. I was able to pick out the autistic children from the samplewith over 90% accuracy simply by manually evaluating each child's craniosacral system. 9.Favorable responses to CranioSacral Therapy were often lost when there was no treatmentfor three or four months. This suggests the lack of growth of the dura mater while the skull andbrain grow as a contributing cause for autism. 44S 440 AutiirnObservations, Experiences and ConceptsJohn E. Up ledger, D.O., O.M.M.April, 2000 Suggested Conclusions The aforementioned observations, coupled with the observed clinical responses to CranioSacralTherapy, suggest that compromise of the accommodative quality of the intracranial meningealsystem, especially the dura mater, to growth of the skull and brain is at the very least a largecontributor to the problems of the autistic child. The dura mater can be stretched by the use ofCranioSacral manual techniques applied to the external surface of the cranium. This work affordssome relief from the membranous restriction imposed upon brain and skull bones. The treatmentmust be continued regularly because the accommodative enlargement of the membranecompartment is quickly used up as the child and his/her brain and skull continue to grow. The Treatment The treatment that I suggest is regular CranioSacral Therapy until the child is fully grown. Thistreatment is best administered on a weekly basis. However, it can be administered at longerintervals if close watch is kept for signs of regression. When these signs do appear, treatmentshould be resumed. If signs of regression appear, it may take up to five or ten sessions to re-establish the accommodations for brain and skull growth by the dura mater membrane. On aweekly basis, one treatment is usually enough to maintain favorable growth conditions.6 It is also suggested that nutritional supplements be given in order to ensure the restoration of vitalityof a brain that has been compressed for a significant amount of time. Among the suggestednutrients are B complex, B12, docosahexaenoic acid (Neuromins), alpha lipoic acid, and a goodmultivitamin and mineral preparation. We have had some success in teaching parents to treat their autistic children using CranioSacralTherapy. This offers them some degree of independence from geographical location requirementsnear CranioSacral Therapists. If the child shows reasonable progress using parental treatment, wesuggest re-evaluation by a skilled CranioSacral Therapist about every six months. 441Ms. PRATT. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity topresent testimony today concerning autism treatment options andresearch. I am here today kind of in multiple roles, first as directorof the Indiana Resource Center for Autism, located at Indiana Uni-versity's Indiana Institute on Disability and Community, and as aboard member of the Autism Society of America.I would like to commend you and thank you for holding thishearing. I think that for too many years, the voices of some of thechildren you see on the posters have not been heard; this givesthem a wonderful opportunity to be heard.While I have your attention, I would encourage you to do twothings. One is to continue funding the Centers for Disease Preven-tion and Control in terms of looking at the incidence and preva-lence of autism. As I was working with your office on providing tes-timony for today, it is clear that we do not have a true idea of theincidence and prevalence of autism across the United States.The other thing that I would encourage you to do is to work withyour colleagues on supporting H.R. 3301, which is the omnibuschildren's health bill, which would provide clear direction to theCDC and the National Institutes of Health.I am probably the oddity on this panel. I am not a physician. Ispend a lot of time in classrooms and in homes and around theState of Indiana, visiting children and their families and their edu-cators and other professionals who support them. And while I knowthat there is broad disagreement about whether there really is anincreasing incidence of autism, I know that we are incredibly busy.I know that I hear from professionals out in the field and fromfamily members that they truly are seeing many more childrenthan they ever saw in the past. So I have to listen to their words.In terms of the potential causes of autism, I hope you realizethat autism is referred to as a \"spectrum disorder,\" and along withthat, that probably reflects the idea that there is a spectrum of rea-sons why children do develop the characteristics associated withautism and that each of the professionals and family members whoare here today are painting just a piece of that picture for you. Iwould really encourage you to propose legislation and funding thatwill look at the possible multiple causes of autism, and along withthe vaccination issue, the issues around environmental situationsand other issues which parents keep reporting as being possibly re-lated to the occurrence of autism.I have never heard from any of the families an issue aboutwhether they want to vaccinate their children or not. I think theissue is in terms of safe vaccinations. As a professional in the Stateof Indiana, I know there is broad disagreement about whetherthere is a link between autism and vaccinations.As a professional who works with families every day, here is myposition. If I could have helped those four families who are heretoday to avoid having a child diagnosed with autism by givingthem accurate information, I would have done so in a heartbeat re-gardless of what the research tells us. I think that is the issue thatall of us face, that when the research may not be proving it, whenwe hear the stories, we want to avoid further stories being told.In addition to looking at the research behind causes, I would alsoencourage us not to forget about the 500,000 other individuals and44'7 442their families who currently have a diagnosis of autism and the needs that they have. The families and several of the paneliststoday have talked about some of those needs.The first one is in terms of early intervention. I really applaudthe National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes ofHealth for starting to look at the essential components of earlyintervention programs that are most effective. I think we have fo- cused a lot of effort on looking at specific programs, and while there is some broad disagreement about which of those specific pro- grams is most effective, I think there is some general agreementarising about the components of those programs, and I hope that those things will really be looked at.Based on the testimony that I have heard during the NationalAcademy of Sciences meetings, it is very clear that additional re- search is needed to try to really build a case for the various compo- nents of effective programming.The next issue that I would like to cover is full funding for IDEA and the professional development efforts. In a recent report, it was noted that 44 out of 50 States are not in compliance with the \"freeand appropriate education\" mandate of the Individuals with Dis-abilities Education Act. While those reasons may differ from State to State, I believe part of the reason is due to funding.In addition to that, there is a tremendous need for trained pro- fessionals in the field. Sometimes, professionals are placed in the role of supporting challenging individuals, and they do not receiveany training or guidance or assistance in being able to do so. SoI would really encourage that we look at providing funding supportto States for continued professional development.In addition to that, you have heard from many of the parents about the need for accurate information to pediatricians and otherphysicians who play a critical role. They are oftentimes the firstpeople that parents talk to when they think their children may have a diagnosis of autism. The information that they can provide to families can help to set them on either the right track or the wrong track. So I really encourage education for them.Another issue that I hear a lot from families is in terms of insur-ance coverage and funding sources. In my written testimony, I pro-vide the example of a family in Indiana that was denied coverage for their child's appendectomy because he had a diagnosis of au- tism. Autism is considered a pre-existing condition by some insur- ance companies, so these children are excluded from insurance cov-erage.I hope you realize the tremendous accommodations that the fami-lies that you saw today have had to make to be here today, andin their lives on a daily basis. The tremendous financial devasta-tion that many of them face, the stresses on their marriagesand I am so glad to see that many of them are here, fathers and moth- ers togetherthe stress on their entire lives is just unbelievable.You know first-hand as a grandparent how tremendous the stresscan be.I also need to tell you that your support is greatly appreciatedby the autism community. Your support is even more greatly ap- preciated by your daughter today. 443I also hope you realize that when insurance companies turn fam-ilies away, they look to other funding sources, whether State orlocal agencies, and in many cases, that money, that funding, isnonexistent or is inadequate for the family support needs. Familiesare told that they have a window of opportunity for their children,and at that point, they have run to get those services and supportsthat they need; and when they are denied the funding they needto be able to provide those services, they will do anything and risktremendous devastation to be able to reach those goals.A population that I hope we will not forget is the adults whohave autism. We have a high percentage of individuals who remainunemployed, who are very competent, talented individuals with au-tism; others who are underemployed or in jobs which really do notmatch their talents and skills and interests.In addition, many of them choose living options that are only afar-off dreamto live in a community, to have access to the samerights and privileges as every other citizen of the United States.While progress has been made in this area, much is still left to do.While I commend the committee for taking this opportunity tolisten to families today, I also urge you to support authorizing leg-islation and appropriation provisions that will further the state ofautism research. While much progress has been made, rememberthat there is still much to do.Thank you.Mr. BURTON.

Second, join 41 of your Colleagues in co-sponsoring H.R. 3301, anomnibus children's health bill that provides clear direction to the CDC and the National Institutesof Health for speeding up the research and public education in autism.The increasing incidence of autism has generated a renewed and much needed focus on autismspectrum disorders. As the incidence increases, research into both the causes and effectivetreatment options becomes paramount. Across the United States, families are struggling with themany challenges presented by a family member with autism and the systems which are needed tosupport him/her. Below are a few comments which reflect major issues often heard. Thesemajor issues include, research into potential causes, early intervention, insurancecoverage/funding mechanisms, adult options, and trained professionals,Research into Potential Causes. Autism is referred to as a spectrum disorder to highlight thedifferences among a population who share a common diagnostic label. Just as these individualsdiffer in their characteristics, so may they differ in the causes of their autism. It seems clear thatautism is a genetic disorder. Children are born with a genetic predisposition for developing thecharacteristics of autism. At some point prior to, during or after the birth process, somethingoccurs that triggers autism to occur. Potential triggers include environmental factors, illness,complications during the birth process, or factors related to diminished immune systems. One ofthe triggers that is being considered and discussed by families is the measles-mumps-rubella(MMR) vaccination. While this is not a statement in support of eliminating vaccinations, it is aplea for examining this potential relationship and for developing ways in which to more safelyvaccinate children. The hope in examining potential causes is two-fold. First, the idea is that ifthe cause can be found, a cure will soon follow. While finding a cure may be in the distantfuture, research into potential causes can have a more immediate impact. If causes are found,such as the MMR vaccination, that can be dealt with immediately, we may be able to preventnumerous families and children from being affected by autism. However, I encourage thecommittee to support research which will look broadly at potential causes. At the same, time, I would like to speak to the federal framework of support for those 500,000individuals currently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders and their families. Theseindividuals and their families can benefit dramatically from early intervention, special education,and adult services. Yet, there are many barriers to their ability to secure such supports. 446 Early Intervention. The National Academies of Science and the National Institute on Health are to be applauded for their efforts in examining the status of research related to educating youngchildren with autism spectrum disorders. While there is generally professional agreementregarding essential features of intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders, there is less agreement regarding the \"best\" specific program. The hope is to be able to identifytreatment approaches which will have the greatest long term impact and which are responsive to the core deficits of autism spectrum disorders. Based on testimony provided by leadingprofessionals to the National Academies of Science, it is clear that additional research is needed to determine critical features of programs.Full Funding for IDEA and Professional Development Efforts. In a recent report, it was noted that 44 out of 50 states are not in compliance with the \"free and appropriate education\"mandate of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While the reasons for this situation may differ in each state, we do know that states need financial support when mandated to provide services. While IDEA authorizes funding for personnel development, the funding allocated is notsufficient to meet the need. As the incidence of autism grows, we are encountering a stark gapbetween the demand for trained personnel and the availability of teachers and medicalprofessionals who have had training in how to identify and respond to individuals with autism. In some cases, professionals with little or no training are taking primary responsibility for theeducation of children who challenge the most trained professional. Across the country, familiescry out for training of pediatricians and other medical personnel. Physicians are often the firstsource of information for families whose children are newly diagnosed. They have a tremendous responsibility for starting parents on the right track. In order to do so, physicians must havemore and better information related to diagnosis and treatment.Insurance Coverage/Funding Sources. When faced with the high cost of interventions,therapies, medications and other necessary support services, families look to state and localagencies for financial resources, and/or to their insurance companies. Often times individualswith autism spectrum disorders are not eligible for insurance coverage. For example, oneindividual was ineligible for insurance coverage for an appendectomy because autism wasconsidered a pre-existing condition. In other words, even though a physical illness is completely unrelated to autism or its behavioral manifestations, sometimes individuals with autism are denied coverage. This policy is based on a very distorted understanding of what autism spectrum disorders are and how they affect a person's physical health. When faced with the high costs ofmedical care, therapies, medications, and other treatment approaches and interventions, many find themselves mortgaging their homes to ensure that their child has the best possible care. Thefinancial and emotional toll on the entire family is enormous. Families then turn to other state and local agencies for financial support. These resources are scarce, and in some states non-existent. Families are told that they have a window of opportunity in which to intervene with their child. When resources and services are not available during this critical time period, families are willing to risk financial devastation. The end result is tremendous stress on theirmarriages, and intense levels of personal stress in coping with their child's autism. And again, this impact is felt by the entire family, including siblings and grandparents. 452 447 Employment and Supported Living. Today, a high percentage of individuals across the autismspectrum remain unemployed. When employed, they are often either under employed or in jobswhich do not match their talents. Some of our most talented individuals face a life of poverty.For others, living options which allow them to reside in their community and receive neededsupport is only a dream. While progress has been made in this arena, much is still left to do.ConclusionWhile I commend the Committee for taking this opportunity to listen to families today, I alsourge you to support authorizing legislation and appropriations provisions that would further thestate of autism research. Support Congressional efforts to fully fund IDEA, providing thesupports and services that students with autism need, including adequate training for educationpersonnel. We need better training for medical professionals, more opportunities foremployment and supported living, and access to health care coverage. While much progress hasbeen made, there is still much to do. 448Dr. HIRTZ. Mr. Chairman, Iam Deborah Hirtz of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], at the Na- tional Institutes of Health.I have been asked to appear before you today to give the commit- tee and the families of autistic individuals who are here a sense of what we have learned from research, what we hope to achieve, and I want to explain that we at the NIH share the sense of urgency that autistic individuals and their families and advocates feel withregard to unlocking the mysteries of this devastating disorder.As a physician who takes care of children with neurological dis-orders including autism, this urgency has a particular intensity for me as well. By presenting information about a broad array of NIHautism research activities, I will try to convey to you the strong commitment of the NIH to increasing our knowledge about autism,what causes it, how best to diagnose and treat it, and we hope not too far in the future, perhaps even how to prevent it.I would also like to tell you that over the last 5 years, the total NIH funding for autism research has nearly quadrupled. It was $10.5 million in fiscalyear 1995 and $40 million in fiscal year1999.We now know that autism is much more common than we pre- viously thought. Estimates vary widely, but recent studies suggest that as many as 1 in 500 people may be affected by some form of autism. Recent reports suggest that the number of children withautism may be increasing substantially. It is not clear whether thereported increases can be accounted for by improved or expanded diagnosis, or by the increasing availability of services for autismand it would be necessary to study the trends of that prevalenceover time.The NIH recognizes the pressing need to look into these issuesand to do this work and is actively working to design studies that can give us knowledge in these areas. Accurate and consistent di-agnosis of autism is one of these difficult areas. To address this problem and in response to the requests of concerned parents, the NIH sponsored a 1998 meeting of major medical and professionalsocieties, parent advocacy groups and Federal agencies to reviewexisting evidence for autism screening and diagnosis. Based on the assembled research and evidence, a consensus statement is near completion as a practice parameter, which is a professional guide- line for recommended procedures, criteria and timing for screening and diagnosis in autism. This will be the first time that such a multidisciplinary group has reached consensus on screening and di- agnostic procedures in the area of autism. The specific practice pa- rameters or clinical recommendations, once approved, which we ex- pect to be shortly, by the boards of various relevant professional so- cieties, will be published in widely read medical journals.In the vast majority of cases, no specific underlying cause of au- tism can be identified. A variety of genetic, metabolic, infectiousand unknown factors may be important. The NIH supports re- search directed at exploring the possible role of these various fac-tors and is exploring the feasibility of a very large, multi-agency, prospective study that could shed light on some of these questions.A working group convened by NIH in 1995 reached a consensus that for at least a significant subgroup of people with autism, there 449appears to be a genetic susceptibility that most likely involves mul-tiple genes, and the NIH has conducted two major meetings on thegenetics of autism.An exciting development this past year has been the identifica-tion of the gene for Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder.In addition, genetic \"hot spots,\" potential chromosomal locations,for more classic forms of autism have been identified. In anotherarea, NIH is supporting a major pediatric brain imaging initiativeto learn how the brain develops in normal infants, children andadolescents. This will provide important data for comparison instudies of developmental disorders such as autism.Although there is currently no known cure or treatment whichcan reverse all the symptoms of autism, interventions designed toalleviate specific symptoms are available. In November 1999, theNIH held a workshop in conjunction with the Department of Edu-cation on treatments for people with autism and other pervasivedevelopmental disorders. The purpose of this workshop was toevaluate the current biological, behavioral, psychopharmacologicaland biomedical treatments in autism and to identify critical re-search needs in autism treatment. The written reports and rec-ommendations from the working groups at this meeting have re-cently been assembled and are currently being reviewed by themembers of the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee, which is agroup from various institutes involved that coordinates the NIH re-search activities, and also by the representatives of autism advo-cacy groups to see where we go from here in pursuing various ave-nues of treatment research.I have just very briefly described some of the NIH autism re-search activities. There are several more presented in my writtentestimony.I would like to add that autism research is a major priority forthe NIH, and we are committed to continuing to work to expandour efforts.I have tried to stick as closely as I could to the 5-minute limit,Mr. Chairman, so that concludes my prepared statement, but Iwould be pleased to respond to any questions you might have.Mr. BURTON. And your full statement will appear in the record.Dr. Cook[The prepared statement of Dr. Hirtz follows:] 455 450 TESTIMONY OF DEBORAH G. HIRTZ, M.D.NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKENATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON GOVEFINMENT REFORMU.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OVERSIGHT HEARING ENTITLED\"THE CHALLENGES OF AUTISM - WHY THE INCREASED RATES?\" APRIL 6, 2000 451 Mr. Chairman, I am Dr. Deborah Hirtz of the National Institute of Neurological Disordersand Stroke (HINDS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I have been asked toappear before you today to give the Committee and the families of individuals withautism a sense of the NIH's ongoing and planned research and other activities related toautism. As a representative of the NIH, and more directly, of the member institutes of theNIH Autism Coordinating Committee, I want to explain that we share the sense ofurgency that individuals with autism and their families and advocates feel with regard tounlocking the mysteries of this devastating disorder. I will try to convey to you thestrong commitment of the NIH to increasing our knowledge about autism - what causesit, how best to diagnose and treat it, and we hope not too far in the future, perhaps evenhow to prevent this dread disorder. CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTISMAutism is a complex, life-long, developmental disability that results in difficulty withsocial interactions, problems in communication, and restrictive or repetitive interests andbehaviors. There is considerable variability in the severity of the symptoms, andintellectual function can range from profound mental retardation to above averageperformance on IQ tests. Epilepsy also occurs in about 30 percent of individuals withautism. Approximately 20 percent of children with autism reportedly experience a\"regression:- that is, they have apparently normal early development, but then lose theirability to communicate and lose their social skills. usually sometime in the second year oflife. Boys are three-to-four times more likely to be affected by autism than girls. Autismoccurs in all racial, ethnic, and social groups. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 452 NIH AUTISM COORDINATING COMMITTEEI would like to briefly discuss the role of the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee(NIH/ACC). The NIH/ACC was established in response to a 1996 Congressional requestthat NTH establish a mechanism to coordinate its autism research activities and assure themost effective use of its resources. Its members include the Directors of the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH), the National Institute on Deafness and Other CommunicationDisorders (NIDCD), and the NINDS, as well as the program staff who manage the autismresearch portfolios of these institutes. The committee was recently expanded to includeadvisory representatives from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(N1EHS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and theNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).Representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Department of Education have also been invited toparticipate in specific topic-focused meetings of the NIH/ACC. The full committeemeets at least three times a year to coincide with meetings of the Institutes' nationaladvisory councils, and meets annually with representatives of autism research advocacyorganizations. NIH AUTISM RESEARCHNIH supports research on brain anatomy and development, language impairment, co-morbid conditions such as epilepsy, mechanisms of attention, and behavioral BEST COPY AVAILARI F 43 interventions in autism, as well as research on possible genetic causes and mechanisms.Over the last five years, the total NIH funding for autism research' has nearlyquadrupledfrom $10.5 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $40 million in Fiscal Year 1999.In FY 2000, it is estimated that NIH autism funding will increase to $45.5 million. INCIDENCE AND-PREVALENCEUnfortunately, we do not have a definitive answer to the question of what the trueincidence of autism is. Estimates vary widely, but recent studies suggest that as many asone in 500 persons may be affected by some form of autism. Recent reports suggest thatthe incidence of autism may be substantially increasing. It is not clear that the reportedincreases can be accounted for by improved or expanded diagnosis, or by the increasingavailability of educational and other support services, although these are surely factors.Appropriate large-scale studies, though time-intensive and expensive, must be done inorder to develop definitive estimates of incidence. NIP( recognizes the pressing need todo the work that will give us essential knowledge of the true prevalence of autism and thetrends of that prevalence over time, and is actively working with the CDC to designstudies that cotad yield this knowledge. SCREENING AND DIAGNOSISAccurate and consistent early diagnosis of autism is difficult. To address this problemand in response to the requests of concerned parents, the NIH ACC institutes, workingwith theAmerican Academy of Neurology, sponsored a 1998 conference on the State ofthe Science in Autism: Screening and Diagnosis. The conference included 4. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 454 representatives of 12 major medical and other professional academies and societies, sixparent advocacy groups, and representatives of the CDC and U.S: Department ofEducation. Attendees reviewed the existing research evidence for autism screening anddiagnosis criteria. Current evidence suggests that symptoms of autism are measurable by18 months of age, and autism can be reliably diagnosed by or before age three. Parentsand expert clinicians can often detect symptoms during infancy, although a formaldiagnosis is generally not made until the child fails to develop functional language by agetwo or later. Research is seeking to determine whether studies of home videoobservations of subtle motor and social behaviors may lead to behavioral diagnosis in thefirst year.This research review became the evidence base for a subsequent meeting in January1999, sponsored by the Child Neurology Society and the American Academy ofNeurology. Based on the assembled research evidence, a consensus statement is beingdeveloped as a practice parameter, which is a professional guideline for recommendedprocedures, criteria, and timing for screening and diagnosis in autism. This will be thefirst time that such a multidisciplinary group has reached consensus on screening anddiagnostic procedures in autism. A summary of the literature review was published in aspecial issue on diagnosis in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders(JDD), Vol. 29, (6). 1999, pp. 439-484). The specific practice parameter or clinicalrecommendations, once approved by the Boards of the professional societies, will bepublished in Neurology, and the Journal glrhild and Adolescent Psychiatry, and are alsoexpected- to be published in each of the other professional journals representing medicalor professional specialties that participated in the meetings. In endorsing these clinical 5 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 455 guidelines, each of the participating organizations officially adopts theserecommendations as the standard for autism screening and diagnosis. CAUSESAutism is not a disease, but rather a disorder in which there may be a number of differentcausal pathways. In the vast majority of cases, no specific underlying cause of autismcan be identified. A variety of genetic, metabolic, infectious, and environmental factorsmay be important. A working group convened by NM in 1995 reached a consensus that,for at least a significant subgroup of persons with autism, there appears to be a genetic susceptibility that most likely involves multiple genes), and NTH has conducted two major meetings on the genetics of autism. To date, genetic causes for Fragile X, the most common genetically inherited form of mental retardation that in some children produces many of the same behaviors and symptoms as autism, and the gene for Rett Syndrome, anautism-spectrum disorder, have been identified. In addition, genetic \"hotspots,\" that is,potential chromosomal locations, for more classic forms of autism have been identified.NINDS, NICHD and NI.MH are supporting a major pediatric brain imaging initiative to learn how the brain develops in normal infants. children, and adolescents which willprovide potential control data for studies of developmental disorders such as autism. A data sharing plan will be implemented to make this resource available to the medical andresearch communities. However, much remains to be done. This includes more research into molecular genetics. normal immune system development. and the \"regression\" that occurs iti some cases of autism. The NICHD- and NIDCD-funded network ofCollaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism, in collaboration with CDC, is planning 6. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 456 to launch a study of persons diagnosed with autism who regressed after apparentlynormal development, as well as matched comparison groups, which should yield valuableinsights into potential risk factors and causes of autism. TREATMENTAlthough there is currently no known cure, nor treatment which can reverse all thesymptoms of autism, interventions designed to alleviate specific symptoms are available.The best-studied therapies include educational, behavioral, and pharmacologicalinterventions, and many children who receive intensive, individualized, behavioralinterventions show progress in social and language skills.In November 1999, NIH held a workshop in conjunction with the Department ofEducation on \"Treatments for People with Autism and Other Pervasive DevelopmentalDisorders: Research Perspectives\" to evaluate the current biological, behavioral,psychopharmacological, and biomedical treatments in autism, and to identify criticalresearch needs in autism treatment. The written reports and recommendations from theworking groups at this meeting have only recently been assembled, and are currentlybeing reviewed by the members of the NIH/ACC and representatives of autism advocacygroups to consider the next steps for incorporating these into the NIH autism researchagenda.Six rapid-turnaround, multi-site, double blind, placebo-controlled studies the NICHD- and NIDCD-funded Collaborative Programs ofExcellence in Autism. The results of one study have already been published in the NewEngland Journal of Medicine, and the others arc expected to be completed and published 7. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 457 in the near future. In addition, NIMH-supported Research Units in Pediatric Psycho-pharinacology are conducting studies of risperidone, a drug which is used to treat autism. CONCLUSIONThe NIH/ACC institutes have conducted or supported a number of other activities related to autism research:Issuing a joint Program Announcement to solicit and encourage grant applications forresearch designed to increase our knowledge of the diagnosis, epidemiology, causes,genetics, and treatment of autism and autism spectrum disorders;Developing an overall autism information dissemination plan by the NIWACC publicinformation officers, with input from the national autism parent organizations, toreach broader parent and health professional audiences, particularly with regard toresearch validated procedures for autism early screening and diagnosis;Conducting a workshop entitled \"Building Animal Models for Autism ThroughTranslational Neuroscience Research;\"Supporting the creation of the Autism Tissue Program and its outreach activitiestinder the auspices of the National Alliance for Autism Research and the AutismSociety of America, and supporting inclusion of autism materials by other NIH-funded brain and tissue Banks a:ross the country;Initiating the planning of a pilot study for a large-scale. longitudinal, multi-agency,multi-institute, prospective, population-based study to establish or rule out causallinksbetween a variety of environmental events and normal or abnormaldevelopment, including autism. If supported, this would he the largest prospective 3. BEST COPYAVAILABLE 458 study ever undertaken, and would take several years to design and pilot study, beforethe full-scale study could be undertaken. I have very briefly described some of the NIH autism research activities. Autismresearch is a major priority for the NIH. We clearly recognize that much remains to beaccomplished, and we are committed to continuing to work to expand our efforts. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond toquestions you and the members of the Committee may have. 9 ESICOPYAVAILABLEB 459Dr. COOK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to tes-tify on the topic of autism. I am, as some have before, speaking assomeone wearing three hatsactually, first, as the brother of the late Kenneth Wade Cook, who had many of the problems of chil-dren and adults with autism; I am also speaking as a child and ad-olescent psychiatrist who cares for many patients with autism, andas a biomedical researcher trying to increase our knowledge of the causes of autism and, above all, to try to increase our ability totreat this devastating disorder.It starts with me recalling being an 8-year-old boy with a 2-year-old brother who my family had just realized was not developingnormally. I remember vividly the pain of my parents. I further re-call that we went to a meeting where, to my recollectionI will notspeak for my parentswe were told that it was known from theoryabout what was known of the brain at that point that \"patterning,\"a way of moving the arms and legs, a special diet, re-breathing through a mask, and related methods still practiced today in var-ious forms, would cure his problems.I remember our family being skeptical from the beginning of thatmeeting. However, by the end of the meeting, we and the otherfamilies in the group were sold on this treatment because it wastoo painful to accept what we knew was happening.If there is anything I have not forgotten, it is that hope is some-thing essential in working with children with severe challengesfor the children, for the families, and for all of us.I am very thankful to those who were interested enough that farback in children with developmental problems to have spent somuch time with my brother and my family and to be with us. Theyknew that providing us the tools to work to teach my brother thebasics of communication and motor skills was very helpful, and Isuspect that many of them were practicing this method for the same reason we werethey simply had to try.I could complain about the 5 a.m. mornings in which as a child,it was physically exhausting to perform the patterning, but I amsure it was good training for being a physician-scientist, or perhapsa Congressperson.However, I am not pleased that there was not more time spentteaching me to play with my brother instead of trying to teach himto read just to show that their method was working, when it wasnot even close to being an appropriate next step.Our family learned to accept and love my brother deeply. I wouldlike to add that at this time, the preferred professional responsewas to tell you to put your child away at birth. And some of our increased awareness, I am afraid, actually positively, is that we donot simply ship the kids away. We felt sort of like we were going against advice to keep him in our home, which we did for 10 years.I am very thankful that children today have more opportunitiesfor education due to congressional legislation. Excellent communitysupport and model community support in St. Louis was vital to myfamily during my brother's last year. Mostly, I miss him deeply,since his death remains as unexplained as his original problem, al-though the two are certainly related. It reminds me that not onlyis there much suffering, there is also death with this disorder. A ^row463 460Obviously, I am alsoa physician-scientist because I cannot acceptthis, even after he isgone. Having several hats, as brother, physi-cian and scientist can be extremely painful. I recall my anger as a child when investigators found that patterning was not effective. As it turns out, I collaborate with people at the same institution at Yale todaybut I wondered how could they do such a thing, and how could I now be in their shoes, now that I have studied secretin and have failed to find that it is working as much as initially claimed.The only thing inmy defense, frankly, fighting myself here, is tosay that I actually shed a tear when the data were analyzed for secretin, because even though at the bottom of it, there is not a lot of plausibility, I do not careI deeply wanted this to work. And that is probably whatmy anger is, that all these things have notprovided what they say they will, and I am the first one who wants them to work.So our laboratory, not being satisfied with the status quo, has worked on neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology, neuroimaging and neurogenetics of autism. The reason for our current focus on genet-ics is the data, not our impressions or our wishes, show it to be the most powerful influence on the etiology of autismand many have been studied carefullymaybe not carefully enough. It is not the only influenceI would agree with what has been said several timesit is certainly not the only influence in autism, and it is certainly nota simple, single-gene disorder. If it were, we would know for sure what that single gene was. Howeverand this isvery importantit is a rare event in my lifetime to realize that suddenly, molecular-genetic study of autism spectrum disorders providesone of the best scientific opportunitiesin medicine. I must say that usually throughout my career, I have had my passion, and my colleagues say, yes, it is very important, but there is no scientific opportunity; we cannot learn anything there. In genetics, we are actually ahead of most other medical dis- orders when we study autism.In terms of why study genetics of autism, I think it is unlikely and I would have said this before recent eventsthat gene therapy will be the result of genetic research in autism. It is also unlikely that genetics of autism will explain a relatively recent increase in measured autism prevalence.The point of genetic research is to develop treatments that will correct the missing or abnormal signals for a small set of nerve cells in the amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum so that the nerve cells mature. I very much agree with those who are optimis- tic on this point. These are not children who have brains that can- not further develop. That is my view, but it is a view as a scientist. You do not see the kinds of changes in the brain that would make things not able to move forward.If we knew the signals, what has long been a too complicated puzzle of autism would become simple enough for us to understand. We are all challenged ina sense in trying to make sense of this.So although the simple idea is to provide gene therapy, oral deliv- ery of more traditional small molecules, which we usually refer to as \"medications,\" is likely to be more feasible and preferable, partlybecause there are few treatments that we have not wanted to take 461back. That is certainly something that have learned as a physi- cianI try things, and they make sense, but if they do not work,it is time to stop them.Two recent developments in the broader field of developmentaldisorders show that complex situation may be better understoodthrough molecular genetics. The first is the finding of the gene forFRAXA, or Fragile XA mental retardation. This is very relevant toautism since a substantial proportion of children with FRAXA haveautism spectrum disorders. Although one wishes knowledge of agene will lead to new treatment sooner, the results of a decade of research in FRAXA to understand the mechanism of this disorderis leading to an almost exponential growth in understanding com-plex interactions of molecules in the process of learning.Mentioned earlier, which is actually quite historic, was the re-cent finding of the gene for Rett syndrome, because this is actuallyfinding a specific gene for an autism spectrum disorder. It is nota-ble that it is caused by a single gene, MECP2, but that it has acourse of regression in social behavior and communication between the first and second birthdays. Knowing the gene has led to abreakthrough in the systematic approach to investigation of Rettsyndrome in terms of how it affects the development of the brain,and this is already moving us forward.Although we do not know the specific genes involvedand Iwould agree with that, and it is definitely something that is per-sonally frustrating todayseveral groups have been finding evi-dence that an extra part of chromosome 15 leads to a high risk forautism, especially if inherited from the mother. Believe me, basedon the history of autism, if I could have it come out another way, I would; but this is simply the origin of the chromosome and hasnothing to do with the mother's behavior, as the theory went in thepast.Although this is responsible for less than 4 percent of cases ofautism, these 15q11-q13 duplications, like Rett syndrome andFRAXA, are helping us understand autism with regression, be-cause all three of these often have this as a component, more gen-erally.Several laboratories including our own are searching for a genein this region. As an example of our concern in genetics about notwanting to waste precious resources, the probability at this pointof there not being a gene in this region is about 5 in 100,000 withthe most rigorous blinded studies. But we are not sure yet, andthat is just the way it has to be, because we may expend our re-sources in the wrong direction. We are close to sure at that level. Of course, the problem is that we will have to get beyond regionswith likely autism genes to actually finding the specific changesand then getting on with the work of using the information to im-prove treatment, because that is the point. So it is a good thing there are people doing excellent clinical re-search and trying to improve educational and other interventionswhile we are working out the fundamental causes, with many oth-ers. However, it is important not to think we have more of an effectthan we can back with controlled data.The history of autism teaches that zeal without skepticism mayhave negative consequences. The first was blaming mothers, and 462the second was false accusation of fathers of children with autism of abuse when their children were undergoing facilitated commu- nication. That was probably the biggest problem that we had last decade in terms of things that, on their face, should not have bad consequences but did.The challenges of autism research are obvious. In terms of needs, I mostly want to thank Congress for the appropriation of increased funds for biomedical research generally. All of the pertinent NIH institutes are now actively engaged in the support of autism re- search.A simple statement of needs is that there are many important and feasible questions about autism not able to be asked with cur- rent resources. There are not enough well-trained researchers inthe field, partly because, in spite of the figures that they have in- creased, I question that it was much more than zero 5 years ago. Most importantly, questions that are being asked efficiently, such as in the area of molecular genetics and others, are not being an-swered at an optimal rate given current funding in this area. That is not OK for me, because my patients are aging with me, and more are being born. Again, I am not criticizing the funding but ap-pointing a statement of scientific opportunity that we do not want to miss.I thank you for the opportunity to communicate.[The prepared statement of Dr. Cook, Jr., follows:] 463 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGODepartment of PsychiatryMC 30775841 S.

However, Pm not pleased that there wasn't more timespent teaching me to play with my brother instead of trying to teach him to read, when it wasn'tclose to being an appropriate next step. Our family learned to accept and love my brother deeply.I am thankful that children today more opportunity for education due to Congressionallegislation. Excellent community support was vital to my family during my brother's last yearsin St. Louis. Mostly I miss him since his death at the age of 29. His death remains as BEST COPYAVAILABLE 464 unexplained as his original problem, although the two are likely to be related. It reminds me that there is mortality as well as morbidity associated with autism and related developmental disorders.We have an extremely long way to go to provide full access to adequate care for children, adolescents, and adults with autism. It is very difficult to confront attitudes as a physician that I only suspected as a child. Insurance companies, state agencies, school administrators, and other physicians continually turn away from caring for people with autism. Much more attention is given to paperwork than provision of care and services. This is not the main purpose of our meeting today, but I can not speak without mentioning this. Although many of the most severe problems are emotional and behavioral, insurance companies discriminate against the best treatments by the most qualified providers, with the result often being time lost from work for parents, depression in parents, and most importantly, suffering would otherwise be treatable,The needs of the patients and problems in the systems of care and education have seemedoverwhelming since I started my practice in the mid 1980s, so the thought of an increase in the prevalence of autism is probably something I wouldn't want to confront. However, comment on changes in systems that are largely responsible for the apparent increase is appropriate. An increase in autism in Illinois schools has been cited as evidence a rise in autism prevalence rates, but autism is still underestimated in Illinois schools. The increase is based on the introduction of autism as a possible educational classification in autism. In addition to many educationalsystems not recognizing autism, many diagnosticians didn't recognize it in the past. Autism spectrum disorders are only beginning to be accurately estimated. Based upon its widespread ethnic distribution, it has most likely been challenging people with autism and their families for thousands of years, but it has taken us this long to recognize what it is. Thus, the committee'songoing work is important and a sense of urgency is necessary to catch up for lost time.This brings to mind the medical saying, \"first do no harm.\" One harm worse than doing nothingwas blaming mothers because of their physical and emotional closeness to their children. Notonly were individuals hurt by blaming mothers for their child's autism, but we probably lost a couple of decades following an impression of causation rather than focusing on the same sciencethat was leading to improved treatments in cancer and heart disease. Without evidence tosupport a relationship between vaccinations and autism, we need to be careful about wastingprecious resources on another case of guilt by association. Mothers were guilty because theywere physically close to children with autism. Now vaccinations are being blamed largelybecause they are given at the same time as the regressions that occur for a substantial minority ofchildren with autism (between the first and second birthday). Certainly, GI findings that havenot been demonstrated to be specific for autism do not provide support for MMR vaccinations as a cause of autism. Data may be provided today which are credible in support of a connection, but the data to date do not support the hypothesis of MMR vaccination caused autism.It has been a privilege to be involved in the development of new treatments for children withautism. Lost in the media's overfocusing on \"miracle\" cures over the more than three-and-a-halfdecades I have been involved, are small changes in our available treatments. Although limited toimproving aggressive behavior, anxiety, and depression, medications that potently inhibit thereuptake of Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa) 465 have provided the first medication class that reduces the core symptoms of repetitive behaviorleading to distress for many people with autism. Of course, it isn't enough, but it demonstratesthat improvements through development of effective medications are possible. As far asresearch challenges and needs are concerned, pharmacological treatment research needs to beenhanced so that we have better data about whether each of these drugs works in autism, forwhich symptoms, at what ages, and for which patients. In addition, it would be extremelyhelpful to know which patients will worsen on small doses and what treatments to provide suchpatients.As many know, not all of our attempts to improve treatment have been successful. A relativelyclassic story is that of fenfluramine, originally thought to raise I.Q. and reduce symptoms ofautism. After considerable work, fenfluramine was found to be a good placebo. Although wewere hopeful that secretin would be serendipitous powerful treatment, at least two carefullycontrolled trials have shown it to be similar in effect to fenfluramine in providing a good placeboeffect.Further studies are ongoing to make sure a positive effect is not present under certaincircumstances, but it may be about to end up as part of the long history of good, honest attemptsto hit a home run in autism treatment that struck out. There is no reason not to try, except thatwe have to be careful about the risks to the children and the costs to the families if we overlypromote treatments without evidence from controlled trials.There is a problem when thousands of doses of secretin from pigs could be administered tochildren with claims of benefit while clinical trials to study safety and efficacy were beingdelayed by federal policies against expediting research review for secretin clinical trials. Thisironic situation allowed the supply of secretin to be depleted, thus delaying initiation andcompletion of our multi-site trial.Having several hats as brother, physician and scientist can be very painful. I recall my anger as achild when investigators found that patterning wasn't effective. How could they do such a thingand how could I now be in their shoes in contributing to data about the lack of efficacy ofsecretin? All I have to say is that I shed a tear when the data were analyzed for secretin, much asI shed many tears when I came to the realization that \"patterning\" was not going to let me knowmy brother without his severe problems.I suppose it is obvious why so much of my time is devoted to research reaching down to basicmechanisms. On the one hand, I am desperate to improve the situation for my patients, many ofwhom are reminders of my brother. On the other hand, for some of my patients I have seenmedical treatments provide relief I didn't think possible before ow first use of Prozac in autismshortly after its release in 1988. By the way, there is no reason to have lengthy discussions aboutwho tried it first, since I know I had parents discuss it around the same time or beforeprofessionals were considering it.The riskiest thing for a physician-scientist to do is translational research, especially when it isfrom the bedside to the bench. Basic science has a much more appealing longitudinal logic.Clinical science has relevance. As much as both are pioneering, translational research oftenrequires almost autistic perseverance. However, eventually the bridge has to be crossed. 466 Our laboratorx has worked on neurochemisty, neuroimmunology, neuroendocrinology,neuroimaging, and neurogenetics of autism. The reason for our current focus on genetics is thatthe data, not impressions, show it to be the most powerful influence in the etiology of autism. Itis not the only influence and it is not a simple, single gene disorder. However, it is a rare eventin my lifetime to realize that suddenly that molecular genetic study of autism spectrum disordersprovides one of the best scientific opportunities in medicine. Of course, this would not bepossible without the considerable basic science advances and applied science advances rangingfrom sequencing of the human genome, to development of rapid methods of genotyping, to thedevelopment of powerful statistical approaches. It is new for established researchers in otherfields to be drawn into autism and related disorders because of the scientific opportunity.It4s.unlilcely that gene therapy will be the result of genetic research in autism. It is also unlikelythat genetics of autism will explain a relatively recent increase in measured autism prevalence.The point of genetic research is to develop treatments that will correct the missing or abnormalsignagiara small set of nerve cells in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum so that thenerve cells mature. If we knew the signals, what has long been a too complicated puzzle ofautism will become simple enough for us to understand. Although the simple idea is to providegene therapy, oral delivery of more traditional small molecules is likely to be more feasible andpreferable.Even more important has been the emerging voice of families of children with autism. I can notbegin to list and thank the parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and grandparents who are notonly taking on the extraordinary challenge of caring for their family members, but who arespeaking for people with autism who because of their communication problems are not as able tospeak for themselves as we wish they could.The need to learn more about autism is self-apparent and the scientific opportunities areabundant. The challenges are in learning about something as complicated as the developingbrain and development of some of the most uniquely human qualities of higher levelcommunication and social behavior.Two recent developments in the broader field of developmental disorders show that complexsituations may be better understood through molecular genetics. The first is the finding of thegene for FRAXA mental retardation. This is very relevant to autism since a substantialproportion of children with FRAXA have autism spectrum disorders. Although one wishesknowledge of a gene will lead to new treatment sooner, the results of a decade of research tounderstand the mechanism of this disorder is leading to an almost exponential growth inunderstanding of complex interactions of molecules in the process of learning. Anotherdevelopment is the recent cloning of the gene for Rett syndrome. This is actually one of themost severe autism spectrum disorders. It is notable that it is caused by a single gene, MECP2,but that it has a course of regression in social behavior and communication between the first andsecond birthday. Knowing the gene has led to a breakthrough in the systematic approach toinvestigation of Rettrome in terms of how it affects the development of the brain. Study ofboth FRAXA and Rett syndrome will lead to basic knowledge about how autism and relatedconditions develop. 467 Although we don't know the specific genes involved, several groups have been finding evidencethat an extra part of chromosome 15 leads to a high risk for autism, especially if inherited fromthe mother. Although responsible for less than 4% of cases of autism, these 15q11-q13duplications, lilWratrsradrome and FRAXA, are likely to help us understand autism moregenerally. Several laboratories, including our own, are searching for a gene in this region. As anexample of our concern about not wanting to waste precious resources, the probability of therenot being a gene in this region is about 5 in 100,000, but we're not sure yet. Of course, we'llhave to get beyond regions with likely autism genes to actually finding the specific geneticchanges and then getting on with the work of using the information to improve treatment. (Moreinformation about molecular genetic studies and autism is available at our web site at:http://psychiatrv.uchicago.eduildn ).It's a good thing there are people doing good clinical research and trying to improve educationaland other interventions while we are working out the fundamental causes. It's also good thatpeople are asking questions about prevention and even taking shots to improve medicationdelivery, either trying to hit for average with medications like Prozac, or swinging for the fenceswith an occasional secretin trial. However, it's important not to think we have more of an effectthan we can back with controlled data. History teaches us that zeal without skepticism may havenegative consequences (e.g. false accusation of fathers of children with autism who underwentfacilitated communication).The challenges of autism research are obvious. Jnierms_of needs, I mostly want to thankCongress for the appropriation of increased funds for biomedical research. All of the pertinentNIH institutes are now engaged in active support of autism research. A_simpltstatement ofneeds is that there are many important and feasible questions about autism not able to be askedwith current resources. There are not enough well-trained researchers in the fieldTT-7art y becausethe area was almost totally unfunded five short years ago. Most importantly, questions that arebeing asked well and efficiently, such as in the area of molecular genetics, are not beinganswered at an optimal rate given current funding in the area. Again, this is not meant as acriticism, but as a statement of scientific opportunity.Thank you for the opportunity to communicate.Sincerely, Edwin-H. Cook, Jr., M.D.Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics 468Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Dr. Cook.Let me start the question with you. Do you subscribe to the the- ory that part of the problems of kids getting autism is caused by the vaccine?Dr. CooK. I guess that isa direct question to me, having evadedthat.Mr. BURTON. Yes.Dr. CooK. I have heardmore today than I knew before I came.I did not specifically address that because I have not directly stud- ied the question.As I see the data at this point, the data do not support the idea that vaccines cause autism. As someone who studied secretin as anexample, I realize that I cannot prove the absence of something. For example, on secretin, all I can say is that I have proved the absence of it for myself; ifsomeone else wants to come and onlytreat a certain kind of child in a certain kind of setting, then per- haps our work will have helped them.Mr. BURTON. What wouldyou think, Doctor, of taking a hardlook at the conclusions that Dr. Wakefield and Professor O'Leary and Dr. Singh came to with their research? I know you work on genetics, but what wouldyou think about looking at their research?Dr. COOK. Well, in someways, I work in the area of clinicaltrials, so I can comment on why they fail to convince me that there is a connection. They have raised the possibility of a connection, but there are several areas in their logic that do not come together. It may be that if they wereup here, they would say, yes, those aregaps that we have to fillbut I am concerned that in the presen- tations, starting with the original paper and today, they have not sufficiently highlighted where the gaps are, so the logic falls apart in a few places.First of all, if we know thatwe have prevented a lot of autism by preventing rubella-caused autism, which was a prevalent cause 20 or 30 years ago, as Dr. Chess showed, then why is it now MMR, and all of a sudden, it is measles?Now, if someone is so pleasedand I must say it is fairly fancy methodology in terms of pulling the measles virus outwhy not show that they can pull the measles virus out from the vaccine, dif- ferentiated genetically from the measles virus that would occur without the vaccine?These are holes, and my main thing is what I hear from the posi- tive side is an almost total lack of self-criticism, OK? That is a key pointMr. BURTON. ButDr. COOK [continuing]. That is a key point of the scientific meth- od.Mr. BURTON. But you do not think that their research is worth taking a look at?Dr. COOK. Oh, I think their research is very interesting, and I think it is particularly interesting to what I thinkand this is an interestingepidemiologicalquestionifthereisautistic enterocolitisand I think they have interesting datahow much of the total group of autism is it? From what I have seen, it would not be nearly enough of autism to account for an increase in preva- lence. 469Mr. BURTON. You heard theand I am going to go down the linewith the rest of you in just a minuteL7Dr. COOK. If I have a child who is vomiting, I very much agree with theMr. BURTON [continuing]. You heard the testimony of the fourparents as well as the testimony I gave about our grandson; andwithin just a day of their getting these shots, their temperatureswent up, and they started the violent reactions, and it got worse. How would you account for that? Is that just a coincidence, or what?Dr. CooK. Well, if I am to take that as a reason for their autismto be caused, then I will agree with the parents who told me theirchild had autism because they took a 2-day trip, leaving the childwith very good grandparents; they came back, and the child hadautism suddenly. Am I supposed to now tell them, yes, you are right, because you see the connectionbecause of a potential coin- cidenceyou are right and caused it by taking 2 days off and leav-ing your child in very loving hands?I think we have got to be very careful and use careful epidemio-logical approaches. Dr. Taylor has done the best epidemiologicalstudy. There is not another one on the other side. If there were, I would weight itin fact, I would give more weight to a positive, well-done epidemiological study. We have only got one. Mr. BURTON. Well, I am not a doctor, but it just seems to me that the scientific community ought to have their minds open to all pos- sibilities as far as the causes of autism are concerned. From your testimony, you sounded like it is a gene problem, and the vaccinescould not possibly be a contributing factor.Dr. COOK. No. They could, but the people who think they could,the people who want to raise the hypothesisand I am someone who has spent a lot of effort testing other people's hypothesesIthink there is a lot of duty when people raise a hypothesis, includ-ing Dr. Wakefield, from GI studies, who raise an epidemiologicalhypothesis, I think it is his responsibility to test the hypothesiscarefully. I have thrown out hypotheses that I quite loved, and theywere greatthey were not all genetic; some were immunologicalbut you have to go with the data. If I have the data, I will go with it.Mr. BURTON. When you studied secretin, did you study more than one dose?Dr. CooK. No. As a matter of fact, before we did the study, therewas a meeting which included people who were convinced that se-cretin worked who said it was one dose, and we used the dose itwas supposed to be; we used porcine-derived secretinand now, allof a sudden, the hypothesis shifts. Now, the hypothesis shifted tomultiple dosesthat is fine. The people who think it is multipledoses and single doses now have to test it. And if we have helpedto refine the hypothesis so they can do a better study and showthat it works, then I am fine with that.I recognize that basically, science cannot disprove anything. It isreally meant toyou have to actually set up a hypothesis to tearapart to accept the other one. That is what I mean by part of theself-criticism of the scientific method. 470So absolutelyif this gets turned around in particularly children with projectile vomitingthat is a very rare group of autismbut somebody with projectile vomiting, maybe 30 kids like that, secre- tin would work wonderfully.Mr. BURTON. Dr. Hirtz,we were talking about the study at BrickTownship, NJ. I do not know if you heard me ask the question of the doctor from the CDC earlier. Why would you think that the Na- tional Institutes of Health and CDC and others would go into Brick Township, NJ and look at all the environmental problems that may have caused the autism epidemic they have had there, and when the parents asked that they check to see if any of the vaccines had anything to do with it, why would you think the health agencies did not check that as well?Dr. HIRTZ. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I am not at all familiar with the study at Brick Township; that was conducted by the CDC, not the NIH, and I am afraid you will have to ask them questions about it.I would be glad to tellyou about activities that the NIH is doingin this area, however, ifyou would like to hear some of them.Mr. BURTON. What wouldyou say about the NIH taking a hardlook at the studies done by Dr. Wakefield, Dr. O'Leary, and Dr. Singh, and some of the theses that Dr. Megson espoused earlier? Dr. HIRTZ. I think that examining scientific evidence is always a useful thing to do; there is nothing wrong with that. In terms of the vaccine issue, I would just like to say that you are rightwe do need to keep our mindsopen. I do feel that at this time, theavailable, valid scientific evidence does not support that vaccine is a cause of autism.HoweverMr. BURTON. What bothersme about a lot of this is Dr. Cook andyou say if there is a hypothesis that says this, it has to be proven before we will even takea hard look at it.Dr. HIRTZ. NoMr. BURTON. Well, that is the impression that I am getting, andDr. HIRTZ. May I finish?Mr. BURTON [continuing]. Let me just finish. The problem is that there are a large number of children who have acquired this prob- lem shortly after getting these vaccines, and when scientists and doctors from other parts of the world come up with a thesis, I think it is irresponsible to out-of-hand just discard that and say, well, that is something they have to further prove, because their hypoth- esis has not yet been proven. It seems to me that you say, hey, if there is a positive result there, if it looks like there may be some- thing there, why don't we take a look at it, too, instead of keeping yourselves confined to one area?Dr. HIRTZ. If you will letme finish, Mr. Chairman, I was goingto tell you about all the efforts we are making to look at that. What I was going to say when I continued was that even though that is the case at the moment,we do take this very seriously, we takethe concerns of the parentsvery seriously, and when we have re-ports like this and concerns like this, we do address them. We are taking three steps at the NIH, and we are undertaking three projects to look at the relationship of vaccines and autism. 4711, 471One of them is very immediate and is going to be done in the cen-ters that now exist. The Child Health Network has Centers of Ex-cellence in autism, and they have about 1,000 children enrolled. Inconjunction with the Deafness and Communicative Disorders Insti-tute and the CDC, they are going to look at the children who haveregressed and look at their vaccine histories and study this issue,compare them to other children. That is going to be done as soonas possible, hopefully, this fiscal year.In addition to that study, something I have been working on, weare planning at the NIH to look at the very important issue of notonly vaccines but risk factors for development of autism as wellMr. BURTON. I have had a number of people today testify fromthe health agencies that there is no scientific evidence that autismis related to vaccines. How do they know that?Dr. HIRTZ. They do not.Mr. BURTON. How do you know that? A vaccine is put out on themarket, children all take itDr. HIRTZ. On theMr. BURTON [continuing]. Let me just finishand there is an in-crease from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 400 or 500, so we have an epidemicon our hands; and yet the health agencies of this country are tell-ing us there is no connection between these vaccinations and au-tism. How do you know?Dr. HIRTZ. I do not know that there is no connection. What Iknow is that the evidence that has been reviewed by the BritishMedical Research Council and the epidemiologic evidence does notsupport a large-scale causation. But I still thinkMr. BURTON. How do you know that?Dr. HIRTZ [continuing]. But I still think that there are and theremay be certain children who are susceptible, and that is what wehave to go after. It is very important that we look for why childrendevelop autism and whether there might be a small minority ofchildren who have some susceptibility, and we are not ruling thatout.Mr. BURTON. Yes. One of the things that concerns meand phar-maceutical companies are extremely important; they employ anawful lot of people in my district and in Indiana; we have somegreat pharmaceutical companies that have saved a lot of lives andprobably kept epidemics from happening around the world, thereis no question about thatbut there are so many people who workat CDC, HHS, NIH, and the other health agencies who have somekind of connection to the pharmaceutical companies and are onthese advisory boards, that it causes one to wonder whether thereis thorough research: going into these things before they are ap-proved.Does that concern you at all?Dr. HIRTZ. At the NIH, we do not really deal with the approvalprocess of the vaccines. Other agencies can tell you more about howthey deal with that.What I am really concerned aboutit is hard for me to conveyto you that we reallythere is nothing I would not do to stop au-tism from occurring and to stop children from developing thisorder, but I 472Mr. BURTON. Well, then, what I would suggest is that we are going to get all of these studiesI am going to get themand we are going to send them to all the health agencies,. and I want thehealth agencies to write back and tell me, after they do some re- search, whether or not they feel there is any merit to these argu- ments. And I want them to look atand I will get other Members of Congress to join me if necessaryI want them to look at Dr. Wakefield, Dr. O'Leary, Dr. Singh, Dr. Megsonall of the doctors who have come here today with various solutions that have workedDr. Up ledger with his cranial manipulation. Those things should all be looked at, because we are giving the health agencies in this country billions and billions and billions of dollars, and for them not to look at every avenue for possible treatment for these things I think would be wrong.Let me just go down to the end of the table and give all of you a questionDrs. Rim land, Goldberg, Megson, Up ledger, and Ms.Pratt.Do you think from whatyou have heard today and seen in yourscientific research that there is a possibility that the vaccines are contributing to the increase in autism?Mr. RIMLAND. There is not only a possibility, there is an ex- tremely high likelihood.Mr. BURTON. Would you pull the mic closer?Mr. RIMLAND. There is not only the possibility, there is an ex- tremely high likelihood from all the evidence available, including the so-called anecdotal evidence that people like to snicker at, but which is really very important evidence, from the kind of evidence that Dr. Wakefield submitted, from the rise in autism at the time of initiation of the MMR, the time of the rise of the epidemic, the data that I provided inmy handout which shows that late-onsetautism started at just about the same time that the MMR was ini- tiated. There is just a world of evidence that leads me to think that it is extremely likely that when the final answer is known, if it is ever known, the MMR will be strongly implicated as an important cause of autism.Mr. BURTON. Dr. Goldberg.Dr. GOLDBERG. With cautionas I say this, as a practicing pedia- trician, I have vaccinated children in my practice whom I consid- ered high-riskI have literally had a godchild with one foot in au- tism and one foot out and vaccinated her along the way. As I stated this morning, I however try to practice vaccination policies that I was taught 20, 30 years agoyou do not vaccinate an ill child; you use certain plans; I never gave a child a hepatitis B shot in thenursery yet. But I think that the effort to solve autism gets dis-tracted by the fact that we do have a lot of children triggered off by some time correlation to the vaccine.As I mentioned in my testimony, I think that if we are going to understand this, we need to step back and figure out why there is a wealth of science that says, hey, the vaccines do not create thisor cause it, and then we suddenly have this epidemic going on, and I really believe the way it will come out in the end, whether we do it in the next 6 or 8 months or in 10 years, is going to be that this will all tie in from the eighties and nineties with what is going 473on in our population and it is not specifically the vaccines, but thevaccines are playing a role in it.Mr.BURTON.Would play a role in it.Dr.GOLDBERG.Pardon?Mr.BURTON.The vaccine would play a role.Dr.GOLDBERG.Yes, the vaccines would play a role. But we needto understand why, suddenly, a population has become susceptibleto those when they did so much good along the way.Mr.BURTON.Dr. Megson.Dr.MEGSON. Iam seeing more and more families that are com-pletely devastated. I know one mother who has been very active inthe parent support group in our local community has had threechildren. The oldest has severe dyslexia/ADD, the second one diedof SIDS within 24 hours of DPT; and the third one is autistic.If my theories are correct, there is an organ in the neck at thebase of the main artery to the brain called the carotid body, andwe are disconnecting the pathway. When the oxygen-level in theblood decreases in the carotid body, there is a signal sent to therespiratory center in the brainstem to increase breathing rates, andwe are disconnecting that pathway.Recently they discovered that, oh, if you put children down tosleep on their backs, they do not die of SIDS. I think we reallyneed to look at this.I do not want to be here. I have never gone against the grain.I am not a vaccine researcher. But once I discovered some of theseconnections, I do not think any of us can turn our backs. So manyfamilies are devastated.Mr.BURTON.Thank you.Dr. Up ledger.Dr.UPLEDGER. Ihave to say yes, I do. As I stated earlier, I thinkthere is a group of autistic childrenand by no means do I say allautistic childrenwhose problems are due to membrane dysfunc-tion. But I have learned to understand that a significant numberof them do, and I can easily differentiate autism from childhoodschizophrenia just based on the feel of the membranes.I think that the membrane is a place where several factors maygo, and it can be, as I said, a fever due to a virus, it can be a vac-cine reaction, it can be a traumatic deliveryit can be anythingthat creates a change in the membrane flexibility and growth ac-commodation.From the histories I have takenand I have taken histories withautistic parents since 1975it is more than coincidence as far asI am concerned. I do not know how many cases of anecdotes weneed to consider that the anecdote has some validity, but it wouldappear to be that it is infinite. We still will not believe the anec-dote. I happen to subscribe to the idea that if you study the anec-dote, you might learn something.So I would go very strongly in favor of the idea that vaccines arepotentially able to cause autism in terms of their effect on mem-branes. I think that membrane condition is probably largely influ-enced by genetic factors along with nutritional factors, along withtoxic factors, and so on, so you have a susceptible membrane.I have opened up enough human heads that are not embalmed,that are maybe 4 or 5 hours old, and I can see the difference in 474the membranes, and whenyou look at the diagnoses, you begin toput 2 and 2 together.I think one of the major things that has happened in medicine is the meningeal membranesystem has been given a very shortshrift. It is avery important system. It has just come out re-centlyI cannot think of his name now, but a fellow from Califor-nia, UC San Diego, I think,came out with evidence, very strongevidence, that 1 gram of dura mater membrane, which is a very small quantity of that membrane, carries 100 million single-domain magnetic crystals that are ferric.What does it take to change that? The brain itself has 5 million per gram. Anything that interferes with electrical conduction or magnetic fields is going to screw up that brain function. When we stretch that base membrane laterally, why does the kid get better in terms of his emotion? Because I think we are improving the con- ditions under which his temporal lobes have to live. That is why. You can tear it all apart, and if you study temporal lobes, you can say, OK, temporal lobes cause autism. But what caused the tem-poral lobe, and what caused the membrane to not accommodate the temporal lobe? When you start looking at it that way, you start looking at multiple factors any one of which can be causaland I put vaccine in that category.Mr. BURTON. Thank you, Doctor.Dr. Pratt, do you have a comment?Ms. PRATT. I think it is a very hard issue, and from both the au- tism side of America and the Indiana Resource Center for Autism, our job is really to provide information for families. And it is very hard when you listen to very well-respected scientists and re- searchers like Dr. Cook, whom I have tremendous respect forand I point him out because he is in Illinois, the State neighboring Indi- anait is very hard when you hear the testimony and the research that says there does notseem to be a link, and then, when youhear from the families their stories. Balancing that out is a very difficult thing, and I struggle with that, because I do not want all of us running down one path, hoping that, yes, at the end of that path is going to be a cure or the reason or whatever. I hope we can all keep our minds open to all possibilities. Again, to be an ethical and decent professional, I have to say to families that I am hearing some stories, and there is a possibility for it. Those families and the families that you have heard from today really cannot wait for the research to tell them conclusively that there is a relationship.I would say that in all likelihood, Congressman Burton, if your daughter had another child, she would take a very serious look at the usage of vaccinations with her third child, regardless of whatthe research tells her. That is the complexity of the issue.So, what you have heard over the last several hours today is a lot of different testimony and sometimes conflicting testimony, and I hope that what we will all focus on is trying to uncover the com- plex nature and perhaps the complex causes behind autism.Mr. BURTON. Thank you.Let me just ask Dr. Cook one more question, and then I wantto make a couple of announcements before we conclude. 475Dr. Cook, how do you account for these parents and these doctorsfinding the measles virus in the guts of these kids who have hadthe MMR shot?Dr. COOK. I am very interested in that finding because I thinkit is a fascinating finding even if it applies to one in 1,000 kidswith autism. Each child is very valuable. So first of all, realize thatDr. Wakefield is talking about a very small group of autism, withdocumented pathology, with vomitingwhich, as I said, is quiterare in autism. I think that is an interesting finding that needs tobe followed up.The next step of that may not be a link with vaccines and au-tism; it may be something quite more important in understandingwhat is happening with autism. So that some of what was pre-sented today, it was very good to see data ahead of time; it is rare,and it is nice of them to share it. There is something about theirwork, particularly seeing more controlled data than I have seen be-fore, that is very interesting, and I will be paying quite a bit of at-tention to, because we need every clue that we can get.Thank you.Mr.BURTON.Very good; 1 second.[Pause.]Mr.BURTON.Let me just ask you a couple more questions, Dr.Cook. Where do you see the autism rates in the next 10 years? Doyou see them pretty close to where they are now, or do you seethem increasing?Dr. CooK. I think if we are talking about from the perspectiveof school districts, they will continue to rise, because I think we arestill underestimating across all school districts.In terms of the actual prevalence, meaning all the children whohave always been out there suffering from this, I do not see itgoing up that high. What I see is appropriatelyand this is a veryimportant, I think almost civil rights movementthese kids andfamilies are being heard now. But I do not see this as an epidemicin the sense of prevalence. I see it as an epidemic in terms of awake-up call that lots of kids and families have been suffering fora long time.Mr.BURTON.So you are saying the 1 in 10,000Dr. CooK. It was neverI do not knowMr.BURTON[continuing]. It was always a lot higher than that?Dr. CooK. I do not know of a 1 in 10,000. I know that 2 to 4 per10,000 is what DSM3 said, which was 1980 to 1987. And 1987 hasbeen referred to as around the time of an increase. That is whenwe went from DSM3 to DSM3R. The reason is DSM3 said the childhad to have a pervasive lack of responsiveness. Now, I do not knowwho these kids were who had autism then, because every childwith autism is related; they are just not related in the same ways.So now you have increased the definition as of 1987and I thinkI have lost the question. I am sorry.Mr.BURTON.It was about the projected increase in the next 10years.Dr. CooK. Right. So the most important thing about the 2 to 4per 10,000 estimates is that they were often done by, well, let ussay someone has come in to a university clinic, and you estimate 476that against the population. What has happened, which is betterepidemiology since then, is you go knocking on every door.So I have heard 1 in 500 referred to more than just autism, butthe best study where they knocked on every door, half a million in Japan, found 1 in 500 for autism. So I do not think we are estimat- ing it yet in terms of its impact.Mr. BURTON. Do any of the rest of you have any projections or guesses on that?Mr. RIMLAND. In California, the increase started in 1977 beforethe diagnostic changes were made, so the switch from DSM3 toDSM4 cannot even begin to account for that.Dr. GOLDBERG. If I can tie in a projection, unfortunately, I canremember discussions back, literally, in the mid-eighties with clini-cians, and at that time, the CDC, the NIH and everyone was say-ing this new entity out there that we were calling \"chronic fatiguesyndrome\" or whatever it was supposed to be did not exist, or wasnot in any big numbers, and as clinicians, we were saying we weregoing to see 1 to 3 percent of the population. Well, now we are inthe late nineties, the numbers are getting very close to that, andwe are now talking 5 or 10 percent.I think that if this is the same crossover to the children as wasseen in adults, you can make a prediction that in the next 5 to 10years, you may hit 5 or 10 percent of our population or more.One of the most scary moments in my life recently, literally, wascoming back on a flight from giving talks in Australia. I rememberthere was literally not a family who did not know a family who didnot know a family that either had chronic fatigue syndrome, ADD,or autism. My thoughts on the flight coming back were, well, whereis Australianear the ozone holebut my big concern was thatthat was going to be our country 5 or 10 years later. In the lastmonth, I have literally had three families inthis is only a yearand a half from that flighttelling me they do not know a familythat does not know a family that does not know a family. This isa major crisis.Mr. BURTON. Any other comments?[No response.]Mr. BURTON. Let me just end by thanking all of you. I really ap-preciate your being here. I have two grandchildrenone got a hep-atitis B shot and stopped breathing within an hour; the other onegot nine shots in 1 day and had a temperature of about 105 andbecame autistic, slamming his head against the wall, runningaround screaming. That is two for two. I guess maybe I am just oneof those unfortunate statistics. But I have got to tell you, I thinkthe problem is much greater than we believe, and I do believe, Ipersonally do believe the vaccines have something to do with it.Now, my position, since I am not a scientist, is really not onethat most people are going to pay much attention to, or the parentswho testified here today. But, what I do want to do is take all thescientific information that we have acquired today from you, fromall the other doctors, and submit that to the health agencies of thiscountry and ask them to do a thorough study of all of them to seeif there is any validity to what we think the problem is. If they dothat and do it thoroughly, and they report back to the Congress,it will be a real service to the American people. 477Yes, Dr. Rim land.Mr. RIMLAND. I think it is rather interesting that most of the of-ficial authorities are taking the position that the increase in autismis unrelated to the vaccine use.One of my favorite expressionsI do not know who said it; Iheard it one time, and I have tried to find out who said it, becauseI think it is extremely trueis \"The chronicle of man's progress isthe history of authority refuted.\"Mr. BURTON. Well, thank you very much.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.I have two very quick announcements. The NIH is having ameeting for parents of children with autism tomorrow morningfrom 10 a.m. to noon at the Natcher Auditorium on the NIH cam-pus in Bethesda. If you would like to attend, you are welcome toattend that.And we need to announce that the Unlocking Autism group ishaving a reception in HC-5 in the Capitol immediately after thehearing.Thank you very much. I appreciate your being here.
