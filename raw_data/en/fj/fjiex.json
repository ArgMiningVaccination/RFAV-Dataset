[A Wildlife Field Research Safety Plan template](/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wildlife_Research_Safety_Plan.docx) is available for use. The IACUC protocol, Section 22.2.5, must outline potential zoonotic diseases, physical hazards, and allergens and precautions necessary for staff to minimize the risks. - Describe the relevant safety and containment procedures that will be used to mitigate project risks and protect personnel. Consider the effect of non-target animals, the necessary safety equipment, work practices, and PPE that will be required for various tasks (e.g. capturing animals, animal inoculation). - Discuss the specific hazards/risks that you may encounter in the field associated with this experiment (e.g. potential exposure risks such as needlesticks, animal/insect bites, parasites, exotic/poisonous plants, or venomous animals).
