Medical Herbalists Marion Mackonochie, Maud Freemantle and Sarah Flower opened the shop in July 2014 to help improve access to high quality herbal remedies. Each of us has trained at university and has a degree in herbal medicine. \"We are passionate about the benefits of herbal medicine and in using herbs to help support health and wellbeing.\" Herbal Medicine is a traditional and sustainable form of natural medicine. Herbalists take a holistic approach incorporating dietary and lifestyle advice and using herbs to gently ease your body back to good health. There is an ever increasing amount of scientific evidence to support the use of herbal medicine for many minor and chronic health com- plaints, including irritable bowel syndrome, mild depression, migraine, pre-menstrual syndrome and colds and 'flu. For many people herbal remedies are a first choice though it can be difficult to know which remedy is the most suitable. Our expertise allows us to help people make an effective and safe choice. Within the shop we offer health advice and have a free drop-in mini-consultation service. We can help you to select a remedy or supplement, and can even mix a tailor-made herbal remedy specifically for you. For complex health problems full consultations are available from our herbalists at their private clinics. We stock high quality herbal remedies, nutritional supplements, herbal teas, essential oils, and natural skin care products. Brands stocked include Pukka, Salus, BioCare, Bio-Health and Lamberts because we believe in the quality that they offer and they are the products that we use ourselves. In addition to the products available to buy in the shop we also run a regular programme of educational workshops. Learning how to use herbs can be both fun and fulfilling. Check out the What's On pages for forthcoming workshops. The Open Market is a growing community of old and new ventures with a variety of interesting stalls, shops and cafes to visit. We find it a fun and vibrant place to be. When you visit our shop you can expect a friendly and professional service, safe in the knowledge that you can always see a fully trained Medical Herbalist.
