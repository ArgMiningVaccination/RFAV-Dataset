It is great smelling, gentle and natural! I have used Natural Balance products for about 20 years And I hope to use them many more years. The shampoos and conditioners are the best. My dogs coats are so soft and healthy, Their long hair is beautiful looking. We found True Blue at our local let supply store sometime ago. When we ran out we went back to replace, as we take it to our groomer, for our Westie. The store was out. So we declined a replacement and ordered it online. Was delivered quickly, no hassle. This is how we will fill our needs for our pet from now on. Our groomer says it is better than what he uses. We love this for our golden! She is so soft and the smell is the best! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHAMPOO. IT LATHERS SO WELL. BEST I HAVE USED. WILL "}
