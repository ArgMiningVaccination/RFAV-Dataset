As the society is aging, their pathological meaning has been changing. An increasing number of patients are displaying symptoms of systemic disease and so we need to pay more attention to immunologic aggression in our medical treatment. For this reason, we focused on natural products. Kampo consists of natural herbs\u2014roots and barks\u2014and has more than 3000 years of history. It was originated in China as traditional medicine and introduced to Japan. Over the years, Kampo medicine in Japan has been formulated in a way to suit Japan's natural features and ethnic characteristics. Based on this traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, we have manufactured a Kampo gargle and Mastic Gel dentifrice. In order to practically utilize the effectiveness of mastic, we have developed a dentifrice (product name: IMPLA CARE) treated mastic; pathogenic factors 1. Introduction Kampo medicine in Japan is the Oriental medicine which was originally brought from China through east Asia and the Korean peninsula as the ancient Chinese medicine. During the Nara period of Japan (AD 710-784), Japanese envoys were sent to Tang Dynasty (AD616-907) under the name of Kentoshi and it became a channel that Chinese medicine was directly brought to Japan. In the Kamakura period (AD1185-1333), it made a progress to become more practical medicine by being adopted more to Japan's natural environment, rather than a simple copy of Chinese medicine. In the Muromachi period (AD 1336-1573), a Japanese whose name was Sanki Tashiro studied in China during its Ming dynasty (AD1368-1644) and created the academic foundation of the Japanese Kampo medicine. Kampo was rst used in higher social classes but since the 15th century it has provided general people natural material-based medicine. In the Edo period (AD 1603-1867), Western medicine was introduced to Japan from Netherland and was called Rangaku, innovating special characteristics such as abdominal diagnosis and contributed to the developments of medical diagnosis and treatment [ 1-3]. On the other hand, the traditional medicine which was primarily using herbal medicines was called Kampo Medicines 2019 ,6, 34; doi:10.3390/medicines6010034 www.mdpi.com/journal/medicinesMedicines 2019 ,6, 34 2 of 31 medicine. In 1883, the Japanese government promulgated the regulation of the medical license that only those doctors who have mastered the Western medicine could prescribe the Kampo medicines and the Kampo medicine declined since then except for the practice by some facilities or individuals. In 1927, the book of Kokan Igaku (traditional Japanese and Chinese medicine) by Kyushin Yumoto was published and it triggered the subsequent revival of Kampo medicine. Following that in 1950, the academic society of \"Japan Society of Oriental Medicine\" of Kokan Igaku was established, which became the association of Oriental medicine including acupuncture and moxibustion treatments. Under the guidance of the Japan Medical Association, Kitasato University Oriental Medicine Research Centre was founded in 1972 and it has played a central role in the education of Oriental Medicine. Further in 2001, the model curriculum of medical education newly incorporated a course of study for \"being capable of explaining Japanese and Chinese medicines.\" At present, all medical schools in Japan have the courses of study for Kampo medicine or Oriental medicine as part of their education program. Kampo medicine has a unique character, which is different from Western medicine. Kampo uses as a combination drug of various herbal plants that have complementary physiological activities. In fact, 148 Kampo formulations are used for medicinal treatments and are covered by the Japanese National Health Insurance Program [ 4]. Since 2012, seven kinds of Kampo formulations were approved by Japan Dental Association within the National Health Insurance Drug Price Standard related with dental treatment [ 5]. In 2015, Kampo Education Plan of Dentistry was sent from the Japan Dental Association to all dental universities [ 6]. At the same time, the rst author of this article (S.W.) established the Yokohama Kampo Dentistry Study Group for the continuing education of Kampo. This group has held 18 research sessions and symposiums by calling a special lecturer of Kampo and is planning to publish a side reader of 11 Kampo preparations for dental students from the Nanzando publishing company. There are two academic societies on Kampo in Japan: The Japan Society for Oriental Medicine and Japan Dental Society of Oriental Medicine. The latter showed previously different direction about qigong and massage but now changing to the same direction with the former. Kampo prescriptions in dentistry has special characteristics due to the diverse symptoms such as the pain caused by the bad bite alignment or malocclusion (exogenous cause) and unidentied complaints. For Kampo prescriptions, it is important to understand the symptoms, by considering these special characteristics. It has also become known that the negative feedback functionality would not work when malocclusion and occlusal destruction become chronic with the sympathetic-nerve predominant state. We expect that Western medicine and the Oriental medicine will be used selectively and in parallel in many of the clinical cases in dentistry to ensure the best results for primary cares and that it would contribute to the dentistry medicine going forward. In this review article, we rstly focus on the basic theory of Kampo medicine and then its biological activities and clinical effects in the dental treatments. 2. Basic Theory of Kampo Medicine 2.1. Concept of Oriental Medicine Western medicine is a proof medicine that is based on the medical evidence, while Oriental medicine is a traditional medicine that has accumulated the evidence based on the experiences [ 7]. The modern medicine has made great advances by accumulating scientic evidences but it was at the same time a challenge to the limit of the medicine and it has added a new dimension of problems such as the side effects of medicines to cope up with the aggravation of diseases. In recent years, medical evidences of Kampo prescription (traditional medicine in Japan based on the traditional Chinese medicine), which is one of the pharmacotherapies of Oriental medicine, has become widely known. It is making it possible to include Kampo in the pharmacotherapy of the modern medicine, in consideration of its role as biological response modiers (BRMs) of the vital balance. Oriental medicine was generated from the concept that the natural world consists of the opposing axis of Yin (Table A1) or \"non-resistant\" and Yang or \"resistant,\" where the relativity of these axes maintains theMedicines 2019 ,6, 34 3 of 31 qualitative balance of the workings of mother nature [ 3]. This principle is therefore called the \" Yin-Yang theory.\" In the Kampo therapy, the body state and each internal organ are divided into YinorYang and it treats the patient so the yin-yang is balanced and can maintain the homeostasis (Figure 1). Medicines 2019 , 6, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 32 3 medicine was generated from the concept that the natural world consists of the opposing axis of Yin (Table A1) or \"non-resistant\" and Yang or \"resistant,\" where the relati vity of these axes maintains the qualitative balance of the workings of mother nature [3]. This principle is therefore called the \" Yin- Yang theory.\" In the Kampo therapy, the body st ate and each internal organ are divided into Yin or Yang and it treats the patient so the yin-yang is balanced and can maintain the homeostasis (Figure 1). Figure 1. Concepts of Kampo therapy. Kampo therapy be gins with the knowledge of constitutional characteristics of patient's body. In-Yo or Yin-Yang : When the switch-over between two representative autonomic nerves, the sympathetic nerves ( yang) and the parasympathetic nerves (yin ), is good, the yin-yang balance is kept well. Kyo-Jits or asthenia and sthenia show ph ysical strength, constitutional characteristics of body and the strength of resistan ce against disease. The re action differs, depending on their Kyo-Sho or Jitsu-Sho. It is categorized into Jitsu-Sho (excess symptom) , Kyo-Sho (deficiency symptom) and Chukan-Sho (symptom in-between the two). Kan-Netsu or chills and fever: Kan is Yin while Netsu is Yang. They are always in a relative relation. When Yin deteriorates, Yang predominates, called Netsu-sho (heat syndrome). 2.2. Differences from the Western Medicine Oriental medicine and Western me dicine are both medical sciences, fundamentally and equally. Oriental medicine identifies the disease mainly based on the pathological condition at the time of diagnosis. It understands that a part of the body appeals the problem and it spreads to the entire body and shows the symptom in that part. Therefore, the treatment aims at alleviating the symptom while improving the pathological condition itself. This pathological condition is called Sho or Kampo Diagnosis. The Western medicine diagnoses based on the demonstrated symptom and it emphasizes the importance of the examinations in order to find out the condition of the appearing symptoms, then gives it a name and treats it accordingly. On th e other hand, Kampo medicine improves the symptom by improving the pathological condition presented in the form of Sho [2,8]. Sho is the measure to know the characteristics, size and depth of the dise ase, which would indicate the cause of the disease and the treatment, is given by finding out the cause of the pathological condition by Sho. From this, Oriental medicine makes it possible to treat the patient as expressed in the phrase \"Different treatments for one disease; identical treatment fo r different diseases.\" It means that different treatments will be given for the same disease name of patients if the Sho (Kampo diagnosis) is different. Likewise, the same treatm ent will be given to the different disease names of patients, if the Sho is the same. Here in this article, the disease na me means the name of the disease under the modern medical science (Figure 2).

On the other hand, Hyo-Ri (supercies and interior) indicates where the disease exists in the body and shows the depth of Sho, depending on the part of the body. Hyo-riis a unique concept of Kampo medicine, which indicates the seriousness of the disease, based on the location and depth of the disease. According to the classic literature \"Shokan-ron,\" Yinand Yang are further divided into 3 layers by the degree of development and it calls them the \"Three Yin\" and the \"Three Yang \"Medicines 2019 ,6, 34 5 of 31 of diseases [ 8]. The Three Yang stage indicates Hyo or the surface of the body such as skin but also includes the parts of the body that show the Hyo symptoms such as chill, fever, headache, joint pain and sweat. The three Yinstage indicates Ri. Mostly Sho's of the internal organs, including heart, lungs and digestive apparatus, are shown, where the symptoms are, for example, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, fullness of the abdomen, stomach tension. The middle part between the Hyo-Ri is called Han-Hyo-Ri or mesodermal. Medicines 2019 , 6, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 32 5 Figure 3. Condition categories of Yin-Yang , Kyo-sho and Netsu-Kan in the body.

The living body has physiological functions to maintain the home ostasis of the organism against the changes of internal and external environment. This function is called Shoki or healthy Ki. Shoki is a function which would defend the body against disease and would induce natural healing ability, where the natural healing ability would seek for the harmony of Ki, Ketsu and Sui (vital energy, blood circulation and aqua). In contrast, the factor that attempts to destroy the homeostasis is called Ja or Byoja or stress or pathogen. It induces the climate, emotion or virus to cause various physical abnormalities which would lead to diseases. Causes of disease are categorized into endogenous, exogenous and other factors. Endogenous factor means that the cause of dise ase comes from the inside of body. It may be common emotions of human beings. It is a physiological phenomenon and may be quintessential in life. However, it can cause abnormality in the functions of internal organs, when mental stress persists or when a sudden strong shock hits us, be cause it would collapse the balance of Yin, Yang , Ki and Ketsu on such occasions. It is called the Seven Emotions -joy, anger, anxiety, worry, grief, apprehension and fear. Exogenous factor means that ja invades the body from outside. Diseases occur influenced by the mental or physical changes when the body cannot ac cept the natural environment such as pathogens, severe natural environment and sudden climate changes. It is called the Six Pathogenic Agents - wind, cold, heat, humidity, dryness and fire (fever). These are other factors, which would cause diseas es due to other causes such as inadequate eating-drinking, fatigue, overwork, injury, poisoning, parasite and heredity. 2.5. Explanation of Ki, Ketsu, Oketsu and Sui The concept of Ki (vital energy), Ketsu (blood/blood circulatory function) and Sui (aqua) is the fundamental concept to understand th e Kampo medicine [2,8] (Figure 4).

Explanation of Ki, Ketsu, Oketsu and Sui The concept of Ki(vital energy), Ketsu (blood/blood circulatory function) and Sui(aqua) is the fundamental concept to understand the Kampo medicine [2,8] (Figure 4). Kiindicates yang and Ketsu reversibly show Jitsu-Sho(excessive) and Kyo-Sho (deciency) (Table 3).Medicines 2019 ,6, 34 6 of 31 Medicines 2019 , 6, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 32 6 Figure 4.

Classifications of Ki, Ketsu and Sui. Yin Yang Ketsu Sui Ki 2.5.1. Ki, Vital Energy Ki is the source of energy of the entire biological activities and it circulates blood and bodily fluid in the whole body [8]. Therefore, the inhibition of the workings of Ki would inhibit the workings of Ketsu (blood circulation) and Sui (bodily liquid) and thus a disease would occur. Ki belongs to yang . When these elements are excessively active, it is called Jitsu or excess and is called Kyo or deficiency when these are deficient. Excessive Ki is called Ki-Gyaku (ki-Jitsu ) or hyperactive ki. It is called Ki-Tai when stagnated due to over excess, while Ki-Kyo when under hypersecretion. 2.5.2 . Ketsu , Blood Circulation Blood circulates through the body and supplies nutrition to the five parenchymatous viscera (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) and the six hollow viscera [gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder and triple heater ( sansho , a passage that controls the flow of air, blood and water)]. Ki and ketsu are interdependent each other - Ki warms up the body in Yang and ketsu nourishes the body in Yin. There are three Ketsu , namely, Ketsu-Netsu (Ketsu-Jitsu) of blood-heat shows hematemesis, bl oody stools, nose bleeds, for example and shows bleeding from tissue, constipation and yellowish urine [8]. When heated blood ( ketsu-netsu ) goes up to the upper body, it causes not only oketsu (blood stagnation) but also affects emotions such as irritation. Blood deficiency is the decay of the recuperation ability of blood. It causes so-called anaemia but also shows other dysfunction such as anorexia and weakening of digestion and absorption and these are governed by Ki. Blood will not circulate the body if Ki is insufficient to operate the blood vessels. This Ki in each part of the body is called Ei-ki or Yin-energy. Ki initiates functions of each organ of the body. Ketsu belongs to Yin. The concept of Oketsu or blood stagnation is the most important concept. Oketsu is a pathological change that would cause diseases when the blood is stagnated in the entire body or in a local tissue (Figure 5).

Therapeutic Effect of Juzentaihoto Periodontitis is the most common chronic inflammatory disease in humans and is characterized by alveolar bone loss and connective tissue destruction. Periodontitis is exacerbated by risk factors including age, gender, smoking, systematic diseases and psychological stress [ 10]. The stress response mediates the interaction between unfavourable psychological conditions and inflammatory periodontal disease. There is a higher prevalence of chronic destructive periodontal disease in individuals with psychological stress, which may be associated with acute necrotizing periodontal disease [ 11]. Psychological stress downregulates the cellular immune response, which may link the stress to periodontal disease [ 12]. Herbal medicines, such as Juzentaihoto (JTT), have good therapeutic effects for stress-related systematic diseases and minimal side effects. JTT consists for anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. It is widely used to prevent cancer metastasis and infection in immunocompromised patients [ 13]. We had examined the efcacy of JTT to prevent periodontitis. 4.1.

(Presented in Kanagawa Dental College Society 53rd General Assembly: A case in which Kampo and denture adjustment was successful for patients complaining of denture). Photos were taken, after obtaining the informed consent from the patient. (Watanabe S, unpublished data) When making dental prosthesis, it is necessary to pay attention to the intraoral environment. In the case above, we observed the lower jaw denture floated due to tongue oedema and swelling and that the denture instability caused the occlusal pain and dysfunction of masticatory. We therefore prescribed Kampo medicines that would improve these symptoms. In this clinical case, we considered that the improvement of sui-tai (fluid stagnation) should be the target of Hyo-Chi , a local and symptomatic treatment, to improve the tongue oedema, so GRS was administered. However, we could not get the expected results, so JTT was also administered in the morning and before going to bed and it presented the trend of improvements fr om the next day. JTT is a Kampo medicine for hon- chi, that is, the systemic treatment of the fundamental cause of the disease. It is often observed in the dentistry and intraoral medicine that patient's cond itions change until the symptom finally surfaces due to the chronical deficiencies. Especially, the entire body is psychologically and mentally affected when malocclusion exists. Under the situation that malocclusion lasts long, it is known that glucocorticoid appears in blood chronically due to the chronical stress from the malocclusion which would induce the malfunction of negative feedba ck. The Oriental medicine explains that the symptoms of Ki and Ketsu occur and they worsen as the time elapses. In our case above, GRS manifested its effect at early timi ng by the simultaneous administration of JTT. It not only cured the oedema of the tongue but also mentally stabilized the patient. JTT is known to improve the pathological condition of the blood circulation and mental stability.

Therapeutic Effects of Jixueteng 5.1. Bactericidal Effect of Jixueteng Jixueteng is prepared from the dried stems of Spatholobus suberectus (S. suberectus ) Dunn of the family Leguminosae. Jixueteng has beneficial pharmacological properties such as increasing circulation, analgesia and the number of red and white blood cells [18]. Jixueteng contains various types of [20] and antioxidant activities [21]. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is decreased by Jixueteng in a dose-dependent manner [22]. Therefore, we focused on the bactericidal effect of Jixueteng on oral bacteria. were grown in BHI broth and suspended in PBS to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Fifty \u00b5L of bacterial suspension was exposed for 1, 15 and 60 min in the presence of 0, 0.2, 2.0 or 8% Figure 13. Changes of the tongue surfaces at 1 ( A), 4 ( B), 8 ( C) or 12 ( D) months after GRS + JTT treatment. (Presented in Kanagawa Dental College Society 53rd General Assembly: A case in which Kampo and denture adjustment was successful for patients complaining of denture). Photos were taken, after obtaining the informed consent from the patient. (Watanabe S, unpublished data) When making dental prosthesis, it is necessary to pay attention to the intraoral environment. In the case above, we observed the lower jaw denture floated due to tongue oedema and swelling and that the denture instability caused the occlusal pain and dysfunction of masticatory. We therefore prescribed Kampo medicines that would improve these symptoms. In this clinical case, we considered that the improvement of sui-tai (fluid stagnation) should be the target of Hyo-Chi , a local and symptomatic treatment, to improve the tongue oedema, so GRS was administered. However, we could not get the expected results, so JTT was also administered in the morning and before going to bed and it presented the trend of improvements from the next day. JTT is a Kampo medicine for hon-chi , that is, the systemic treatment of the fundamental cause of the disease. It is often observed in the dentistry and intraoral medicine that patient's conditions change until the symptom nally surfaces due to the chronical deciencies. Especially, the entire body is psychologically and mentally affected when malocclusion exists. Under the situation that malocclusion lasts long, it is known that glucocorticoid appears in blood chronically due to the chronical stress from the malocclusion which would induce the malfunction of negative feedback. The Oriental medicine explains that the symptoms of Kiand Ketsu occur and they worsen as the time elapses. In our case above, GRS manifested its effect at early timing by the simultaneous administration of JTT. It not only cured the oedema of the tongue but also mentally stabilized the patient. JTT is known to improve the pathological condition of the blood circulation and mental stability. When the condition of the disease is found difcult to improve, Kampo medicine of hon-chi (treatment of fundamental cause), in combination would relieve the symptoms. 5. Therapeutic Effects of Jixueteng 5.1. Bactericidal Effect of Jixueteng Jixueteng is prepared from the dried stems of Spatholobus suberectus (S. suberectus ) Dunn of the family Leguminosae. has benecial pharmacological properties such as increasing circulation, analgesia and the number of red and white blood cells [ 18].Jixueteng contains various types of flavonoids such as flavone, isoflavones, flavanones, flavanonols and chalcone [ Flavonoids products that show antibacterial [ 20] and antioxidant activities [ 21]. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is decreased by Jixueteng in a dose-dependent manner [ 22]. Therefore, we focused on the bactericidal effect of Jixueteng on oral bacteria. grown in BHI broth and suspended in PBS to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. Fifty \u0016L of bacterial suspension was exposed for 1, 15 and 60 min in the presence of 0, 0.2, 2.0 or 8% Jixueteng extract. The same volume of PBS was used as a control. At the end of the incubation period, a 10-fold serial dilution was inoculated onto BHI sheep blood agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37\u000eC for 7 days. The bactericidal effect ofJixueteng was determined by counting the number of bacterial cells. Jixueteng extract reduced theMedicines 2019 ,6, 34 14 of 31 number of viable bacterial cells, such as S. mutans (Figure 14A), P . gingivalis ( Figure 14D )(Figure 14).

At the end of the incubation period, a 10-fold serial dilution was inoculated onto BHI sheep blood agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. The bactericidal effect of Jixueteng was determined by counting the number of bacterial cells. Jixueteng extract reduced the number of viable bacterial cells, such as S. mutans (Figure 14A), P. gingivalis (Figure 14B), nucleatum Figure 14D ) (Figure 14). In particular, the bactericidal effects of Jixueteng against F. nucleatum (Figure 14D) was higher than those of other oral bacteria. After treatment with 8% Jixueteng extract for 60 min, the number of P. gingivalis was decreased from 4.61 \u00d7 109 2.90 per [23]. Gram-negative periodontal pathogens are late colonizers of dental plaque and promote inflammatory tissue destruction in the oral cavity [24]. Thus, Jixueteng extract may act selectively on periodontal bacteria and break down dental plaque accumulation. Figure 14.

Inhibitory Effect of Jixuet eng on Osteoblast Differentiation In periodontitis, several cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and RANKL (receptor tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-family member, binds to its receptor RANK, which is on the surface of osteoclasts and preosteoclasts. The interaction between RANK and RANKL signalling is important for osteoclastogenesis [25]. To examine the influence of Jixueteng on osteoclastogenesis, we used mouse co-cultured cells in the presence of 1 ,25-(OH) 2D3 and dexamethasone. Jixueteng extracts were added to co-cultured cells at a final concentration of 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001% and 0.0001% and cultivated for 7 days under 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 7 days, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing three of more nucl ei were counted as osteoclasts. The treatment of Jixueteng extract (at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.01%) significantly inhibited osteoclast formation (P < 0.01). Addition of 0.1% extract completely inhibited TRAP-positive cells and multinucleated osteoclasts. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Jixueteng on osteoclast surviv al was determined by mouse co-cultured cells in the presence of RANKL and PGE 2. The number of osteoclasts was decreased with 0.001 to 0.1 mg/mL Jixueteng in a dose-dependent manner [26].

Inhibitiory Effect of Alveolar Bone Resorption by Jixueteng on Mice Experimental Periodontitis Flavonoids are effective ingredients for the inhibition of inflammatory bone resorption [ 27]. We evaluated the inhibitory effect of alveolar bone resorption by Jixueteng using an experimentalMedicines 2019 ,6, 34 15 of 31 periodontitis model, under the guideline of the intramural Committee of Ethics on Animal Experiments. Fifty-four male C57BL/6N 4-week-old mice were used. Mice were given sulfamethoxazole (1 mg/mL) and trimethoprim (200 mg/mL) in their drinking water for 4 days to reduce original oral flora followed by 3 days of an antibiotic-free period before bacterial infection. The bacteria used was P . gingivalis A, which was inoculated in BHI broth under anaerobic conditions. Animals were randomly divided into the following three groups: Group A received only 5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (sham-infected group), group B was infected orally with P . gingivalis and group C was administered Jixueteng extract in drinking water and was infected orally with P . gingivalis. Each mouse in group B and group C was infected orally with P . gingivalis , which was suspended in 5% CMC and received 0.1 ml (1.0\u00021010cells/mL ) of bacterial suspension. The bacterial infection was given by oral gavage (three times) at 48 h intervals. The mice were sacriced 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the nal bacterial infection to examine the change in alveolar bone resorption every 2 weeks. The left sides of the horizontal alveolar bone resorption around the maxillary molars were evaluated morphometrically as dry specimens to measure horizontal alveolar bone loss. The distance between the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and the alveolar bone crest (ABC) was measured at seven palatal sites per mouse. Measurements were made under a dissecting microscope (40 \u0002magnication) tted with a digital high-denition system, standardized to provide measurements in millimetres. The right sides of the upper jaws were analysed for histology. The samples were xed, decalcied and embedded in parafn. The parafn section was cut serially into 5-mm sections in a mesial-distal direction. The sections were stained for haematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and TRAP . In particular, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were dened as osteoclasts and examined under an optical microscope (40 \u0002magnication). The number of osteoclasts was counted in the area of the periodontal tissue between the mesial root of the rst molar and the distal root of the third molars. We found apparent horizontal bone loss in C57BL/6N mice challenged with P . gingivalis (group B) but not in the control (group A) or the Jixueteng -administered group (group C) (Figure 15A). Figure 15B shows the mean values \u0006standard error (SEM) of the CEJ to ABC derived from seven measurement sites in weeks 2, 4 and 6 after infection. Induction of alveolar bone loss was more reproducible with an infection by P . gingivalis by oral gavage (group B) (p< 0.01) than in the sham-infected control (group A) 4 weeks after infection, whereas no difference was observed 2 weeks after infection. In all experimental groups, the maximum resorption of alveolar bone was observed at the end of the experiment and the mean bone levels of the sham-infected control (group A) and P . gingivalis infection group (group B) were 0.194 \u00060.001 mm and 0.228 \u00060.010 mm, respectively. Alveolar bone loss was signicantly lower in the Jixueteng group (group C) ( p< 0.01) than that of group B in weeks 4 and 6. The mean bone level of group C in week 6 was 0.188 \u00060.003 mm, which was comparable to that of the control group A (Figure 15) [28]. By histopathological examination, osteoclasts were observed along the alveolar septum in mice periodontal tissues (Figure 16). Table 6 shows the number of osteoclasts in the alveolar bone crest. No signicant difference in the number of osteoclasts was observed among the experimental groups 2 weeks after infection. Table 6. Effects of Jixueten g on osteoclast formation in periodontal tissues.

However, improvement in degeneration of these vascular networks and prolongation of the vascular plexus were observed by administration of Jixueteng (C). Cited from [28] with permission.Medicines 2019 ,6, 34 17 of 31 After 4 weeks, the number of osteoclasts in the P . gingivalis -infected group B was signicantly higher than that of sham-infected group (group A) and the Jixueteng -administered group (group C) (p< 0.01) [ 28].P . gingivalis has virulent factors that induce inflammatory responses and alveolar bone resorption [ 29]. This bacterium also invades and survives in host cells, inducing a network of inflammatory responses [ 30].P . gingivalis also increases the likelihood of systemic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 31]. We previously reported that Jixueteng improves gingival vascular a periodontitis [ 28] (Figure 15). Jixueteng may inhibit the adherence and colonization of P . gingivalis in mice oral cavities. Therefore, our ndings suggest that Jixueteng reduces the inflammatory destruction in periodontitis. Jixueteng has bactericidal effects against oral bacteria, inhibits the osteoclastogenesis and reduces the alveolar bone resorption induced byP . gingivalis .Jixueteng reduces the inflammatory tissue destruction in periodontitis and Jixueteng may be a useful ingredient to prevent periodontitis. 6. Therapeutic Effects of Mastic 6.1. History of Mastic (Kampo Name: Yo-Nyuko olibanum) Mastic is the resin collected from the naturally growing trees in only Chios Island in southeast Aegean Sea of Greece. It was initially called frankincense. Mastic has a long history, it is written in the Old Testament (Genesis 37:25) and many ancient Greek literatures mentioned the medical effect of mastic. Christopher Columbus, before he stayed in Portugal, visited Chios Island during his voyage to the Orient as recorded in his diary in 1474-1475 and he described about mastic; it is sticky sap extracted from tree and becomes resin when solidied. There has been a habit of chewing this in Greece since more than 5000 years ago and it was known that those people who had this habit rarely had digestive diseases. In China's classical Kampo medicine masterpiece of \"Zu-Kei Honzo\" (masterpiece of plant diagrams) also described it as Kun-roku-ko , kuduruka. The substance called frankincense today is the resin from the trees of Boswellia genus of the Burseraceae family that grow in north-eastern Africa or Arabian coast and it is different from the mastic from Greece. Traditional frankincense to present is the same kuduruka in the book of Honzo and they grow in the Mediterranean coast areas. Resin from the tree that belongs to the Anacardiaceae family is considered MASTICHE RESINA . This is called orYo-Nyuko in Kampo and is known as Pistacia lentiscus locally (Figure 17). Medicines 2019 , 6, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 32 18 MASTICHE RESINA . This is called \"mastic\" or Yo-Nyuko in Kampo and is known as Pistacia lentiscus locally (Figure 17). Figure 17. Mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus ). (photos taken at Chios island, Greece, 2007) It is empirically proven that herbs that are used in folk therapies, including the herbal medicines constituting Kampo, have multif unctional medicinal effects. Mastic resin has a unique shape and various efficacy and has been used to promote heal th from old time. In addition, mastic resin has been used in chewing gums as a material for or al health and hygiene and indicated antiplaque activities. Recently in Japan, mastic has been receiving attention as material for oral cares and many companies are developing and selling mastic-formulated oral gels for toothbrushing paste. Mastic has been forming a market of high-end products of oral cares. Also, dentists have been paying attentions to its effect and mastic is securing its position in the clinical medicine as the primary care product for oral cavity cares. To cope with the improvements of adult diseases and systemic diseases associated with the oral hygiene in the ag ing society of Japan and further to improve the oral health in Asia, a group of dentists launched an NPO called \"Mastic Clinical Study Group.\" It has been running the public awareness building prog rams of the oral hygiene including preventive dentistry. Presently, many dentists are making use of mastic in the clinical studies and are promoting its use in the treatment of patients and to spread the awareness of the primary cares. 6.2.

Antimicrobial Activity Compared with the group, which used the PBS mouthwash, the group that used the mastic- formulated gums showed the significant inhibition of the increase of oral bacteria (Figure 18). Compared with the group that used the gums without mastic formulation, it inhibited the increase of the pathogenic bacteria and the effect was equivalent of ben zalkonium chloride. Figure 17.

Among 5 extracts, ethyl acetate extract showed the highest TS values (TS = 2.6), although its values were two-order lower than that of doxorubicin (TS = 244.7) [ 34]. However, mastic caspase-3 activation, decline in the intracellular concentration of putrescine) in HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia, while polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Mastic inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG)E 2, as well as expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase cells. hydroxyl radical more potently than NO and superoxide radicals. The narrow range of effective concentration of mastic due to its cytotoxicity may limit its potential application as an anti-inflammatory agent [45]. 6.3.5. Inhibition of CYPs with Pistacia lentiscus oil 100 \u0016L per mice did not show any undesirable effect on the function of kidney and liver but signicantly inhibited the enzyme activity and expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4, especially in the liver tissue [ 46]. The result suggests the possibility that when mastic is used in combination with other pharmacological agents, the biological action of the latter may be more enhanced. Among ve masic fractions, n-hexane extract exhibited the highest CYP3A4-inhibitory activity (IC50= 3.1 \u0016g/mL), followed by methanol extract \u0016g/ml) nally, methanol extract (refluxed) (IC 50= \u0016g/ml).

Development of A Dentifrice Gel Containing A Mastic Resin and Jixueteng Periodontitis is the second most common dent al disease worldwide after dental decay. Periodontitis is caused by microorganisms that adhere and grow on tooth surfaces and by an aggressive immune response against these microor ganisms. The mouth contains a wide variety of oral bacteria, which is an ideal environment for their growth. Nutrition is supplied from food residues and saliva, nitrogen and amino acids mix in gingival crevicular fluids. Periodontitis is triggered by a complex microbial biofilm in the subgingival area that houses over 700 bacterial species and phylotypes [47]. Bacteria from the red complex group, such as P. gingivalis , predominate in gingivitis and periodontal disease patients by PCR analysis. Three microorganisms are mainly associated with periodontal disease, Treponema denticola , Tannerella forsythia and P. gingivalis and they usually form a complex called red complex bacteria (RCB). These bacteria are Gram negative, non- Figure 20. The clinical observation of periodontal tissue around the upper 4th and 5th teeth before and after treatment with laser and mastic gel.

Development of A Dentifrice Gel Containing A Mastic Resin and Jixueteng Periodontitis is the second most common dental disease worldwide after dental decay. Periodontitis is caused by microorganisms that adhere and grow on tooth surfaces and by an aggressive immune response against these microorganisms. The mouth contains a wide variety of oral bacteria, which is an ideal environment for their growth. Nutrition is supplied from food residues and saliva, nitrogen and amino acids mix in gingival crevicular fluids. Periodontitis is triggered by a complex microbial biolm in the subgingival area that houses over 700 bacterial species and phylotypes [ 47]. Bacteria from the red complex group, such as P . gingivalis , predominate in gingivitis and periodontal disease patients by PCR analysis. Three microorganisms are mainly associated with periodontal disease, Treponema denticola ,Tannerella forsythia and P . gingivalis and they usually form a complex called red complex bacteria (RCB). These bacteria are Gram negative, non-spore-forming anaerobic organisms and they may be found as pure or mixed infections [ 48]. RCB possess several virulence factors including mbriae, proteinases, exopolysaccharides and hemin-binding proteins [ 49]. RCB have been detected in both subgingival plaque and in the apical root canal and cause periodontal and endodontic diseases [ 48,53,54].P . gingivalis is a pathogen that causes periodontal disease, which is a common chronic inflammatory disease [55-57]. Jixueteng is a herbal medicine with pharmacological properties, such as increasing circulation, analgesia and the number of red and white blood cells and is composed of the dried stems of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn and Millettia dielsiana Harms, both family Leguminosae [ 58,59].Jixueteng has potent local anti-infection effects on oral indigenous bacteria and inhibits alveolar bone loss [ 23,39]. These ndings suggest that Jixueteng is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for periodontal disease because of its antibacterial and immune activities and its ability to improve circulation. However, Jixueteng has not been clinically used in the oral eld and its effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflamed regions and the detailed mechanisms underlying these pharmacological actions remain unclear. ROS is involved in various physiological and pathological events. Overproduction of ROS causes oxidative damage to biomolecules, such as lipids, proteins and DNA, which ultimately results in many chronic diseases in humans such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, post-ischemic perfusion injury, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular diseases, chronic inflammation, stroke, septic shock, aging and other degenerative diseases [60,61]. Because, Jixueteng extract inhibits osteoclast differentiation and survival in a dose-dependent manner, neutralizes oxygen species and improves blood flow, we developed a dentifrice containing Jixueteng in this study. However, Jixueteng alone did not have a satisfactory bactericidal effect on periodontopathic bacteria and fungi. Therefore, the antimicrobial effect was supplemented with a mastic, which effectively suppresses pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, as a result of searching for plant-derived components that suppress periodontopathic bacteria, we found that antibacterial lotuses had comprehensive and effective antibacterial effects on pathogenic bacteria and fungi. We are commercializing a dentifrice containing these ingredients and named it \"IMPLA CARE\" (Figure 19). At our hospital, dental hygienists do not invasively remove dental calculus in primary care. Patients were supplied with an IMPLA CARE at night-time and the dental calculus was removed after the gums were healthy and tight. Improving gingiva before treatment with IMPLA CARE reduced the risk of bacteraemia. IMPLA CARE was important for subsequent treatment, postoperative management and may help prevent systemic diseases such as diabetes, cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction. We investigated natural products with antimicrobial activity. First, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Jixueteng ,Sasa veitchii and lotus on oral bacteria were measured. The natural products were dissolved in sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and two-foldMedicines 2019 ,6, 34 23 of 31 serial dilutions were aliquoted in small volumes in microwell plates. Bacterial cells were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with hemin (5 \u0016g/mL), vitamin K 1(0.2\u0016g/mL) and yeast extract (5 mg/mL) under anaerobic conditions (CO 2: 10%, H 2: 10%, N 2: 80%) at 37\u000eC for 18 h. Bacterial cells were washed and suspended in PBS to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. The bacterial suspension was exposed for 40 h to two-fold serial dilutions of the natural products. The same volume of PBS was used as a control. Jixueteng had bactericidal effects on S. mutans, L. casei, S. gordonii, F. nucleatum and S. aureus .Sasa veitchii had a strong bactericidal effect on the fungus C. albicans (Table 9). Therefore, the IMPLA CARE contained a mixture of Jixueteng ,Sasa veitchii , grapefruit and lotus in the mastic resin. Table 9. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ve natural products.

Oral health is related to life-style such as diet in many ways. The development of dental caries requires high sugar intakes [ 62]. On the other hand, the high consumptions of smoking and alcohol and the loss of vitamin D affects metabolic functions of periodontal tissue and induce periodontitis. Previous review has been reported that psychological stress reduces human immune system and promotes chronic inflammation in periodontal tissue [ 63]. Our result demonstrated that JTX affected the correlation between restraint stress and bacteria-induced periodontal destruction [ 6,14]. Recently, psychological stress is a risk factor of toothache, especially non-odontogenic pain [ 64]. Odontogenic pain is generally derived from pulpal or periodontal tissue. However, non-odontogenic pain is not often originated from the orofacial regions. The characteristics of non-odontogenic pain indicate various types of symptoms; very mild, intermittent and severe, sharp pain and continuous. The general dentists are difcult to be specied the pain regions, that confuse the exact pain control in any case.
