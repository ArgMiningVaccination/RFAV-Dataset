Courses numbered in the 100s, and some in the 200s, are introductory in material and/or approach. Generally courses numbered in the 200s and 300s are intermediate and advanced in approach. Courses numbered in the 400s and 500s are most advanced. Although courses are normally limited to 40 students, some courses have lower enrollment limits due to space constraints (e.g., in laboratories or studios) or to specific pedagogical needs (e.g., special projects, small-group discussions, additional writing assignments). For example, writing-intensive courses are normally limited to 20 students, and seminars are normally limited to 12. Enrollment limits mean that a student might not always be able to take a course that he or she wishes to take. To satisfy pedagogical needs, departments may set priorities to govern entrance into courses limited in enrollment.\" The term in which the course will be offered is indicated by the letter immediately following the course number: F for fall semester, and S for spring semester. F,S designates a course offered in both fall and spring semesters. Su designates a course comprising a summer field trip. Courses with bracketed numbers will not be offered during 2013-14. In most cases, the description indicates the next date the course will be offered. A single three-digit number preceding a course description indicates that the course may be elected for a single term. Most offerings are of this type. Two three-digit numbers separated by a hyphen indicate that normally the course will be elected for two terms. For such courses, a student may not enter the second term without having taken the first, unless otherwise indicated. A course designated as open to a certain class (e.g., \"Open to sophomores\") is also open to all higher classes. A course with no statement concerning class eligibility is open to all students. Unless otherwise stated, all courses meet for three 50-minute or two 75-minute class periods each week. In the list of faculty members for each department, the letters (F,S) following a name indicate terms of leave or off-campus teaching. The following letters denote faculty members who are teaching in the following programs: ACC (Associated Colleges in China); AYS (Academic Year in Spain); DC (Term in Washington); JYF (Junior Year in France); MFE (Mellon Faculty Exchange); NYC (New York City Program).

Carter Angel David Nieves Nigel Westmaas The Africana Studies Department focuses on the historical transformation of African peoples as they spread throughout the Atlantic World and beyond. Central to the department is the exploration of the experiences of African peoples with subjugation and liberation as well as their struggle for self-determination and self-expression. A concentration in Africana studies consists of 11 courses: 220, 221 (or History 141 for the Classes of 2010, 2011 and 2012), 301, 381 or 382, one course focusing on gender and sexuality at the 200 or 300-level, one 400-level seminar, 549 (beginning with the Class of 2013), 550 and three approved electives. Only one 100-level course will be accepted and the other two electives must be at or above the 200- level. Concentrators are encouraged to have a basic working knowledge of an appropriate language other than English. The department will accept study abroad and/or coursework in overseas programs toward the concentration with the approval of the chair. Before electing a concentration in Africana studies, students must meet with the chair to design a program of study, planning in advance so that they will be able to complete prerequisites for courses counting toward the concentration. The Senior Program in Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary, year-long project culminating in a thesis, performance or exhibition. The department must approve the project in the fall of the student's senior year. Any member of the department may supervise the Senior Project. Students who have an average of 3.3 (88) or higher in the concentration may receive honors through distinguished work in 550. A complete description of the Senior Program is available from the chair. A minor in Africana Studies must include 220, 221, 381 or 382, one 400-level seminar and one elective.

Trivedi (History) Christopher Vasantkumar (Anthropology) Steven Yao (English) (F/S) The Asian Studies Program offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Asian languages, cultures, and societies. The program foresters an in-depth understanding of an Asian culture, requiring coursework in at least two of the following departments\u2014Anthropology, Art History, English, Government, History, Religious Studies, Theatre\u2014alongside study of an Asian language. Building upon this interdisciplinary approach, Asian Studies concentrators are well-prepared for study in an Asian country. In the senior year, concentrators draw together their knowledge from coursework and experiences in Asia to complete senior projects. A concentration in Asian Studies consists of nine courses distributed among at least three departments. These courses should be selected according to the requirements listed below. Honors in Asian Studies will be awarded to concentrators with at least an 3.3 (88) average in the concentration and who complete 550 with a grade of at least A-. A minor in Asian Studies consists of five courses, including 180 and four electives approved by the program director. Students double majoring in Asian Studies and East Asian Languages and Literatures (EALL) may use upper-level Chinese or Japanese language courses to satisfy the Asian Studies requirements, providing they are not used to count toward the EALL concentration. Beginning with the class of 2016, there are three tracks within the Asian Studies concentration: China Studies, Japan Studies, and India Studies. Ordinarily, students choose to focus their coursework and language study in one of these three regional areas. Students with thematic interests in Asia may pursue a comparative course of study in consultation with the Director. A partial list of courses regularly offered in each of these three areas follows a list of requirements for each track. China Studies 1. 180F Exploring Culture in the Great Cities of Asia. 2. Asian Language: The completion of intermediate language study, Chinese 140.

Page 42 of 207 Cinema and New Media Studies Updated Jul. 31, 2013Classics Faculty Shelley P. Haley, Chair Anne C. Feltovich Barbara K. Gold Carl A. Rubino Classics is the study of the languages and civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as of related civilizations, both ancient and modern. The department offers courses in ancient Greek and Latin and also in classical studies, where no knowledge of Latin or Greek is required. Students wishing to concentrate or minor in classics may take one of two directions. A concentration in classical languages, which emphasizes work in Latin and Greek as keys to understanding the ancient world, requires a minimum of 11 full-credit courses. Four of those courses, at least two of which must be numbered 300 or above, should be in one of the two languages; and three of them, at least one of which must be numbered 300 or above, should be in the other. Two courses in classical studies, in addition to 550, the Senior Project, are also required. (With the approval of the department, exemptions to these requirements may be made for students who come to Hamilton with substantial preparation in Latin or Greek.) Students concentrating in classical languages are also required to complete at least one course each year in Greek or Latin. Because the language concentration requires substantial accomplishment in both Greek and Latin, prospective concentrators entering the College with no knowledge of those languages should make an immediate start with the prerequisite 100- and 200-level courses. A concentration in classical studies, which offers a study of ancient Greece and Rome with emphasis on only one of the languages, requires a minimum of eight full-credit courses. Six of those courses should be in classical studies, at least four of them numbered 200 or above and at least one numbered 300 or above. One course numbered 300 or above in either Latin or Greek is also required, along with 550, the Senior Project. (With the approval of the department, certain courses in Greek or Latin may be substituted for classical studies courses). In addition, students concentrating in classical studies must complete at least one course each year in classical studies, Greek or Latin. Hamilton is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome (the Centro) and of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. Many students have also attended other programs in Rome and Athens. Concentrators and other students trained in Latin or Greek are encouraged to spend one or two semesters of their junior year in a program in Greece or Rome or in another suitable program abroad. Interested students should note that admission to the Intercollegiate Center and the American School is competitive and that preparation in Latin or Greek, and sometimes both, is an important factor in determining admission. Students who have earned an A- (90) average in the concentration may receive honors by earning a grade of A- in the Senior Seminar. A description of the program may be obtained from any member of the classics faculty. A minor in classical languages requires at least two courses numbered 300 or above in Latin or Greek, as well as two courses in classical studies, one of which must be numbered 200 or above. Because the language minor requires advanced work in either Latin or Greek, interested students entering the College without either of those languages should make an early start with the prerequisite 100- and 200-level courses. A minor in classical studies requires a minimum of five classical studies courses, three of which must be numbered 200 or above, with at least one numbered 300 or above, and one year of college Latin or Greek or a grade of B or higher in a 200- or 300-level course in Latin or Greek.

Page 50 of 207 College Courses and Seminars Updated Jul. 31, 2013Communication Faculty Catherine W. Phelan, Chair Cheryl A. Casey Megan M. Dowd The mission of the Communication Department is to ensure that students are critically aware of the ways in which information technologies inevitably alter interpersonal and social environments. The curriculum focuses on the interplay of face-to-face and mediated communication, while recognizing that speech can take many forms and be studied within many contexts. Coursework in the concentration is designed to offer knowledge of historical and theoretical paradigms, as those paradigms provide cogent explanations of a rapidly evolving social landscape. As students progress through their studies they are expected to develop an understanding of what it means to be informed scholars. The goals of the concentration require the integration of theory and practice in order to prepare students for the demands of civic engagement beyond the classroom. We encourage each student to identify and pursue an individual research agenda that builds on an awareness of the ways in which communication can both inform and influence ethical decisions. The department's mission supports the 2009 Hamilton Strategic Plan in terms of civic engagement, relevance of coursework and the development of a supportive learning community. Learning goals of the Communication concentration include: 1. To critically investigate the diverse ways in which information technologies can alter the human communication environment. 2. To understand the complex ways in which concerns with communication cannot be separated from ethical concerns. 3. To discern how interpersonal communication is fundamentally different from the varied forms of mediated communication. 4. To relate the different approaches of the study of Communication to the key questions of the discipline. 5. To apply the most appropriate of different methodological approaches to one's own research questions. 6. To organize, adapt, and present one's scholarship successfully for diverse audiences. These six goals are supported by the objectives identified in syllabi for specific courses in the curriculum. A concentration in communication consists of 11 courses: five core courses, three electives in communication (one of which must be at the 300 level or above), and three cognate courses from other disciplines. The core courses are 101, 275, 302, 455 and the senior thesis (500). These courses are offered every year. Electives in communication are offered every other year. Cognate courses speak to the interdisciplinary perspectives that inform the study of human communication, and must be at the 200 level or above; cognates cannot count toward a second major or a minor. During the second semester of senior year, students will provide their advisor with a written rationale that supports their selection of cognates and explains how these courses enrich their study of communication. Students pursuing a concentration in communication will gain a critical understanding of the theoretical frameworks and methods of research in the discipline. Communication Theory (302) should be taken in the student's junior year, followed by Methods of Communication Research (455) and Senior Thesis (500) in the fall and spring, respectively, of senior year. All senior projects consist of both written and oral components, culminating in a final draft of original research and an oral presentation to students and faculty at the end of the course. Honors in communication will be awarded based on a cumulative record of 3.5 (90) or above in all courses counting toward the concentration, as well as a grade of A or above in Senior Thesis (500). A minor in communication consists of five communication courses: 101, 275 and three additional courses (one of which must be at the 300 level or above). 101F,S Introduction to Communication.

Page 62 of 207 Computer Science Updated Jul. 31, 2013Critical Languages Faculty Mary Beth Barth, Program Director Mary Sisler Mireille Koukjian Anat Guez Language study requires practice and conscientious preparation on a daily basis in order to participate fully in highly interactive classes. Classes are conducted with very little use of English. The Critical Languages Program generally does not offer courses beyond second year and there is no minor or major available for these languages. Arabic, Italian and Hebrew are offered as regular courses. Course schedules may be found under Critical Languages (CLNG). Students with prior language experience must take a placement test prior to enrolling to determine appropriate level in order to receive course credit. Swahili and Hindi are offered as self-instructional courses, contingent upon student tutor availability. Students meet three times a week in small groups with a student tutor who is fluent in the language. The student tutor is not a \"teacher\" in the usual sense. Students, therefore, are expected to exercise the self-discipline and motivation required of independent work. Courses follow established curricula and are not self-paced. In addition to being highly motivated and self-directed, students must be willing to make a daily commitment to the rigorous study and practice of the language through the use of written, recorded and computer materials. Course grades are determined by mid-term and final exams, administered by external examiners. Students enrolled in the self-instructional courses must contact Mary Beth Barth by 4 p.m. the first day of classes in order to schedule the class. On rare occasions, due to scheduling conflicts, a student is unable to take the class.

The Department. Page 67 of 207 Dance and Movement Studies Updated Jul. 31, 2013Digital Arts Faculty Samuel F. Pellman (Music), Director L. Ella Gant (Art) The introduction of digital media into creative fields has changed the very nature of their study and production. Musicians, scientists, creative writers, film makers, and visual and performing artists have developed multiple fluencies with digital media. This, in turn, has challenged the long-standing tradition of individual genius specializing in individual media and has made collaborative and cross-disciplinary work practically inevitable. The program in digital arts provides a formal framework for the exploration of these creative possibilities. The minor in digital arts consists of five courses: the Electronic Arts Workshop (Art/Music 377) and four other courses, including at least two from the digital arts studio course list. Courses counted toward this minor cannot also be counted toward another concentration or minor.

Courses offered focus on language acquisition and introduction to the cultures and civilizations of both countries. As much as possible, the first-year courses are taught in the target languages, while the upper-level courses are conducted entirely in Chinese or Japanese. The Chinese concentration emphasizes work in the original language as key to understanding China and China-related issues aiming at and preparing students for further studies in graduate schools and professional careers in international trade, government service, diplomacy, private business, journalism and other related fields. A concentration in Chinese consists of nine courses numbered 140 or higher, including 150, 220, a 400-level course, which should be taken before the senior year (an ACC 400 level course counts), 445, and a course at or above the 430 level taken in each semester of the senior year, and the required senior project (550). A course concentrating on China's civilization or cultural offered by another department may satisfy the 150 requirement. Consult the Chinese Program. A minor in Chinese requires five courses numbered 140 or higher, including 150, 220 and a 400-level course. A minor in Japanese requires five courses. Those courses include at least three language courses beyond Japanese 120 (i.e., 130, 140 and 200) and one non-language course offered by the program. The fifth course may be either a language (220 and above) or a non-language course. Consult the faculty in Japanese. Students of Chinese and Japanese are strongly encouraged to participate in study abroad programs in China and Japan. Students of Chinese are eligible for the ACC program. Students of Japanese have the opportunity to study abroad through such programs as Kyoto Center for Japanese Language (Kyoto), CIEE-Sophia University (Tokyo) and Nanzan University (Nagoya). Consult the faculty in Japanese for details. To obtain departmental honors, students in Chinese must have an average of A- or better in all coursework in Chinese and must be a Chinese major. Study of the Chinese and the Japanese languages (Chinese 140/Japanese 140) in the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department also satisfies the two-year language requirement of the Asian Studies Program. Students are encouraged to strengthen their understanding of cross-cultural issues by integrating their language and culture studies with courses offered in Asian studies. Students interested in beginning or continuing their Chinese or Japanese language studies should make an immediate start with the 100- or 200-level courses or consult with the department chair. All 100-, 200- and 300-level courses taught in English are open to juniors and seniors without prerequisites. Associated Colleges in China Administered by the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department, the program provides summer, fall and spring study in Beijing (Capital University of Economics and Business) with intensive coursework through individualized instruction with a high level of participation and interaction. The courses are taught entirely in Chinese and encompass topics including advanced language, Chinese politics, society, economics, religion, art, folklore and literature. Unique features and activities of the program include the language pledge (speaking Chinese only), language practicum (individual projects conducted with local citizens), Chinese host families, Chinese language table, field trips in historically and culturally important sites outside of Beijing and extracurricular activities such as Taichi, Chinese food cooking, calligraphy, etc. Page 70 of 207 East Asian Languages and Literatures Updated Jul. 31, 2013The courses taken with ACC will count toward the Chinese concentration requirement. However, students with concentrations other than Chinese should consult with the appropriate department for transfer of credit for the concentration. The ACC Program is open to sophomores, juniors and first-semester seniors. It is in principle a full-year program (summer, fall and spring); however, applications may be made for any of the three sections. To be admitted, students must take at least two semesters of Chinese, a course on the culture and civilization of China and have the permission of the ACC director. Chinese 110F First-Term Chinese.

Owen A concentration in economics consists of nine courses: 101,102, 265, 275, 285 and four elective courses. Math 113 or its equivalent is one of the prerequisites for 275. At least two of the elective courses must be at the 400 level or above, with at least one at the 500 level and taken as a senior. The Senior Project will be completed in a designated 500-level course. The Senior Thesis is a written report of a project containing original research. Students writing a thesis must enroll in 560 (Research Seminar). 230 and 235 do not count toward the concentration. Concentrators must complete 265, 275 and 285 by the end of the junior year so that they may apply these analytical tools in their 400 level and 500 level courses. Additionally, 265, 275 and 285 must be taken at Hamilton. For purposes of fulfilling the requirements for the concentration, the Department does not classify any transferred courses at the 400 level or above. See the departmental website for additional information on procedures for transferring credit for economic courses taken off-campus. Additionally, Independent Study 499 is not classified as a 400 level elective. Exemption from these requirements is granted only in unusual cases. Because Economics 265 is not open to students who have taken or are concurrently taking Math 253 or Math 352, these students must substitute Economics 400 for Economics 265 in the requirements for the concentration. Students planning graduate work in economics should consult a member of the department for specific advice. They should take 400, selections from the other 400-level courses, 560 and obtain as strong a background in mathematics as possible. The sequence in calculus and linear algebra is required by virtually all good Ph.D. programs in economics; additional work in mathematics, such as courses in differential equations and real analysis, is strongly recommended. Students who plan to study for an M.B.A. should complete at least one semester of calculus and should consult \"Information for Prospective M.B.A. Students,\" a document available at the Career Center Web site, for additional recommendations. Departmental honors will be awarded to concentrators who demonstrate superior performance in economics, as evaluated by members of the department. To be eligible for honors, a student must complete 400 and 560, have a grade point average of at least 3.3 for all courses that satisfy the concentration and write an outstanding Senior Thesis. A minor in economics consists of 101, 102, 275, 285 and one additional economics course, with the exception of 230 or 235, which do not count toward the minor. 275 and 285 must be taken at Hamilton. If the student's concentration is in public policy, Economics 101 and 102 cannot count in both the student's concentration and the minor. These courses will be used to satisfy concentration requirements, and they will be replaced by alternative courses in the minor requirements. These alternative courses will be chosen by the chair of the Economics Department in consultation with the director of the Public Policy Program. Seniors may not preregister for Economics 101 but may add this course at the beginning of each semester, space permitting. 101F,S Issues in Microeconomics.

Stockton Allen Barbara T. Britt-Hysell Kim Wieczorek Characterized by an inquiry-oriented approach to the field of education, coursework in this interdisciplinary minor is integrated into, rather than separated from, the liberal arts curriculum of the College. This course of study is recommended for students who are interested in school administration, public policy and education, school counseling, design and development of curriculum, educational assessment, K-12 private school teaching, graduate studies leading to teaching certification and other related fields. Support from local public school districts allows students to complete upward of 120 hours of field experience in the elementary, middle and/or secondary school environments. The five-unit minor in education studies consists of 350, 370 and three other approved courses, and culminates in a final presentation completed during the spring semester of the student's senior year. As each student's interests and needs are unique, specific course selection beyond the required 350 and 370 will be individually determined with guidance and approval from the director in consultation with members of the Education Studies Program Committee. Other than education studies courses, no more than two courses from a single department may be applied toward the minor. Courses applied toward meeting concentration requirements may not be applied toward a minor in education studies. Placement for 370 is contingent upon the student achieving at least a 2.7 (B-) overall GPA and the approval of the director of the Education Studies Program.

Hall Christiane Gannon Doran Larson (F,S) Hoa T. Ngo Vincent Patricia O'Neill (F,S) Jane Springer (F,S) C. Katherine H. Terrell (F,S) Margaret O. Thickstun Benjamin Widiss Special Appointment John H. O'Neill The English and Creative Writing Department offers two concentrations, one in the study of literature and one in the art of creative writing. Each concentration consists of a total of 12 courses: 10 courses in the target concentration, and two courses in language study (see the description of the language requirement below). CREATIVE WRITING A concentration in creative writing consists of 10 courses: four workshops (215, 304, 305 and 419) and six courses in literature written in English: 1) 204 and 205; 2) at least one course in pre-1660 literature; 3) at least one course in literature from 1660-1900; 4) at least one course in post-1900 literature; 5) at least one additional course (which may be a 100-level English course). Note that the change in historical periods (from 1700 to 1660) applies to Class of 2015 and later. For Classes of 2014 and earlier, the previous definition of historical period (using 1700 as dividing year) will still apply. At least one literature course must be at the advanced level (numbered 300 or higher). A course in film study, a course in a foreign literature taught in the original language (not used to complete the language requirement; see below), or a course in comparative literature may be counted as the elective. The chronological period for a course is stated at the end of its description in the catalog. Not all courses fit into one of the chronological periods. Courses in expository writing (Writing 110 and Writing 310) do not count toward the concentration or minor in creative writing. Students may take no more than one creative writing workshop in a term. Transfer courses are not accepted as substitutes for the workshops. The Senior Program in creative writing consists of the Seminar in Creative Writing (419). Students who have not taken a 100-level English course must take 204 before taking 215. Alternative prerequisites (or direct AP placement) are not permitted for 215, 304, 305, or 419. Students who wish to concentrate in creative writing must take 215 by the end of the sophomore year. Students who have attained distinguished achievement in the concentration at the end of the junior year (normally a 3.5 average) may be considered for honors. The department will recommend for honors students who receive an A- or better on work submitted for honors and who earn a cumulative average of 3.5 or better in courses taken for the concentration (the cumulative average of 215, 304, 305 and 419 must also be 3.5 or better). A minor in creative writing consists of five courses: two courses in literature written in English (which may include a 100-level English course), 215, and either 204 and 304 or 205 and 305. Students concentrating in English literature may not minor in Page 87 of 207 English and Creative Writing Updated Jul. 31, 2013English course), 215, and either 204 and 304 or 205 and 305. Students concentrating in English literature may not minor in creative writing. ENGLISH The concentration consists of 10 courses in literature written in English: 1) at least one course from among 204, 205, and 206; 2) at least one course in pre-1660 literature; 3) at least one course in literature from 1660-1900; 4) at least one course in post-1900 literature; 5) at least one 500-level seminar, taken in the spring of the senior year; 6) at least five additional courses (only one of which may be a 100-level English course). Note that the change in historical periods (from 1700 to 1660) applies to Class of 2015 and later. For Classes of 2014 and earlier, the previous definition of historical period (using 1700 as dividing year) will still apply. At least four of the 10 courses must be at the advanced level (numbered 300 or higher). A course in Creative Writing, film study, in a foreign literature taught in the original language (not used to complete the language requirement; see below), or in comparative literature may be counted toward the concentration (though not as an advanced course). Courses cross-listed into English and Creative Writing from another department or program can be counted only as an elective, unless otherwise noted. The chronological period for a course is stated at the end of its course description. A few courses do not fit into one of the chronological periods. Neither courses in expository writing (Writing 110 and Writing 310) nor workshops in creative writing may count toward the concentration or the minor in English literature. The Senior Program in English requires all concentrators to complete a 500-level seminar in literature during the spring of their senior year. The seminar may not be used to meet requirements 2-4. Unless otherwise noted in the course descriptions, the department accepts the following as alternatives to a 100-level English course as a prerequisite for courses in literature: any writing-intensive course offered by the Comparative Literature Department; French 200, 211, and 212; German 200; Hispanic Studies 200, 201, 210, and 211. Sophomores, juniors and seniors may take 226, 238 and 267 without a prerequisite. Students from any class year with AP scores of 4 or 5 may take the following literature courses without a prerequisite: 204, 205 (spring only), 213 221, 222, 225 (spring only), 255, 256, 267, 293. AP 5 students will receive a general elective credit after completing a first English course (at the 200 level) if they receive a grade of B- or higher. AP 4 students are eligible for placement at the 200-level, but not for an additional credit. Beginning in Fall 2013, first-year students may also take 100-level English courses for AP credit. Students can only receive a total of one unit of credit for both AP English Literature and Language. Students who have attained distinguished achievement in the concentration at the end of the junior year (normally a 3.5 average) may be invited to write an honors thesis. Students so invited will submit a proposal in the fall of the senior year; students whose topics are approved will complete the thesis in the spring. The department will recommend for honors students who receive an A- or better on the honors thesis and who earn a cumulative average of 3.5 or better in courses taken for the concentration. Students aiming for honors are strongly encouraged to take a course in literary theory. A minor in English literature consists of five courses: at least one course from among 204, 205 and 206; at least one course from among 222, 225, and 226; and three electives in literature written in English, one of which may be a 100-level English course and one of which must be at or above the 300 level. Students concentrating in creative writing may not minor in English literature. A student considering teaching English at the secondary level should consult with his or her adviser about the kinds of departmental coursework that would offer the best preparation for that goal. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT Concentrators in creative writing and English literature must fulfill a language requirement: 1) completion of two courses at the college level in a language other than English (courses taught in a foreign language department in which class readings and discussions are in English may not be counted toward the foreign language requirement, nor may two courses taken in two different languages); \u2014 or \u2014 2) completion of 221 and 293 (or equivalent courses in Old English and the history of the English language taken elsewhere and approved for transfer credit); -- or -- 3) completion of either 221 or 293 (or equivalent) and a language course in Latin or Greek. Courses taken to complete the language requirement may not be counted among the 10 courses for the concentration. [223S] Gender and Violence in the Middle Ages.

Rayne (Geosciences) Julio Videras (Economics) Richard Werner (Philosophy) Ernest Williams (Biology) Environmental studies concerns human interaction with the physical world. The Environmental Studies Program offers an opportunity to explore that interaction from a variety of perspectives and using the tools of different academic disciplines. A number of departments contribute courses to this interdisciplinary program. The concentration in Environmental Studies encourages both interdisciplinary breadth and depth of study in a discipline. Upon declaring their ES concentration, students also declare a focus academic division in which to pursue their ES program, and work closely with faculty advisors to develop an individualized plan of study. Note that ES 150 is NOT a required course for the concentration. The concentration consists of 13 courses: Six foundational courses distributed among the two academic divisions: 1) natural sciences and 2) social sciences/humanities, including: one introductory science course in geoscience, and one in biology, chemistry or physics; two in the social sciences/humanities; two additional courses selected from the student's focus division; Four elective courses chosen from a specific discipline within the focus division; One data analysis and/or statistics course (prior to senior year); One elective course with explicit environmental content; 550, the Senior Project A complete description of the Senior Project is available from members of the advisory committee. A maximum of four credits may be transferred into the concentration from study off-campus with prior approval. Students who have earned at least a 3.5(90) average in courses toward the concentration may receive honors in Environmental Studies through distinguished work on the Senior Project. The detailed requirements for the environmental studies concentration are: 1. Six foundational courses, which should be taken before the completion of the junior year. These courses are: Two of the following Natural Sciences courses: One of Geoscience 103, 105, 110, 112 or 116 One of Biology 101, 102 or 115, Chemistry 120 or 125, or Physics 100 or 200 Two courses from the Social Sciences/Humanities list below (or at the discretion of the student's advisor and the Program Committee) Two more courses from the student's focus division (not limited to the lists below).

One elective course with explicit environmental content from outside one's discipline (chosen in consultation with the student's advisor). 5. 550 Senior Project. Note that students pursuing science- or other empirically-oriented Senior Projects are normally expected to begin their empirical research as an Independent Study with a faculty member in the semester (or summer) preceding their enrollment in ES 550. The Independent Study can be undertaken as a half- or full-credit course and will be counted toward completion of the ES concentration. The minor in Environmental Studies consists of five courses: An introductory environmental science course (one of ES150, GeoSc 105, or GeoSc 110) and four from the Natural Sciences and Social Sciences/Humanities lists above (with the exclusion of introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses). A student may petition to substitute other courses with an explicit environmental focus. The five courses must include at least one course from outside the natural sciences. A student may count for the minor at most two courses from a single department, and at most two courses from programs away from Hamilton. 150F Environmental Science and Society.

During their senior year, concentrators in French must: 1) enroll in at least one 400-level course during both the fall and spring semesters; one of these courses must focus on a period before 1800; 2) complete a substantial research paper in a 400-level course, normally in the spring semester; 3) participate in an assessment of their oral proficiency in an interview conducted by outside examiners early in the spring semester. Concentrators may not normally fulfill the requirement for the major through the election of a 200-level course during their senior year. A complete description of the Senior Program is available in Christian Johnson 202. To attain honors in French, students must have an average of A- or better in all coursework in the department at the end of first semester of senior year, and must, during the spring semester of their senior year, complete a third course (550) with an average of A- or better on both the required paper and the oral defense.

Hamilton College Junior Year in France After a preliminary orientation in Biarritz and Paris, students register at various Paris universities and post-secondary institutions. In consultation with the director, they select a program of four courses per semester from those offered at Paris III, Paris VI or at other institutes such as the Institut d'Etudes Politiques, the Institut Catholique and the Ecole du Louvre. In addition, a number of special courses taught by French professors are arranged by Hamilton in Paris. The Universit\u00e9 de Paris and the special institutes announce their courses at the beginning of each academic year. The director makes specific course information available to students as soon as possible. Many varied courses in art history, economics, French language and literature, history, linguistics, music, philosophy, political science, sociology and theatre are offered. Students are urged to take at least one semester of a language class and are encouraged to select a balanced program of courses in different disciplines. A detailed description of selected courses is contained in the program's catalogue. All courses taken with the Hamilton College Junior Year count toward the graduation requirement. However, students with concentrations other than French must consult with the appropriate department before departure about transfer of credit for the concentration. The Hamilton College Junior Year in France is for a full academic year. The department believes that far greater linguistic and cultural benefits are gained from an academic year in France than from a semester. Concentrators and other serious language students are therefore encouraged to participate in the nine-month program. A semester option is available, however, to pre-med students, students majoring in the sciences (including mathematics and computer science) and students whose academic plans necessitate attending another semester program in another country. 110F First-Term French.

Baker David W. Rivera Frank C. Vlossak The department offers concentrations in government, world politics and public policy as follows: GOVERNMENT A concentration in government consists of 10 courses: 116, 117 and either 112 or 114, with at least one of these being writing-intensive, and seven additional courses at the 200 level or above. Of these seven courses, at least two must be in international relations or comparative politics, at least two must be in American politics or political theory, at least two must be at the 300 level, and one must be the Senior Project (550). A minor in government consists of five courses, with at least two of these at the 200 level or above. Honors in government or world politics requires a GPA of 3.6 in the major by the end of the sixth semester, maintaining that average at graduation, and the successful completion of 549 and 551. WORLD POLITICS The world politics major involves the study of politics on a global scale, including both international relations and politics within nations. In order to understand the complex interplay of international and national politics, all world politics majors study the philosophical and moral bases of various political systems; the history of the modern international system; the political economy of global power and wealth; and the key issues for U.S. foreign policy. To achieve this understanding, all world politics majors are required to take a total of 11 courses, including the following core courses: 112, 114, 117 (one of which must be writing-intensive); 290 and 291; and 550. Students complete the major by focusing either on a particular region of the world (Africa, Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Russia and Eastern Europe, Western Europe) or a thematic topic (poverty and inequality in world politics, democratization, international law and organization, international security, politics of the global economy, nationalism and identity in global politics). In consultation with their advisor, students will select five related courses in their area or theme from a variety of departments. One of these must be at the 300 level in government. For students focusing on a region of the world, one of the five courses must be in an appropriate language at the fourth-semester level or above. Students may also design their own thematic track with the advice and consent of their advisor. The advisor will approve each student's course list after the major is declared. PUBLIC POLICY See the public policy section in this catalogue. The Term in Washington Program, offered each semester, combines regular academic study with the experience and understanding gained by working in congressional and executive offices. Four credits are awarded toward graduation, two of which (325 and 327) count toward a concentration in government, and up to two may be counted toward a concentration in world politics or public policy. It is useful to have some background in the operations of the American federal government, so Government 116 (American Political Process) or its equivalent is strongly advised, but the program has no fixed prerequisite and is open to students majoring in any concentration offered by the College. It is also open to selected students from other colleges. Page 118 of 207 Government Updated Jul. 31, 2013201S Introduction to Feminist Thought.

Page 127 of 207 Government Updated Jul. 31, 2013Hispanic Studies Faculty Joana Sabadell-Nieto (Chair) Luisa Briones Willstedt (Madrid Program Director) Special Appointment s Jeremy T. Medina The Hispanic Studies Department offers a diverse curriculum that includes Spanish language study for both non-heritage and heritage speakers, and Latin American, Spanish and U.S. Latino/a literature and culture studies. In our Centro Universitario de Estudios Hisp\u00e1nicos in Madrid we also offer courses in social sciences, art, cinema and dance. The Hispanic studies concentration consists of nine courses numbered 140 or higher, including 200/201, and 210 or 211, one elective in the 200 series, three electives at the 300 level or above \u2014 including at least one in both Latin American and Peninsular fields (one of these must focus on literature before 1800) \u2014 and one course at the 400 level. Concentrators must also fulfill a cultural requirement that can be met through study abroad or a cultural studies course. Any course offered by another department that focuses specifically on Latin America, Spain or U.S. Latinos/as may satisfy the 200-level requirement but will not count as one of the nine concentration courses. Concentrators may include one course in translation as one of the required courses for the major. Five of the nine courses required for the major must be taken at Hamilton. It is strongly advised that all concentrators study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country. In order to complete the Senior Program, senior concentrators in Hispanic Studies (non-honors candidates) will: 1) enroll in a 300-level course or Hispanic studies 400 in the fall semester, and a 400-level course in the spring semester (in the spring seniors will complete a research project in a 400-level course; spring semester advanced courses are doubly designated as 300/400 [i.e. 310/410], in order to distinguish seniors who are writing the senior research project from other students. Thus if a senior plans to take more than one advanced course in the spring, he/she should take only one course at the 400 level); 2) participate in an assessment of oral proficiency in an interview conducted by outside examiners in the fall semester. Concentrators may not normally fulfill the requirement for the major through the election of a 200-level course during their senior year. Senior honors candidates will: 1) enroll in Hispanic Studies 400 in the fall semester; 2) enroll in 550 and complete a senior thesis in the spring semester; 3) participate in an assessment of oral proficiency in an interview conducted by outside examiners in the fall semester. In order to attain honors in Spanish, students must have an average of 3.5 (90) or better in the nine courses required for the major and must complete 550 (senior thesis) with an A- or better. Senior honors candidates who are studying in Spain (with HCAYS) during the fall of their senior year are exempt from the Hispanic Studies 400 requirement. A complete description of the Senior Program is available in Christian Johnson 202. The Hispanic studies minor consists of five courses numbered 140 or higher, including 200/201 and 210/211, and at least one course at the 300 level. One of these courses may be taken in translation. Three of the five courses for the minor must be taken at Hamilton. THE ACADEMIC YEAR IN SPAIN The Academic Year in Spain was established in 1974 to offer the highest interdisciplinary academic standards in foreign study programs (distinguished professors, small classes and a rigorous Spanish-only pledge), along with careful attention to the intellectual, cultural and social needs of each student. Directors-in-residence are drawn from the Department of Hispanic Studies at Hamilton College. The program is administered at Hamilton by a general director and by the programs abroad committee, and representatives of Swarthmore and Williams Colleges serve as directing advisors to the program and are instrumental in deciding important curricular and administrative matters and in long range planning. Also affiliated with the program are Amherst College and Princeton University. A board of advisors, drawn from such institutions as Bates, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Bucknell, Colby, Grinnell, Harvard, Reed, Scripps, Smith, Stanford, Wellesley and Yale, further helps in matters of recruitment and student preparation. All courses are taught entirely in Spanish and include language and linguistic studies, culture studies and study in the social sciences. Courses offered include advanced language, the art of translation, the history of Spanish art, cinema, analysis of poetic texts, Cervantes, contemporary theater, 19th- and 20th-century Spanish and Latin American narrative, contemporary Spanish and Latin American history, the economy of Spain, anthropology, sociology, contemporary Spanish politics, flamenco and studio art. The program also offers internships sculpted to each student's area of interest and preparation. Students are taught by faculty members from leading universities in Madrid. The Centro Universitario de Estudios Hisp\u00e1nicos, HCAYS headquarters, is Page 128 of 207 Hispanic Studies Updated Jul. 31, 2013located within the \"Ciudad Universitaria\" of Madrid, next to the Complutense University and the University of San Pablo, an HCAYS affiliate (students may opt to take one course at the University of San Pablo). Language and civilization classes form part of the fall orientation program in Galicia, while a similar orientation for spring students takes place in Andaluc\u00eda. Frequent group excursions throughout Spain complement the rich academic and social opportunities offered to students in Madrid. The program is open to sophomores, juniors and first-semester seniors.

As Woodrow Wilson observed in 1894, \"Every citizen should know what the law is, how it came into existence, what relation its form bears to its substance, and how it gives to society its fiber and strength and poise of frame.* Understanding the theory, practice and meaning of law stimulates civic engagement and provides students with the analytical and empirical foundation to engage subjects ranging from legal decision-making and dispute resolution; policing, criminal justice and incarceration; political speech and action; to the use and meaning of legal discourse in the making of social policy. A minor in Jurisprudence consists of five courses: two courses in Analytic Perspectives and Theory, and three courses in Substantive Areas.

Spicer Stephen P. Stetson Adam Stockwell Eric S. Summers David W. Thompson Coaches Tim Byrnes Sally Cockburn Preston Denby Al Highducheck Gillian McDonald Kathy Wilmot All enrolled students are required to participate in a physical education program for individual development. This \"lifetime carryover\" program is based on the theory that it is as important to develop a healthy body and a love of sports as it is to provide scope for the skilled athlete. There is a five-part requirement that includes: 1) A physical fitness test (a course is offered for those who do not pass); 2) A swim test (beginning swimming is offered for those who do not pass); 3 and 4) Two lifetime activity classes; 5) one unit of the following: intercollegiate athletics, wellness seminar, lifetime activity class. Lifetime activity classes include the following: aerobics, badminton, fitness, golf, jogging, lifeguard training, power walking, racquetball, scuba, skating, squash, swimming, tennis, toning and volleyball. Upon passing the physical fitness and swimming tests and successfully completing the three other parts of the requirement, a student shall have completed the physical education requirement. Activities may not be repeated for credit nor may a student be given intercollegiate credit and also receive credit for a similar class (i.e., a hockey player may not receive credit for ice skating). Except under unusual circumstances, it is expected that the requirement will be completed in the first year. All students must complete the requirement by the end of four semesters in residence and may not study abroad or away without completing it. Students with physical disabilities may enter an individual program approved by the director of physical education. Page 171 of 207 Physical Education Updated Jul. 31, 2013Physics Faculty Gordon Jones, chair Brian Collett Natalia V. Connolly Seth A. Major Peter J. Millet Ann J. Silversmith A concentration in physics consists of 10 courses: 190, 195, 290, 295, 390, 550 and four other courses chosen in consultation with an advisor who is a member of the physics faculty. Normally at least one of the electives will be selected from physics courses at the 300-level or above. Students who wish to prepare for graduate school in physics or engineering should choose electives from physics courses at the 300-level and above. Students with other interests may, in consultation with their advisor, select up to two electives from other science departments. Such courses should support interdisciplinary interests or career goals. Normally 390 is taken in the spring semester of the junior year in preparation for the research project undertaken in 550. Honors in physics requires outstanding work in the senior research project. In the first year, prospective concentrators should take 190 and 195, and differential and integral calculus (Mathematics 113 and 114). If the Mathematics Department grants advanced placement, the student may wish to take vector calculus (Mathematics 215), linear algebra (Mathematics 224), or differential equations (Mathematics 235). Physics 290 and 295 should be taken in the second year; Physics 245 is strongly recommended for the second year as well. Other options should be discussed with a member of the physics faculty. Students who wish to major in physics but who have taken either 100-105 or 200-205, or who wish to begin the major belatedly should consult with the department chair. Students with advanced placement in physics should consult with a member of the department before registering for a physics class. A minor in physics consists of five courses: 190, 195, 290 or 295, and two other physics courses. Alternatively, one can complete the minor with 100-105 or 200-205, plus three other physics courses, of which one must be at the 200 level or above. A minor in astronomy consists of five courses: a 2-course introductory sequence (190-195, 100-105, or 200-205), 290, 160 and either 330 or an independent study in astronomy. A student who majors in physics may not minor in astronomy. Students interested in the 3-2, 3-1-1-1, or 4-2 engineering programs affiliating Hamilton with engineering schools should take 190, 195, and calculus (or linear algebra if mathematics placement so warrants) in their first year. There are many possible options in engineering programs, and because of their complexity beyond the first year, interested students should consult the engineering advisor, Professor Millet. This is also the case for those who have taken 100-105 or 200-205 and have then become interested in engineering. Juniors or seniors without prior courses in the department may enroll in 100, 120, 135, 160, 200 and 245. 100F Survey of Physics I.

Students are strongly encouraged to take Economics 101 and Mathematics 100 (or 253) in their first year, and to take Government 230 and Public Policy 251 in their sophomore year. No student may declare a concentration in public policy without either completing or being enrolled in 251. Concentrators must complete the following courses by the end of the junior year: 382; Economics 102; Government 116 and 230; one of the required courses in ethics; and one of the \"issue areas\" courses listed above. The Senior Project may be completed in one semester (500) or two semesters (500-501). To qualify for honors in public policy, a student must submit a distinguished record in the concentration and perform with distinction in the Senior Project. Credit from the Term in Washington Program may be substituted for up to two of the courses required for the concentration, with the approval of the program director. Students interested in pursuing graduate study in public policy or public administration are encouraged to take additional courses in economics, in substantive areas of public policy, and in mathematics and statistics. A minor in public policy consists of 251, Economics 101 and 102, Government 230 and one of the required ethics courses above. If the student's concentration is in economics, government or philosophy, these courses cannot count in both the student's concentration and the minor. Instead, courses that are required for both the concentration and the minor will be used to satisfy concentration requirements, and they will be replaced by alternative courses in the minor requirements. These alternative courses will be chosen by the program director in consultation with the chair of the student's concentration department. In addition to the required courses, there are many other courses in the College curriculum that will be of interest to public policy concentrators. Page 181 of 207 Public Policy Updated Jul. 31, 2013Students interested in the concentration should consult as early as possible with Professor Wyckoff. 247F The Pursuit of Happiness.
