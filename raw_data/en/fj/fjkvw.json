Illinois uses the standardized data collection methods developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). These method s are used in 46 states, New York City , Washington DC , Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands, representing approximately 81% of live births in the U.S. Data are collected through mailed surveys with telephone follow -up for non- respond ents. In Illinois, a systematic stratified random samp le of approximately 180 mothers is selected monthly from a frame of eligible birth certificates. At two to six months after delivery, the PRAMS program mails an introductory letter and survey to each sampled mother. The program follows up with those who do not initially respond, sending them a reminder letter and two additional survey mailings . PRAMS interviewer s telephone mothers who do not respond to any of the mailed surveys to administer the survey by telephone. Surveys are available in English and Spanish , and telephone interviews are conducted in both languages. In 2020, a total of 1,994 women were select ed to participate in the study ; 1,205 women completed the survey. Data w ere weighted and are representative of the 12 -month PRAMS -eligible estimated population of 126,199 recent mothers . Data collection in 2020 marks the fif th year of using the Phase 8 PRAMS survey. Sampling Design A systematic stratified random sampling design is used to oversample low birthweight ( less than 2,500 grams) births. The sample is stratified by low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) and normal birthweight (2,500 grams or greater). The 2020 overall weight ed response rate is 61%. The weighted response rates by infant birth weight are 58% for low birth weight and 61% for normal birth weight . Weighting and Interpretation of Results Statistics are based on weighted data. CDC developed the weights to adjust for sample design, non- response patterns, and omissions from the sampling frame. The final sampling weight used to analyze the survey data is the product of these three elements. Weighting is necessary to give unbiased estim ates of population parameters. The p ercentages, 95 percent confidence intervals , and total estimated population affected were calculated using Survey Data Analysis ( SUDAAN\u00ae *) software. Estimates for response categories with small cell size (i.e., respondents < 30 in denominator or < 6 in numerator ) are not reported due to possible imprecisio n. PRAMS data are representative of Illinois resident women, age 14 years or older, who gave birth in Illinois to live infants . The sampling design is valid at the state level and not intended or developed to represent sub-state geographies or their populations without further evaluation. The data are not applicable to all pregnant women. At the direct ion of IDPH legal counsel, w omen younger than 18 years of age were not asked questions about physical abuse.
