Pete's ever-seeking spirit gallops on the foul stench that wafts from the Dump and torments the good people of Staten Island. But Pete's had his fill of outer-borough provincial life and is gunning for a promotion. To land the new gig, he's got to impress the man downstairs. He needs a couple of big scores and lucky for him, Staten Island is oozing with potential for evil. Carl and Anthony, two teenage buddies who share a bond that goes deeper than friendship, deeper even than blood, may be just the ticket. Pete descends upon them in a desolate lot. He orchestrates a depraved act of violence and betrayal, which sends him cruising towards his promotion.

But when Gina and Pete collide, all hell's going to really break loose. 2023 Firebird Book Awards Winner in three categories (Paranormal, Horror and Thriller) Kirkus Reviews says... \"Arginteanu's prose throughout is vivid and colorful, and he keeps his narrative bubbling with interest by filling it with a large cast of well-defined characters\" \"The author does a remarkably skillful job at mixing casual brutalities of life with the uplifting qualities of existence that stubbornly persist\" \"A grim but thoroughly enjoyable tale set amid urban horrors.\" Please buy it here [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B92KGWD2/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B92KGWD2/) If you enjoy it, please encourage your friends to buy it and give it a great review on Amazon.
