The handbook pr ovides information about Texas Medicaid's benefits, policies, and procedures applicable to these providers. Important: All providers are required to read and comply with \"Section 1: Provider Enrollment and Responsibilities\" (Vol. 1, General Information). In addition to required compliance with all requirements specific to Texas Medicaid, it is a violation of Texas Medicaid rules when a provider fails to provide health-care services or items to Medicaid clients in accordance with accepted medical community standards and standards that govern occupations, as explained in 1 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) \u00a7371.1659. Accordingly, in addition to being subject to sanctions for failure to comply with the requ irements that are specific to Texas Medicaid, providers can also be subject to Texas Medicaid sanctions for failure, at all times, to deliver health-care items and services to Medicaid clie nts in full accordance with all applicable licensure and certification requirements incl uding, without limitation, those related to documentation and record maintenance. All providers are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect as outlined in subsection 1.7, \"Provider Responsibilities\" in \"Section 1: Provider Enrollment and Responsibilities\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). 1.1 Medical Transportation Program The Medical Transportation Program (MTP) is fund ed with federal and state dollars to arrange nonemergency transportation to medical or de ntal appointments for eligible clients and their attendants. The Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) administrative rules govern parental accompa- niment of children who receive Medicaid screenings, treatments, and MTP services. Titles 1 Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Part 15, \u00a7380.207 allows parents or guardians to authorize one adult and one alternate adult to accompany th eir children on MTP rides when the parent or guardian is unable to do so. The parent or guardian is required to designate the other adult on a form prescribed by HHSC in accordan ce with section \u00a7380.207(4). An adult who is author ized by a parent or guardian may not be a provider or an employee or affiliate of a provider that submits claims for services. Refer to: The Medical Transportation Program Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for more information. 1.2 Rates Reduction Texas Medicaid implemented mandated rate reductio ns for certain services. The Online Fee Lookup (OFL) and static fee schedules include a column titled \"Adjusted Fee\" to display the individual fees with all mandated percentage reductions applied. Additi onal information about rate changes is available on the Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP) website at www.tmhp.com/resources/rate-and- code-updates/rate-changes .CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 13 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.1.3 NP, CNS, PA, and CNM Clai ms Submitted by a Physician Physicians will be reimbursed 92 percent of the established reimbursement rate for services provided by an NP, CNS, PA, or CNM if the physician does not make a decision regarding the client's care or treatment on the same date of service as the billabl e medical visit. Physicians who submit a claim using the physician's own National Provider Identifier (NPI ) for the services that were provided by the NP, CNS, PA, or CNM must submit one of the following modifiers on each claim detail: SA\u2014Services were provided by an NP or CNS U7\u2014Services were provided by a PA SB\u2014Services were provided by a CNM Exception: The 92 percent reimbursement rate does not appl y to laboratory services, radiology services, or injections provided by an NP, CNS, PA, or CNM. 1.4 Payment Window Reimbursem ent Guidelines for Services Preceding an Inpatient Admission According to the three-day and one-day payment wind ow reimbursement guidelines, most professional and outpatient diagnostic and nondiagnostic services that are rendered within the designated time frame of an inpatient hospital stay and are related to the inpatient hospital admission will not be reimbursed separately from the inpatient hospital stay if the services are rendered by the hospital or an entity that is wholly owned or operated by the hospital. These reimbursement guidelines do not apply in the following circumstances: Services are rendered at a federally qualified he alth center (FQHC) or rural health clinic (RHC). Services are for a THSteps medical checkup. Professional services are rendered in the inpatient hospital setting. The hospital and the physician office or other entity are both owned by a third party, such as a health system. The hospital is not the sole or 100-percent owner of the entity. These reimbursement guidelines do not apply for FQHC, RHC, THSteps, and professional services that are rendered in the inpatient hospital setting. Refer to: Subsection 3.7.4.17, \"Payment Window Reimbursement Guidelines\" in the Inpatient and Outpatient Hospital Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for additional infor- mation about the payment wind ow reimbursement guidelines. 2 Medicaid Children's Services Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) 2.1 CCP Overview CCP is an expansion of the Early Periodic Screen ing, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) service as mandated by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989, which requires all states to provide all medically necessary treatment for correction of physical or mental problems to Texas Health Steps (THSteps)-eligible clients when federal financia l participation (FFP) is available, even if the services are not covered under the state's Medicaid plan. Under the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, an d Treatment (EPSDT) regulation, known in Texas as Texas Health Steps (THSteps), Section 1905(r) of the Social Security Act mandates that all Medicaid- eligible beneficiaries who are birth through 20 years of age receive medically necessary services to treat, correct and ameliorate illnesses and co nditions identified if the service is covered in the state's Medicaid CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 14 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.plan or is an optional Medicaid service. It is the re sponsibility of the state to determine medical necessity on a case specific basis. No arbitrary limitations on services are allowed (e.g., one pair of eyeglasses or 10 therapy sessions per year) if determined to be medically necessary. Services not covered unde r this section include: Experimental or investigational treatment. Services or items not generally accepted as effective and/or not within the normal course and duration of treatment. Services for the caregiver or provider convenience. All EPSDT requirements must be adhered to for bene ficiaries who receive services under managed care arrangements. The following CCP provider sections describe the spec ific requirements of each area of responsibility: Subsection 2.6 *, \"Clinician-Dir ected nding) (CCP)\" this handbook. Refer to: The Physical Therapy, Occupational Therap y, and Speech Therapy Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for information about comprehens ive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (CORFs) and outpatient rehabilitation faci lities (ORFs). The Home Health Nursing and Private Duty Nursing Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for more information about private duty nursing (PDN) services. The Physical Therapy, Occupational Therap y, and Speech Therapy Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for more information about CCP therapy services. The Certified Respiratory Care Practitioner (CRCP) Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for more information about CRCP CCP services. 2.1.1 Client Eligibility The client must be birth through 20 years of age an d eligible for THSteps on the date of service. If the client's Your Texas Benefits Medicaid card states \"Emergency,\" \"PE,\" or \"QMB,\" the client is not eligible for CCP benefits. Clients are ineligible for CCP services be ginning the day of their 21st birthday. 2.1.2 Enrollment Refer to: Subsection 1.7.18, \"Children's Services Comprehensive Care 1: Provider Enrollment and Responsi bilities\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ) for enrollment information. 2.1.3 Services, Benefits , and Limitations Payment is considered for any health-care service that is medically necessary and for which FFP is available. CCP benefits are allowable services not currently covered under Texas Medicaid (e.g., speech- language pathology medical nutritiona l products, medical nutrition services, inpatient CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 15 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.rehabilitation, travel strollers, and special needs car seats). CCP benefits also include expanded coverage of current Texas Medicaid services where services are subject to limitations (e.g., diagnosis restrictions for total parenteral nutrition [TPN] or diagnosi s restrictions for attendant care services). Requests for services that require a prior authorizat ion must be submitted to TMHP. Prior authorization is a condition for reimbursement, not a guarantee of payment. For information about specific benefits, providers can refer to provider-spe cific sections of this manual. Payment cannot be made for any service, supply, or equipment for which FFP is not available. The following are some examples: Vehicle modification, mechanical, or structural (such as wheelchair lifts). Structural changes to homes, domici les, or other living arrangements. Environmental equipment, supplies, or services, such as room dehumidifiers, air conditioners, filters, space heaters, fans, water purification sy stems, vacuum cleaners, and treatments for dust mites, rodents, and insects. Ancillary power sources and other types of standby equipment (except for technology-dependent clients such as those who ar e ventilator-dependent for mo re than six hours per day). Educational programs, supplies, or equipment (such as a personal computer or software). Equine or hippotherapy. Exercise equipment, home spas or gyms, toys, therapeutic balls, or tricycles. Tennis shoes. Respite care (relief to caregivers). Aids for daily living (toothbrushes, spoons, reachers, and foot stools). Take-home drugs from hospitals (Eligible hospital s may enroll in and bill Vendor Drug Program (VDP). Pharmacies that want to enroll should call 512-491-1429. Therapy involving any breed of animal. 2.1.4 Prior Authorization and Do cumentation Requirements Prior authorization is a condition for reimbursement; it is not a guarantee of payment. A prior authori- zation number (PAN) is a TMHP-assigned number es tablishing that a service or supply has been determined to be medically necessary and for which FFP is available. It is each provider's responsibility to verify the client's eligibility at the time each service is provided. An y service provided while the client is not eligible cannot be reimbursed by TMHP. The re sponsibility for payment of services is determined by private arrangements made between the provider and client. Prior authorization of CCP services may be requeste d in writing by completing the appropriate request form, attaching any necessa ry supportive documentation, and subm itting them by mail, fax, or the electronic portal to the TMHP- CCP department. Prescribing or ordering providers, dispensing providers, clients' responsible adults, and clients may sign prior authorization forms and supporting documentation using electr onic or wet signatures. Providers who fax new prior authorization requests, re submitted requests, or a dditional information to complete a request must include: A working fax number on the prior authorization fo rm, so that they can receive faxed responses and correspondence from TMHP. The last four digits of the client's Medicaid identification number on the fax coversheet. CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 16 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Prior authorization may also be requested throug h the TMHP website. (Providers can refer to Subsection 5.5.1, \"Prior Authorization Requests Through Fee-for-Service Prior Authorizations\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ) for additional information to include mandatory documentation and retention requir ements). All requested information on the form must be completed, or the request is returned to the provider. Incomplete forms are not accepted. If prior authorization is granted, the potential serv ice provider (such as the DME supplier, pharmacy, registered nurse (RN), or physical th erapist) receives a letter that includes the PAN, the procedures prior authorized, and the length of the authorization. Prov iders are notified in writ ing when additional infor- mation is needed to process the request for services. Providers must submit a CCP Prior Authorization Request Form and docu mentation to support medical necessity to the CCP department before providing services. Providers must submit the CCP Prior Authorization Request Form when requesting a medically necessary service if the service is not addressed in the Texas Medicaid Provider Procedures Manual and the client is 20 years of age or younger. Important: Documentation to support medical necessity of the service, equipment, or supply (such as a prescription, letter, or medical records) must be current, signed, and dated by a physician (M.D. or D.O.) before services are performed. Providers must keep the information on file. Refer to: CCP provider-specific sections for prior author ization requirements of specific services, including the appropriate prior authorization request forms. 2.1.4.1 Incomplete Prior Authorization Requests Providers must respond to an incomplete prior authorization requ est within 14 business days of the request receipt date. Incomplete pr ior authorization requests are requests that are received by TMHP with missing, incomplete, or illegible information. Prior to denying an incomplete request, TMHP's Pr ior Authorization department will attempt to get the correct information from the requesting provider . The Prior Authorization department will make a minimum of three attempts to contact the requesting pr ovider before sending a letter to the client about the status of the request and the need for additional information. If the necessary information to make a prior authorization determination is not received within 14 business days of the request receipt date, the request will be denied as \"incomplete.\" To ensure timely processing, providers should respond to requests fo r missing or incomplete information as quickly as possible. For fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid re quests that require a physician re view before a final determination can be made, TMHP's Physician Reviewer will complete the review within three business days of receipt of the completed prior authorization request. An additional three business days will be allowed for requests that require a peer-to-peer review with the client's prescribing physician. 2.1.4.2 Diagnosis Coding All providers must obtain the client's medical diagno sis from the physician. Th is information must be reflected on each claim submitted to TMHP. 2.1.4.3 Drug and Medical Device Approval Manufacturers may request to have drug or medical device products added as a CCP benefit by sending the information in writing to the following address: HHSC 1100 West 49th Street Austin, TX 78756-3179 HHSC reviews the information. Requests for consideration must not be sent to TMHP.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 17 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.2.1.4.4 Physician Signature The dated signature of the physician (M.D. or D.O. ) on a prescription or CCP Authorization Request Form must be current to the service date(s) of the request, i.e., the sign ature must always be on or before the service start date and no older than three months before the current date(s) of service requested. Physician signatures dated after the service start date on initial requests cannot be accepted as documen- tation supporting medical necessity for dates of serv ice prior to the signature date. A request for prior authorization must include document ation from the provider to support the medical necessity of the service, equipment, or supply. If services begin as a result of a verbal order before the physician's dated signature, proof of the verbal order must be submitted with the request. Stamped signatures and dates are not accepted on CCP Authorization Request Forms or prescriptions for CCP prior authorized services, supplies, or equipm ent. Verbal orders must be cosigned and dated by a physician (M.D. or D.O.) within two weeks, per prov ider policy. Signatures of chiropractors or doctors of philosophy (PhDs) are not accepted on CCP Authorization Request Forms or prescriptions for CCP prior authorized services. Certified nurse midwife (CNM), clinical nurse spec ialist (CNS), nurse practitioner (NP), and PA providers may sign on behalf of the physician for private duty nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapy services when the physician delegates this authority. Physician prescriptions must be specific to the type of service requested. 2.2 Managed Care Organization (M CO) Clients Who Transition to Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS) When clients transition from an MCO to FFS, providers can request that previously approved authori- zations for Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) servic es, occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), private duty nursing (PDN), and speech ther apy (ST) be transferre d from the MCO to FFS. 2.2.1 Submission Guidelines TMHP will consider the reimbursement of claims for se rvices that were rendered on or after the MCO's disenrollment date only when the provider submits a request to TMHP to transfer the previously approved authorization for CCP services. The request to TMHP must be received on or before the end date of the previously approved MCO authorization. Any requests submitted after the MCO' s authorization end date will have to meet the regular submission guidelines for the specific service type. 2.2.2 Documentation Requirements All of the requests to transfer the authorizations from the MCO to FFS must include: A copy of the previously approved authorization letter. All of the documentation that was sent in the original authorization request, including any physician orders that were used to determine the start of care. TMHP will accept the physician orders as the required documentation for the requested services. The completed CCP Prior Autho rization Request form, Special Medical Prior Authorization (SMPA) form, Home Health Plan of Care, or Te xas Medicaid Physical, Occupational, or Speech Therapy (PT, OT, ST) Prior Authorization Form, whic hever is applicable for the requested service. The form must include the dates of service and quantities that are being requested from TMHP, which must match the dates of service and quan tities that were approved in the original authorization. Note: It is not necessary to obtain signatures or dates on the forms listed above when submitted to TMHP for the purpose of transferring an au thorization from an MCO to FFS Medicaid.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 18 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Authorizations for services transferred from an MC O to FFS Medicaid are subject to retrospective review. TMHP will verify the client's eligibility, the date s of service, and the quantities requested. TMHP will process reimbursement claims as follows: Claims for services that were rendered before the date on which the transfer request was received will be denied as a late submission, and the provider will be notified of their administrative appeal rights through the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). Claims for services that were rendered on or afte r the date of receipt use the required information from the transferred authorization and will be processed as if the request was received in a timely manner. Claims for services that were paid by an MCO and then recouped must contain the recoupment EOB from the MCO for consideration of payment. Th e claims must meet the 95-day deadline from the recoupment disposition date. Note: Letter requests for refunds will not be accepted . A recoupment EOB with a disposition date is required. If a request to transfer an MCO authorization is su bmitted after the end date of the MCO authorization or the provider does not have an authorization let ter from the MCO, TMHP will process the request to transfer the authorization based on established TM HP authorization submissi on guidelines for CCP services, PDN, OT, PT, and ST. All new requests for rendered services must meet the documentation requirements. 2.2.3 New Services and Extension of Services For new services that occur after the client's MCO disenrollment change date, the provider is responsible for submitting all TMHP required paperwork and m eeting all established subm ission guid elines for prior authorization. Requests for the extension of services that occur after the MCO disenrollment change date must include all of the paperwork that is required by TMHP and meet all established submission guidelines for prior authorization. 2.2.4 Loss of Eligibility If an MCO disenrolled a client and the client also loses Medicaid eligibil ity, providers must anticipate, if and when Medicaid eligibility is restor ed, that the client will initially be considered a Medicaid FFS client and will have a retroactive eligibility period. All requests for services that require prior authorization and that occur during the client's retroactive eligibility period, must be submitted to TMHP following the process that is outlined in subsection 5.1.1, \"Prior Authorization Requests for Clients \"Section 5: Fee-for-Service Prior Authorizations\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). If a client is retroactively disenrol led by an MCO, all of the services that are rendered by the provider during this retroactive disenrollment period (specifically from the date on which the client was eligible for FFS to the date of the client's MCO eligibility change) will be deni ed by TMHP, and the provider will be notified of their administrative appeal rights. TMHP may consider services for the MCO transition beginning on the date of the client's MCO eligi- bility change date and going forward. TMHP uses the MCO transition process for the submission of paperwork and the processing of provider requests.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 19 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.2.3 Autism Services Autism services are a benefit of the Texas Health Steps-Comprehensive Care Program (THSteps-CCP) for Medicaid children or youth who are 20 years old an d younger and meet the crit eria outlined in this section. 2.3.1 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition characterized by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and deficits in so cial communication and social interaction, with onset of symptoms occurring in early childhood. Texas Medicaid acknowledges that research and clinical practices in interventions for ASD are an evolving and dynamic field. As such, documentatio n to support the medical need for ASD services, including applied behavior analysis (ABA) services, may include intervention techniques with a sound basis in discipline-specific peer-reviewed literature wh en available, interventions with specific applica- to the person's cl inical and functional profile (inclu ding comorbid conditions), and an individualized, person-centered treatment plan that aligns with the values and preferences of the person with ASD and their family. Diagnosis of ASD may be made by any one of the following providers: A developmental pediatrician A neurologist A p s y c h i a t r i s t A licensed psychologist An interdisciplinary team composed of a physician, physician assist ant (PA), or nurse practitioner in consultation with one or more providers who ar e qualified child speciali sts, have expertise in autism, and are in one of the following disciplines: Any provider listed above Licensed clinical social worker Licensed professional counselor Licensed psychological associate Licensed specialist in school psychology Occupational therapist (OT) Speech-language pathologist (SLP) A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, with each element conducted by appropriately trained, specialized, or certified providers, is required to diagnose ASD. The diagnostic evaluation must include all of the following: Diagnostic criteria and symptom severity level according to the most current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). A validated diagnostic assessment tool or combinat ion of tools, using the most current editions or versions of the tools, as age and clinically appr opriate, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revise d (ADI-R), the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, or another validated diagnostic tool, as clinically appropriate. Screening tools such as the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT) may not replace the use of validated diagnostic assessment tools. Documentation of diagnosis must include:CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 20 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Age of the child or youth Date of the initial ASD diagnosis Documentation of any known comorbid behavioral or physical health disorders Documentation of trauma history To be eligible for the ABA services outlined in this se ction, a diagnosis of ASD complete with diagnostic criteria and symptom severity level must be made or reconfirmed with reassessment within 3 years of initiation or recertification of ABA services. To be eligible for ABA services outl ined in this section more than 3 years after initial ASD compre- hensive diagnosis, reassessment of ASD symptom severity levels per DSM criteria must be made by qualifying diagnostic providers, as listed above. 2.3.2 Comprehensive Service Array Texas Medicaid offers an array of medically necessary services to supp ort individualized treatment plans for children or youth who are 20 years old and younger with ASD. These services may be covered benefits when matched with an individualized treatment plan tailored to the specific needs of the child or youth who ar e 20 years old and younger and their caregivers and documented as medically ne cessary and effective. Not all services may be clinically appropriate for all people, families, or situations. Services must be evidence-based, person-centered, delivered by personnel of appropriate training and credentialing, and oriented to functi onal, attainable, and measurable goals. These services may include one or more of the following but are not limited to: Applied behavior analysis (ABA) Case management/care coordination (with parent permission) Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Nutrition, when provided by a licensed dietitian Occupational therapy (OT) Outpatient behavioral health services Physician services, including medication management Physical therapy (PT) Speech-language pathology (SLP); also called speech therapy (ST) Nonphysician qualified health-care professional s who are enrolled in Texas Medicaid may be reimbursed up to 2 times per rolling year for particip ation in interdisciplinary team meetings (procedure code 99366) for the coordination of care for children or youth who are 20 years old and younger with ASD and have a prior authorization for ABA evaluati on or treatment services. The Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) is required to partic ipate in interdisciplin ary treatment team meetings. Interdisciplinary team meetings are not required for child or youth access to any service but are highly encouraged for a collaborative approach to treatment, which is consider ed the gold standard for care of people with ASD. Interdisciplinary team meetings must include the LBA and at least 2 other licensed professionals meeting simultaneously with the parent or caregive r. The child or youth may optionally attend the meeting. Additional members may attend, such as assistants, pa raprofessionals, or others the family chooses, but these participants may not seek Medicaid reimbursem ent or count toward the required members of the interdisciplinary team meeting.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 21 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Non-Medicaid enrolled licensed pr ofessionals who work directly wi th the child or youth and would otherwise be eligible for reimbursement for interdisci plinary team meetings except that they are not Medicaid-enrolled may not receive Medicaid reim bursement for participation in team meetings. However, they may be considered as a participating team member for the purpose of meeting the minimum number of licensed provider participants. Regardless of Medicaid enrollment, licensed assistan ts, nonclinical social workers, case managers, and paraprofessionals may not count toward the minimum number of licensed professionals present at the interdisciplinary team meeting. Team members may include licensed Medicaid-enrolled practitioners of the following disciplines: Licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) Licensed behavior analyst (required team member) Licensed dietitian (LD) Licensed professional counselor (LPC) Licensed psychologist (LP) Occupational therapist (OT) Physical therapist (PT) Physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner Speech-language pathologist (SLP) Note: The physician, physician assistant, or nurse pra ctitioner may bill a standard evaluation and management code (i.e., established patient visit) based on the counseling and coordination of care time spent in the team conference. To be reimbursed for the interdisciplinary team meeting (procedure code 99366), each participating licensed team member must have individually evaluate d or provided direct services to the child or youth within the previous 180 days. For a change of provider, the new provider must foll ow requirements in the Change of Provider section to begin services prior to attendance at the interdisciplinary team meeting. Team members, including the child or youth, their fa mily, or their caregiver, may participate via remote technology, which meets standards of care for telehealth. Medicaid-enrolled providers must designate remote delivery with modifier 95 on the claim.Team members may include representatives from the ch ild's or youth's school, but school districts are not eligible for direct reimbursement fo r the interdisciplinary team meeting. No more than one individual from the same specia lty may receive Medicaid reimbursement for the team meeting. School personnel of the same discipline as Medi caid-enrolled providers who are participating to coordinate care are not considered duplicates of th e same specialty and may count toward the 3-partic- ipant licensed professional minimum. 2.3.3 Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Behavior analysis is the scientific study of the princi ples of learning and behavior, specifically about how behavior affects, and is affected by, past and current environmental ev ents in conjunction with biological variables.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 22 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.ABA refers to the application of current, evidence-b ased specialized principles of the applied behavior analysis discipline by a provider, such as a licensed and certified behavior analyst (LBA), trained in this intervention. The intent of ABA therapy is to effect meaningful changes, which are durable and generalizable, in socially significant behaviors in everyday settings. ABA focuses on treating behavior difficulties and shaping behavior patterns through environmental adaptations and consistent reinforcement and conse- quences across settin gs and situations. Intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) is a high-intensity application of ABA therapy. ABA services must be medi cally necessary to treat, correct, or am eliorate the individual's condition. A diagnosis alone is not sufficient documentat ion to support the medical necessity of ABA. Physical restraint is not appropriate during any serv ice provided to Medicaid children or youth under the Autism Services benefit except in emergency instan ces of threat of physical harm to the child or youth or others around them. Physical restraint may only be implemented by a person trained in the type of restraint being implemented. Restraint must be limited to the use of such reasonable force as is necessary to address the emergency. Restraint must be discontinued at the point at which the emergency no longer exists.Restraint must be implemented in such a way as to protect the health and safety of the child or youth and others. Restraint must not deprive the child or youth of basic human necessities. Documentation must be kept of the up-to-date trai ning for all staff members involved and of each incident that resulted in restraint. Use of ABA in no way precludes other medically necessary treatment interventions for ASD, such as ST, OT, and other forms of behavioral th erapy, family therapy, parent-implemented models that use a devel- opmental relationship-based appr oach, or medication management. Texas Medicaid strongly encourage s, and in some circumstances re quires, interdisciplinary collabo- ration of care. 2.3.4 Parent or Care giver Involvement For fidelity to the ABA treatment model for childr en or youth who meet elig ibility requirements, an effective course of ABA typically requires active pa rent or caregiver particip ation and involvement to increase the potential for behavior changes in the spec ific behaviors identified as causing limitations or deficits in functional skills expected for the child or youth. Parent or caregiver training is co nsidered a separate component of the individualized treatment plan from the direct services provided to the child or yo uth, and documentation of parent progress on goals is required. Parent or caregivers ideally must be able to part icipate in ABA therapy and implement ABA techniques in the home and community environment as instructed by the LBA or licensed assistant behavior analyst (LaBA) for behavior changes to prove to be durable and generalizable. Individual family circumstances are necessary criteria when designin g the individualized treatment plan. Participation by the parents or ca regivers are expected, and continue d authorization for ABA services will take consideration of their involvement and abil ity to reinforce behavior changes over time and across settings.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 23 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Exceptions to this general expectation may be cons idered on a case-by-case basis. For example: for children or youth in residential placement through the Department of Family and Protective Services conservatorship who have a treatment plan designed to address this limitation. In these cases, persons involved in the child or youth's care are encouraged to be involved in implementation of the therapeutic interventions in the home and community. ABA services will not be denied solely on the basis of lack of parent or caregiver involvement; however, parent or caregiver involvement may affect the effect iveness, durability, and generalizability to natural settings of the treatment and may be considered when making determinations re garding effectiveness of the treatment requested. 2.3.5 Treatment Planning Treatment planning requires that the LBA collabor ate with and obtain documentation of determina- tions from the prescribing provider or other appropri ate providers for elements of the treatment plan that are not within the LBA scope of practice. ABA treatment plans, including group treatment, require goals that relate to the child or youth's individual functional contexts. Functional context refers to everyday environments fo r behaviors or skills that allow the child or youth to achieve an outcome relevant to their health, safety, or independence. Goals to address behaviors that result in deficits in social communicati on and social interaction relating to the child or youth health, safety , or independence in functional co ntexts may be considered medically necessary. Treatment plan goals (to include parent or caregiver training) may target a specific behavior interfering with activities of daily living (ADLs) use the prin ciples of ABA (i.e., backward chaining, schedules of reinforcement, etc.) to teach parents or caregivers on supporting ADLs. General goals addressing ADL skill acquisition are excluded. Functional goals must be specific to the child or youth, objectively measurable within a specified time frame, attainable in relation to the child or yout h's prognosis and developmen tal status, both important to and relevant to the child or youth and their family , and directly related to the core symptoms of ASD as defined by the current version of DSM. The treatment plan may also include goals to spec ifically address challenging behaviors, such as aggression, in the creation of a Behavior Support Plan (BSP). BSPs may not include the use of aversive interventi ons, including but not limited to the use of pain, discomfort, social humiliation, seclusion, or restraints. The treatment plan must include separate goals specific to parent or caregiver training. The child or youth must be able to participate in sessions as outlined in the individualized treatment plan. This section addresses ABA services provided by Te xas LBAs as well as by an LaBA or behavior technician (BT) working under the supervision of an LBA in office, home , clinic, and community settings. All LBAs and their supervisees must provide services in a way that is consistent with the physician's orders, commonly accepted practice standards, licensing requir ements, and within their scope of practice. Services must be provid ed in compliance with the Texas Health Step-Comprehensive Care Program, medical standards for telehealth, and th ese Medicaid Autism Services requirements, which may be more restrictive than general ABA practice. The LBA must determine whether services are clini-CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 24 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.cally appropriate, effective, and no t contraindicated for the child or youth, their family, or particular situation. LBAs and supervisees must also adhere to all applicable he alth-care standards, including but not limited to confidentiality, documentation, and medical record-keeping. Note: Remote delivery as specified for this service will supersede that of the Telecommunication Services Handbook. ABA therapy addresses the behaviors associated with the core symptoms of ASD that impact attainment of individualized functional goals. It is out of sc ope for an ABA provider to attempt to remediate under- lying or associated medical conditions that may impa ct progress toward individualized functional goals or to formulate a treatment plan without appropriate collaboration with other health-care disciplines, as appropriate. LBAs and the staff they supervise are expected to have training and knowledge of typical development for children or youth who are 20 years old and younge r in order to provide medically necessary services. When evaluating and treating children and youth with suspected or diagnosed comorbid genetic, physical, or behavioral health cond itions or trauma history, the LBA is expected to coordinate with the appropriate skilled and licensed professionals. Co -occurring conditions may mimic or exacerbate ASD symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment of physical health condit ions, including developmen tal delays in children, would require collaboration with additional professionals. For example, a child or youth with a co-morbid diagnosis of a motor disorder who has treatment plan goals addressing speech or motor skill deve lopment would require coordination with an SLP, OT, or PT, as appropriate. For example, a child or youth with a diagnosis of a seizure disorder would require close coordination with the physician treating the condition. A child with a co-morbid diagnosis of a feeding disorder who has treatment plan goals addressing feeding would require coordination with the ap propriate medical provider, including but not limited to a physician, dietitian, OT, or SLP. LBAs are not permitted as the sole provider of a feeding treatment plan. Diagnosis and treatment of co-occurri ng behavioral health conditions require the input of and coordi- nation with behavioral health prof essionals specifically trained and ed ucated in this scope of practice. For example, a child or youth with a co-morbid diagnosis of an xiety would require coordination with the appropriate behavioral health provider. It is out of scope for an LBA to dictate the provis ion of other medically nece ssary treatments, including requiring a child or youth and their family to drop other services in order to access ABA. The following ABA services may be authorized for eligible children or youth who have been diagnosed with ASD according to guidelines: An initial ABA evaluation (proce dure code 97151) to include deve lopment of an individualized treatment plan and a BSP, as appropriate An initial 90-day course of ABA treatment with medical necessity docume ntation from the ABA evaluation. Treatment may include the foll owing with documented medical necessity: Provision of one-on-one ABA services delivered directly by the LBA or delivered by the super- vised LaBA, BT, or both (procedure codes 97153, 97155) Provision of group ABA services delivered direct ly by the LBA or delivered by the supervised LaBA, BT, or both (procedure codes 97154, 97158)CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 25 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

If applicable, employ directly or co ntract with LaBAs or BTs or both. Have training and knowledge of typical developmen t for children or youth who are 20 years old and younger. LBAs serve as direct supervisors of the LaBAs and BTs and must ensure that the quality of the ABA services provided by LaBAs and BTs meets the mini mum standards promulgated by the applicable certi- fying body's recommendations, rules, and regu lations as well as Medicaid requirements. LBAs are ultimately responsible for the delive ry of ABA care including the treatment plan. Direct supervision must be provided in accordance with Texas state licensure. Only direct supervision, where the LBA directly observes the LaBA or the BT providing services with the child or youth, or the child or youth's parents or caregivers, will be reimb ursed by Texas Medicaid (procedure code 97155). Indirect supe rvision, including but not limited to a review and discussion of case load, data collection procedures, and profession al development, is not reimbursable under Texas Medicaid. See the Reimbursement and Billing Guidelines section. ABA treatment will ideally be delivered in the primar y language used at home or the primary language of the child or youth with ASD. Translation or interpretation services, when and as required for effective service delivery, must be offered if providers are not able to deliver the treatment in the child or youth's primary language. The LBA is responsible for provision of services within Medicaid requirements. 2.3.6.2 Licensed Assistant Behavior Analysts (LaBA) LaBAs must have a current, unrestri cted state-issued license and meet all applicable Texas licensure requirements.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 26 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

An estimate of the child or youth's cognitiv e abilities may be provided when a validated assessment of cognitive abilities is not possibl e due to the child or youth's level of ASD or behaviors or both. Limited cognitive ability or ot her co-occurring disability does not preclude the child or youth from consideration for medically necessary ABA evaluation and treatment services provided the treatment plan is realistic for the child or youth. A functional behavior assessment, related to spec ific behaviors of concern, to be addressed in a BSP, as clinically indicated. Individualized ABA treatment plans must include: Identification of specific targeted behaviors/skills related to the child or youth's health, safety, or independence that will be addressed in treatment.

Treatment plan, such as updated goals. 2.3.7.14 Frequency and Duration Guidelines for ABA services Frequency must always be commensurate with the child or youth's clinical needs and level of disability, as well as evidence-based standards of practice; it is not for the convenience of the responsible parents or caregivers or the provider. LBA recommendations for frequency and duration on the ABA treatmen t plan are expected to reflect the LBA's skilled analysis of the optimal dose-respo nse relationship for the child or youth and their family. Therefore, the child or youth and family attendance at the recommended frequency and duration levels is critical in following ev idence-based treatment recommendatio ns. Poor or sporadic attendance may impact the effectiveness, dura bility, or generalizability of th e treatments that are delivered. An effective course of ABA typicall y requires active parent or caregiver involvement to increase the potential for durable and generalizable behavior change s in the specific behaviors identified as causing limitations or deficits in functional skills expected for the child or youth based on personal and environ- mental factors unique to that indi vidual. Exceptions to this are made only as determined on a case-by- case basis. ABA treatment (not inclusive of pr ocedure code 97156) may be delivere d at the following frequency and duration levels without requiring ad ditional submission of documentat ion or review by a physician for medical necessity. Medical ne cessity is related to symptom severity as defined by the current version of the DSM in addition to guidelines in this section. All levels of intensity of ABA treatment services may be considered depending upon indi vidual case consideration. The fo llowing are guidelines. The objec- tives of ABA therapy will vary per child or youth, an d frequency and duration should be based upon the functional goals of treatment, specific needs of the child or youth, response to treatment, and availability of appropriately trained and certified ABA staff. Treatment plans in which the requested frequency exceeds the following service level guidelines will be sent for physician review to determine medical necessity. High frequency IBI (greater than 20 hours/week) may be considered when documentation shows two or more of the following: 6 y e a r s o f a g e o r y o u n g e r Autism Severity Level 2 or 3 (per DSM-V criteria) Goals related to elopement, aggression, or self-injury that are severely impairing Within the first 2 years of initiating ABA Moderate frequency (6 to 20 hours/week) may be considered when documentation shows two or more of the following: 12 years of age or younger Autism Severity Level 2 or 3 (per DSM-V criteria) Goals related to elopement, aggression, or self-injury that are moderately impairing Within the first 4 years of initiating ABA therapyCHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 33 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Targeted/focused frequency (5 hours or less/w eek or 20 hours or less/month in some other increment) may be considered when document ation shows two or more of the following: 20 years of age or younger Autism Severity Level 1, 2, or 3 (per DSM-V criteria) Focused on specific targeted clinical issues or goals related to specific targeted skills Maintenance/consultative level (2-4 hours per we ek or less) may be considered when documen- tation shows all of the following: Ages 1 through 20 years of age Autism Severity Level 1, 2, or 3 (per DSM-V criteria) Goals related to integration of spec ific skills into daily functioning Documentation substantiates the risk for regr ession after completion of more intense ABA intervention 2.3.7.15 Discharge or Discontinuation Criteria The ABA provider may discharge the child or youth from treatment, or ABA prior authorizations may be discontinued, when docume ntation submitted indicates on e or more of the following: The child or youth has met ABA treatment plan go als and is no longer in need of ABA services. The child or youth has not made clinically significant progress towa rd meeting goals identified on the ABA treatment plan after successive progress re view periods and repeated modifications to the treatment plan. Health-care services that do not demonstrate effectiveness as consistent with Medicaid autism service requirements must be modified or discontinued. ABA treatment plan gains are not generalizable or durable over time and do not transfer to the larger community setting after su ccessive progress review periods an d repeated modifications to the treatment plan. The child or youth can no longer participate in ABA services because of medical factors, family factors, or other factors that prohibit participation. Parent or caregiver opts to discontinue. Attendance falls below 85% of scheduled sessio ns without documentatio n supporting the medical necessity of continued treatment. The ABA providers do not appropriately collect, trac k, or review progress or outcomes data, or do not make appropriate treatment plan modi fications for effective service delivery. 2.3.8 Exclusions The following services are not a benefit of Texas Medicaid: ABA addressing academic goals ABA addressing goals only related to performative social norms that do not significantly impact health, safety, or independence Treatment other than at the maintenance or consultative level not expected to result in improve- ments in the child or youth's level of functioning Services that do not require the supervision of or specific skills and judgment of a LBA to perform Services that do not meet accepted standards of practice for specific and effective treatment of ASDCHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 34 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

For those services for which the unit of service is 15 minutes (1 unit = 15 minutes), partial units should be rounded up or down to the nearest quarter hour. To calculate billing units, count the total number of billable minutes for the calendar day for the client, and divide by 15 to convert to billable units of service. If the total billable minutes are not divisible by 15, the minutes are converted to one unit of service if th ey are greater than seven and converted to zero units of service if they are seven or fewer minutes. For example: 68 total billable minutes/15 = 4 units + 8 minutes. Because the 8 minutes are more than 7 minutes, those 8 minutes are converted to one unit. Therefore, 68 total billable minutes = 5 units of service. When providers are counting minutes for timed proc edure codes, the time intervals for 1 through 8 units are as follows: 2.4 Breastfeeding Support Services Refer to: Section 3, \"Breastfeeding Support Services\" in the Gynecological, Obstetrics, and Family Planning Title XIX Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for information about breastfeeding support services. 2.5 Certified Respiratory Care Practitioner Services (CCP) Refer to: The Certified Respiratory Care Practitioner (CRCP) Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for information about CRCP (CCP) services. 2.6 * Clinician-Directed Care Coordination Services (CCP) 2.6.1 * Services, Benefits, and Limitations Clinician-directed (physician, NP, CNS, and PA) care coordination services are a benefit of CCP for eligible clients who are birth through 20 years of age an d have special health needs.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.2.8 Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Supplier (CCP) 2.8.1 Enrollment To be eligible to participate in CCP, providers of DME (including customized or non-basic medical equipment) and expendable medical supp lies must be enrolled in Medicare. Home health agencies that provide DME and supplies should refer to subsection 2.1, \"Enrollment\" in the Durable Medical Equipment, Medical Supp lies, and Nutritional Products Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ). 2.8.1.1 Pharmacies (CCP) Pharmacy providers are eligible to participate in CCP. To be enrolled in CCP, the pharmacy must also be enrolled in VDP. This enrollment allows pharmacy providers to bill for those medications and supplies payable by Medicaid for clients who are birth through 20 years of age but not covered by VDP (e.g., some over-the- counter drugs, some nutritional products, diapers, and disposable or expendable medical supplies). Pharmacy providers must continue to bill HHSC for drugs covered under VDP. To locate a pharmacy CCP provider, use the Online Provider Lookup (OPL) at opl.tmhp.com. Refer to: Subsection 2.1.2, \"Enrollment\" in this handbook for more information about CCP enrollment procedures. Section 1.1, \"About the Vendor Drug Program\" in the Outpatient Drug Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks )) for information about this program. Section 2, \"Texas Medicaid (Title XIX) Home Health Services\" for details about coverage through Texas Medicaid (Title XIX) Home Health Services. 2.8.2 Services, Benefits , and Limitations DME is defined as medical equipment that is manu factured to withstand repeated use, ordered by a physician for use in the home, and requ ired to correct or ameliorate the client's disability, condition, or illness. Because there is no single authority (such as a federa l agency) that confers the official status of \"DME\" on any device or product, HHSC retains the right to make such determinations with regard to DME covered by Texas Medicaid. DME covered by Texas Medi caid must either have a well-established history of efficacy or, in the case of novel or unique equipment, valid peer-reviewed evidence that the equipment serves a medical purpose, can withstand repeated use, and is appropriate and safe for use in the home. Requested DME may be a benefit of Texas Medicaid when it meets the Medicaid definition of DME. The majority of DME and expendable medical supplies are covered thro ugh Texas Medicaid (Title XIX) Home Health Services. If a service cannot be provided through Texas Medica id (Title XIX) Home Heal th Services, the service may be covered through CCP if it is determined to be medically necessa ry for the client and if FFP is available. If a DME provider is unable to deliver a piece of equi pment, the provider must allow the client the option of obtaining the DME or expendable me dical supplies from another provider. Periodic rental payments are made only for the lesser of the following: The period of time the equipment is medically necessary The total monthly rental payments equal the reasonable purchase cost for the DMECHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 50 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DME will be purchased when a purchase is determined to be medically necessary and more cost effective than leasing the device with supplies. Only new, unus ed equipment will be purchased. When a provider is replacing a piece of rental DME with purchased DME, the provider must supply a new piece of DME to the client. Purchase is justified when the estimated duration of need multiplied by the rental payments would exceed the reasonable purchase cost of the equipment or it is otherwise more practical to purchase the equipment. DME repair will be considered based on the age of the item and cost to repair it. A request for repair of DME must include an itemized estimated cost list fr om the vendor or DME provider who will make the repairs. Rental equipment may be provided to replace purchased medical equipment for the period of time it will take to make necessary repairs to purchased medical equipment. All adjustments and modifications that are made within the first six months after delivery are considered part of the purchase price. However, DME that has been delivered to the client's home and then found to be inappropriate for the client 's condition will not be eligible for an upgrade within the first six months following purchase unless there had been a s ignificant change in the client's condition, as documented by the physician familiar with the client. Rental reimbursement to the same provider cannot ex ceed the purchase price, except as addressed in specific policies. All DME purchased for a client becomes the Medicaid client's property upon receipt of the item. Delivered equipment will become the Medicaid client's property in th e following instances even though it will not be prior authorized or reimbursed: Equipment delivered to the client before the physician signature date on the CCP Prior Authori- zation Request Form or prescription. Equipment delivered more than three business da ys before obtaining prior authorization from TMHP that meets the criteria for purchase. As long as the client is eligible for CCP services on the date the custom equi pment is ordered from the manufacturer, the provider must use the order date as the date of service since custom equipment is client specific and cannot be used for another client. To establish medical necessity of the equipment for th e client, the provider must have on file in the client's records current document ation that is signed by a phys ician (e.g., a signed and dated prescription) showing the following: A diagnosis relative to each item requested. The specific type of supply needed. The length of time needed. 2.8.2.1 Purchase Versus Equipment Rental When providing equipment not prio r authorized under Texas Medica id (Title XIX) Home Health Services for CCP clients with long-t erm or chronic conditions, it is mo re cost-effective, in many cases, to purchase the equipment rather than rent it. The client's condition and leng th of time the equipment will be used must be carefully assessed before prior authorization for rental or purchase is requested. CCP nurses determine whether the equipment will be rented, purchased, repaired, or modified based on the client's needs, the duration of use, and the age of the equipment.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 51 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.CCP does not pay for the purchase of certain types of equipment; consequently, long-term rental may be considered. Most other equipmen t is rented for only four months initially. During this time, the provider must assess whether the equipment should be purchased before the rental lapses. Rentals and purchases must be prior authorized. After prior authorization is obtain ed for purchase, new equipment must be provided and the rental discontinued. CCP does not purchase used equipment. Providers of customized or nonbasic medical equi pment also must be enrolled as Medicare DME providers. 2.8.3 Prior Authorization and Documentation Requirements Providers can request prior authorization for most DME through the TMHP website. Providers that make written requests for prior authorization must complete the CCP Prior Authorization Request Form on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com , and they must attach the documentation necessary to support the request. The documentat ion must include a current prescrip tion that has been signed and dated by a physician (M.D. or D.O.), and it must be mailed or faxed to TMHP with the prior authori- zation request. For specific policy information not co ntained in this manual related to the purchase of DME, providers can call TMHP-CCP Customer Service at 1-800-846-7470. A completed CCP Prior Authorization Request Form pr escribing the DME or medical supplies must be signed and dated by the prescribing physician familiar with the client before requesting prior authori- zation. The completed CCP Prior Authorization Request Form must be maintained by the requesting provider and the prescribing physician. The original signature copy must be kept in the physician's medical record for the client. To complete the prior authorization process by paper, the DME provider must fax or mail the completed CCP Prior Authorization Request Form to the CCP prior authorization unit and retain a copy of the signed and dated CCP form in the client's medica l record at the provider's place of business. To complete the prior authorization process electron ically, the DME provider must complete the prior authorization requirements through any approved elec tronic methods and retain a copy of the signed and dated CCP Prior Authorization Request form in the client's medical record at the provider's place of business. To avoid unnecessary denials, the physician must pr ovide correct and complete information, including accurate documentation of the medical necessity for the equipment and services requested. The physician must maintain documentation of medica l necessity in the client's medical record. The requesting provider may be asked for additional information to clarify or complete a request. Retrospective review may be performed to ensure documentation supports the medical necessity of the requested equipment or supplies. A determination as to whether the equipment will be rented, purchased, repaired, or modified will be made by HHSC or its design ee based on the client's needs, durati on of use, and age of the equipment. Equipment that has been purchased may be considered for replacement when loss or irreparable damage has occurred outside the warranty terms, conditions, and li mitations. A copy of the police or fire report, when appropriate, and th e measures to be taken to prevent reo ccurrence must be submitted with the prior authorization request. A request for prior authorization mu st include documentation from the provider to support the medical necessity of the service, equipment, or expendable medical supply. Physician prescriptions must be specific to the item requested. For example, if the provider is requesting a customized wheelchair, the prescription must request a custom ized wheelchair, not just a wheelch air. Providers must submit a CCP Prior Authorization Request Form and documentat ion to support medical necessity to the CCP department before providing services. Providers must obtain prior authorization within three business days of the requested date of service.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 52 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Refer to: Section 2.2.30, \"Procedure Codes That Do Not Require Prior Authorization\" for details about specific procedure codes that do no t require prior authorization through Texas Medicaid (Title XIX) Home Health Services. 2.8.3.1 Equipment Accessories CCP may consider prior authorization of equipment acce ssories, such as ventilator and oxygen trays and positioning inserts, when supporti ng documentation takes into accoun t all the client's needs, capabil- ities, and physical or mental status. 2.8.3.2 Equipment Modifications A modification is the replacement of a component du e to changes in the clie nt's condition, not the replacement of a component that is no longer functioning. DME that has been delivered to the client's home and then found to be inappropriate for the client's condition will not be eligible for an upgrade within the first six months following purchase. All modifi- cations that are made within the first six months afte r delivery are considered part of the purchase price. However, CCP may consider prior authorization of modifications to custom equipment if a change occurs in the client's needs, capabilities, or phys ical or mental status that cannot be anticipated. Documentation must include: All projected changes in the client's needs. The age of the current equipment, and the cost of purchasing new equi pment versus modifying current equipment. 2.8.3.3 Equipment Adjustments Adjustments do not require supplies. Labor for adjustments within the first six months af ter delivery are not prior authorized because these are considered part of the purchase price. Up to one hour of labor for adjustments may be considered for reimbursement with prior authorization through CCP as needed after the first six mont hs. Providers must use procedure code K0739 for adjustments. 2.8.3.4 Repair to Client-Owned Equipment Repairs to client-owned equipment may be prior authorized as needed with documentation of medical necessity. Technician fees are consider ed part of the cost of the repair. HHSC or its designee reserves the right to request additional documentation about the need for repairs when there is evidence of abuse or neglect to equipmen t by the client, client's family, or caregiver. When there is documented proof of abuse or neglect, requests for repairs will not be prior authorized. Providers are responsible for maintain ing documentation in the client's medical record th at specifies the repairs and supporting medical necessity. Documentation must include all of the following: The date of purchase The serial number of the current equipment (as applicable) The cause of the damage or need for repairs What steps the client or caregiver will take to prevent further damage if repairs are due to an accident When requested, the cost of purchasing new equi pment as opposed to repa iring current equipmentCHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 53 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Temporary replacement of client-owned respiratory eq uipment during the repair may be considered for prior authorization for one mo nth using procedure code K0462. Labor for repair of client-owned respiratory equipment may be consid ered for prior authorization using procedure code K0739 up to a maximum of two hours per day (maximum quantity of eight units). Routine maintenance of rental equipm ent is the provider's responsibility. 2.8.3.5 DME Certification and Receipt Form The DME Certification and Receipt Fo rm is required and must be co mpleted before reimbursement can be made for any DME delivered to a client. The cert ification form must include the name of the item, the date the client received the DME, and the signatures of the provider and the client or primary caregiver. The DME provider must maintain the signed and dated form in the client's medical record.DME claims and appeals that meet or exceed a bille d amount of $2,500 for the same date of service will suspend for verification of client receipt of the DME item(s). The DME Certification and Receipt Form must be faxed to 1- 512-506-6615. If the claim is submitted withou t the form or if receipt of the DME item(s) cannot be verified, the DME item(s) on the claim will be denied. TMHP may contact the client that received the product for verification of services rendered. Refer to: DME Certification and Receipt Form on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . 2.8.3.6 Documentation of Supply Delivery Providers must retain individual de livery slips or corresponding invoic es for each date of service to document the date of delivery for all supplies provided to a client. Providers must disclose this documen- tation to HHSC or its designee upon request. These records and claims must be retained for a minimum of five years from the date of service (DOS) or until all audit questions, appeals, hearings, investigations, or court cases are resolved. The DOS is the date on which supplies are delivered to the client or shipped by a carrier to the client as evidenced by the dated tracking document attached to the corresponding invoice for that date. Documentation of deli very must include one of the following: Delivery slip or invoice signed an d dated by the client or caregiver. A dated carrier tracking document that includes the shipping date and delivery date must be printed from the carrier's website as confirmation that the supplies were shipped and delivered. The dated carrier tracking document must be attached to the delivery slip or corresponding invoice. The dated delivery slip or invoice mu st include the client's full name and address to where supplies were delivered, and an itemized list of goods that includes the descriptions and numerical quantities of the supplies delivered to the client, and the corresponding tracking number from the carrier. This document could also include prices, ship ping weights, shipping charges, and any other description. All claims submitted for DME suppli es must include the same quantities or units that are documented on the delivery slip or correspon ding invoice and on the CCP Prior Authorization Request form. They must reflect the number of units by which each pr oduct is measured. For example, diapers are measured as individual units. If one package of 300 diapers is delivered, the delivery slip or invoice and the claim must reflect that 300 diapers were delivered and not that one package was delivered. Diaper wipes are measured as boxes or packages. If one box of 200 wipes is delivered, the delivery slip or invoice and the claim must reflect that one box wa s delivered and not that 200 individu al wipes were delivered. There must be one dated delivery slip or invoice for each claim submitted for each patient. All claims submitted for DME supplies must reflect either one business day before or one business day after the date of service as documented on the delivery slip or correspondi ng invoice and the same timeframe covered by the CCP Prior Authorization Request form. The DME Certific ation and Receipt Form is still required for all equipment delivered.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 54 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

ECI service providers are employees and subcontractors of non-profit entities that have contracts with the State of Texas for the provision of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C Early Childhood Intervention services. Medically necessary services may be provided by ot her Medicaid-enrolled provid ers in addition to the services provided by the ECI contractor. For exampl e, the family may choose to receive speech therapy from the ECI contractor and physical therapy from a home health provider. Or, outpatient clinic personnel may have expertise that will enhance the services of the ECI provider resulting in ECI providers and other Medicaid-enrolled providers pr oviding services within the same discipline. Only the services provided to ECI enrolled children by ECI contracted entities must comply with the Medicaid medical guidelines for ECI services. Services provided by other Medica id-enrolled providers, including ot her providers of physical, occupa- tional, and speech therapy, must comply with Medica id medical guidelines that apply to those provider types (e.g., outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency). 2.9.2.1 Physical, Occupational, and Sp eech Therapies and Specialized Skills Training (PT, OT, ST, and SST) ECI services use techniques by which the ECI service provider engages the family or caregiver in activ- ities to meet the developmental needs of the child.

Whenever possible, HHSC encourages face-to-face interac tion, such as an in-person visit, as well as the use of synchronous audiovisual technology over sy nchronous telephone (audio-only) technology of telehealth services. Providers must defer to the needs of the client receiv ing services, allowing the mode of service delivery to be accessible, person- and family-centered, and prim arily driven by the client in service's choice and not provider convenience. Services delivered by synchronous audiovisual techn ology will require participation of a parent or caregiver to assist with the treatment. Therapy assistants may deliver services and re ceive supervision using synchronous audiovisual technology in accordance wi th each discipline's rules. Providers should refer to state practice rules and national guidelines regarding supervis ion requirements for each discipline.

Co-location is defined as the provision of services in the same office or building complex in which the client's physician, PA, or APRN has their practice. In many cases, the treating physician, PA, NP, or CNS will be the person's primary care provider; however, a specialist seeing a person regularly may fu nction in a similar role to a primary care provider and may also make HBAI refe rrals to a co-located LPHA. HBAI services are designed to identify the psycholo gical, behavioral, emotional, cognitive and social factors important to prevention, treatment or management of physical health symptoms. HBAI services are a benefit when the person receiving services meets the following criteria: The person has an underlying physical illness or injury. There are indications that biopsyc hosocial factors may be signific antly affecting the treatment or medical management of an illness or an injury. The person is alert, oriented, and, depending on th e person's age, has the capacity to understand and to respond meaningfully duri ng the in-person evaluation. The person has a documented need for psychological evaluation or intervention to successfully manage his or her physical illness, and activities of daily living. The assessment is not duplicative of other provider assessments. HBAI services that include the family of the person receiving services are a benefit when the family member directly participates in the overal l care of the person receiving services.

All PCS providers must have an NPI. Providers that are currently contra cted with HHSC to administer cons umer-directed services (CDS) or provide PCS through the service responsibility option (SRO), including providers currently enrolled in Texas Medicaid, are required to enro ll or re-enroll separately as a CD S or SRO provider. Texas Medicaid enrolls only new providers that are currently cont racted with HHSC to provide PCS through CDS and SRO. Providers (other than those discussed above) that want to provide PCS to Medicaid clients must enroll through TMHP. Texas Medicaid enrollment rules for PCS participation require providers to have one of the following categories of HHSC licensure prior to enrollment: Personal Assistance Services (PAS) Licensed Home Heal th Services (LHHS) Licensed and Certified Home Health Services (LCHHS)CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 73 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.LCHH and LHH agencies that are currently enrolled through TMHP do not need to enroll as CCP-PCS providers to provide PCS. Providers must have an NPI in one of the following enrollment categories: LHHS agency, LCHHS agency, or PCS provider. Providers that are enrolled as any entity other than an LHHS agency or LCHHS agency are required to meet the provider enrollment rules in order to participate in the delivery of PCS through Texas Medicaid. Refer to: Subsection 2.1.2, \"Enrollment\" in this handbook for more information about CCP enrollment procedures. 2.12.2 Services, Benefits , and Limitations PCS is a benefit of CCP for Texas Medicaid clients who are birth through 20 years of age. PCS may not be authorized in hospitals, nursing facilities, or in termediate care facilities for individuals with intel- lectual or developmental disabilities (ICF-IID). PC S will be denied when billed on the same date of service as an inpatient stay service. The provider may appeal the denied claim with documentation supporting that PCS was performed while the client was not in a hospital setting. PCS are support services provided to clients who meet the definition of medical necessity and require assistance with the performance of ADLs, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and health maintenance activities (HMAs) due to a physical, cognitive, or behavioral li mitation related to a clie nt's disability or chronic health condition. PCS are provided by someone other than the responsible adult of the client who is a minor child or the legal spouse of the client. A responsible adult is an individual, 18 years of age or older, who has agreed to accept the responsibility for providing food, shelter, clothing, education, n urturing, and supervision fo r the client. Responsible adults include, but are not limited to, biological parent s, adoptive parents, step parents, foster parents, legal guardians, court-appointed mana ging conservators, and the primary ad ult who is acting in the role of parent. PCS are those services that assist eligible clients in performing ADLs, IADLs, and HMAs. The scope of ADLs, IADLs, and HMAs includes a range of activities that healthy, nondisable d adults can perform for themselves. Typically, developing children graduall y and sequentially acquire the ability to perform these ADLs, IADLs, and HMAs for themselves. If a typically developing child of the same chronological age could not safely and independently perform an ADL, IADL, or HMAs without adult supervision, then the client's responsible adult ensures that the client's needs for the ADLs, IADLs, and HMAs are met. PCS include direct intervention (assisting the client in performing a task) or indirect intervention (cueing or redirecting the client to perform a task). ADLs, IADLs, and HMAs include, but are not limited to, the following: ADLs IADLs Bathing Escort or Assistance with Transportation Services Dressing Grocery or Household ShoppingEating Laundry Locomotion or Mobility Light housework Personal Hygiene Meal preparationPositioning Medication AssistanceToileting Money management Transferring Telephone Use or Other Communication * Escort or Assistance with Transportation Services includes the co ordination of transpo rtation to medical appointments and accompaniment to appointments to assist with needed ADLs. PCS does not include the payment for transportation or transportation vehicl es since these services are available through MTP.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 74 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Note: Exercise and range of motion ar e not available through PCS, bu t are services that could be provided through PT, PDN, or home health SN. PCS does not include the following: ADLs, IADLs, or HMAs that a typically developi ng child of the same chronological age could not safely and independently perform without adult supervision Services that provide direct intervention when the client has the physical, behavioral, and cognitive abilities to perform an ADL, IADL, or health -related function without adult supervision Services used for or intended to provide resp ite care, child care, or restraint of a client Stand-by supervision related to safety Potty training Grocery shopping for members of the client's family or household Cleaning for members of the client's family or household (exception: light housework is approved if the client shares a room with a person) Cleaning the entire house (exception: a need for clean environment is approved if related to the client's diagnosis or condit ion [e.g., asthma, allergies, or autoimmune deficiencies]) Note: Cleaning an area or equipment that is used to complete a task may be included in the light housework IADL, as appropriate. Laundry services for members of the client's family or household (exception: laundry is approved when related to the client's diagnosis or condition that results in soiled bedding or clothing for the client beyond the norm [e.g., inco ntinence, feeding tube, trachea, an ostomy, diapers, or skin condition]) Waiting time for the laundry machine to complete a cycle in the home setting (exception: the time an attendant is at a laundromat completing the laundry task for the client is covered for PCS) Meal preparation for members of the client's family or household Time of a PCS attendant while acting as the responsible adult for the receipt of medical care or providing medical transportation An escort is approved if it is rela ted to the client's diagnosis or condit ion, such as using the toilet at the appointment or assistance carrying equi pment (e.g., feeding pump, oxygen tank). An escort is approved if it is related to the client 's diagnosis or condition an d the responsible adult is occupied during the transport. For example, a child' s condition might include be haviors that create an unsafe situation for the child during transport, such as removing a seatbelt, attempting to open the car door while the car is in motion, or elopement. PCS does cover the entire time that an attendant is away from the home performing this task. PCS is considered for reimbursement when provider s use procedure code T1019 in conjunction with the appropriate modifier listed in the following table. PCS provided by a home health agency or PCS-only provider, including PCS being provid ed under the SRO defined in 40 TA C Part 1, Chapter 41, must be billed in 15-minute increments. PCS provided by a financial management services agency (FMSA) under the CDS option defined in 40 TAC Part 1, Chap ter 41, must submit the attendant fee in 15-minute increments. FMSAs must bill the administration fee once per calendar month per client for any month in which the client receives PCS under the CDS option and re gardless of the number of PCS units of service the client receives under the CDS option during the month. PCS claims are considered for reimbursement only when TMHP has i ssued a valid PAN to a PCS provider.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 75 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Texas Medicaid does not reimburse providers for PCS that duplicate services that are the legal respon- sibility of school districts. The sc hool district, through the School He alth and Related Services (SHARS) program, is required to meet the client's personal care needs while the client is at school. If those needs cannot be met by SHARS or the school district, the school district must submit documentation to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) case manager indicating the school district is unable to provide all medically necessary services. When cl ients are receiving both PC S and PDN services from an individual person over the same span of time, the combined total number of hours for PCS and PDN are reimbursed according to the maximum allowable rate. 2.12.2.2 Client Eligibility The PCS benefit is available to Texas Medicaid clients who: Are birth through 20 years of age.PCS Procedure Codes All PCS Providers* (except FMSA) Procedure Code T1019Modifier U6 (PCS each 15 minutes) UA (Behavioral health co ndition, each 15 minutes) FMSA Under CDS Option* Procedure Code T1019 Modifier U7 (Attendant fee each 15 minutes) U8 (Administration fee once a month) UB (Behavior health condition, each 15 minutes) * 40 TAC Part 1, Chapter 41CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 76 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Clients must choos e the program through which they receive a ttendant care, if they meet the eligibility requirements of both programs. Clie nts will be given the following options for the delivery of attendant care services: A client can receive all attend ant care services through PCS. A client can decline PCS and rece ive all attendant care service through a waiver program, if the waiver program offers attendant care.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 77 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Clients who participate in the CDS option for PCS an d for a waiver program are required to choose one FMSA to provide services through both programs. FM SAs will only be permitted to file the financial management services (FMS) fee, also known as the monthly administrative fee, through one program. The FMSA must file the FMS claim through the program that provides the highest reimbursement rate. 2.12.2.2.1 Accessing the PCS Benefit Clients must be referred to DSHS be fore receiving the PCS benefit. A re ferral can be made by any person who recognizes a client may have a need for PCS, including, but not limited to, the following: The client, a parent, a guardian, or a responsible adult A primary practitioner, primary care provider, or medical home A licensed health professional who has a therap eutic relationship with the client and ongoing clinical knowledge of the client A family member Home health, personal assistance, or FMSA providers Referrals to DSHS can be made to the appropriate DSHS Health Service Region, based on the client's place of residence in the state. Clients, parents, or guardians may also call the TMHP PCS Client Line at 1-888-276-0702 for more information on PCS. PCS prov iders must provide contact information for the client or responsible adult to DSHS or the TMHP PCS Client Contact Line when making a referral. Upon receiving a referral, DSHS ass igns the client a case manager, who then conducts an assessment in the client's home with the input and assistance of the client or responsible adult. Based on the assessment, the case manager identifies whether the client has a need for PCS. If the case manager identifies a need for PCS, the client or responsibl e adult is asked to select a Medicaid-enrolled PCS provider in their area. Once a provider is selected, the DSHS case manage r prior authorizes a quantity of PCS based on the assessment and requests TMHP to issue a PAN to the selected PCS provider. The PCS provider uses the PAN to submit claims to TMHP for the services provided. 2.12.2.2.2 The Primary Practitioner's Role in the PCS Benefit A client who is assessed for the PCS benefit must have a primary practitioner (a licensed physician, APRN, or PA) or a primary care provider who has pe rsonally examined the client within the last 12 months and reviewed all of the appropriate medical records. The primary practitioner or primary care provider must have established a diagnosis for the cl ient and must provide continuing care and medical supervision of the client. Prior to authorizing PCS, HHSC requires the completion of an HHSC- approved Practitioner Statement of Need (PSON) by a primary practitioner. The PSON must be on file with HHSC prior to the initiation of PCS and will on ly accept the PSON from an individual who is a physician, APRN, or PA. The PSON certifies that the client is 20 years of ag e or younger and has a physical, cognitive, or behav- ioral limitation related to a disability or chronic he alth condition. The primary practitioner or primary care provider must mail or fax the completed PSON to the appropriate DSHS Health Services Region. DSHS keeps the signed and dated PSON and the client 's PCAF in the client's case management record for the duration of the client's participation in the benefit. When a behavioral health condition exists, the primary practitioner may be a behavioral health provider. If the client's medical record does not include the primary practitioner's documentation and a PSON that certifies that the client has a physical, cognit ive or behavioral health condition that impacts the client's ability to perform an ADL or IADL, then PCS payments may be recouped. Note: If a client is entering or is already in the cons ervatorship of the state, PCS may be provisionally initiated for up to 60 days once eligibility has been established through the assessment.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 78 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.HHSC requires the reassessment of the client's need for PCS every 12 months or when requested due to a change in the client's health or living condition. A new PSON will be required at each annual reassessment and when there is a change in the client 's medical condition that may increase the need for services. 2.12.2.3 PCS Provided in Group Settings PCS may be provided in a provider to client ratio other than one-to-o ne. Settings in which providers can provide PCS in a provider to client ratio other than one-to-one include homes with more than one client needing PCS, foster homes, and independent living arrangements. A PCS provider may provide PCS to more than one client over the span of the day as long as: Each client's care is based on an individualized service plan. Each client's needs and service plan do not over lap with another client's needs and service plan. Example: If the prior authorized PCS hours for Client A is four hours, Client B is six hours, and the actual time spent with both clients is eigh t hours, the provider must bill for the actual one-on-one time spent with each client, not to exceed the client's prior authorized hours or total hours worked. It would be acceptable to bill four hours for Client A and four hours for Client B, or three hours for Client A and five hours for Client B. It would not be acceptable to bill five hours for Client A and three hours for Client B. It would be acceptable to bill ten hours if the individual person actually spent ten hours onsite providing prior authorized PCS split as fo ur hours for Client A and six hours for Client B. A total of ten hours cannot be billed if the individual person worked only eight hours. PCS may be delivered in a client-to-provider ratio other than one-on-one as long as each client's care is based on an individualized POC and each client's needs are being met. Only the time spent on authorized PCS tasks for each client is eligible for reimbursemen t. Total PCS billed for all clients cannot exceed an individual attendant's total number of hours at the place of service. When there is more than one client within the sa me household receiving PCS, the DSHS case manager will synchronize authorizations within the househol ds for all eligible clients. The DSHS case manager will assess all eligible clients in the home and submit authorizatio ns for all eligible clients in the household for the same authorization period. DSHS ca se managers will communicate with the provider the actions that are being taken usin g the existing Communication Tool. Note: There should be no lapse in services to the client. 2.12.3 Prior Authorization and Documentation Requirements Prior authorization is required before services are pr ovided. All PCS must be pr ior authorized by a DSHS case manager based upon client ne ed, as determined by the client assessment. DSHS prior authorizes PCS for eligible clients. The DSHS case manager notifies TMHP of the authorized quantity of PCS. TMHP sends a notification letter with the PAN to the client or responsible adult and the selected PCS provider if PCS is approved or modified. Only the client or responsible adult receives a notification letter with an explanation of denied services. PCS is prior authorized for periods of up to twelve months. PCS providers must provide services from the start of care date agreed to by the client or responsible adult, the case manager, and the PCS provider. PCS may be authorized in the same day as PPECC, if medically necessary. However, they must be rendered in a home setting, be fore or after PPECC services. A PCS provider may obtain prior authorization to pr ovide enhanced PCS to clients with a behavioral health condition when the following criteria are met: The DSHS case manager completes the Personal Care Assessment Form (PCAF) and identifies the behavioral health condition.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 79 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The PCAF indicates that the identified behavioral health condition impacts the client's ability to perform an ADL or IADL. The PCAF indicates which ADL(s) or IADL(s) cannot be performed by the client without assistance. The DSHS case manager submits the appropri ate modifier on the authorization request. When a client experiences a change in condition, the client or respon sible adult must notify the DSHS Health Service Office in the client's region. A new asse ssment is required when a client's physician orders services in a PPECC. A DSHS case manager must perform a new assessment and prior authorize any revisions in the quantity of PCS based on the new assessment. TMHP issues a revised authorization and notifications are sent to the client or responsible adult and the selected PCS provider. If the change is made during a current prior authorization period, th e new prior authorization will maintain the same end date as the original prior authorization period. The revised authorization pe riod will begin on the SOC date stated in the new assessment. For continuing and ongoing PCS need s beyond the initial prior authoriz ation period of up to twelve months, a DSHS case manager must conduct a new assessment and submit a new authorization request to TMHP. TMHP sends a notification letter updating the prior authorization to the client, responsible adults, and the selected PCS provider. HHSC or its designee may suspend an authorization for PCS when either: The client or the client's family creates an unsafe environment for the attendant's health and safety. The provider requests suspension for the re asons outlined in 40 TAC Part 1, Chapter 41. Providers can call a toll-fr ee PCS Provider Inquiry Line at 1- 888-648-1517 for assistance with inquiries about the status of a PCS prior authorization. Prov iders should direct inquiries about other Medicaid services to the TMHP Contact Center at 1-800-925-9126. PCS providers should encourage the client or responsible adult to contact the appropriate DSHS Health Service Region with inquiries or concerns about the PCS assessment. Note: Any organization that employs attendants wh o provide PCS, and any organization serving as an FMSA, must comply with all document ation requirements as specified by the PCS program. 2.12.3.1 PCS Provider Responsibilities PCS providers must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. All PCS providers must maintain written policies and procedures for obtaining consent for medical treatment in the absence of the responsible adult. Th e procedure and policy must meet the standards of the Texas Family Code, Chapter 32. Providers must accept clients only when there is a re asonable expectation and ev idence that the client's needs can be adequately met in the POS. The POS must be able to support the client's health and safety needs and adequately support the use, maintenance, and cleaning of all required medical devices, equipment, and supplies. Necessary primary and backup utility, communication, and fire safety systems must be available in the POS. The PCS provider is responsible for the supervision of the PCS attendant as required by the PCS provider's licensure requirements. 2.12.3.2 Documentation of Services Provided and Retrospective Review Documentation elements are routinely assessed for compli ance in retrospective revi ew of client records, including the following: All entries are legible to people ot her than the author, da ted (month, day, year, time), and signed by the author.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 80 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Each page of the record documents the client 's name and Medicaid identification number. All attendants' arrival and departure times are documented with signature and time. Documentation of services correlates with, and refl ects medical necessity for, the services provided on any given day. Client's arrival or departure from the home sett ing is documented with the time of arrival, departure, mode of transportation , and who accompanied the client. 2.12.4 Coordination with PPECC Provider When a DSHS case manager is notified by the client, client's responsible adult, or client's physician that PPECC services have been initiated, revised, or recertified, th e DSHS case manager must conduct a PCS reassessment, and submit all docume ntation required for a revision, modification, or denial of the original PCS authorization request, including a Physician's Statement of Need if there is a change in client condition. The new authorization request must be submitted within ten (10) business days of notification. DSHS case managers must provide documentation to support medical ne cessity if PCS service hours do not decrease when PPECC services are initiated. DSHS case managers must also document coor dination with the PPECC provider, maintaining documentation that the client or the client's responsible adult has participated in the development of the plan of care. When a client receives both PCS an d PPECC in a single day, and decide s to receive fewer hours of service in a PPECC (i.e., shifts more services to the home setting), or terminates PPECC services, the PCS case manager must conduct a reassessmen t, and submit all documentation required for a revision, modifi- cation, or denial of the original PCS authorization re quest, including a Physicia n's Statement of Need if there is a change in condition within ten (10) business days of notificati on by the client, client's respon- sible adult, or client's physician. Similarly, if the client decides to receive fewer ho urs of PCS services in the home, and increase PPECC hours, the DSHS case manager must conduct a reasse ssment, and submit all do cumentation required for an modification of the authorization request, within ten (10) business days of no tification by the client, client's responsible adult, or client's physician. Note: Coordination requirements may be different in a Medicaid managed care environment. PCS services rendered in a client's home may be bille d before or after PPECC services on the same day, but not at the same time as PPECC services. PCS services required while a client is in a PPECC are considered part of the PPECC billable rate. 2.12.5 Claims Information TMHP processes PCS claims. PCS providers must submit claims for services in an approved electronic claims format or on the appropriat e claim form based on their provider type. PCS providers, other than home health agencies, that are enrolled as PAS-only providers, FMSAs, or SRO providers must file PCS claims using a CMS-1500 paper claim form. Home heal th agencies, including those enrolled as an FMSA, or an SRO provider, must file PCS claims using the UB-04 CMS-1450 paper claim form. TMHP does not supply the forms. Home health agencies and consum er-directed agencies that bill for PCS using procedure code T1019 must include the prior authorization number on claims submitted for reimbursement. Additionally, providers utilizing paper, TexMedConnect, or billing through EDI must include the prior authorization number with all claims submissions.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 81 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

All CFC must be prior authorized by a DSHS case manager based upon client need, as deter mined by the client assessment. DSHS prior autho- rizes CFC for eligible clients. The DSHS case manager no tifies TMHP of the authorized quantity of CFC. TMHP sends a notification letter with the prior auth orization number (PAN) to the client or responsible adult and the selected CFC provider if CFC is approved or modified. Only the client or responsible adult receives a notification letter with an explanation of denied services. CFC is prior authorized for periods of up to twelve months. CFC providers must provide se rvices from the start of care date agreed to by the client or responsible adult, the case manager, and the CFC provider.

When a client experiences a change in condition, the client or respon sible adult must notify the DSHS Health Service Office in the client's region. A DS HS case manager must perform a new assessment and prior authorize any revisions in the quantity of CFC based on the new asse ssment. TMHP issues a revised authorization and notifications are sent to th e client or responsible adult and the selected CFC provider. If the change is made during a current pr ior authorization period, the new prior authorization will maintain the same end date as the original prior authorization period. The revised authorization period will begin on the start of care date stated in the new assessment. For ongoing CFC needs beyond the in itial prior authorization period of up to twelve months, a DSHS case manager must conduct a new assessment and submit a new author ization request to TMHP. A new in-home assessment must be conducted every twelve months with the client. TMHP will send a notifi- cation letter updating the prior authorization to the client, responsible adults, and the selected CFC provider. HHSC or its designee may suspen d an authorization for CFC when either: The client or the client's family creates an unsafe environment for the attendant's health and safety; or The provider requests suspension for the re asons outlined in 40 TAC Part 1, Chapter 41.

Refer to: The Medicaid Managed Care Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) or to the HHSC website at www.hhs.texas.gov/services /health/medicaid-chip , for additional information about children's Medicaid dental Services. Under the Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic, and Treatment (E PSDT) regulation, known in Texas as Texas Health Steps (THSteps), Section 1905(r) of the Social Security Act mandates that all Medicaid eligible beneficiaries who are birth through 20 years of age receive medically necessary services to treat, correct, and ameliorate illnesses and co nditions identified if the service is covered in the state's Medicaid plan or is an optional Medicaid service. It is the re sponsibility of the state to determine medical necessity on a case-specific basis. No arbitrary limitations on services are allowed (e.g., on e pair of eyeglasses or 10 therapy sessions per year) if dete rmined to be medically necessary. Services not covered unde r this section include: Experimental or investigational treatment. Services or items not generally accepted as effective and/or not within the normal course and duration of treatment. Services for the caregiver or provider convenience. All EPSDT requirements must be adhered to for bene ficiaries who receive services under managed care arrangements. 3.1 Enrollment To become a provider of THSteps or intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disability (ICF-IID) dental serv ices, a dentist must: Practice within the scope of the provider's professional licensure. Complete the Dental Provider Enrollment Application and return it to TMHP. Dental providers are required to maintain an active license status with the TSBDE. TMHP receives a monthly automated board feed from TSBDE to update licensure information. If licensure cannot be verified with the automated board feed, it is the prov iders' responsibility to provide a copy of the active TSBDE license to TMHP. If TSBDE has a delay in pr ocessing license applications and renewals, the provider must request a letter from TSBDE for their individual provider inform ation and send the letter of verification of current licensure to TMHP. The le tter must contain the provider's identifi- information, license number, and licensure period.

To have freedom from physical, mental, emotional, sexual, or verbal abuse, or harm from the provider or staff. To have freedom from overly aggressive treatment in excess of that required to address documented medical necessity. A provider's failure to ensure any of the client rights may result in termination of the provider agreement or contract and other civi l or criminal remedies. 3.1.6 Complaints and Resolution Complaints about dental services are typically rece ived through the TMHP Contact Center, although a complaint is accepted from any source. A complaint is researched by TMHP and resolved or escalated as appropriate.

The client is severely disabled. To satisfy the preadmission history and physical ex amination requirements of the hospital, ASC, or HASC, a THSteps medical checkup for dental rehabil itation or restoration may be performed by the child's primary care provider. Physicians who are not enrolled as THSteps medical providers must submit claims for the examination of a client before the procedure with the appropriate evaluation and management procedure code from the following table: Refer to: Subsection 3.2.12.1, \"Exceptions to Periodicity\" in this handbook. Note: The dental provider must submit claims to TM HP using the ADA Dental Claim Form to be considered for reimbursement th rough THSteps Dental Services.

Coordination of all specialty care is the responsibility of the client's primary care provid er. The primary care provider must be notified by the dentist or the HMO of the planned services. Dentists providing sedation or anes thesia services must have the a ppropriate current permit from the TSBDE for the level of sedation or anesthesia provided. The dental provider must be in compliance with the guidelines detailed in General Information. Note: Post-treatment authorization will not be a pproved for codes that require mandatory prior authorization. 3.2.24 Orthodontic Services (THSteps) Orthodontic services are a benefit for THSteps clients who are 13 years of age and older who have either permanent dentition and a severe handicapping malo cclusion or one of the following special medical conditions: Cleft palate Head-trauma injury involving the oral cavity Skeletal anomalies involving the oral cavity A severe handicapping malocclusion is defined by Texas Medicaid as dy sfunctional masticatory (chewing) capacity as a result of the existing rela tionship between the maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) dental arches or teeth that without correcti on will result in damage to the temporomandibular joint (s) (TMJ) or other supporting oral structures (e.g., bone, tissues, intra- or extra-oral muscles, etc.). Exception to the age restriction may be considered for clients who are 12 years of age and younger if medical necessity has been verified by the dental director for one of the following: Crossbite therapy Limited orthodontic treatment and minor treatment to control harmful habits Special medical conditions Dental services that are not covered by THSteps Dental Services but are medically necessary and allowable may be a benefit under CCP accordin g to federal Medicaid guidelines and TAC. As required by the Texas Human Resources Code, cl ients who are 14 years of age and younger must be accompanied to Texas Health Steps dental checkups an d visits by the cl ient's parent, legal guardian, or another adult who is authorized by the parent or legal guardian. The authorized adult can be the client's relative. The individual accompanyi ng the client must wait for the client while the appointment takes place. Exempt entities (school health clinics, Head Start pr ogram, or childcare facilities) that provide services must as a condition of reimbursement: Obtain written, unrevoked consent for the services fr om the client's parent or legal guardian within a one-year period before the date of service. Encourage parental involvement in and management of the health care of the clients who receive services from the clinic, program, or facility. The following definitions of dentition established by the ADA' s Current Dental Terminology (CDT) manual are recognized by Texas Medicaid: Primary Dentition: Teeth developed and erupted first in order of time. CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 150 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Transitional Dentition: The final phase of the tran sition from primary to adult teeth, in which the deciduous molars and canines are in the proce ss of shedding and the permanent successors are emerging. Adolescent Dentition: The dentition that is present after the normal loss of primary teeth and prior to cessation of growth that would affect orthodontic treatment. Adult Dentition: The dentition that is present after the cessation of growth that would affect ortho- dontic treatment. The American Association of Orthodontists classifica occlusion or malocclusion is as follows: Class I: A Class I occlusion exists with the teeth in a normal relationship when the mesialbuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molar coincide s with the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. Class II: A Class II malocclusion occurs when the mandibular teeth are distal or behind the normal relationship with the maxillary teeth. This can be due to a deficiency of the lower jaw or an excess of the upper jaw and therefore, presents two types: Division I is when the mandibular arch is behi nd the upper jaw with a consequential protrusion of the upper front teeth. Division II exists when the mandibular teeth are behind the upper teeth, with a retrusion of the maxillary front teeth. Both of these malocclusions have a tendency toward a deep bite because of the uncontrolled migration of th e lower front teeth upwards. Class III: A Class III malocclusion occurs when the lowe r dental arch is in front of (mesial to) the upper dental arch. People with this type of occlusion usually have a strong or protrusive chin, which can be due to either horizontal mandibular exce ss or horizontal maxillary deficiency. Commonly referred to as an underbite. 3.2.24.1 Benefits and Limitations for Orthodontic Services Comprehensive orthodontic servic es must be provided by a bo ard-eligible or board-certified orthodontist. Note: Exceptions to a board-eligible or board-certifie d orthodontist may be considered for clients in a rural or frontier area or where access to care is an issue. The diagnostic workup is considered part of th e pre-orthodontic treatment visit (procedure code D8660). The following procedure codes are used to submit claims for the diagnostic workup: Comprehensive orthodontic services include all of the following: Diagnostic workups B a n d i n g Initial brackets Replacement brackets Monthly visits Initial retainers Special orthodontic treatment appliance(s) FEBRUARY 2023 151 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.The following procedure codes are used to submit claims for orthodontic services: Full banding is allowed on perman ent dentition only, and treatment should be accomplished in one stage and is limited to once per lifetime. Exception: Cases of mixed dentition may be considered when the treatment plan includes extractions of remaining primary teeth or in the case of cleft palate. 3.2.24.2 Crossbite Therapy Crossbites (anterior and posterior) are defined by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) as malocclusions involving one or more teeth in which the maxillary teeth occlude lingually with the mandibular antagonistic (opp osing) teeth. A crossbite can be of a dental or skeletal origin or a combination of both. The intent of crossbite therapy is to prevent the need for comprehensive orthodontic treatment. This treatment may lessen the severity or future effects of a malformation, eliminate its cause, or may include localized tooth movement. Crossbite therapy (limited orthodontics) is allowed for primary or transitional dentition. Crossbite therapy will not be considered for transitional dentition when there is a need for full banding of the adult teeth. Crossbite therapy must be submitte d with procedure code D8010 or D8020. Clients with special medical conditions may be considered for li mited orthodontic services of the pr imary dentition if the services are medically necessary and submi tted with procedure code D8010. Crossbite therapy is an inclusive charge for treating the crossbite to completion. Adjustments, mainte- nance, diagnostic models, and diagnostic wo rkup procedures are not reimbursed separately. 3.2.24.3 Minor Treatment to Control Harmful Habits Special orthodontic appliances are a benefit for minor treatment to control harmful habits. Orthodontic appliances for minor treatment to control harmful habits mu st be submitted with procedure codes D8210, D8220, and D8670. Monthly adjustments (procedure co de D8670) for minor treatment to control harmful habits are limited up to 10 visits. Claims for panoramic films (proce dure code D0330), cephalometric fi lms (procedure code D0340), oral/ facial photographic images obtain ed intraorally or extraorally (pro cedure code D0350) and diagnostic models (procedure code D0470) will be denied when they are submitted with procedure code D8210 or D8220. Each orthodontic appliance (procedure code D 8210 and D8220) are limited to once per arch, per lifetime. 3.2.24.4 Premature Termination of Comprehensive Orthodontic Treatment Premature termination of comprehensive orthodontic treatment includes the following: Removal of the brackets and arch wires Removal of appliances with the fabrication of retainers Delivery of orthodontic retainersOrthodontic Services Procedure Codes D8080 D8660 D8670CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 152 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Documentation of one of the following must be r etained for premature term ination of comprehensive orthodontic treatment: Documentation of a lack of cooperation from the client. Documentation that the client requested premature removal and a release of liability form has been signed by the parent, guardian , or client if he or she is at least 18 years of age. Premature termination of comprehensive orthodontic treatment must be submitted with procedure code D8680. Removal of the appliance (procedure code D8680) will be denied if the claim is submitted by any provider on the same date of service as orthodontic treatment (procedure code D8080). Providers must keep a copy of the release of liabilit y form on file and are responsible for this documen- tation during a review process. Premature removal of appliances will be considered only when there is evidence Medicaid previously approved orthodontic treatment. If premature removal of the appliances is requested before completion of trea tment, future orthodontic services may not be considered. The provider must document why the premature removal was necessary. 3.2.24.5 Other Orthodontic Services Only one retainer per arch per life time (procedure code D8680) is allo wed. The delivery of a retainer includes any visits for retainer adjustments. R etainer adjustments are not reimbursed separately. Appliances required as part of the cleft pala te treatment plan may be reimbursed separately. Special orthodontic appliances may be used with fu ll banding and crossbite therapy when approved by the TMHP Dental Director or Associate Dental Director. 3.2.24.6 Non-covered Services Single arch comprehensive orthodontic treatment is not a benefit of Texas Medicaid. Orthodontic services that are performed solely for cosmetic purposes are not a benefit of Texas Medicaid. Although aesthetics is an important part of self-esteem, se rvices primarily for self-worth are not within the scope of this Texas Medicaid benefit. Orthodontic services for a client who initiated or thodontic treatment through a private arrangement while Medicaid-eligible are not a benefit of Texas Medicaid. An initial orthodontic or pre-orthod ontic treatment visit (procedure co de D8660) is considered part of the exam in an oral evaluation (procedure codes D0120 or D0150). 3.2.24.7 Comprehensive Orthodontic Treatment Comprehensive orthodontic services (procedure code D8080) are restri cted to clients who are 13 years of age and older or clients who have exfoliated all primary dentition. National procedure codes do not allow for any work -in-progress or partial submission of a claim by separating the three orthodontic components: diag nostic workup, orthodontic appliance (upper), or (lower). When submitting claims for comp rehensive orthodontic treatment pr ocedure code D8080, three local codes must be submit ted as remarks codes along with proced ure code D8080. Local codes (procedure codes lower) must be placed in the Rema rks Code field on electronic claims or Block 35 on paper claims. Note: If the remarks code and procedure code D8080 are not submitted, the claim will be denied.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 153 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Each remarks code pays the corre ct reimbursement rate which, when combined, totals the maximum payment of $775. Procedure code D 8080 must be submitted on three se parate details, with the appro- priate remarks code, even if the claim submission is for the workup and full ba nding. Submission of only one detail for a total of $775 will not be accepted. Example 1: A client is approved for full banding, but af ter the initial workup, the client discontinues treatment. This provider would submit the national procedure co de D8080 and place the local code Z2009, Diagnostic workup approved, in the Re marks/comment field. The claim would pay $175. Example 2: A client is approved for full banding. The provider continues treatment and places the maxillary bands. The provider wo uld submit the national procedure code D8080 and place the local procedure code Z2009, Diagnostic workup approved, and Z2011, Ma xillary bands, in the Remarks/ comment field. The claim would pay $475. All electronic claims for procedure code D8080 must have the appropriate remark s code associated with the procedure code. Providers must adhere to the following guidelines for electronic claim submission so TMHP can accurately apply the correct remarks co de to the appropriate claim detail. A Diagnostic Procedure Code (DPC) remarks code must be submitted, only once, in the first three bytes of the NTE02 at the 2400 loop. Example 1: For a claim with one detail, submitted with procedure code D8080 and remarks code Z2009, enter the information as follows: DPCZ 2009. The total submitted would be $175. Example 2: For a claim with two details, where detail s one and two are procedure code D8080 and the remarks codes are Z2009 and Z2011, enter the in formation as follows: DPCZ2009Z2011. The total submitted would be $475. Example 3: For a claim with three details, where all three details are submitted separately with procedure code D8080, enter the remarks code based on the order of the claim detail as follows: DPCZ2009Z2011Z2012. The total submitted would be $775. This method ensures accurate and ap propriate payment for services rendered and addresses the need for submission of a partial claim. 3.2.24.8 Orthodontic Procedure Codes and Fee Schedule When submitting claims for orthodontic procedures, use the following procedure codes: Procedure Code Limitations Not payabl e to the dentist who placed the appliance. Includes removal of arch bar and premature removal of braces. A 1-20 Limited Orthodon tic Treatment D8010* Replaces D8050. Limited to one per lifetime.D8020* Replaces D8060.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.3.2.25 Special Orthodontic Appliances All removable or fixed special orthodontic appliances must be prior authorized. The prior authorization request must include both the national code and re marks code. However, prior authorization requests may omit the DPC prefix to the eight-digit remarks code. All removable or fixed special orth odontic appliances must be submit ted with national procedure code D8210 or D8220. To ensure appropriate claims proc essing, the DPC remarks code (local procedure code) reflecting the specific service is also requir ed. The appropriate remarks codes must be entered on the prior authorization request form. Failure to follow the following steps will cause the claims to deny. Failure to enter the DPC remarks code and the appr opriate procedure code wi ll not result in claim denial; however, manual intervention is required to process the claim, which may result in a delay of payment. For paper claim submissions, providers must enter the local procedure code in Block 35 (Remarks) of the ADA claim form. For electronic submissions, providers enter the DPC remarks code in the Comments field to ensure correct authorization, accurate records, and reimbursement. For electronic submissions other than TexMedConnec t submissions, providers must use the following instructions to ensure that TMHP a ccurately applies the correct local procedure code to the appropriate claim detail: The DPC prefix must be submitted, only once, in the first three bytes of the NTE02 at the 2400 loop. In bytes 4-8, providers must submit the remark co de (local procedure code) based on the order of the claim detail. Do not enter any spaces or punc tuation between remark codes, unless to designate the detail is not submitted with D8210 or D8220. Example: For a claim with three details, where detail s one and three are submitted with procedure code D8210 and detail two is not, enter th e following information in the NTE02 at the 2400 loop: DPC1014D 1046D. (The space shows that detail two needs no local code.) If all details require a local code, enter DPC, no spaces, and the appropriate local codes. To submit using TexMedConnect, providers must enter the local code into the Remarks Code field, located under the details header. The Remarks Code fi eld is the field directly after the Procedure Code field. TexMedConnect submitters are not required to ma nually enter the DPC prefix as it is placed in the appropriate field on the TexMedConnect electronic claim.D8210* Refer to subsection 3.2.25, \"Special Or thodontic in this handbook Refer to subsection 3.2.25, \"Special Or thodontic Appliances\" in this handbook for associated remarks field code.

The HLD index requires the use of an HLD score sheet and a Boley gauge for measuring. Refer to: The Texas Medicaid Handicapping Labio-Ling ual Deviation (HLD) Index Score Sheet on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . Providers should be conservative in scoring. The clie nt must be considered severe handicapping maloc- clusion with dysfunctional masticatory (chewing) capa city as a result of the existing relationship between the maxillary (upper) and mandibular (low er) dental arches and/or teeth that, without correction, will result in damage to the temporomandibular joint(s) (T MJ) and/or other supporting oral structures (e.g., bone, tissues, intra and/or extra oral muscles, etc.) and have a minimum of 26 points on the HLD index to be considered for any orthodontic care other than crossbite correction. \"Half-mouth\" treatment cannot be approved. With the client or models in the centric position, the HLD index is to be scored as follows. Record all measurements rounded-off to the nearest millimeter (mm). Enter a score of \"0\" if the condition is absent. Cleft Palate A cleft palate case request for mixed dentition will be considered only if narrative justification supports treatment before the client reaches full dentition. Note: Intermittent treatment requests may exceed th e allowable 26 reimbursable treatment visits. Severe Traumatic Deviations Refers to facial accidents only. Po ints cannot be awarded for congen ital deformity. Severe traumatic deviations do not include trauma tic occlusions for crossbites. Overjet in Millimeters Score the case exactly as measured. The measurement must be recorded from the most protrusive incisor, then subtract 2 mm (considered the norm), and enter the difference as the score. Overbite in Millimeters Score the case exactly as measured. The measurement must be recorded from the labio-incisal edge of the overlapped anterior tooth or teeth to the po int of maximum coverage , then subtract 3 mm (considered the norm), and enter the difference as the score. Mandibular Protrusion in Millimeters Score the client exactly as measured. The measurement must be recorded from the \"line of occlusion\" of the permanent teeth, not from the ectopically erupted teeth in the anterior segment.D8210* DPC1075D arch Two horizontal projections forward D8220* DPC1078D ApplianceProcedure CodeRemarks Code Remarks Code Description * = Services payable to an FQ HC for a client encounter.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 158 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Open Bite in Millimeters Score the case exactly as measured. Measurement must be recorded from the \"line of occlusion\" of the permanent teeth, not from the ectopically erupted teeth in the anterior segment. Caution is advised in undertaking treatment of open bites in older t eenagers, because of the frequency of relapse. Ectopic Eruption An unusual pattern of eruption, such as high labial cu spids or teeth that are grossly out of the long axis of the alveolar ridge. Ectopic eruption does not include teeth that are rota ted or teeth that are leaning or slanted especially when the enamel-gingival junction is within the long axis of the alveolar ridge. Note: Record the more serious condition. Do not include (score) teeth from an arch if that arch is to be counted in the category of Anterior Crowding . For each arch, either the ectopic eruption or anterior crowding may be scored, but not both. Anterior Crowding Arch length insufficiency must exceed 3.5 mm to be considered as crowding in either arch. Mild rotations that may react favorably to stripping or moderate expansio n procedures are not to be scored as crowded. Excessive Anterior Sp acing in Millimeters The score for this category must be the total, in millimeters, of the anterior spaces. Providers should be conservative in scoring. Libera l scoring will not be helpful in the evaluation and approval of the case. The case must be considered dysfunctional and have a minimum of 26 points on the HLD index to qualify for any orthodontic care other than crossbite corre ction. Half-mouth cases cannot be approved. The intent of the program is to provide orthodontic care to clients with hand icapping malocclusion to improve function. Although aesthetics is an important part of self-estee m, services that are primarily for aesthetics are not within the scop e of benefits of this program. The proposals for treatment services should inco rporate only the minimal number of appliances required to properly treat the case. Requests for multip le appliances to treat an individual arch will be reviewed for duplication of purpose. If attaining a qualifying score of 26 points is unce rtain, providers must incl ude a brief narrative when submitting the case. The narrative may reduce the ti me necessary to gain final approval and reduce shipping costs incurred to resubmit records. Providers must properly label and protect all reco rds (especially plaster diagnostic models) when shipping.

Refer to: 25 TAC, \u00a733.72 for more information about utilization review. 3.5 Claims Filing and Reimbursement 3.5.1 Reimbursement The Medicaid rates for dentists are calculated as access-based fees in accordance with 1 TAC \u00a7\u00a7355.455(b), 355.8085, and 355.8441(11). Providers can refe r to the online fee lookup (OFL) or the applicable fee schedule on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . Texas Medicaid implemented mandated rate reductio ns for certain services. The OFL and static fee schedules include a column titled \"Adjusted Fee\" to display the individual fees with all mandated percentage reductions applied. Ad ditional information about rate ch anges is available on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com/resources/ra te-and-code-updates . 3.5.2 Claim Submission After Loss of Eligibility The Texas Medicaid 95-day filing dead line applies to all THSteps and ICF- IID dental services. If a client has lost Medicaid eligibility or turned 21 years of age, continue to file claims for services provided on the DOS the client was eligible. Indicate the actual DO S on the claim form, and enter the authorization number in the appropriate block on each claim filed. Refer to: Subsection Third Party Refer to: \"Section 8: Third Liability (TPL)\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). 3.5.4 Claims Information Dental services must be submitted to TMHP in an approved electronic format or on the ADA Dental Claim Form. Providers may purchase ADA Dental clai m forms from the vendor of their choice. TMHP does not supply the forms. A samp le of the ADA Dental Claim form can be found on the ADA website at www.ada.org . When completing an ADA Dental claim form, all requ ired information must be included on the claim, as TMHP does not key information from attachments. Superbills or itemized statements are not accepted as claim supplements. All THSteps and ICF-IID claims must be received by TMHP within 95 days from each DOS and submitted to the following address: Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership PO Box 200555 Austin, TX 78720-0555 Claims for emergency, orthodontic, or routine dental services must each be filed on separate forms. A claim submitted for either emergency or orthodontic services must be identified as such in Block 35 (Remarks) of the claim form. A THSteps and ICF-IID dental provider cannot submit claims to Texas Medicaid under his individual NPI for the services provided by one or more associat e dentists practicing in his office as employees or independent contractors with specific employer-emp loyee or contractual relationships. All dentists providing services to Medicaid clients must enroll as THSteps dental providers regardless of employer relationships. The individual provider submitting cl aims may be reimbursed into a single accounting office to maintain these described relationships.

All denied claim appeals must be su bmitted to TMHP with the exception of a request to waive late filing deadlines. TMHP does not have the authority to waiv e state or federal mandates regarding claim filing deadlines. If, after all appeal processes at TMHP have been exhausted, the provider remains dissatisfied with TMHP's decision concerning the appeal, the prov ider may file a complaint with the HHSC Claims Administrator Operations Management Unit. Refer General Information ). Note: Providers must exhaust the appeals process with TMHP before filing a complaint to the HHSC Claims Administrator Operations Management Unit. Providers may use one of three methods to appeal Me dicaid claims to TMHP: telephone (AIS), paper, or electronic. All appeals of denied claims or requests for adjust ments on paid claims must be received by TMHP within 120 days of the date of disp osition of the R&S Report on whic h the claim appears. If the 120-day appeal deadline falls on a weekend or TMHP-recogni zed holiday, the deadline will be extended to the next business day. Certain claims must be appealed on paper; they canno t be appealed either electronically or by telephone. Refer 1, General Information ) for information about appeals that may not be appe aled electronically and claims that may not be appealed through AIS. To appeal in writing: If a claim cannot be appealed electronically or by telephone, appeal the claim on paper by completing the following steps: 1) Provide a copy of the R&S Report page where the claim is reported.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 173 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.2) Circle one claim per R&S Report page. 3) Identify the information that was incorrectly provided and note the correct information that should be used to appeal the claim. If necessary, specify the reason for appealing the claim. 4) Attach radiographs or other necessary supporting documentation. 5) If available, attach a copy of the original claim. Claim copies are helpful when the appeal involves dental policy or procedure coding issues. 6) Do not copy supporting documentation on the opposite side of the R&S Report. 7) It is strongly recommended that providers submitting paper appeals retain a copy of the documen- tation being sent. It is also recommended that paper documentation be sent by certified mail with a return receipt requested to establish TMHP's receipt of the claim and the date the claim was received. The provider is urged to retain copies of multiple claim submissions if the NPI is pending. Note: Claims submitted by newly-enrolled providers must be received within 95 days of the date the new NPI is issued, and within 365 days of the DOS. 8) Submit the paper appeal with supporting documentation and any radiographs and adjustment requests to the following address: Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership Inquiry Control Unit 12357-B Riata Trace Parkway, Suite 100 Austin, TX 78727 To appeal by telephone: 1) Contact the Dental Line at 1-800-568-2460. 2) For each claim in question, have the R&S Report listing the claim and any supporting documents readily available. 3) Identify the claim submitted for appeal.

The appeal will appear as finalized or pe nding on the following week's R&S Report. Providers may also appeal electronically. Electronic appeal submission is a method of su bmitting Texas Medicaid appeals using a personal computer. The electronic appeals feature can be a ccessed directly through the TMHP EDl Gateway or by using TexMedConnect. For additional inform ation, contact the TMHP EDI Help Desk at 1-888-863-3638. Electronic appeals can increase accura cy of claims processing, resulting in a more efficient case flow to the provider: Download and printout capabilities help maintain audit trails for the provider. Appeal submission windows can be automatically fill ed in with electronic R&S Report information, thereby reducing data entry time. 3.5.6 Frequently Asked Questi ons About Dental Claims Q Why is routine dental treatment not a benefit when performed at the same visit as an emergency visit? A The following are reasons routine dental treatment is not a benefit when performed at the same visit as an emergency visit: The purpose of an emergency claim is to allow the provider to treat a true emergency without the concern that routine dent al procedures may be denied.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 174 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Medicaid program policy guidelines do not allow payment for both emergency and routine services to the same provider at the same visit. True emergency claims process through the audit system correctly when \"emergency\" is checked on either the paper or electronic claim and the Remarks or Narrative section of the claim form describes the nature of the emergency. Q Why are some claims for oral exams and emergenc y exams on the same date for the same client denied? A Medicaid program policy does not allow claims for an initial oral exam and an emergency exam to be submitted for the same DOS for the same client. An emergency exam performed by the same provider in the same six-month time period as an initial exam may be considered for reimbursement only when the claim for the emergency exam indicates it is an emerg ency and the emergency block is marked and the Remarks or Narrative section is completed. If t he claim is not marked as an emergency, the claim will be denied. Q Why could an appeal of a denied claim take a long time?A An appeal can take a long time if TMHP is requir ed to research the denied claim and determine the reason the claim did not go through the system. For faster results, provider s should submit appeals as soon as possible and not use the entire 120 days allowed to submit the appeal. The following are guidelines on filing claims efficiently: Use R&S Report dates to track filed claims. File claims electronically through TMHP EDI. Electronic claims submission does not allow a claim with an incorrect date to be accepted and processed, which saves time for the provider submitting claims and TMHP in processing claims. Call 1-888-863-3638, for more information about TMHP EDI. File claims with the correct info rmation included. Most denied cl aims result from the omission of dates, signature, or narrative, or incorrect ID numbers such as client Medicaid numbers or NPIs. Q Why are only ten appeals allowed per call? A There is a limit on appeals per call to allow all providers equal access. Q Why do reimbursement checks sometimes take a long time to arrive?A Reimbursement may be delayed if a provider fails to submit claims in a timely manner. Q Does electronic claims submissi on result in delayed payment? A No. Providers who submit claims electronically re port faster results than when submitting claims on paper. Providers are encouraged to use TMHP EDI for claims submission. The following are helpful hints to a more efficiently processed claim: Ensure the NPI is on all claims. Include the performing provider's signature on all paper claims. Verify client eligibility for procedures. Verify if the procedure code requires a narrative on the claim; the narrative is for medical necessity. Include the required client information, in cluding name, birth date, and client number. Dental auxiliary staff (i.e., the hygienist or the ch airside assistant) cannot enroll in Texas Medicaid; therefore, they cannot submit claims to Texas Me dicaid. Any procedure performed by the auxiliary must be submitted by the supervisin g dentist, using the dentist's NPI.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 175 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Claim Submission Reminders: Procedure code D8660 is allowed at different age le vels, per provider. If a claim for procedure code D8660 is submitted within six months of proced ure code D8080, procedure code D8080 will be reduced by the amount that wa s paid for procedure code D8660. Prior authorization is required with documentat ion of medical necessity when replacing lost or broken orthodontic retainers (p rocedure code D8680) . Clients may not be billed for covered services. Prior authorization of orthodontic services is no ntransferable. If a client changes an orthodontic provider for any reason, or a provid er ceases to be a Medicaid provider, the new orthodontic services provider must submit a separate request for pr ior authorization. The pr ovider requesting and receiving authorization for the service also must perform the service and submit the claim. Codes listed on the authorization letters are the only codes considered for payment. All other codes submitted for payment are denied. Providing the authorization number on the submitted claim results in more effici ent claims processing. Prior authorization is required for clients who are 7 through 20 years of age that are in need of general anesthesia and do not meet the Criteria for Dental Therapy Under General Anesthesia requirements (22 point threshold). Prior authorizat ion is required for medically necessary dental general anesthesia that exceeds once per six mont hs, per client, any provider. The dentist providing therapeutic services under general anesthesia is responsible for obtaining prior authorization for both services. General anesthesia (provided in the dentist offi ce, ambulatory service clinic, and inpatient/outpa- tient hospital settings) does not require prior au thorization for clients who are 7 through 20 years of age, unless the client does not meet the mini mum required points for general anesthesia in Criteria for Dental Therapy Under General Anesthesia on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . All THSteps dental charts for dental general anesth esia are subject to retrospective, random review for compliance with the Criteria for Dental Th erapy Under General Anesthesia and requirements for chart documentation. Providers must not bill a client unless a formal denial for the requested item or service has been issued by TMHP stating the service is not a benefi t of Texas Medicaid and the client has signed the Client Acknowledgment Statement in advance of the service being provided for that specific item or service. A provider must not bill Medicaid client s if the provided service is a benefit of Texas Medicaid. Refer to: Subsection 1.7.11.1, \"Client Acknowledgment Statement\" in \"Section 1: Responsibilities\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). THSteps clients must receive: Dental services specified in the treatment plan that meet the standards of care established by the laws relating to the practice of dentistry and the rules and regulations of the TSBDE. Dental services that are free from abuse or harm from the provider or the provider's staff. Only the treatment required to address documented medical necessity that meets professionally recognized standard s of health care.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 176 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Providers that need additional information may call 1-800-757-5691 or refe r to \"Appendix F. Texas Health Steps Quick Reference Guide\" in this handb ook for a more specific list of resources and telephone numbers. Providers may also contact the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) THSteps Provider Relations staff located in DSHS regional offices by calling the ap propriate regional office as listed in\"Appendix A: State, Federal, and TMHP Contact Information\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). THSteps Provider Relations contact information is also available on the DSHS website at www.dshs.texas.gov/ thsteps/regions.shtm . In addition, THSteps has developed online educat ional modules to provide additional information about the program, components of the medical chec kup, and other information. These modules provide free continuing education hours for a variety of prov iders. Providers do not have to be enrolled in THSteps. These courses may be accessed at www.txhealthsteps.com . The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) service is Medicaid's compre- hensive preventive child health service for clients wh o are birth through 20 years of age. In Texas, EPSDT is known as THSteps and includes periodic scre ening, vision, hearing, and dental preventive and treatment services. EPSDT was crea ted by the 1967 amendments to the federal Social Security Act and defined by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Ac t (OBRA) of 1989. The periodic screening for a checkup consists of five federally required components as noted on the THSteps Periodicity Schedule. In addition, Section 1905(r)(5) of the Social Security Act (SSA) requires that any medically necessary health-care service listed in the Act be provided to EPSDT clients even if the service is not available under the state's Medicaid plan to the rest of the Medicaid population. A service is medically necessary when it corrects or ameliorates the client's disability, physical or mental illness, or chronic condition. These additional services are available through CCP . For questions about coverage, providers can call CCP at 1-800-846-7470. 4.1.2 Statutory Requirements Several specific legislative requirem ents affect THSteps and the provid ers participating in the program. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Newborn Screening, Health and Safety Code, Ch apter 33, Section \u00a733.011 Newborn Screening Test Requirement. Subsection D.5, \"Parental Accompaniment\" in this handbook. Requirements for Reporting Abuse or Neglect, as outlined in subsection 1.7.1, \"Compliance with Texas Family Enrollment and Responsibilities\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ).

Newborn Hearing Screening, Health and Safety Code, Chapter 47. Teen Confidentiality Issues. There are many state st atutes that may affect consent to medical care for a minor, depending on the facts of the situat ion. Among the relevant statutes are Chapters 32, 33, 153, and 266 of the Texas Family Code. Provid ers may want to consult an attorney, their licensing board, or professional organization if gu idance is needed or questions arise on matters of medical consent.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 177 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Refer to: \"Appendix D. Texas Health Steps Statutory State Requirements\" in this handbook for more information. 4.1.3 Referrals for Medicaid-Covered Services When a provider performing a checkup determines that a referral for diagnosis or treatment is necessary for a condition found during the medical checkup, th at information must be discussed with the parents or guardians. A referral must be made to a provider who is qualified to perform the necessary diagnosis or treatment services. If the performing provider is competent to treat the condition found, a referral elsewhere is not necessary, unless it is to the prim ary care provider to assure continuity of care. Providers that need assistance find ing a specialist who accepts client s with Medicaid coverage can call the THSteps toll-free helpli ne at 1-877-847-8377, or they can find one using the Online Provider Lookup on the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . Continuity of care is an important aspect of providing services and fo llow-up. Efforts should be made to determine that the appointment was kept and that th e provider who received the referral has provided a diagnosis and recommendations for furt her care to the referring provider. In addition to referrals for conditions discovered du ring a checkup or for specialized care, the following referrals may be used: Case Management for Children and Pregnant Women . Case Management for Children and Pregnant Women provides health-related case management services to eligible children and pregnant women. Case Management for Children and Pregna nt Women services include assessing the needs of eligible clients, formulating a service plan, making referrals, problem-solving, advocacy, and follow-up regarding family and client needs. For more inform ation about eligibility and client referral, see subsection 3. 1.1, \"Eligibility\" in the Behavioral Health and Case Management Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) or subsection 3.1.2, \"Referral Process\" in the Behavioral Health and Case Management Services Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ). Hearing Services referrals . If the hearing screening returns abno rmal results, clients who are birth through 20 years of age must be referred to a Texa s Medicaid provider who is an audiologist or physician who is experienced with the pediatric population and who offers auditory services. Routine Dental Referrals. The provider must refer clients to establish a dental home beginning at 6 months of age or earlier if trauma or early chil dhood caries are identified. For established clients after the 6-month medical checkup, the provider must confirm if a dental home has been established and is ongoing; if not, additional referrals must be made at subs equent medical checkups until the parent or caregiver confirms that a dental home has been established for th e client. Clients who are birth through 5 months of age are not eligible for ro utine dental checkups bu t should be referred to a dentist if any dental issues ar e identified during a THSteps medical checkup or acute care visit. When possible, clients should be referred to a provider who has completed the required benefit education and is certified by Texa s Health Steps to perform First Dental Home services. The First Dental Home provider may be located through the ad vanced search function in the Online Provider Look Up or by calling 1-877-847-8377. Referrals for Dental Treatment . If a THSteps medical provider identifies the medical necessity of dental services, the provider must refer the client to a THSteps dental provider. The THSteps medical provider can accomplish this by providin g the parent or guardian a listing of THSteps dentists from the Online Provider Lookup. The parent or guardian can receive assistance in locating a THSteps dentist and assistance wi th scheduling of dental appointments by contacting the THSteps toll-free helpline at 1- 877-847-8377. Clients who are birth through 5 months of age also can be seen for emergency dental services by the dentist at any time for trauma, early childhood caries, or other oral health problems. Clients who are birth through 20 years of age may self-refer for dental care.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 178 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Emergency Dental Referrals. If a medical checkup provider identifies an emergency need for dental services, such as bleeding, infectio n, or excessive pain, the client ma y be referred directly to a partic- ipating dental provider. Emergency dental services are covered at any time for all Medicaid clients who are birth through 20 years of age. Note: Assistance in coordinating dental referrals can be obtained from the THSteps toll-free helpline at 1-877-847-8377 or the DSHS Regional THSteps Coordinator for the respective region (lists are provided in \"Appendix A: Stat e, Federal, and TMHP Contact Information\" (Vol. 1, General Information). In cases of both emergency and nonemergency dental services, clients are able to make a choice when selectin g a dental provider who is participating in the THSteps Dental Program. Family Planning and Gene tic Services Referrals. For clients eligible for Me dicaid who need genetic services or family planning services, a referra l should be made. Info rmation about Medicaid- covered genetic services is available in the Medical and Nursing Specialists, Physicians, and Physician Assistants Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) and information about family planning services is available in Section 2, \"Medicaid Title XIX Fa mily Planning Services\".

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Medical Residents Medical residents may provide medi cal checkups in a teaching facility under the guidance of the attending staff as long as the facility's medical st aff by-laws and requirements of the Graduate Medical Education (GME) Program are met, and the attending physician has determined the intern or resident to be competent to perform checkups. THSteps does not require the supervising physician to examine the client as long as these conditions are met. Clinics In a clinic, a physician is not required to be pres ent at all times during th e hours of operation unless otherwise required by federal regulations. A phys ician must assume respon sibility for the clinic's operation. 4.2.1.1 Requirements for Registered Nurses Who Provide Medical Checkups RNs without a CNS, NP, or CNM recognition as an APRN by the Texas BON may provide medical checkups only under direct physicia n supervision, meaning the physicia n is either on site during the checkup or immediately available to furnish assistan ce and direction to the RN during the checkup. Required online education modules developed by THSteps must be completed prior to providing checkup services. All modules are approved for contin uing education units (CEUs) for RN's as well as other medical disciplines. Requ ired THSteps online education modules are available on the Infor- mation page of the THSteps website. The RN or the RN's employer must maintain documentation that the required modules were completed. Online modules are updated regularl y to include new content. RNs that have completed the required modules previously are encouraged, but not required to retake online modules. Before a physician delegates a THSt eps checkup to an RN, the physician must establish the RN's compe- tency to perform the service as required by the physic ian's scope of practice. The delegating physician is responsible for supervising the RN who performs the services. The delegating physician remains respon- sible for any service pr ovided to a client. Refer to: Subsection 4.2.1, \"THSteps Enrollment\" in this handbook for more infor- mation about enrollment procedures. 4.3 Services, Benefits, Limitations, and Prior Authorization 4.3.1 Eligibility for THSteps Serv ices and Checkup Due Dates Through outreach, THSteps staff (DSHS, HHSC, or contractors) encourage clients to use THSteps preventive medical checkup services when they firs t become eligible for Medicaid and each time there- after when they are periodically due for their next medical checkup. THSteps will send clients a letter when they are due for a medical checkup. A client is eligible for THSteps services, including me dical checkups, from birth through 20 years of age. Although the Medicaid Eligibility Ve rification Letter (Form H1027) iden tifies eligible clients when the client's Your Texas Benefits Medi caid card is lost or has not ye t been issued, Form H1027 does not indicate whether the client is due for medical checkup services. Providers can veri fy the client 's eligibility through TexMedConnect, the Medicaid Client Port al for Providers, or the TMHP Contact Center. A client is due for a THSteps medical checkup based on his or her date of birth and the ages indicated on the periodicity schedule. Children younger than three years of age are due at frequent intervals. Children and youth three years of age and older are considered due for a checkup on their birthday and are encouraged to have a yearly checkup as soon as practical. In addition, for children enrolled in Medicaid managed care, a new member is due for a THSteps medical checkup as soon as practicable, but in no case later than 14 days of enrollment for newborns, and no later than 90 days of enrollment for all other eligible child members. CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 181 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Providers should schedule checkups based on the ag es in the periodicity schedule, but circumstances may support the need for a checkup prior to the client's birthday (for example, a 4-year checkup could be performed prior to the child's 4th birthday if the ch ild is a member of a migrant family that is leaving the area). THSteps fee-for-service po licy creates this flexibility by allo wing a total number of checkups at each age range. Refer to: \"Subsection 4.3.6, \"THSteps Medical Checkups\" in this handbook for additional details. Providers are encouraged to notify the client when they are due for the next checkup according to the THSteps periodicity schedule. A checkup that is necessary more frequently than indicated on the periodicity schedule is considered an exception-to-periodicity. Refer to: Subsection 4.3.7, \"Exception-to-Periodicity Checkups\" in this handbook for additional details about billing for a checkup performed as an exception-to-periodicity checkup. 4.3.2 Prior Authorization Prior authorization is not required fo r preventive care medical checkups. 4.3.3 Additional Consent Requirements Additional parental or guardian consent may be requir ed if online or web-based screening tools are used that could result in client data bein g stored electronically in an outside database other than the provider's electronic medical record system, or if the data is used for purposes other than THSteps screening. The provider should seek legal advice re garding the need for this consent. 4.3.4 Verification of Medical Checkups The first source of verification that a THSteps medical checkup has occurr ed is a paid claim or encounter. THSteps encourages providers to file a claim either electronically or on a CMS-1500 paper claim form as soon as possible after the date of servic e, as the paid claim updates client information. The provider may contact TMHP through the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com or AIS at 1-800-925-9126 to verify that the client is due for a checkup. A second source of acceptable verification is a phys ician's written statement that the checkup occurred. If the provider chooses to give the client written veri fication, it must include th e client's name, Medicaid ID number, date of the medical chec kup, and a notation that a comp lete THSteps medical checkup was performed. Note: Verification of medical checkups must not be se nt to THSteps but must be maintained by the client to be provided as needed by an HHSC eligibility caseworker. If neither the first nor the secondary source of verifi cation is available, a THSteps outreach worker may contact the provider's office for verification. 4.3.5 Medical Home HHSC and DSHS encourage the provision of the THS teps medical checkup as part of a medical home. Texas Medicaid defines a medical home as a model of delivering care that is accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, and coordinated. In providing a medical home for the client, the primary care clinician directs care coordination to gether with the client or youth and/or family. Medical checkup providers with mobile units should en courage the families to establish a medical home for their child(ren) and obtain future ch eckups from their primary care provider. When a checkup is provided in the home setting, mo bile unit, or clinic other than the medical home, it should be in coordination with the medical home and the results must be provided to the medical home as soon as possible. A mobile unit is an extension of the provider's office and must be able to provide a complete checkup.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 182 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Preventive care medical checkups ar e a benefit of the THSteps program if they are provided by enrolled THSteps providers and all of the required compon ents are completed. An incomplete preventive medical checkup is not a benefit. The THSteps peri odicity schedule specifies screening procedures required at each stage of the client's life to ensure that health screenings occur at age-appropriate points in a client's life. Components of a medical checkup that have an available CPT code are not reimbursed separately on the same day as a medical checkup, with the exception of initial point-of-care bl ood lead testing, mental health screening for adolescents, postpartum depre ssion screening, tuberculin skin test (TST), develop- mental and autism screening, vaccine administration, and oral evaluati on and flouride varnish (OEFV). Note: Initial blood lead testing, other than point-of-c are, must be sent to the DSHS Laboratory for testing. Reminder: Incomplete medical checkups are subject to recoupment unless there is documentation supporting why a component was not completed. Refer to: Subsection 4.3.12.1.3, \"Mental Health Screenin g\" in this handbook for more information about required mental health screenings. Sports physical examinations are not a benefit of Texas Medicaid. If the client is due for a THSteps medical checkup and a comprehensive medical checku p is completed, a THSteps medical checkup may be reimbursed and the provider may complete the documentation for the sports physical. THSteps preventive medical checkups are not a benefit under telemedicine or telehealth. Refer to: The THSteps Medical Checkups Periodic ity Schedule which may be found at www.hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider -portals/health-services-providers/texas- health-steps/medical-providers . Checkups should be scheduled, to the extent possible, based on the ages on the periodicity schedule to accommodate the need for flexibility wh en scheduling checkup appointments. The following table lists the number of visits allowed at each age range: All of the checkups listed on the periodicity schedu le were developed accordin g to the recommendations of the AAP and in consultation with recognized authorities in pediatric preventive health. In Texas, the THSteps periodicity schedule may differ from the AAP periodicity schedule base d on the scheduling of laboratory or other tests in fe deral EPSDT or state regulations. For more information about conducting a THSteps checkup, providers can refer to the THSteps online educational modules at www.txhealthsteps.com .

When submitting claims for THSteps checkups and services, RHC providers must use the national POS code 72, and FQHC providers must use modifier EP in addition to the modifiers used to identify who performed the medical checkup. In accordance with the federal rules for RHCs and FQHCs, an RN in an RHC or FQHC may not perform THSteps checkups independently of a physician's interactions with the client. Refer to: Section 4, \"Federally Qualified Health Cente r (FQHC)\" for informatio n related to billing. Section 7, \"Rural Health Clinic\" fo r information related to billing. Checkups, exception-to-periodicity checkups, and fo llow-up visits are limited to once per day any provider. A checkup and the associated follow-up visit may not be reimbursed on the same date of service. The follow-up visit will be denied. An incomplete checkup is subject to recoupment un less there is documentation to support why the component was not completed as part of the checkup. A new patient is one who has not received any profe ssional services within the preceding three years from the provider or from anothe r provider of the same specialty who belongs to the same group practice. As an exception, a new preventive care medical checkup (procedure code 99381, 99382, 99383, 99384, or 99385) may be billed when no prior checku ps have been billed by the same provider or provider group, even if an acute care new patien t E/M service was previously performed by the same provider. An additional new checkup is allowed only when the cl ient has not received any professional services in the preceding three years from the same provider or another provider who belongs to the same group practice, because subsequent acute care visits to the new patient THSteps checkup continues the estab- lished relationship with the provider. If the provider that performs the medical checkup pr ovides treatment for an identified condition on the same day, the provider may submit a separate claim fo r an acute care established- client office visit. The separate claim must include the established-client pr ocedure code that is appropriate for the diagnosis and treatment of the identified problem. Treatment of minor illnesses or conditions (e.g., follow-up of a mild upper respiratory infectio n) during the THSteps medical ch eckup may not warrant additional billing. Acute Care Visits When a new patient checkup is billed for the same date of service as a new patient acute care visit, both new patient services may be reimbursed when billed by the same provider or provider group if no other acute care visits or preventive care medical chec kups have been billed in the past three years. Providers must use modifier 25 to describe circumstan ces in which an acute care E/M visit was provided at the same time as a checkup. Providers must submit modifier 25 with the E/M procedure code when the rendered services are distinct and provided for a different diagnosis. Providers must bill an appro- priate level E/M procedure code with the diagnosis th at supports the acute care visit. The medical record must contain documentation that supports the medi cal necessity and the level of service of the E/M procedure code that is submitted for reimbursement. An acute care E/M visit for an insignificant or trivia l problem or abnormality billed on the same date of service as a checkup or exception-to-periodicity checkup is subject to recoupment. Providers must bill an acute care visit with their NPI on a separate claim without benefit code EP1.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 185 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Exception-to-periodicity checkups are complete me dical checkups, which are medically necessary and might cause the total number of checkups to exceed the number allowed for the client's age range if the client were to have all regular scheduled checkups . An exception-to-periodicity checkup is allowed when: Medically necessary, for example, for a client with developmental delay, suspected abuse, or other medical concerns or a client in a high-risk environm ent, such as living with a sibling with elevated blood lead. Required to meet state or federal exam requirements for Head Start, day care, foster care, or preadoption. When needed before a dental proc edure requiring general anesthesia. As noted in the Periodic Checkup Age Range table, th e number of checkups is set for each age range. This may avoid an exception-to-periodicity checkup an d allow flexibility for the provider and family to schedule a checkup including before the child's birthday. If a client is due for a medical checkup, a checkup outside of the regular THSteps schedule must be billed as a regular checkup rather than an exception to periodicity. The checkup is considered complete when all the required components are documented in the client's medical record or supporting documentation, wh ich details the reason a component(s) was not completed. A plan to complete the component(s) if not due to reasons of conscious or parental concerns must be included in the documentation. Note: A sports physical is not a reason fo r an exception-to-periodicity checkup. When billing for an exception-to-periodicity visit, provider must also include the most appropriate exception-to-periodicity modifiers. Claims icity that do not include one for these modifiers will be denied as exceeding periodicity. THSteps medical exception-to-periodicity services must be billed with the same procedure codes, provider type, modifier, and condition indicators as a medical checkup. Additionally, providers must use modifiers 23, 32, and SC to indicate the exception.Modifier Description SC Medically necessary service or supply 23 Unusual Anesthesia: Occasionally, a pr ocedure that usually requires either no anesthesia or local anesthesia must be done under general anesthesia because of unusual circumstances. This circumstance may be reported by adding the modifier \"23\" to the procedure code of the basic service. 32 Mandated Services: Services related to mandated consultation or related services (e.g., PRO, third party payer, go vernmental, legislativ e, or regulatory requirement) may be identified by adding the modifier \"32\" to the basic procedure.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 186 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

If the client has a condition that has been previously diagnosed and is currently receiving treatment, the associated standardized sc reening may be omitted with proper documentation. Documented test or screening result s obtained within the preceding 30 days for clients who are two years of age and younger, and the preceding 90 days for cl ients who are three years of age and older may be used to meet the testing or screening requirements. Results must include the dates of service and one of the following: A clear reference to the previous visit by the same provider Results obtained from another provider 4.3.12.1 Comprehensive Health and Developmental History 4.3.12.1.1 Nutritional Screening Dietary practices must be evaluated at each checkup to identify and address nutritional issues or concerns. 4.3.12.1.2 Developmental Surveillance or Screening Developmental surveillance or scre ening is a required component of every checkup for clients who are birth through 6 years of age. Autism screening is re quired at 18 months of age and again at 24 months of age. If not completed at 24 months of age, or if there is a particular concern it should be completed at 30 months of age. As THSteps medical services, developmental screen ing (procedure code 96110) and autism screening (procedure code 96110 with modifier U6) are limited to once per day, per client , by the same provider or provider group. This service will be denied unle ss a checkup, exception-to-periodicity checkup, or follow-up visit was reimbursed for the same date of service by the same provider. Standardized developmental screening is required at the ages listed in the \"Required Screening Ages and Recommended Tools\" table. Providers must use one of the validated, standardized tools listed in the table when performing a developmental or autism sc reening. A standardized screen is not required at other checkups up to and including the 6-year checkup; however, developmental surveillance is required at these checkups and includes a review of mileston es (gross and fine motor skills, communication skills, speech-language development, self-help/care skills, and social, emotional, and cognitive development) and mental health and is not considered a separate service. Providers may be reimbursed separa tely when using one of the required screening tools listed in the following table in addition to the checkup visit at specific age visits. THSteps requires one of the following required standardized tools at the followi ng ages for a checkup to be considered complete: Required Screening Ages and Recommended Tools Screening Ages Developmental Screening Tools Autism Screening Tools 9 months Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Parents' Evaluation of Development Status (PEDS) or Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC)N/ACHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 191 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

If a provider administers a standardized and valida ted developmental screening at additional checkups other than those listed in the Required Screenin g Ages and Recommended Tools table, the provider must document the rationale for the additional scr eening, which may be due to provider or parental concerns. Developmental screening that is completed withou t the use of one of the required standardized screening tools is not a separately payable benefit, and the checkup will be considered incomplete. Standardized developmental screening as part of a me dical checkup and for ages other than required on the periodicity schedule is not co vered when completed for the sole purpose of meeting day care, Head Start, or school program requirements. Standardized developmental screenin g may be performed outside a THSteps medical checkup as part of development and neurologic al assessment testing. Refer to: Subsection 9.2.25, \"Developmental Screening and Testing and Aphasia Assessment\" in the Medical and Nursing Specialists, Physicians, and Physician Assistants Handbook (Vol. 2, Provider Handbooks ) for information related to develo pmental screening testing outside a THSteps medical checkup. Referral for an in-depth developmental evaluation is determined by the crit eria of the specific tool or at the provider's discretion. Referral for in-depth eval uation of development should be provided when parents express concern about their child's development, regardless of scoring on a standardized devel-opment screening tool. A medical diagnosis or a co nfirmed developmental delay is not required for referrals. The ECI program serves clients wh o are birth through 35 months of age with disabilities or develop- mental delays. Under federal and state regulations, all health-care professionals are required to refer children to the Texas HHS ECI program as soon as po ssible, but no longer than 7 days after identifying a disability or a suspected delay in development, even if referred to an approp riate provider for further testing. If the client is 3 years of age or older, referral should be made to the loca l school district's special education program. 4.3.12.1.3 Mental Health Screening Mental health screening for behavi oral, social, and emotional developm ent is required at each THSteps checkup.

Postpartum Depression Scr eening and Referral Services The American Academy of Pediatri cs (AAP) recommends the infant's provider screen mothers for postpartum depression. Po stpartum depression is the most comm on form of postpartum mood distur- bance. Screening mothers for post partum depression is appropri ate for the general postpartum population and is recommended within the first few months following birth, up to the infant's first birthday. Postpartum depression meets the sa me clinical criteria as major de pressive disorder, with the main difference being onset during pregnancy or after delivery. While postpartum depression is the most common form of postpa rtum mood disturbance, providers should be aware that other mood di sorders that may arise during the postpartum period include anxiety and panic disorders, obsessive-compulsi ve disorder, and postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis is a much mo re severe form of po stpartum depression a ccompanied by psychotic features. Postpartum psychosis is rare , typically develops in the first few days to weeks after delivery, and is a psychiatric emergency requir ing immediate me dical attention. In addition to postpartum psycho sis, immediate or emergent medica l attention may be necessary when the risk of imminent harm or danger is present. Screening Guidelines Screening using a validated tool is required. At a mi nimum, screening should occur at least once during the postpartum period. Validated tools may include the following: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Postpartum Depression Screening Scale Patient Health Questionnaire 9 Screening alone is inadequate for improving clinical outcomes. A po sitive screening for postpartum depression requires the THSteps provider to develop a referral plan with the mother. Positive Screenings: Referrals and Follow-Up THSteps providers must discuss the screening resu lts with the mother, discuss the possibility of depression, and the impact depression may have on the mother, family, and health of the infant. The THSteps provider and mother should discuss the mother's options so the provider can refer her to an appropriate provider. Screening and referral is not contingent upon the mother 's Medicaid eligibility. When needed, referrals should be made regardless of the funding so urce, including referral to local mental health authorities and loca l behavioral health authorities. THSteps providers should refer the mother to a provider who can perform further evaluation and determine an appropriate course of treatment. Appr opriate providers include, but are not limited to: Mental health clinicians The mother's primary 194 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Obstetricians and gynecologists Family physicians Community resources such as Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs) Note: Referral to an emergency center may be necessary when the risk for imminent harm or danger is present, such as mothers who report suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming herself or the baby. Resources should be provided for support in the interim until the mother is able to access care. Scheduling a return visit for the infant sooner than the next scheduled visit may be appropriate in some cases. Prior Authorization Requirements Screening for postpartum mood disorders at the ch eckup or follow up visit does not require prior authorization. Note: While recommended, screening for postpartum depression at the THSteps visit is not a compulsory requirement of the infant visit. Documentation Requirements Documentation in the infant's reco rd must include the name of the screening tool used and date the screening was completed. If the mother screens positive for depression, at a mi nimum, the provider must note that a referral plan was discussed with the mother and a referral to a provider was made. Providers may give the mother a copy of the completed screening tool to take with her to referral appointments. Documentation should also include any health education or anticipato ry guidance provided, along with the time period recommended for the infant's next appointment. 4.3.12.1.5 Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Administer the TB risk screening tool annually begin ning at 12 months of age and thereafter at other medical checkups. The TB risk screening tool is available on the HHSC website at www.hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/ provider-portals/health-services-p roviders/texas-health-steps/forms . A TST is to be administered when the screening tool indicates a risk for poss ible exposure. Providers must use procedure code 86580 when a TST is administered. A TST may be reimbursed separately when perfor med as part of a THSteps medical checkup. TB screenings are part of the encounter rates for FQ HCs and RHCs and are not reimbursed separately. A follow-up visit (procedure code 99211) is required to read all TSTs . The provider may bill the follow- up visit with an NPI and THSteps benefit code. If further evaluation is required to diagnose either latent TB infection or active TB disease, the provider may bill the appropriate E/M office visit code. Diagno sis and treatment are provided as a medical office visit. Providers can also call the TB program at 1-512-533-3000 for additional clinical information.

Clients who are birth through 35 months of age wi th suspected or confir med hearing or visual impairment must be referred to ECI as soon as possible, but no longer than 7 days after identification. 4.3.12.2.3 Hearing Screening State-mandated newborn hearing scre ening is offered by and performed in the birth facility in accor- dance with Health and Safety Code (HSC), Chapter 47, \u00a7\u00a7 47.001-47.009 and 25 TAC \u00a7\u00a7 37.501-37.507. A newborn hearing screening must be completed at the birthing facili ty. Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) or transient evoke or distorti on product otoacoustic emissions (OAE) may be performed. Screening Results Birthing facilities must report all newborn hearing screening results to DSHS within five business days using the web-based Texas Early Hearing Detectio n and Intervention (TEHDI) Management Infor- mation System (MIS) if written parental consent is obtained. Documented written consent must be maintained in the infant's medical record. Birthing facilities must provide written newborn hearin g screening results to the parent or caregiver as well as the newborn's primary care provider or medical home. Primary care providers and medical homes (Texas He alth Steps [THSteps] prov iders) must obtain a copy of the newborn hearing screening results within the TEHDI MIS if not provided by the birthing facility. The primary care provider or medical home must review all newborn hearing screening results with the parent or caregiver at the first checkup an d determine if any additional follow-up is necessary. Note: The primary care provider or medical home is responsible for managing and coordinating care for the child.

Outpatient Rescreening Newborns who do not pass the second screen in the birthing facility must be referred to a Medicaid- enrolled provider for an outpatient follow-up rescre en. The rescreen provider must have access to AABR or OAE screening and must be experienced wi th the pediatric population under age three. Newborns who do not receive a referral from the birthin g facility, after not passing the second screen in the birthing facility, must be referred by their prim ary care provider or medical home to a Medicaid- enrolled provider for an outpatie nt follow-up rescreen, unless their primary care provider or medical home is adequately equipped to provide the service. The optimal time frame for the outpatient follow- up rescreen is when the infant is between 10 and 30 days old. Outpatient follow-up rescreens must be completed by AABR or OAE screening. Results must be reported as soon as possible to the DSHS TEHDI MIS, as well as the infant's primary care provider or medical home. Newborns who pass the outpatient rescreen must ha ve their hearing monitored by their primary care provider or medical home per the THSteps periodicity schedule. Diagnostic Audiological Evaluation Newborns who do not pass the outpatient rescreen mu st be referred to a Medicaid-enrolled audiologist for a diagnostic audiological evaluation using the Texas Pediatric Protocol for Evaluation. Referrals should be made upon consultation with th e primary care provider or medical home. Note: Additional information about the Texas Pediatri c Protocol for Evaluation is available at www.dshs.texas.gov/tehdi/appr oved-screening-equipment.aspx . Unless the newborn or infant has be en hospitalized since birth, the di agnostic audiological evaluation must be completed no later than the third month af ter birth, or upon referral by the primary care provider or medical home. Diagnostic audiological evaluations completed by audiologists using the Texas Pediatric Protocol for Evaluation must include a diagnostic auditory brains tem response (ABR) and, if not previously done, a diagnostic OAE to determine cochlear involvement. Audiologists will use equipment norm s for newborns, preferably ones they have collected on their equipment. Protocols include air and bone conduc tion testing using tone burst ABR, as well as click ABR, so the amplification may be appropriate to fit the individual. Note: Additional information about technologies th at have been evaluated by an independent investigator and DSHS, and have been found to meet the requirements for conducting newborn hearing screening is available at www.dshs.texas.gov/tehdi/Audiologic-Evaluation- Protocol.aspx . Evaluation Results Audiologists must report all diagnostic results to DSHS TEHDI MIS and provide written hearing screening results to the primary care provider or medical home. The newborn or infant will be fitted for hearing ai ds by the audiologist when appropriate and should receive continued audiological asse ssments and monitoring as needed.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 197 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

The vaccines are recommended according to the Recommended Childhood and Ad olescent Immunization Schedule (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], AAP, and the American Academy of Family Physicians [AAFP]). Medicaid does not reimburse for vaccine s/toxoids that are available from TVFC. THSteps providers are strongly encouraged to enroll in TVFC at DSHS and must do so in order to obtain free vaccines for clients who are birth through 18 years of age. Local and public health departments that are not otherwise enrolled as a provider that is auth orized to receive reimburs ement for vaccine adminis- tration fees should enroll as a Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) provider. Providers may not charge Texas Medicaid for the cost of the vaccines obtained from TVFC; however the administration fee, not to exceed $14.85, is consid ered for reimbursement. For additional information about immunizations, prov iders can refer to the THSteps online educational \"Immunization\" at www.txhealthsteps.com. Refer to: Section \"Vaccine Services\" handbook. \"Appendix B. Immunization s\" in this handbook. Providers must assess the immunizati on status at every medical checkup to ensure all age requirements have been met. The necessary vaccines and toxoids must be administered at the time of the checkup unless medically contraindicated or because of parent's or caregiver's reasons of conscience including religious beliefs. If an indicated vaccine or toxoid was not administered, the re ason must be documented in the client's medical record. Vaccines and toxoids must be administered accord ing to the current ACIP \"Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedu le - United States.\" Providers must not refer clients to the local health department or other entity for immunization administration. THSteps providers are strongly encouraged to obta in vaccines from TVFC for clients who are birth through 18 years of age.

Health education an d counseling with parents or guardians and clients are required to assist parents in understanding what to expect in terms of the client's development and to provide information about the benefits of healthy lifestyles and practices, as well as accident and disease prevention. Written material may also be giv en but does not replace counseling. The optional THSteps clinical records include age-appropriate topi cs on the back of each form. These forms can be found at www.hhs.texas.gov/doing-business-hhs/provider -portals/health-servic es-providers/texas- health-steps/forms . 4.3.12.5 Dental Referral Based on the AAPD definition of a dental home, Texa s Medicaid defines a dent al home as the dental provider who supports an ongoing rela tionship with the client that is inclusive of all aspects of oral health care delivered in a compre hensive, continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way. In Texas, establishment of a client's dental home should begin at 6 months of age but no later than 12 months of age and includes referral to dental specialists when appropriate. The physician must refer clients to establish a dental home beginning at 6 months of age or earlier if trauma or early childhood caries are identified. For established clients after the six-month medical checkup, the provider must confirm if a dental ho me has been established and is on-going; if not, additional referrals must be made at subsequent me dical checkup visits until the parent or caregiver confirms that a dental home has been established for the client. The parent or ca regiver of the client may self-refer for dental care at any age, including 12 months of age or younger. 4.3.12.6 Laboratory Test Age-appropriate and risk-based laboratory testing as noted on the periodicity schedule is considered part of the medical checkup.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.4.5 Vaccine Services Vaccines and vaccine administration as recommende d by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are benefits of Texas Medicaid. Immunization is the process by which a client become s immune or resistant to an infectious disease, typically by vaccination. Vaccination is the action of introducing a vaccine into the body. A vaccine stimulates a client's immune system to produce immunity to a disease, thereby providing protection from that disease. Vaccines may be administered orally, nasally, or via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The following are categories of vaccines: Live, attenuated I n a c t i v a t e d Toxoid S u b u n i t Conjugate Providers must follow current ACIP general usag e recommendations and ad here to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee's (NVAC) Standards fo r Adult Immunization Prac tice and Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practice; howe ver, in the event of conflict, providers are required to follow more specific Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) guidelines. Providers must provide the current vaccine information statements (VIS s) produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to clients. VISs explain the benefits and risks of the vaccine(s) administered. 4.5.1 Texas Vaccines for Chil dren (TVFC) Program The TVFC program provides vaccines at no cost to the provider. The vaccines are recommended according to the Recommended Childhood and Ad olescent Immunization Schedule (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], AAP, and the American Academy of Family Physicians [AAFP]). Medicaid does not reimburse for vaccine s/toxoids that are available from TVFC. THSteps providers are strongly encouraged to enroll in TVFC at DSHS and must do so in order to obtain free vaccines for clients who are birth through 18 years of age. Local and public health departments that are not otherwise enrolled as a provider that is auth orized to receive reimburs ement for vaccine adminis- tration fees should enroll as a Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) provider. Providers may not charge Texas Medicaid for the cost of the vaccines obtained from TVFC; however the administration fee, not to exceed $14.85, is consid ered for reimbursement. For additional information about immunizations, prov iders can refer to the THSteps at www.txhealthsteps.com . TVFC Distributed Vaccines When single antigen vaccine(s)/toxo id(s) or comparable an tigen vaccine(s)/toxoid(s) are available for distribution through TVFC, but the provider chooses to use an ACIP-recommended product that is not distributed through TVFC, the vaccine/toxoid will not be covered; however, th e administration fee will be considered.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 209 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.4.5.2 Vaccine Adverse Event Re porting System (VAERS) The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires health-care providers to report to VAERS: Any adverse event reaction listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine. Any reaction listed in the VAERS Table of Reportab le Events that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. VAERS encourages providers to report vaccine administration errors and any adverse event that occurs after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States even if it is clear whether a vaccine caused the adverse event. NCVIA requires health-care providers to report cert ain adverse events that o ccur following vaccination. As a result, VAERS was established by CDC and FDA in 1990. VAERS provid es a mechanism for the collection and analysis of adverse events (side effect s) associated with vaccines currently licensed in the United States. Adverse events are defined as health effects that occur after immunization that may or may not be related to the vaccine. VAERS data are monitored continually to detect unknown adverse events or increases in known side effects. A copy of the Reportable Events Table can be obtained by calling VAER S at 1-800-822-7967 or by downloading it from vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . For additional information about NCVIA, providers can refer to www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/ forms/ 11-11246 . 4.5.2.1 Vaccine Reporting to Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Administered vaccines must be reported to DSHS. DS HS submits all vaccines reported with consent to a centralized repository of immuni zation histories. This lifespan registry is know n in Texas as ImmTrac2. 4.5.2.2 Rabies Vaccine Availability and Animal Bite Reporting Providers that determine a client requires the rabies vaccination seri es after valid rabies exposure may obtain the biologicals directly from the manufacture r or through one of the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) depots around the state. Animal bites to people must be reported as soon as possible to the designated Local Rabies Control Authority (LRCA). Refer to: Subsection 9.2.38, \"Postexposure Prophylaxis for Rabies\" in the Medical and Nursing Specialists, Physicians, and Physician Assist ants Handbook (Vol.2, Provider Handbooks) for additional information about rabies vaccination. 4.5.3 Documentation Requirements Providers must document the following information fo r every vaccine administered to a client in the client's medical record: Vaccine given Date the vaccine was administer ed (day, month, year format) Name of the vaccine manufacturer Vaccine lot number Signature and title of the person administering the vaccine Organization name and addressCHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 210 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Publication date of the VIS issues to the client, parent, or guardian If a vaccine is given outside of ACIP's recommende d routine immunization schedules for children or adults, the reason for the vaccination must be includ ed in the client's medica l record. Reasons for vacci- nating outside the routine schedule may include but are not limited to: P r e g n a n c y An impaired immune system Suspected exposure to a disease These records are subject to retrospective review to determine appropriate utilization and reimbursement for this service. 4.5.4 * Vaccine Reimbursement Vaccines and vaccine administration are reimbursed at a fee determined by HHSC. Each vaccine and its administration must be submitted on the same claim in the following sequence: the vaccine procedure code immediatel y followed by the applicable vaccine administration procedure code(s). All of the vaccine administration procedure codes th at correspond to a single vaccine procedure code must be submitted on the same cl aim as the vaccine procedure code. Vaccines for clients who are birth th rough 18 years of age are available through TVFC and administered at a site that is eligible for TVFC enrollment will not be reimbursed through Texas Medicaid. Providers may not bill clie nts who are birth through 18 years of age for vaccines available through TVFC. Preventive Health Visits If a vaccine is administered as part of a preventive health visit, including but not limited to a THSteps preventive care medical checkup, then the age-approp riate diagnosis code for the preventive health visit must be submitted on the claim. Diagnosis code Z 23 may also be included on the claim as secondary. For a vaccine administration at a visit for which the ad ministration is the only purpose of a visit (i.e. the vaccine administration is not part of a preventive health visit), provider should submit the appropriate vaccine diagnosis code Z23. Vaccine administration must be billed with the following ag e-appropriate diagnosis codes: Vaccines should be obtained throug h TVFC for clients who are birth through 18 years of age. Provider purchased vaccines are not reimbursed separately unless they meet the definition of \"not available\" as defined in this section. A vaccine may be defined as \"not available\" in one or more of the following situations: TVFC, based on their federal resolution (distribution guidelines), does not distribute a Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)-approved vaccine that has an ACIP-recommended use. ACIP approves a new vaccine with established guidelines, but the vaccine has not yet been negotiated or added to a TVFC contract.

Providers may use the state-defined modifier U1 in addition to the associated administered vaccine procedure code for clients who are birth through 18 ye ars of age and the vaccine was unavailable through TVFC. The state will notify providers if a vaccine meets the de finition of \"not available\" and when the provider's privately purchased vaccine can be billed with the modifier U1. Modifier U1 may not be used for fa ilure to enroll in TVFC, maintain sufficient TVFC vaccine inventory, or clients who are 19 through 20 years of age. Vaccines for clients who are 19 years through 20 years of age may be reimbursed through THSteps when provided as part of a THSteps preventive care medical checkup, or CCP when provided as part of an acute medical visit outside of a THSteps preventive ca re medical checkup. Providers must bill acute care services under their existing NPI. Vaccines for client s who are 21 years of age or older may be reimbursed through traditional Texas Medicaid when the vaccine is medically necessary.

The provider has the following options: If the provider chooses to bill the other insurance, the provider must submit the claim to the client's other insurance before submi tting the claim to Medicaid. If the provider chooses to bill Medicaid and not the client's other insurance, the provider is indicating that he or she accepts the Medicaid pa yment as payment in full. Medicaid then has the right to recovery from the other insurance. The provider does not have the right to recovery and cannot seek reimbursement from the other insurance after Medicaid has made payment. If the provider learns that a client has other ins urance coverage after Medicaid has paid a claim, the provider must refund the payment to Medi caid before billing the other insurance. Providers should bill their usual and customary fee except for vaccines obtained from TVFC. Providers may not charge Medicaid or clients for the vaccine received from TVFC. Providers may charge a usual and customary fee not to exceed $14.85 for vaccine administration when providing immunizations to a client eligible for TVFC. Providers are reimbursed the lesser of the billed amount or the maximum allowable fee. THSteps medical checkups may be billed electronic ally or on a CMS-1500 paper claim form. Providers may purchase CMS-1500 paper claim forms from the ve ndor of their choice. TMHP does not supply the forms. Providers may request information about electron ic billing or the paper claim form by contacting the TMHP THSteps Cont act Center at 1-800-757-5691. All procedures, including the informational-only proc edures, must have a billed amount associated with each procedure listed on the claim. Informational-only procedure codes must be billed in the amount of at least $.01. Providers must record the foll owing on the CMS-1500 claim form to receive reimbursement for a medical checkup, exception to period icity checkup, or follow-up visit: The NPI and benefit code EP1 (exception: FQ HC providers do not use benefit code EP1) The appropriate Texas Health Steps medical checku p procedure code (all ages) with diagnosis code Z0000, Z0001, Z00110, Z00111, Z00121, or Z00129.

A.5 Tuberculosis Screening and Guidelines The screening tool for tuberculosis (T B) exposure risk is to be used annually to determine the need for tuberculin skin testing. The questions in the screening tool are intended as a minimum screen. Follow-up questions may be necessary to clarify hesitant or ambiguous responses. Questions specif ic to TB exposure risks in the client's community ma y need to be added. The following applies for tubercul in screening and skin testing: If all the answers are unqualified negatives, the client is considered at low risk for exposure to TB and will not need tuberculin skin testing. If the answer to any question is \"Yes\" or \"I don't know,\" the client should be tuberculin skin tested.ECHR-6 Year 6 Year Visit Child Health Record ECHR-7 Year 7 Year Visit Child Health Record ECHR-8 Year 8 Year Visit Child Health Record ECHR-9 Year 9 Year Visit Child Health RecordECHR-10 Year 10 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-11 Year 11 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-12 Year 12 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-13 Year 13 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-14 Year 14 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-15 Year 15 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-16 Year 16 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-17 Year 17 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-18 Year 18 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-19 Year 19 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-20 Year 20 Year Visi t Child Health Record ECHR-19-20 Year 19 & 20 Year Visit Child Health Record Form Pb-110, Lead Risk QuestionnaireTB QuestionnaireForm Number Form NameCHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 223 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. In the case of the client for whom an answer in the past of \"Yes\" or \"I don't know\" prompted a skin test, which was negative, the skin test may not have to be repeated annually. The decision to administer a skin test must be made by the medical pr ovider based upon an assessment of the possibility of expo sure. A negative tuberculin skin test never excludes tuberculosis infection or active disease. Bacillus of Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccinated clients should also have the screening tool administered annually. Previous BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to tuberculin skin testing. Positive tuberculin skin tests in BCG vaccinated children are interpreted using the same guidelines used for non- BCG vaccinated children. Clients who have had a positive TB skin test in the past (whether treated or not), should be re- evaluated at least annually by a phys ician for signs and symptoms of TB. Care of clients who are newly discovered to be tuberculin skin test positive includes: An evaluation for signs and symptoms of TB. A chest X-ray to rule out active disease. Oral medications to prevent progression to active di sease or multi-drug therapy if active disease is present. Referral for consultation by a pediatric TB specia list is recommended if active disease is present. A report to the local health authority for investigation to find the source of the infection.

I MMUNIZATIONS B.1 Immunizations Overview Clients who are 17 years of age and younger must be immunized accordin g to the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule for the United States . If the immunizations are due as part of a Texas Health Steps (THSteps) medical checkup, the medica l checkup provider is responsible for the adminis- tration of immunizations for clients who are birth through 20 years of age and may not refer clients to local health departments. The Department of State He alth Services (DSHS) requires that immunizations be administered during the THSteps medical checku p, unless they are medically contraindicated or excluded from immunization for reasons of conscience, includin g a religious belief. Providers, in both public and private sectors, ar e required by federal mandate to provide a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) to the responsible adult accompanying a client for an immunization. These statements are specific to each vaccine and inform the responsible adult about the risks and benefits. It is important that providers use the most current VIS. Providers interested in obtaining copies of current VISs and other immunization forms or literature may call the DSHS Immunization Branch at 1-512-458-7284. VISs may also be downloaded from the DSHS Immunization Branch website at www.immunizetexas.com . B.1.1 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires health-care providers to report to VAERS: Any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacture r as a contraindication to subsequent doses of the vaccine. Any reaction listed in the VAERS Table of Reportab le Events that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. VAERS encourages providers to report vaccine administration errors and any adverse event that occurs after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States even if it is clear whether a vaccine caused the adverse event. A copy of the Reportable Events Table can be obtained by calling VAER S at 1-800-822-7967 or by downloading it from vaers.hhs.gov/resources/infoproviders.html. TVFC Versus Non- TVFC Vaccines/Toxoids When single antigen or comparable antigen vaccines/toxoids are available for distri- bution through the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVF C) Program, but the provider chooses to use a different Advisory Committee on Immunization Pr actices (ACIP)-recommended product, the vaccine/ toxoid will not be reimbursed; however, the administration fee will be considered. Note: All administered vaccines/toxoi ds must be reported to DSHS. DSHS submits all vaccines/ toxoids reported with consent to a centralize d immunization registry, known as ImmTrac2. Refer to: Subsection B.3.5, \"How to Report Immuni zation the Texas Immunization Registry\" in this handbook. B.1.3 Exemption from Immunization fo r School and Chil d-Care Facilities Parents may obtain an exemption from immunization requirements for school and childcare entry for reasons of conscience or religious beliefs. An exem ption is also available for clients who are medically contraindicated from receiving a vaccine. For more information on exemptions call 1-512-458-7284, or visit www.immunizetexas.com .

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.B.2 Recommended Childhoo d Immunization Schedule The Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule indicates the recommended age for routine administration of currently licens ed childhood vaccines. This schedu le was developed and approved by ACIP, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Some combination vaccines are available and may be used whenever any component of the combination is indicated and its other components are not contraindicated. Providers should consult the manufac- turer's package insert for detailed recommendations. Vaccines should be administered at the recommended ages. Any dose not given at the recommended age should be given as a catch-up immunization on any subsequent visit when indicated and feasible. A current copy of the Recomm ended Childhood Immunization Schedule can be accessed at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules . Refer to: Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immuni zation Schedule on the THSteps page of the TMHP website at www.tmhp.com . B.3 General Recommendations For information about vaccine administration, dosin g, and contraindications, immunization providers should consult vaccine package inse rts and the January 28, 2011, issue of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). For copies of the MMWR, contact the Immunization Branch at 1-512-458-7284. B.3.1 How to Obtain Vaccines at No Cost to the Provider TVFC provides routinely recommended ACIP va ccines for immunization of THSteps and other Medicaid- and TVFC-eligible clients free of charge to providers who are enrolled in TVFC. The local health department/district or DSHS regional office pr ovides information on how to order, account for, and inventory vaccines. Local and public health departments that are not otherwise enrolled as a provider that is authorized to receive reimbursement for vaccine administration fees should enroll as a Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) provider. Monthly reports are required in order to receive state- purchased vaccines. Physicians who request and accept state-supplied vaccines must complete and sign the provider enrollment and profile forms annually. Th e provider may not charge Medicaid or the client for vaccines obtained from TVFC. Additional information is available at www.immunizetexas.com . B.3.2 Administrations and Immunizations B.3.2.1 Administrations The following administration procedure codes must be submitted in combinat ion with an appropriate vaccine/toxoid procedure code: Procedure codes 90460 and 90461 are benefits for servic es rendered to clients who are birth through 18 years of age when counseling is provided for the immunization administered. Documentation of counseling by the physician or other qualified health -care professional must be noted in the client's medical record. Procedure codes 90471, 90472, 90473, and 90474 are benefits for services rendered to clients of any age when counseling is not provided for the immunization administered.Administration Procedure Code 90460 90461 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

Is enrolled in Medicaid. Has no health insurance. Is underinsured: clients who have other health insurance but the coverage does not include vaccines, clients whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (TVFC-eligible for noncovered vaccines only), clients whose ins urance capitates vaccine coverage at a certain amount (once that coverage amount is reached, these clients are categorized as underinsured). Is a client who receives benefits from the Chil dren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the provider bills CHIP for the administration fee. Maintain all records related to the TVFC program, including parent, guardian, or authorized repre- sentative's responses to screening for patient's eligibil ity for at least five ye ars. If requested, the provider will make such records available to DSHS , the local health depart ment authority, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Comply with the appropriate vaccination schedule, dosage, and contraindications, as established by ACIP, unless (a) in making a medical judgment in accordance with accep ted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate, or (b) the particular requirement is not in compliance with Texas la w, including laws relating to religious and medical exemptions.

B.3.5 How to Report Immunization Records to ImmTrac2, the Texas Immunization Registry Texas law requires all medical pr oviders and payors to report all immunizations administered to clients who are 17 years of age and younger, to ImmTrac2, the Texas immunization registry operated by DSHS (Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7161.007-161.009). Providers must re port all immunization infor- mation within 30 days of administration of the vaccine, and payors must report within 30 days of receipt of data elements from a provider. Prior to report ing immunizations to ImmTra c2, providers must first register for registry participation and access. ImmTrac2 is a centralized repository of immunization histories for clients of all ages and is a free service and benefit available to all Texans. Registry information is confidential, and by law, may be released only to: The client or client's parent, lega l guardian, or managing conservator. The client's physician, school, or licensed child-care facility in which th e client is enrolled. Public health districts or local health departments. The insurance company, health maintenance organization, or other organization that pays for the provision of the client's health-care benefits. A health-care provider author ized to administer a vaccine. A state agency that has legal custody of the client. ImmTrac2 offers two methods fo r reporting immunizations to DS HS: direct internet entry into ImmTrac2's internet application and el ectronic data transfer (import). B.3.5.1 Direct Internet Entry This method allows providers to access and review clients' immunization histories prior to adminis- tering vaccines. Providers then update their client's immunization record directly into the ImmTrac2 web application after administering vaccines to the patient. B.3.5.2 Electronic Data Transfer (Import) This method allows providers to report immuniza tions from an electronic medical record (EMR) software application by extract file for import into ImmTrac2. Providers may still have access to the ImmTrac2 web application to access and review thei r clients' immunization histories before adminis- tering any vaccines. Regardless of reporting option selected, all provider s must first register for ImmTrac2 access and receive login credentials from ImmTrac2 Customer Support. To register for ImmTrac2 access, providers may obtain and complete an ImmTra c2 Registration Packet (for providers and schools) from www.dshs.state.tx.us/immunize/immtrac/default.shtm or request it from ImmTrac2 Customer Support at 1-800-348-9158.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 230 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.B.3.5.3 Obtaining Parental Consent for Registry Participation Before including a client's immunization informat ion in ImmTrac2, DSHS must verify that written consent for registry participation has been granted by the client's parent, legal guardian, or managing conservator. Most parents grant consent for ImmTrac2 participation during the birth certificate regis- tration process. Written parental consent for ImmTrac2 participation applies to all past, present, and future immunizations. Texas law also permits a parent , managing conservator, or guardian to withdraw consent for ImmTrac2 participation at any time. Providers may offer parents the oppo rtunity to grant consent for their child's participation in ImmTrac2 using the pre-filled, ImmTrac2-generated Immuni zation Registry (ImmTrac2) Consent Form or the manual version (#C-7) of this form, also availabl e from the ImmTrac2 application. Providers should retain the consent form and affirm parental consent through ImmTrac2 to establish the client's ImmTrac2 record and report all immunizations ad ministered and add any historical immunization information to the client's record . Entering administered immunizations and historical immunization information to the client's record constitutes \"reporti ng\" to ImmTrac2 as required by current Texas law.

L EAD SCREENING C.1 Blood Lead Screening Proc edures and Follow-up Testing For all children enrolled in Texas Health Steps (THS teps) blood lead testing is mandatory when they are 12 months of age and 24 months of age, or whenever they receive their first checkup after these ages if blood testing was not completed (up to and includin g the 6-year checkup). Lead-risk assessment should be done at all other checkups through age 6, an d may be performed using Form PB 110, Lead Risk Questionnaire. A \"yes\" or \"don't know\" answer to any question on the questionnaire indicates that a blood lead test should be administered. All blood lead levels in clients who are birth through 14 years of age must be reported to the Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Re ports should include all information as required on the Te xas Child Blood Lead Level Report Form F09-11709, which is available at www.dshs.texas.gov/lead/providers.shtm or by calling 1-800-588-1248. Information related to blood lead screening and reporting for clients who are 15 year s of age or older is available on the DSHS Blood Lead Surveillance Group's website at www.dshs.texas.gov/lead/default.shtm . C.2 Symptoms of Lead Poisoning Children who have EBLLs in the range of 5-45g/dL may be asymptomatic, although impairment of neurodevelopment may become evident as they get older. Very high lead levels may cause colic, consti- pation, anorexia, or vomiting. Children with venous blood lead levels (BLLs) over 44g/dL are eligible for medical intervention. However, it is important not to equate the absence of symptoms with the absence of toxicity. C.3 Measuring Blood Lead Levels A blood lead test is the only definitive method to detect exposure. BLLs are measured as micrograms of lead per deciliter of whole blood (g/dL). In Texas, a BLL requires medical ca se management and follow- up testing if the level is greater than or equal to 5 g/dL. Blood lead tests, in order of occurrence: Screening test\u2014A blood lead test that indicates whet her a client may have an EBLL. This test must be sent to the DSHS lab, or may be done using point-of-care technology in the provider's office. Diagnostic test\u2014A venous blood lead test that is performed wi thin recommended guidelines to determine the status of a client who has previously had an EBLL on a screening test (See subsection C.5, \"Lead Poisoning Prevention Edu cational Materials and Forms\" in this handbook for a link to form Pb-109 and recommended guidelines). Follow-up test\u2014A venous blood lead test to monitor the status of a client with a previously elevated diagnostic test for lead. Note: A follow-up test is not related to the THSteps follow-up visit. A visit to monitor a child with EBLL would be submitted as an acute care evaluation and management (E/M) visit. Providers are responsible for conducting a diagnostic te st when a screening test finds a lead level of 5 g/ dL or greater. Blood for a screening test may be dr awn from a venous or capillary site. A venous blood draw is strongly recommended and preferred. To order venous sample supplies from the DSHS Laboratory, call 1-888-963-7111, Ext. 7661. Note: The capillary lead screen analysis is subject to a false positive result from skin lead contami- nation during collection. A soap and water wa sh of the patient's hands or feet and the collector's hands (or the wearing of gloves) mu st be performed to minimize the chance of contamination. Alcohol cleansing alone is not sufficient.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 232 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.If the screening test is 5 g/dL or above, recalling a client for a diagnostic sample may be billed as a THSteps follow-up visit. If the screening test was re jected due to clotting, insufficient quantities, or perceived contamination, the provider must repeat the sample as a diag nostic test. Again, the provider may bill the visit and analysis as an E/M visit. Prov iders can submit the specimen to the DSHS Clinical Chemistry Laboratory using the ap propriate DSHS Laboratory Specim en Submission form (the same way as for all other THSteps laboratory blood specimens). If the initial blood lead test is collected as part of a THSteps medical checkup, it must either be se nt to the DSHS lab or performed in the provider's office using point-of-care. The diagnostic and follow-u p test for the same client may be sent to a private laboratory. Refer to: Pb-109: Reference for Blood Lead Retesting and Medical Case Management on the DSHS website for interpretation of la boratory test results and guidel ines for follow-up for clients with elevated blood lead levels. Subsection 4.3.12.6.6, \"Require d Laboratory Tests Related handbook. Subsection 4.3.10, \"Newborn Examination\" in this handbook. Providers can find more information about the medical and environmental management of lead- poisoned children on the DSHS Texas Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (TX CLPPP) website at www.dshs.texas.gov/lead or by calling 1-800-588-1248. C.4 Environmental Lead Investigation Services C.4.1 Enrollment State and local health depart ments that employ or contra ct certified lead risk assessors must be enrolled with Texas Medicaid as a THSteps provider to perf orm environmental lead investigation (ELI) services. State and local health department s that are currently en rolled in Texas Medicaid must complete the THSteps Provider Enrollment Application. State and local health departments that are not cu rrently enrolled in Texas Medicaid must complete the Texas Medicaid Provider Enrollment Applic ation and the THSteps Provider Enrollment Application. C.4.1.1 Services, Benefits, Limitations, and Prior Authorization ELI services must be billed with procedure code T 1029, which is restricted to the following diagnosis codes: Texas Medicaid may only reimburse a state or loca l health department for the certified lead risk assessor's time and activities during an onsite inve stigation of a client's ho me or primary residence. Laboratory analysis of environmental substances (e.g ., water, paint, or soil) is not a benefit of Texas Medicaid. Children who have confirmed and persistent EBLLs ma y require an ELI to determine the source of the lead exposure. An ELI is completed in a client's ho me or primary residence by a certified lead risk assessor to determine whether a lead hazard exists and, if so, whether the lead source could be the cause of the - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.C.4.1.2 Requesting an Environmental Lead Investigation For the purpose of requesting an ELI, a health-care provider is a physician, nurse practitioner (NP), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), or physician assist ant (PA) who conducts bloo d lead tests for a THSteps client. Health-care providers may subm it a request for an ELI after a blood lead test has been conducted and there is evidence of persistent and confirmed EB LLs for the client. An EBLL is defined as a BLL of 10g/dL or higher. An ELI may be considered medically necessary if the results of the most recent blood lead test indicate any of the following: A venous BLL result of 10g/dL to 19g/dL fr om two separate specimens conducted at least 12 weeks apart A venous BLL result of 20g/dL or greater from one specimen Note: The ELI must be requested as soon as possible and no later than 30 days after obtaining the most recent BLL that indicate s medical necessity. The health-care provider must maintain in the client's medical record the ELI request an d the documentation of the BLL that indicates medical necessity. The health-care provider can request an ELI by co mpleting Form Pb-101 \"Env ironmental Lead TX CLPP P. TX CLPPP will review the request and determine whether the criteria for an ELI have been met. If an ELI request meets the TX CLPPP criteria, TX CLPPP sends a referral for an ELI to a sta te or local health department that is enrolled as a THSteps provider so that it can be assigned to a certifie d lead risk assessor. A ce rtified lead risk assessor conducts an ELI using a completed Pb-103 Texas Elevated Blood Lead Level Investigation Questionnaire (all pages). An ELI can be performed under on e of the following circumstances: No previous investigation of the current ho me or primary residence has been performed. There is a change in the client's current home or primary residence. If a previous investigation of th e current home or primary residenc e has been performed and there has been a change in the client's re sidential environment, TX CLPPP will determine whether the criteria have been met for an additional ELI. C.4.1.3 Prior Authorization Prior Authorization is not required for ELI services. C.4.2 Documentation Requirements The state or local health department that is respon sible for conducting the in vestigation must maintain the following documentation in the client's medical record: The TX CLPPP fax transmittal cover sheet that refers the ELI request to the local health department. The cover sheet must include: The site to be assessed. A statement that identifies the site as the client's primary place of residence.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.APPENDIX D. T EXAS HEALTH STEPS STATUTORY STATE REQUIREMENTS D.1 Legislative Requirements Several specific legislative requirements affect Texa s Health Steps (THSteps) and the provider's partici- pation in Texas Medicaid. The legislation includes, but is not limited to, those in cluded in this Appendix. D.2 Texas Health Steps (THSteps) Program The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, an d Treatment (EPSDT) Program is mandated by Title XIX of the Social Security Act. EPSDT is a program of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for Medicaid-eligible clients who are birth through 20 years of age. In Texas, EPSDT is known as THSteps. The Texas Department of State Heal th Services (DSHS), by authorization of Texas Department of Health and Human Services (HHSC), operates and administers the outreach and informing, medical and dental chec kup, dental treatment utilization components of this program. State authority is found in Title 25 Te xas Administrative Code (TAC), Part 1, Chapter 33, Subchapter A, Rule \u00a733.1. D.3 Communicable Disease Reporting Diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human im munodeficiency virus (HIV), are reportable conditions under 25 TAC, Chapter 97, Subchapter F. Providers must report confirmed diagnosis of STDs as required by 25 TAC \u00a7\u00a797.132-134. D.4 Early Childhood Inte rvention (ECI) Referrals All health-care professionals are required by federal and state regulations to refer children who are birth through 35 months of age to the Texas HHS ECI program as soon as possible, but no longer than 7 days after identifying a disability or suspected delay in development. Referrals can be based on professional judgment or a family's concern. A medical diagnosis or a confirmed developmental delay is not required for referrals. To refer families for services, prov iders should use the ECI referral form available on the Texas Pediatric Society website at https://txpeds.org/sites/txpeds.org/files/ documents/eci-referral-form-icd-10.pdf . Providers may also refer families for services by calling their local ECI program or the Health and Human Services Office of the Ombudsman at 1-877-787- 8999, select a language, an d then select Option 3. The Ombudsman staff will ask for your ZIP code, county, or city and provide the name and number of the local ECI program. Callers that are deaf or hard of hearing may use the relay option of their choice or dial 7-1-1 to connect with Relay Texas. To facilitate referrals for ECI services an optional fo rm is available on the Texas Pediatric Society website at https://txpeds.org/sites/ txpeds.org/files/documen ts/ECI-Referral-Form.pdf . For additional ECI information, provid ers can visit the HHS ECI website at www.hhs.texas.gov/services/ disability/early-childhoo d-intervention-services . Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing may use the relay option of their choice or dial 7-1-1 to connect with Relay Texas. D.5 Parental Accompaniment Texas Human Resource Code (HRC) \u00a7\u00a732.024(s)-(2) requires that, as a condition for provider reimbursement, a client who is 14 years of age or yo unger be accompanied by th e client's parent, legal guardian, or other authorized adult during medica l and dental checkups and dental treatment. The authorized adult can be the client's relative. DSHS implemented this requirement through rules found in 25 TAC \u00a733.2 (Definitions) and 25 TAC \u00a7 33.6 (THSteps Provider Responsibilities).CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 237 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.The DSHS rules require that the parent, legal guardian , or authorized adult accompany the client to the checkup, and that the parent, legal guardian, or au thorized adult must wait for the client while the checkup, treatment, or service takes place. Providers will not be required to su bmit documentation to TMHP to veri fy compliance with this policy in order for TMHP to process claims. By submitting the claim for reimbursement, the provider acknowl- edges compliance with all Medicaid requiremen ts. Additional assurances are not necessary. Exception: School health clinics, Head Start programs, an d childcare facilities are exempt from this policy if the clinic, program, or facility encourages parental invo lvement in the health care of the client and obtains written consent for the serv ices. The consent from the client's parent or guardian must have been received within the one-year period before the date on which the services are provided and must not have been revoked. Refer to: HRC \u00a7\u00a732.024(s)-(s-1) and 25 TAC \u00a733.2 and \u00a733.6. D.6 Newborn Blood Screening The Health and Safety Co de (HSC), Chapter 33, Section \u00a733.011, implemented by the rules found at 25 TAC, Part 1, Chapter 37, Subchapter D, requires testing of all newborns. A current list of disorders can be found at www.dshs.texas.gov/newborn /screened_disorders.shtm . This testing is the responsi bility of the physician who is attendin g a newborn client (defined as up to 30 days of age by rule in 25 TAC, Chapter 37, Subchapt er D, \u00a737.52) or the person who is attending the delivery of a newborn client who is not attended by a physician to screen for the disorders within 24 to 48 hours of birth. All infants must be tested a second time at 1 to 2 weeks of age. If there is any doubt that a client who is 12 months of age or younger was properly tested, the provider should submit a blood sample with the appropriate DSHS Form NBS3 to the DSHS Newborn Screening Laboratory. D.7 Abuse and Neglect D.7.1 Requirements for Re porting Abuse or Neglect Providers are required to report abuse or neglect as outlined in subsection 1.7, \"Provider Responsibil- ities\" in \"Section 1: Provider Enrollment and Responsibilities\" ( Vol. 1, General Information ). Additionally, the General Appropriations Act, Art icle II, Rider 23 under DSHS, and Rider 13 under HHSC, of S.B. 1, 79th Legislative Regular Session, 2007, require that DSHS and HHSC distribute or provide appropriated funds only to recipients who show good faith efforts to comply with all child abuse and reporting requirements set forth in the Texas Family Code (T FC), Chapter 261, relating to investi- gations of reports of child abuse and neglect. D.7.2 Procedures for Reporting Abuse or Neglect Professionals, as defined in TFC \u00a7261.101 (b), are requ ired to report abuse or neglect no later than the 48th hour after the hour in which the professional first has cause to believe the client has been or may be abused or is the victim of the offense of indecency with a child. Nonprofessionals shall imme diately make a report when the nonprofessional has cause to believe that the client's physical or mental health or welfare has been adversely affected by abuse. A report must be made regardless of whether the prov ider staff suspects that a report may have previ- ously been made. Reports of abuse or indecency with a child should be made to one of the following: Texas Department of Family and Protective Serv ices (DFPS), if the alleged or suspected abuse involves a person responsible for the care, cust ody, or welfare of the child (DFPS Texas Abuse Hotline, 1-800-252-5400, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week).CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 238 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Call the DFPS Texas Abuse Hotline if: You believe your situation requires action in less than 24 hours. You prefer to remain anonymous. You have insufficient data to complete the required information on the report. You do not want an email to confirm your report. Note: Providers can also report nonemergency abuse online at www.txabusehotline.org . Any local or state law enforcement agency or the state agency that operates, licenses, certifies, or registers the facility in which th e alleged abuse or neglect occurred. The agency designated by the court to be responsible for the protection of children. The law requires that the report include the following: Name and address of the minor, if known. Name and address of the minor's parent or the pers on responsible for the care, custody, or welfare of the child if not the parent, if known. Any other pertinent information concerning the alleged or suspected abuse, if known. A provider may not reveal whether the client has been tested or diagnosed with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). If the minor' s identity is unknown (e.g., the minor is at the provider's office to receive testing for HIV or an STD anonymously), no report is required. D.7.2.1 Staff Training on Reporting Abuse and Neglect All providers shall develop training for all staff on the policies and procedures in regard to reporting child abuse, including sexual abuse an d neglect. New staff shall receive this training as part of their initial training or orientation. Training shall be documented. As part of the trainin g, staff shall be informed that the staff person who conducts the screening and has caus e to suspect abuse has occurred is legally responsible for reporting. A joint report may be made with the supervisor. Several specific legislative requirements affect THSteps and the provider's participation in Texas Medicaid. The legislation includ es, but is not limited to thos e included in this appendix.CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 239 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

H EARING SCREENING INFORMATION E.1 Texas Early Hearing Detect ion and Intervention (TEHDI) Process The following processes for early hearing detection and intervention are addressed in this section: Birth screen Outpatient rescreen Evaluation using Texas Pedi atric Protocol for Audiology Referral to an Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) program Periodic monitoring by the physician or medical home Refer to: The 1-3-6 Month Practitioner's Guide on the DSHS website. E.1.1 Birth Screen The hearing screen at birth will be either screening auditory brainstem response (ABR) or transient or distortion product otoacoustic ons (OAE). The foll owing items apply: A newborn's hearing is screened at the birth facili ty. If a newborn does not pass the screen, hearing is rescreened before discharge. The birth facility reports results to the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) using the web- based eScreener Plus (eSP) system. The newborn's family and physician/medical home receive a written report of the hearing screen outcome. If a newborn passes the screen, the physician moni tors hearing as part of well child checkups. If a newborn does not pass the second screen, a re ferral is made to a local resource who is experi- enced with the pediatric population for outpatient rescreen. E.1.2 Outpatient Rescreen If an outpatient rescreen is necessary, either AB R or OAE will be used. The following items apply: The physician/medical home receives the written report of results from the birth facility. The screener/physician reports results to the DS HS contractor, OZ System s, using the web-based eSP system, by calling 1-866-427-5768 or faxing 1-817-385-3939. If the newborn passes the outpatient rescreen, the ph ysician monitors hearing as part of well child checkups. If a newborn does not pass the outpatient rescreen, a referral is made to an audiologist for evaluation using the Texas Pediatric Protocol for Evaluation. Visit www.dshs.texas.gov/tehdi for more information. Hearing services for clients who are birth through 20 years of age are administered through the Texas Medicaid hearing services benefit. Clients may use the Online Provider Lookup (OPL) to locate a Texas Medicaid provider who provides hearing services for children (clients who are birth through 20 years of age).CHILDREN'S SERVICES HANDBOOK FEBRUARY 2023 240 CPT ONLY - COPYRIGHT 2022 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.E.1.3 Evaluation using Texas Pediatric Protocol for Audiology These evaluations will include a diagnostic ABR and, if not previously done, a diagnostic OAE will be performed to determine cochlear involvement. The following items apply: Audiologists use equipment norms fo r newborns, preferably ones that they have collected on their equipment. Protocols include air and bone cond uction testing using tone burst ABR, as well as click ABR, so the amplification may be appropriately fit. The physician/medical home receives results an d makes the referral to ECI using the web-based eSP system or by using the ECI program search web page at citysearch.hhsc.state.tx.us . The physician/medical home monitors the child. See the Journal of Early Hearing Detection and Intervention 2019 Position Statement at \"Year 2019 JCIH Position Statement\" (usu.edu) . The audiologist reports results to the DSHS contra ctor as noted above and makes the referral to ECI. Fitting of hearing aids by an audiologist when appropriate. Continued audiological assessment and monitoring as needed (usually monitor each three months for the first year of hearing aid use). E.1.4 Referral to an ECI Program The client will be referred to an EC I program by an audiologist or physician as soon as possible, but no longer than 7 days of identification of hearing loss as required by law. The following items apply: Service coordination provided by ECI. ECI will refer to the Local Educ ation Agency (LEA) for auditory impairment (AI) services as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding between TEA and HHS ECI. An evaluation and Individual Family Service Plan (I FSP) will occur within 45 days of referral to ECI. ECI services are available to clients birth through 35 months of age when determined by an IFSP. ECI and LEA will coordinate transition services upon the child's third birthday. E.1.5 Periodic Monitoring by the Physician or Medical Home The physician/medical home will continue to monitor the client periodically and may consult or use the following: Providers may refer to the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) 2007 Position Statement for suggested monitoring protocols at publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/120/4/898/71218/Year- 2007-Position-Statement-Principles -and?autologincheck=redirected .
