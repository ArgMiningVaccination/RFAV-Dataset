PERMISSION The agreement of parent(s) or guardian to the participation of their child or ward in research. PHARMACOLOGY The scientific disci pline that studies the action of drugs on living systems (animals or human beings). PHASE 1 TRIALS Includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. These studies are typically conducted with healthy volunteers; sometimes, where the drug is intended for use in patients with a particular disease, however, such patients may participate as subjects. Phase 1 trials are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacological actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associate d with increasing doses (to establish a safe dose range), and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness; they are typically closely monitored. The ultimate goal of Phase 1 trials is to obtain sufficient information about the drug's pharmacokin etics and pharmacological effects to permit the design of well -controlled, sufficiently valid Phase 2 studies. Other examples of Phase 1 9/24/2018 studies include studies of drug metabolism, structure - activity relationships, and mechanisms of actions in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of subjects involved in Phase 1 investigations is generally in the range of 20 -80. PHASE 1, 2, 3, 4 DRUG TRIA LS Different stages of testing drugs in humans, from first application in humans (Phase 1) through limited and broad clinical tests (Phases 2 and 3), to post - marketing studies (Phase 4). PHASE 2 TRIALS Includes controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the drug's effectiveness for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to determine the common short - term side effects and risks associated with the drug. These studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted with a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. PHASE 3 TRIALS Involves the administration of a new drug to a larger number of patients in different clinical settings to determi ne its safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosage. They are performed after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather necessary additional information about effectiveness and safety for evaluating the overall benefi t-risk relationship of the drug, and to provide and adequate basis for physician labeling. In Phase 3 studies, the drug is used the way it would be administered when marketed. When these studies are completed and the sponsor believes that the drug is saf e and effective under specific conditions, the sponsor applies to the FDA for approval to market the drug. Phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand patient -subjects. PHASE 4 TRIALS Studies conducted after a drug has been approve d by FDA, to delineate additional information about the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. These studies could include, but would not be limited to, studying different doses or schedules of administration than were used in Phase 2 studies, use of th e drug in other patient populations or other stages of the disease, or use of the drug over a longer period of time.

POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTHCARE A type of advance directive executed by a competent adult that appoints another individual to make medical treatment decisions on his or her behalf in the event that the person making the appointment loses decision -making cap acity. The appointed surrogate is often referred to as the patient advocate, patient proxy, patient representative, or health care agent. The laws of Wisconsin governing the authority of this individual in research is silent. Also known as a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care. PRACTICABLE Capable of being effected, done or put into practice; feasible. Useable for a specified purpose. PREGNANCY The period of time from confirmation of implantation of a fertilized egg within the uterus until the fe tus has entirely left the uterus ( i.e., has been delivered). Implantation is confirmed through a presumptive sign of pregnancy such as missed menses or a positive pregnancy test. This \"confirmation\" may be in error, but, for research purposes, investigat ors would presume that a living fetus was present until evidence to the contrary was clear. Although fertilization occurs a week or more before implantation, the current inability to detect the fertilization event or the presence of a newly fertilized egg makes a definition of pregnancy based on implantation necessary. PRE -MARKET APPROVAL Process of scientific and regulatory review by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices.

RESEARCH INTERMEDIARY The research intermediary meets with subjects in order to confirm that subjects understand the scope of the rese arch as well as any risks and/or benefits to the subject. The research intermediary visits regularly with subjects to determine if they truly 9/24/2018 understand the research study in which they are considering taking part, how they will participate and what subjec ts expect from the experience. The intermediary seeks the answers to questions posed by the subjects, addresses any concerns they might have and confirms that they, in fact, want to take part in the study. The intermediary reminds subjects that they may ch ange their minds about participating in the research at any time. RESEARCH MISCONDUCT Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Research misconduct does not include hones t error or differences of opinion. RESEARCH STUDY Any activity designed to test a hypothesis and permit conclusions to be drawn to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. RESEARCH SUBJECT PROTECTION PROGRAM (RSPP) The administrative support unit within AHC for the IO and any appointed IRBs. **As defined by Aurora System Policy. RESPECT FOR PERSONS An ethical principle discussed in the Belmont Report requiring that individual autonomy be respected and that persons with diminished autonomy be protected. RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES Research conducted by reviewing records from the past ( e.g., birth and death certificates, medical records, school records, or employment records) or by obtaining information about past events elicited through interviews or surveys. REVIEW [OF RESEARCH] The concurrent oversight of research on a periodic basis by an IRB. In addition to the at least annual reviews mandated by the federal regulations, reviews may, if deemed appropriate, also be conducted on a continuous o r periodic basis. RIC See: Research Integrity Committee RISK The probability of harm or injury (physical, psychological, social, or economic) occurring as a result of participation in a research study. Both the probability and magnitude of possible harm may vary from minimal to significant. Federal regulations define only \"minimal risk.\" (See also : Minimal Risk. ) RSPP See: Research Subject Protection Program RSPP MANAGER The manager of the RSPP program that serves as the Human Protections Administr ator as required by OHRP. 9/24/2018 SAFETY REPORT A written report drafted by a sponsor which notifies the FDA and all participating investigators of: (1) any adverse experience associated with the use of an investigation drug that is both serious and unexpected; or (2) any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. The sponsor must make each notification as soon as possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the inf ormation. An example is a Medwatch report for investigational drugs. SCREEN FAILURE Subjects who have signed a consent form, but did not meet eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. SECONDARY RESEARCH Involves the summary, analysis, and/or collation of existing research rather than primary research, in which data are collected from, for example, research subjects or experiments. SENSITIVE INFORMATION [HIPAA] With regard to HIPAA, PHI that specifically relates to: (i) treatment for mental health, deve lopmental disabilities, alcohol and drug abuse; or (ii) treatment of an illness related to, or testing for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (\"HIV\"). SERIOUS ADVERSE DRUG EXPERIENCE Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that res ults in a subject experiencing any of the following outcomes: death; a life threatening adverse drug experience; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital anom aly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize a subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsi ons that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT Any incident involving an Investigational Drug or Investigational Device which: (1) with r espect to an Investigational Drug, is both a Serious Adverse Drug Experience and an Unexpected Adverse Drug Experience; or (2) with respect to an Investigational 9/24/2018 SERIOUS ADVERSE SUBJECT EVENT Device, is an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect. Any Adverse Subject Event temporally associ ated with the subject's participation in research that results in death, is life-threatening (places the subject in immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred), results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect , or, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject 's health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition SHORT FORM CONSENT DOCUMENT The federal regulations [\u00a746.117(b)(2)] permit oral presentation of informed consent information in conjunction with a short form written consent document (stating that the elements of c onsent have been presented orally) and a written summary of what is presented orally. A witness to the oral presentation is required, and the subject must be given copies of the short form document and the summary. When this procedure is used with subjects who do not speak English, (i) the oral presentation and the short form written document (see sample attached) should be in a language understandable to the subject; (ii) the IRB -approved English language informed consent document may serve as the summary; and (iii) the witness should be fluent in both English and the language of the subject. SIGNIFICANT INTEREST (as defined by COI Smart) A financial or non -financial interest that primarily falls into the following six categories: (1) salary paid by anothe r entity; (2) equity interest; (3) intellectual property; (4) paid or unpaid position of authority or influence; (5) relationships with immediate family members or other individuals; (6) travel or other expenses paid by another entity. SIGNIFICANT RISK DEVICE An investigational medical device that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the subject. SIGNIFICANT NEW FINDING Significant new information to be submitted to the IRB including: reports generated from a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), annual reports from sponsors, revised Investigator's 9/24/2018 Brochures/Device Manuals, current literature, and other sources to ascertain the status of the study. SINGLE -BLIND DESIGN Typically, a study design in which the Investig ator, but not the subject, knows the identity of the treatment assignment. Occasionally the subject, but not the Investigator, knows the assignment. SINGLE IRB REVIEW A legal arrangement that allows one IRB to review the research on behalf of other eng aged institutions SINGLE PATIENT USE This occurs when a medical practitioner obtains an investigational drug for a single, identified patient who: (1) is not enrolled in a research study; (2) is in a desperate situation and (3) is unresponsive to other therapies or in a situation where no approved or generally recognized treatment is available. SITE ADMINISTRATOR An individual with administrative responsibility for a particular facility or facilities. SITE VISIT A visit by agency officials, representati ves, or consultants to the location of a research activity to assess the adequacy of IRB protection of human subjects or the capability of personnel to conduct the research. SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH (SBR) Refers broadly to research that deals with human attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Biomedical and clinical researchers sometimes incorporate SBR questions and methodologies into their physiological research. SBR is characterized by data collection methods, such as: Questionnaires Interviews Focus grou ps Direct or subject observation Non-invasive physical measurements SOP See: Standard Operating Procedure SPONSOR A person or an entity that initiates a research study, but does not actually conduct the investigation, i.e., the investigational drug or in vestigational device is administered or dispensed to, or used in connection with, a subject under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct a research study that it has initiated is considered to be a sponsor (not a sponsor - investigation) and the employees are considered to be investigators. An Investigator may, however, serve as a Sponsor -Investigator. SPONSOR - An individual who both initiates and a ctually 9/24/2018 INVESTIGATOR conducts, alone or with others, a clinical investigation. Corporations, agencies, or other institutions do not qualify as Sponsor -Investigators. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) The policies and procedures that govern the Aurora IRB. STATISTI CAL SIGNIFICANCE A determination of the probability of obtaining the particular distribution of the data on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Or, more simply put, the probability of coming to a false positive conclusion. If the probability is less than or equal to a predetermined value ( e.g., 0.05 or 0.01), then the null hypothesis is rejected at that significance level (0.05 or 0.01). SUBJECT See: Human Subject. SUBMITTED The status of a research study that has been given to the Aurora IRB for review by an investigator but has not yet received the final approval of the Aurora IRB. SURROGATE DECISION MAKERS [SOP 702] The following individuals are considered surrogate decision makers (\"surrogate(s)\") according to Aurora IRB policy: spou se or domestic partner (as defined in Aurora Health Care System Administrative Policy #151); adult children; parents; adult siblings; and/or other close relatives or friends who are aware of the prospective research subject's values and likely preferences concerning research participation. SURVEYS Studies designed to obtain information from a large number of respondents through written questionnaires, telephone interviews, door -to-door canvassing, or similar procedures. SUSPENSION A \"for -cause\" temporary withdrawal of IRB approval of research activities. The IRB is required to report this action to OHRP, FDA, and other federal agencies as indicated. SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION An activity that involves a prospectively identified approach and that incorporate s data collection and either quantitative or qualitative data analysis to answer a question or draw conclusions. **As defined by Aurora System Policy. TERMINATION A \"for -cause\" withdrawal of IRB approval of a study. The IRB is required to report this acti on to OHRP, FDA, and other federal agencies as indicated. TEST ARTICLE Any drug (including a biological product for human use), medical device for human use, or any other article subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. 9/24/2018 THERAPEUTIC INTE NT The research physician's intent to provide some benefit to improving a subject's condition ( e.g., prolongation of life, shrinkage of tumor, or improved quality of life, even though cure or dramatic improvement cannot necessarily be effected.) This term is sometimes associated with Phase 1 drug studies in which potentially toxic drugs are given to an individual with the hope of inducing some improvement in the patient's condition as well as assessing the safety and pharmacology of a drug. THERAPY Treatm ent intended and expected to alleviate a disease or disorder. TISSUE SAMPLE Samples of skin, heart valves, musculoskeletal tissue, such as bone, cartilage, ligaments and tendon, along with blood, saliva, and other tissues or body fluids. TREATMENT IND A limited research study that is added to an existing IND application. The FDA will issue a Treatment IND if: (1) the drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life -threatening disease; (2) there is no satisfactory alternative treatment available; (3) the drug is already under investigation, or research studies have been completed; and (4) the sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. TREATMENT IDE A limited research study that is added to an existing IDE application. The FDA will consider use of an investigational device under a treatment IDE if: (1) the device is intended to treat a serious or immediately life -threatening disease; (2) there is no satisfactory alternative treatment available; (3) the device is already under investigation, or research studies have been completed; and (4) the sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated wit h, an investigational device if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that re lates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM Any incident, experience, or outcome that is (1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures described in the protocol and related documen ts and the characteristics of the population being studied, or has occurred beyond the expected frequency and/or 9/24/2018 severity previously identified ; (2) related or possibly related to the participation in the research. For example, exposure of a technician to increased levels of radiation due to a malfunctioning investigational imaging device would be an Unanticipated Problem . The IRB would review the report of such event as a possible UPIRSO [Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others] if it in volves increased risk to subjects or others. UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS INVOLVING RISK TO SUBJECTS OR OTHERS (UPIRSO) Any incident, experience, or outcome that is (1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures descri bed in the protocol and related documents and the characteristics of the population being studied; (2) related or possibly related to the participation in the research; and (3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. \"Others\" may include subjects' family members, health care providers, and research staff. For example, exposure of a technician to increased levels of radiation due to a malfunctioning investigational imaging device would be an Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others. UNEXPECTED ADVERSE DRUG EXPERIENCE Any adverse experience with an investigational drug that is not identified in nat ure, severity, or frequency in the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required, that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the risk information described in the general investigational plan. UNEXPECTED [Per Aurora IRB Immediate Reporting policy (SOP 403)] The specificity and severity are not accurately reflected in the information previously submitted to the IRB (e.g. protocol and/or informed consent document). [Note an event is considered \"unexpected\" i f it is described with specificity within the documents previously provided to the IRB, but has occurred beyond the expected frequency and/or severity identified.] UPIRSO See \"Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others\" US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN The department of the executive branch of the federal government responsible for the federal health 9/24/2018 SERVICES (DHHS) programs in the civilian sector. USE [HIPAA ] Per Aurora system policy 140 and HIPAA regulations , the sharing, employment, a pplication, utilization, examination or analysis of PHI within an entity that maintains such information. In the research context, this includes the viewing (e.g. from the electronic medical record ( eMR )), collecting and/or analyzing of identifiable . VACC INE A biologic product generally made from an infectious agent or its components \u2014 a virus, bacterium, or other microorganism \u2014 that is killed (inactive) or live -attenuated (active, although weakened). Vaccines may also be biochemically synthesized or mad e through recombinant DNA techniques. VARIABLE An element or factor that the research is designed to study, either as an experimental intervention or a possible outcome (or factor affecting the outcome) of that intervention. VIABLE INFANT When referring to a delivered or expelled fetus, the term \"viable infant\" means likely to survive to the point of sustaining life independently, given the benefit of available medical therapy. This judgment is made by a physician. In accordance with DHHS regulations, t he Secretary, HHS, may publish guidelines to assist in the determination of viability. Such guidelines were published in 1975, and specify an estimated gestational age of 20 weeks or more and a body weight of 500 grams or more as indices of fetal viabilit y. These indices depend on the state of present technology and may be revised periodically. (See also: Nonviable Fetus .) VICE CHAIRPERSON The Vice Chairperson of an Aurora IRB. VIOLATION See: Protocol Violation . VOLUNTARY Free of coercion, duress, o r undue inducement. Used in the research context to refer to a subject's decision to participate (or to continue to participate) in a research activity. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS Subjects such as children, prisoners, individuals with impared decision -making capacity , or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons who are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. VULNERABLE SUBJECTS Individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectatio n, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory 9/24/2018 response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples are members of a group with a hierarchical structure, such as medical, pharmacy, dental, and nursing students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the pharmaceutical industry, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention. Other vulnerable subjects include patients with incurable diseases, pe rsons in nursing homes, unemployed or impoverished persons, patients in emergency situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, minors, and those incapable of giving consent. WAIVER OF AUTHORIZATION The documentation that the cov ered entity obtains from a researcher or a Privacy Board that states that the Privacy Board has waived or altered the Privacy's Rule's requirement that an individual must authorize a covered entity to use or disclose the individual's PHI for research purpo ses. WAIVER OF CONSENT An IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include, or which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in this section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed consent provided the IRB finds and documents that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiv er or alteration; and (4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. WAIVER OF DOCUMENTATION OF CONSENT An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent fo rm for some or all subjects if it finds either: (1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be aske d whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; or (2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is n ormally required outside of the research context. 9/24/2018 WARD A minor or incompetent person placed under the care or protection of a guardian or court. WASHOUT A period of time in which subjects are not receiving an intervention and/or treatment for the indicat ion under investigation and the effects of a previous treatment are eliminated. Washout periods are sometimes required or allowed (per the protocol) before the screening process to help determine eligibility. WITHDRAWN 1) The status of a research study with the Aurora IRB. The study has been submitted to the IRB office (it may have even been reviewed by the IRB), however the investigator has requested that the study be removed from IRB consideration. If the approval letter has not been issued for the study, a written request from the investigator will be filed in the study file, and the \"withdrawn\" designation entered into Pro IRB. WITNESS See: Impartial Third Party Witness WRITTEN OR IN WRITING Writing on a tangible medium (e.g., paper) or in an electro nic format. "}
