Acupuncture can help to improve blood flow throughout your body, which boosts the oxygenation of the tissues. At River Oak Veterinary Hospital, we work with Dr. Lindsay Croom to provide acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapies in order to restore your pet's health and vitality. Dr. Croom has been certified in Veterinary Acupuncture since 2002. The Acupuncture Technique Acupuncture treatment involves the insertion of miniscule needles into your pet's body at precise locations called meridians. This is where the blood vessels and nerves converge. These needles guide energy along these meridians, supporting your pet's nervous system, promoting circulation and enhancing their body's natural healing abilities. Common Acupuncture Uses Our vets will often recommend using acupuncture provided by Dr. Croom for a wide variety of issues, including: [Pain Management](#) Medical treatment like chemotherapy can cause quite a bit of discomfort for your pet.
