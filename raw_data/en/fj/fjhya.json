In this article, we will explore one of them - namely the prickly business of acupuncture.", "sitename": null, "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "What is acupuncture? During the treatment, the practitioner inserts thin sterilised needles into specific points in the patient's body. This is done carefully after an initial consultation, which also includes a skilled measuring of the client's pulse. The needles stay in for a period of a minimum of 7 to a maximum of 45 minutes. During this time, the practitioner might also slightly vibrate or twist the needles either manually or with a special device and incorporate heat treatment. Generally, this should not be a painful process; however, some points might feel quite sensitive. Some practitioners finish the session with additional massage, reiki, sound healing, prayer, or a combination of body and energy healing modalities. Depending on the school, there are believed to be 361 to around 2000 acupoints on the body, mostly located along the 12 body meridians. Meridians are pathways in the body connecting to specific organs where the vital energy flows. The needles help release blockages and direct the energy flow to facilitate self-healing and natural balance. What are the benefits of acupuncture? Although there is no official scientific consensus and proof that acupuncture works or that acupoints and meridians actually exist, there is plenty of research published proving otherwise. Acupuncture is believed and proven to relieve pain and alleviate various physical, mental, and emotional issues. It is claimed to reduce stress, improve the immune system, enhance overall well-being, help with allergies, addictive habits, hormonal imbalances, digestive issues, and so on... But then again, once you start taking better care of yourself no matter how the beautiful, beneficial domino effect of healing with all its gore and glory is activated and you are on the journey to self-love through self-care and wholeness... What are the side effects of acupuncture? As with any treatment, there may be complications and reactions. These might be due to an unskilled practitioner, using non-sterile needles or your body going through a healing crisis. Therefore, it is essential to check your practitioners' credentials and recommendations as well as simply trust your gut feeling when choosing healers to work with your body and energy field. As mentioned before, usually, you'll feel relaxed and need to stay extra hydrated a day or two after the session. In very rare cases, you might feel a lot worse before you'll feel better. This may be because of sensitivity, extreme internal imbalance, or due to toxicity. For women, unless working on specific issues, it is not recommended to have acupuncture treatments during their period. For most women, the days just before might be more uncomfortable as well because of possible overall heightened sensitivity. Where to find acupuncture in Bali?

Summary of the Author's Experience I have had acupuncture treatments previously in Australia at my local TCM clinic on the Gold Coast and a private Acupuncture and Craniosacral therapist for managing periods of high-stress and emotional overwhelm as well as support for physical ailments relating to lungs and liver. I have also attended a sound healing / meditation journey where acupuncture needles were an optional addition to be inserted in the navel and heart area. I guess the sound waves served as the vibration that particular time... The results have been different levels of relaxation and deep peace. In Bali, I stumbled on Anto Ghi (WhatsApp +62 819 3623 1759) when visiting a friend who had his treatment at home. She seemed transcendental, so I decided to give it a go. Anto is knowledgeable with years of experience and a warm yet focused presence, willing to patiently answer all TCM questions. He finishes the session with one of those excruciating Bali massages you need to surrender and breathe through but feel amazing afterward. From the first session, I needed to recover for four days. I had an intense physical reaction, and I did not feel blissfully peaceful and serene at all. I embraced my painful, debilitating experience, slowed down, and had a good serve of humility and gratitude. And gave it another go a few weeks later. Ahhhh that one finally gave me the bliss and balance results I was graving... In conclusion, acupuncture is a widely practiced and powerful alternative healing modality here in Bali. As with everything else in life, you get to choose whether this is something you need to experience or not, but I can highly recommend to give it a try. "}
