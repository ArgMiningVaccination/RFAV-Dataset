If you need care right away, go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Most hospitals must treat you during a medical emergency, even if you cannot pay. Doctors and hospitals should not ask about your immigration status. Many doctors and hospitals may ask for a social security number. You do not need to give a social security number to doctors or private insurers. Some government programs, such as Medicare , can require a social security number. Virginia does not report anyone to immigration for submitting an application to or receiving services through Medicaid, FAMIS MOMS, FAMIS Plus or FAMIS. What is health? Health in your country may incl ude body, mind and spirit (espirit\u00fa). You may think of these as being together. Good health may mean th at you are in balance.

To do this, it is best to complete Advance Directives (living will). It is better to write these, but you do not have to do so. You may say what you want in front of a kind of witness. Advance Directives have two parts: A. You have a right to determine what care you want when you will not recover. To legally tell you doctor what care he may (o r may not) give you when you will not recover: Complete Advance Directives (also called a living will). This lets you tell the doctor several things about care: Whether you want care that may help you liv e as long as possible, even though you will not recover. You may want some kinds of care and not others. Examples : Food and water through a tube Machine that breathes for you Other medical or surgical care That you do not want care to live longer Example: DNR (Do not resuscitate): This tells the docto r or hospital not to help if your heart stops How comfortable you want to be Example: To be as comfortable as possible Hospice care It is important that you discuss your c hoices with your family and your doctor. B. You have a right to state who will make decisions for you if or when you cannot. There are three names for this part of the Directive: Medical power of attorney 5 Durable power of attorney for health care Health care proxy For any of these, you may state that: The person you name makes all decisions about your care The person you name makes only those decisions you list Durable power of attorney allows the pers on you name to make additional decisions: The person you name may make any decisions you want, whether or not you are dying. You do not have to make Advance Directives. Virginia law lists people who can make d ecisions for you if you do not have Advance Directives. This may be a guardian or family member.
