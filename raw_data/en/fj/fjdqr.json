Camu Camu](http://www.acupunctureinwestchase.com/blog/index.php/2013/12/megadosing-vitamin-cold-option/) [So, it's that time of year when people get run down and start catching those colds and flus. I wrote a couple of weeks ago about preventing the flu and stopping those immune busting behaviors. Hopefully you are trying to utilize some of those! However, I'm hearing a lot about people using Emergen C packets to prevent colds and flus. I have some people tell me that they pound 3-5 packets a day! Aside from 5 packets a day possibly sending you to the bathroom all day, I have another problem with this, or 2 or 3!](http://www.acupunctureinwestchase.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/emergencpink.png) First off, this is a synthetic vitamin C along with other synthetic vitamins. I'm not a big fan. If you need to boost your diet with added nutrients, then whole food supplements are the best way to go. Don't stress your body and liver with a ton of synthetic vitamins. Secondly, these are highly acidic to the body. An acidic body is the opposite of a healthy body. The more alkaline leaning the body, the healthier it is, period. So, if your immune system is struggling, don't stress it more. Third, have you looked at the ingredients in these packets? The \"Pink\" one to support breast cancer contains caramel color which is a carcinogen. They all contain Fructose, which is the sugar that goes to your liver to be processed. This leads to metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and affects your lipid profile and triglycerides. Best to keep fructose to a minimum and only consume it in natural fruits. I'm also not a big fan of \"natural flavors,\" maltodextrin or silica. These are far from real foods. Check out a couple of ingredient samples on some of the popular packets for yourself. Emergen-C Pink Vitamin C Energy Booster 1000 mg: Other Ingredients: Fructose, citric acid, malic acid, vegetable juice color, natural flavors, maltodextrin, raspberry juice powder, silica, tartaric acid, caramel color, extract), glycine aspartic and cysteine hydrochloride. Emergen-C Vitamin C Energy Booster Tangerine 1000 mg : Other Ingredients: Fructose, citric acid, natural flavors, cranberry juice powder, fruit and vegetable juice colors, pomegranate juice powder, tapioca maltodextrin, malic acid, [Don't despair though! I have a whole food supplement/Superfood to the rescue. If you feel like you need a boost of Vitamin C, try Camu Camu. It is a berry used by the indigenous Amazonian people. Camu Camu is known for its high Vitamin C content. In fact, just 1 teaspoon of Camu Camu powder contains 700% of your daily need for Vitamin C. It has more than 30 times the amount of Vitamin C found in oranges.](http://www.acupunctureinwestchase.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/camucamu-self1.jpg) According to Sunfood, where I get the powdered Camu Camu for all of you, \"The Camu Camu berry (Myciaria dubia) is picked in season, then dried and powdered turning this purplish-red, cherry-like fruit to a light beige color. The Indigenous Amazonian traditionally use it as a medicinal herb improving the bodily functions of the brain, eyes, heart, lungs, liver and skin. It is believed to help ward off the common cold, influenza and other viral diseases, various health conditions such as asthma, edema and heart disease, support strong collagen, tendons and ligaments, decrease inflammation, and help deal with stress and anxiety. \" Ok then, who couldn't use a little of this?! The ingredients on the Camu Camu reads: Certified Organic Camu Camu. That's it. No added flavors, fillers, flow agents or acidic additives. Just a super dose of vitamin C along with B vitamins, potassium and antioxidants that are naturally found in the berries. It can be added to juice or smoothies. It adds a bit of a tang so it works nicely in green juices and smoothies. But if you're in a hurry just add some to grapefruit juice and go. It couldn't be easier. If you want to give it a go just give me a call and I'll send it out to you or stop by the office to pick up a bag. "}
