Keywords Introduction 3D primary cell tumor models have received renewed recognition due to their ability to better mimic the complexity of in vivo tumors and as a potential bridge between traditional 2D culture and in vivo studies. 3-Dimensional (3D) cancer models have become an essential tool for the evaluation of new chemotherapeutics to fight cancer, yet automated drug screening assays using these models remains challenging for drug discovery. Advances by our group and others have enabled the screening of cancer 3D models in a rapid, highly miniaturized, and cost-effective fashion that permits direct compound response profiling to be generated in a phenotypic manner [ ]. 3D ex vivo tumor models are believed to better recapitulate the features of the disease such as cell interactions, hypoxia, and phenotypic heterogeneity of the cancer tissue and drug response [ [[1]](#bib0001) - Hou S. - Tiriac H. - Sridharan B.P. - Scampavia L. - Madoux F. - Seldin J. - Souza G.R. - Watson D. - Tuveson D. - Spicer T.P.

Patient tumor derived organoids models can be generated from minimal amounts of primary tissue and can be used as models for 3D high-throughput screening (HTS). To effectively deploy 3D models for HTS there are generally two essential requirements: to produce the required amount of spheroids, and to yield acceptable assay performance [ [4](#) - Longati P. - Jia X. - Eimer J. - Wagman A. - Witt M.-R. - Rehnmark S. - Verbeke - L\u00f6hr M. - spheroids induce a matrix-rich, chemoresistant phenotype offering a better model for drug testing.

Although, we have extensively explored both methods, there are limitations and associated costs to these technologies that still play a key factor in the decision to pursue 3D research into high throughput environments. The ability to move rapidly into affordable, scaffold free systems for HTS is a top priority for our current research efforts [ [[5]](#bib0005) - Madoux F. - Tanner A. - Vessels M. - Willetts L. - Hou S. - Scampavia L. - Spicer T.P. A 1536-well 3D viability assay to assess on spheroids. SLAS Discov. 2017; 22: 516-524 ]. Vast improvements in 3D cell culture technologies make them much more cost effective and efficient largely because of the use of a cell-repellent surfaces and a novel angle plate adaptor technology. To explore other methods, we developed a reliable cost effective and efficient method to form spheroids. The design was created in collaboration with Greiner BioOne using an in-house 3D printer to create an angle plate adapter. By combining the use of a cell-repellent surface and this angle plate adaptor technology, we were able to facilitate the formation of 3D cultures in a scaffold free system that is uHTS compatible. This new method was well validated, side by side, with other available methods which include the micro cavity ultra-low attachment surface plates from Corning and the magnetic bioprinting technology from Greiner BioOne, both of which we have used extensively before [ [[8]](#bib0008) - Rao S.R. - Kostic A. - Baillargeon P. - Fernandez-Vega V. - de Anda M.R. - Fletcher K. - Shumate J. - Scampavia - Buxbaum J.D. - Spicer T.P.

Advanced development of primary pancreatic phenotypic drug screening. SLAS Discov. 2018; 2472555218766842 As part of this effort, we focused on a panel of ten non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and accounts for 84% of all lung cancer cases. NSCLC remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated death, with a 5-year survival rate less than 25%. This type of cancer begins with healthy cells that change and start growing out of control, leading to the formation of lesions or tumors. Understanding the dynamics of how the tumor microenvironment promotes cancer initiation and progression that leads to cancer metastasis is crucial to help identify new molecular therapies. Previous research demonstrated KRAS dependency in the context of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines and the confirmation of culture-dependent effects of KRAS across monolayer vs. 3D spheroids [ ]. The methods described here concur that 3D cultures models more appropriately mimic the complexity of the in vivo tumors [ [[9]](#bib0009) - Janes M.R. - Zhang J. - Li L.S. - Hansen R. - Peters U. - Guo X. - Chen Y. - Babbar A. - Firdaus S.J. - Darjania L. - Feng J. - Chen J.H. - Li S. - Li S. - Long Y.O. - Thach C. - Liu Y. - Zarieh A. - Ely T. - Kucharski J.M. - Kessler L.V. - Wu T. - Yu K. - Wang Y. - Yao Y. - Deng X. - Zarrinkar P.P. - Brehmer D. - Dhanak D. - Lorenzi M.V. - Hu-Lowe D. - Patricelli M.P. - Ren P. - Liu Y.

To that end, the purpose of this study was to identify NPs that inhibit KRAS in a focused subset of NSCLC organoids in 3D format via HTS. We provide evidence that while spheroid cultures traditionally rely on artificial extracellular matrices (ECMs) to facilitate aggregation into 3D models, we were able to conduct HTS screening in a completely scaffold-free system.

Detailed methods and procedures Development of the novel angle adaptor technology This project utilized custom 3D printed plate holders which were designed to allow the plates to be incubated at a 45-degree angle relative to a typical horizontal incubator shelf. An initial single-plate holder design was provided by Greiner Bio-One for testing. This design was iterated upon using Autodesk Fusion 360 (San Rafael, CA), to enable multiple plates to be stacked in a single adapter. All variants of the angled plate holder were designed to provide sufficient room for lidded or unlidded microplates. 1-plate, 2-plate and 5-plate variants of the stack were designed, but the CAD model can be easily adapted to other configurations in order to support desired plate quantities. Prototype components were fabricated with PETG thermoplastic on a Prusa i3 slicer parameters: 100% infill, 0.3mm layer height. Note, while we used these adapters for 1536 well format, they are agnostic to the plate density and should work equally as well in use for 3D modelling in 96 or 384 well plates.

These actinobacterial strains at the Natural Products Discovery Center (NPDC), UF Scripps, totaling 125,127 specimens, were isolated over the last eight decades, many of which can no longer be accessed in their natural environment, making this collection extremely important to human health. Selected members of the NPL utilized for this effort consists of 360 crude extracts, 800 partially purified fractions, and 120 pure NPs that were reformatted in 384-well format and subsequently in 1536-well format that was used for the screening described herein.

The time that takes cells to form organoids and spheroids will depend on their source and the type of cells used. Some cells can form spheroids within 24hrs after the incubation in the angle adaptor while others may require just a few hours and sometimes even days. We noticed that some cells that do not form nice compact spheroids and are more \"organotypic\", meaning their appearance in 3D is more amorphous and less sphere shaped. In some case these lines may benefit form a longer incubation time in the 3D plates or on the angle adaptor. In this case, we will recommend keeping the plates in the angle adaptor during the entire duration of the experiment. Other issues that can be observed are some cells don't aggregate uniformly in the well and can cause the cells to be more spread out. Typically, this doesn't present with variability in phenotypic whole well readouts but can display differently when imaging which should be determined for each cell type/line. Data analysis HTS campaign and data processing A 1,280 subset of the NPL, consisting of the selected crude extracts, partially purified fractions, and pure NPs, was screened a focused panel of 10 cell non-small lung cancer spheroid at a pace of 10 plates per day. Data files were uploaded into the UF Scripps' institutional database for individual plate quality control and hit selection. Assay plates were determined acceptable only if their Z' was > 0.5 [ ]. Compound activity was normalized on a per-plate basis using the following equation: [ [[16]](#bib0016) - Zhang J.-H. - Chung T.D.Y. - Oldenburg K.R.

J Biomol Screening. 2015; 20: 858-868 Test Well refers to those wells with cells treated with test compounds. High Control is defined as wells containing medium only (100% inhibition), and Low Control wells contain cells treated with DMSO only (0% inhibition). The high and low controls were also applied for assay quality evaluation in terms of Z' [ ]. Day to day assay response and stability was assessed using 2 pharmacological control compounds (ARS1620 and Doxorubicin) that we required to be within 3-fold of the expected IC50, on an experiment to experiment basis and across all experiments, for each cell model. A low control-based hit cut-off was used to define active NPs for each assay. This cutoff is calculated as the average percent inhibition of the low control wells plus three times their standard deviation [ [[16]](#bib0016) - Zhang J.-H. - Chung T.D.Y. - Oldenburg K.R.

A rapid phenotypic whole-cell screening approach for the identification of small-molecule inhibitors were prepared as 10-point, 3-fold serial dilutions and tested against 10 non-small lung cancer cell lines described above in 3D format in triplicate using the 50nL pintool and the most concentrated samples of the NPL (estimated at 10 mM at most for the active NPs). For each test of the active NPs, % inhibition was plotted against NP concentration. A four-parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The reported CC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept. The highest concentration tested is unknown due to the nature of these natural products. The pharmacological controls were prepared as 20-point, 3-fold serial dilutions and tested against the panel of NSCLC cells in 3D format in triplicate starting from 10 \u00b5M nominal concentration. For these control compounds, % inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. CC50 values of the control compounds were determined by fitting the concentration response curve data (CRC) with a four-parameter variable slope method in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Results Assay implementation of 3D cell culture in 1536wpf using a novel angle adaptor technology This novel angle adaptor technology was tested in 1536-well format across a panel of 10 different non-small lung cancer cell lines. The original design was only for one plate, but the design can be modified in order to enable multiple plates stacked into the same angle adaptor unit ( [Fig. 1](#gr1)). Using this method allowed us to implement the same phenotypic 3D cell viability approach that was developed and miniaturized in a 1536-well format using the ultra-low attachment spheroid microplates [ ]. This novel technology was tested side by side to the ultra-low attachment method available in 1536 format from Corning and it demonstrated similar results. Bright field images at 24hrs and 96hrs post seeding clearly show the formation of the cells into spheroids ( [[15]](#bib0015) - Hou S. - Tiriac H. - B.P. - Scampavia L. - Madoux F. - Seldin J. - Souza G.R. - Watson D. - Tuveson D. - Spicer T.P. Advanced development of primary pancreatic statistics was comparable and % activity was decent between both methods, despite of the variability that these cultures can show when they are grown in 3D ( [Fig. 2](#gr2)B). The pharmacological controls were also compared between the two technologies and the CC50 values were within 3-fold, which indicates that the angle adaptor provides comparable results to the microcavity geometry plates. ( [Fig. 2](#gr2)C) In order to implement the assay, different cell densities were tested to determine the cell linearity of the assay for each of the cell lines. Different cell densities were seeded into a Greiner 1536 well cell repellent plate ( [Fig. 3](#gr3)A). Once seeded, the plates were incubated on a 45\u00b0 angle device inside the cell culture incubator for 24hrs. This initial device was designed by Greiner and then multi-stack angle devices were created in house with a 3D printer. The angle plate method will aggregate the cells towards the corner of the well to help with the formation of the 3D spheroids in a cell repellent surface plate. Assay statistics were calculated for the different conditions tested and the optimal cell density was selected for the screening based on the linearity and the Z' values ( [Fig. 3](#gr3)B). Images were at intervals of 0hrs, 24hrs and 96hrs post seeding to monitor the aggregation and 3D formation. After 96hrs of incubation, cell viability was measured using a simple 3D Cell Titer Glo luminescence assay. In a separate test to confirm the 3D formation, cells were stained with Hoechst and images were taken using a confocal microscope, which demonstrated the successful formation of 3D spheroids. ( [Fig. 3](#gr3)C) Primary screening of non-small lung cancer spheroid/organoid models using novel angle adaptor technology In this study, we used a novel angle adaptor technology ( [Fig. 1](#gr1)) for testing primary non-small lung cancer cells in a 1536 well microplate formatted in 3D for high throughput screening. Using this 3D angle adaptor technology, disaggregated cells were seeded in cell repellent plates and pre-incubated on the angle adaptor that facilitates the formation of spheroids in the absence of artificial extracellular matrices (ECM). A panel of 10 non-small lung cell lines mostly derived from lung adenocarcinoma disease were used for the screening. To accomplish this, we employed a simple phenotypic assay to measure the cell viability in response to cytotoxic NPs [ ], a process previously implemented for pancreatic organoid performed by Hou et al. [[5]](#bib0005) - Madoux F. - Tanner A. - Vessels M. - Willetts L. - Hou S. - Scampavia L. - Spicer T.P. A 1536-well 3D viability assay to assess on spheroids. SLAS Discov. 2017; 22: 516-524 Initially, the first version of the angle adaptor was designed by Greiner and in collaboration with UF Scripps to test the technology. We were able to create different versions using a simple 3D printer, all of which proved to be compatible for use with these methods ( [Fig. 1](#gr1)). Another important consideration was the HTS concentration of the NPs. Due to their inherent nature, there is no concentration associated. As part of the assay implementation, an assessment was conducted to measure the effect of these NPs by testing different pintool sizes (data not shown). Based on the different parameters tested, we tested each molecule in triplicate using the 10nL pintool which demonstrated the sensitivity needed to identify cytotoxic NPs at a rate that is HTS amenable while not ending up with all NPs showing cytotoxicity. ( [Fig. 4](#gr4)). The assay performance was robust across HTS, yielding an average Z' of 0.79 \u00b1 0.06 and a signal to background of 119.28 \u00b1 9.86 for all ten assays. A summary of the primary screening results is presented in [Table 2](#tbl0002)in which we showed the assay statistics, the hit rate and the activity across the different type of samples of the natural products library tested. Table 2Summary of the 3D HTS and hit rates of the different cell lines vs. NP screening. |NSCLC Cell established high throughput methods [ ] to calculate the cutoff for to determine which hits are considered active for each of the cell lines, a cumulative total of over 1000 hits were found across all 10 cell lines. Most of the hits overlapped between the cell lines. Overall, the extracts and pure compounds showed comparable and higher hit rates (10%), whereas fractions showed lower hit rates (4%) across all 10 cell lines. In addition, two control compounds were used to verify the sensitivity of the assay. Concentration response curves (CRC) of ARS-1620 and Doxorubicin were accessed using the same 3D format for each of the cell lines ( [[20]](#bib0020) - Spicer T. - Fernandez-Vega V. - Chase P. - Scampavia L. - To J. - Dalton J.P. - Da Silva F.L. - Skinner-Adams T.S. - Gardiner D.L. - Trenholme K.R. - Brown C.L. - Ghosh P. - Porubsky - Wang J.L. - Whipple D.A. - Schoenen F.J. - Hodder P. Identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum M18 Aspartyl Aminopeptidase (PfM18AAP) of is a small molecule inhibitor that is highly potent and selective for KRASG12C mutation in vitro and in vivo [ ]. Utilizing, ARS-1620 as a pharmacological control allowed us to confirm the sensitivity against the different cell lines in this study. In order to proceed to dose response assays, a multicomponent score data analysis approach was performed to analyze the data in which both wild type and KRASG12C mutant average % response was compared. A score assessment was applied based on the activity across all cell lines tested to determine which NPs to select for dose response studies. Conducting this deeper analysis between the wild type and mutant hit correlation between the cell lines allowed us to identify 128 NPs which were selected for dose response assays.

Targeting KRAS mutant cancers with a covalent G12C-specific inhibitor. Cell. 2018; 172 (e17): 578-589 Dose response assays The selected 128 top hits were tested in triplicate across the same panel of non-small lung cancer organoids in 3D format using the same angle adapter technology. The assay statistics Z' average data for the 3D dose response data are 0.74 \u00b1 0.10 with a signal to background of 115.52 \u00b1 10.43 for all ten assays. Again, the uncertainty of the highest concentration for the active NPs in the crude extracts and fractions, estimated at 10 mM, make it difficult to report an accurate CC50 values generated from fitted curves. The approach used was based on the percent response and the effect of each NPL hit based on the pintool size. The analysis reported was based on the effect of these NPs and how they behave between the wild type and mutant cell lines. Using this approach, about five hits showed some selectivity towards the cancer cell lines and less activity some of the wild type cells tested which are presented in [Table 3](#tbl0003). Current efforts now consist of selectivity assays to determine the efficacy of these compounds towards the G12C mutant KRAS cell lines and dereplication of the NPL hits to structurally characterized the active NPs. In addition, proliferative/cytotoxicity assays are being performed using normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to determine cytotoxicity associated to normal human cells other than lung.

The limitations for the usage will be the cost of the plates and the space required to place the angle adaptors in the incubators. Another limitation is not the technique itself but, rather will be to generate the amount of cells needed for either 384 well format or 1536-well format depending on the organoids. This technique is a completely scaffold free system that will not require the usage of Matrigel or any other ECM components. For us, it affords a method to screen large libraries using 3D cell culture models with a rapid and reliable approach that facilitates early determination of drug efficacy in cancer models. This technique is cost effective and does not require expensive tools that can be associated with other platforms to create 3D cell cultures models. This protocol is easily accessible to any laboratory and opens the opportunity to be applied to other models of disease in a 3D environment Author contributions Virneliz Fern\u00e1ndez Vega: Assay scientist performing the project and the screening Dong Yang: Natural products chemist who participated in data analysis and selection of the hits Luis Ortiz Jord\u00e1n: Assisted with the cells and the experiments Louis Conway: Scientist in assisting with the data analysis Li Yun Chen: assisted with the cells in the Parker lab Justin Shumate: High throughput engineer supporting the equipment Pierre Baillargeon: High throughput engineer supporting the equipment and the database tools Louis Scampavia: directed the engineering at the HTS facility Christopher Parker: Conceptualized the agenda and provided the cells and help with the data analysis Ben Shen: Conceptualized the project and supplied the natural products used in this study.
