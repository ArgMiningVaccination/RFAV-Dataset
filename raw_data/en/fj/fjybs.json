[Megemont, 177][Hall Cr, 69, 87][Hall, 288-289][Melody, 646][Mella, 78] Tiger's Eye, or Tiger Eye, is a variety of macrocrystalline Quartz known for its remarkable chatoyancy and rich layers of gold and brown color. It is thought to be a pseudomorph of Quartz, formed as layers of Crocidolite, a fibrous blue asbestos, were replaced over time by Chalcedony Quartz while still retaining the original shape of the asbestos fibers. A later theory proposes a simultaneous growth of the minerals through a crack-seal vein-filling process. In either case, iron from the decomposed Crocidolite oxidized to its brown color, and reflection of the light on the random fibers produces the gleaming chatoyancy. [www.gemdat.org][www.mindat.org][Lembo, 335][www.gemselect.com][Fernie, 311] This page is dedicated to the golden brown variety of Tiger's Eye Quartz and its properties.

Falcon's Eye (or Hawk's Eye) - reminiscent of the eye of a bird of prey, this blue-gray to blue-green variety is actually the phase in development of Tiger's Eye before Quartz replacement of Crocidolite has altered to iron oxide, retaining the original gray-blue or green of the asbestos fibers.
