In order to keep our patients and staff safe, we've implemented policies and procedures in accordance with CDC guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19. We have implemented the following procedures for your in-person visit to keep you safe: - All sick patients will be screened per CDC guidelines when scheduling an appointment. - Remote Check-In Available - Patients can use their mobile phones to check in from their vehicle to let staff know they've arrived and will be instructed to enter the building. - Masks - Effective Monday, May 1, 2023, in response to falling community transmission of COVID and Flu, masking will be optional for patients. If you are sick and experiencing symptoms including fever, chills, cough, sneezing and/or fever with a new rash, you will be required to wear a mask. Please note that if a patient prefers to wear a mask, all team members involved in the direct care of that patient will also wear a mask to respect their preferences. In the event the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determines COVID-19 transmission in a county is \"substantial\" (orange) or \"high\" (red), then all employees, patients and visitors over the age of two will be required to wear a mask when entering any of our buildings. - Please refer to any signage before entering the building. - Guest Policy - Other than for minors or patients who meet certain criteria, we ask all patients to come to their visit alone. - We have increased the frequency at which our offices are being cleaned.

Coronavirus is an illness caused by a virus that spreads mainly from prolonged exposure between people who are in close contact with one another, within about 6 feet, and through respiratory droplets from an infected person coughing or sneezing. To help protect yourself, the [CDC recommends](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Rua0CVO97mFgVWEsQ2MQD?domain=cdc.gov) avoiding contact with sick individuals, avoid touching your face, eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, staying home when you're sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and discarding, cleaning frequently touched objects and surfaces, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You should wear a facemask in public and private settings when you are unable to stay more than 6-feet away from people not in your household. Patients with Coronavirus exhibit flu-like symptoms which can include*: | || | *This is not an all-encompassing list; as we learn more about the Coronavirus, new possible symptoms may emerge.

Exposure & Testing If you are experiencing COVID symptoms, please call 845-643-3909 to schedule an appointment. After patients have called the Coronavirus Hotline at 845-643-3909, those with symptoms will be scheduled for a telehealth appointment with a provider who will determine the type of test needed and the appropriate location for testing based on the level of care needed. Crystal Run offers PCR (nasal swab) testing by appointment in Middletown, Monroe, Newburgh, Rock Hill, and West Nyack. We offer testing for patients presenting with symptoms of Coronavirus and pre-procedure testing for patients scheduled for an outpatient procedure. In addition, we have expanded our COVID-19 test availability to include asymptomatic testing. We're also offering patients antibody testing which can offer more information about how long antibodies, and therefore an immune response, last. The antibody test is a simple blood test that can be conducted in a Crystal Run Healthcare lab.
