The success rate for drug development is low; at best, only 1 in 5 candidates that enter human testing will be approved for patients.* This snapshot of the antibiotic pipeline will be updated periodically as products advance or are known to drop out of development.

They will be included in future updates if development resumes: December 2014 review : EDP-788 (Enanta Pharmaceuticals) and TD-1792 (Theravance Biopharma) were removed during the December 2014 review. These drugs were either no longer included in the research and development pipelines on the company website, or there was direct communication from the company regarding the status of the drugs. Additionally, GSK-2696266, which had been removed during the September review, is included in this pipeline again as S-649266, which is being developed by Shionogi. September 2014 review GSK-2696266 and GSK-1322322 (GlaxoSmithKline), ACHN-975 (Achaogen), and LFF571 (Novartis) were removed during the September 2014 review. These drugs were either no longer included in the research and development pipelines on the company website, or there was direct communication from the company regarding the status of the drugs. June 2014 Review : Ceftobiprole\u2014Ceftobiprole, an antibiotic developed by Basilea Pharmaceutica, had been included in our analysis; however, the company announced in June 2014 that it is not pursuing further development in the United States until a partner has been acquired. * Michael Hay et al., \"Clinical Development Success Rates for Investigational Drugs,\" Nature Biotechnology 32, no. 1 (2014): sthash.XLzMLQta.dpuf . Notes 1. Antibiotics listed here include products containing at least one component not approved in the United States previously. All analyses were strictly limited to systemic antibiotics (drugs that work throughout the body) and drugs to treat Clostridium difficile -associated disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited C. difficile as an urgent public health threat in a 2013 report ( Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States , 2013, Sept. 16, 2013, http:/ /www.cdc.gov/ drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ ar-threats-2013-508.pdf ). We also limited this pipeline to drugs with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening infections. Specifically excluded were drugs to treat mycobacterial infections, such as tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex, H. pylori , and biothreat pathogens. Additionally, we excluded biological products, vaccines, and locally acting drugs such as topical, ophthalmic, and inhaled products. Avibactam, a novel beta- lactamase inhibitor, is being studied in combination with three approved antibiotics, and all three were counted for this report as each combination targets a distinct set of pathogens. 2. Based on the most advanced development phase for any indication according to trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov . If no trials were included in clinicaltrials.gov , then the phase listed on the company website or provided directly by the company is noted. Antibiotics that have been approved will remain listed for one year following approval of the initial indication. 3. Based on information provided on the company website or press releases or based on inclusion in citations iv or v below. \"Yes\" in this category means that the antibiotic has potential activity against at least one Gram-negative organism. Examples include the pathogen that causes gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae , which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classified as an urgent public health threat; Gram-negative bacilli such as members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, pneumonia and Escherichia Pseudomonas so-called fastidious Gram-negative bacteria that commonly cause community-acquired respiratory infections. In the next update of this pipeline, this column will be split into two in order to specifically highlight those drugs that meet an unmet medical need\u2014 specifically those that target Gram-negative bacilli resistant to currently available antibiotics. 4. Certain antibiotics intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections can be designated by the Food and Drug Administration as qualified infectious disease products (QIDPs). QIDPs are eligible to receive benefits under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (signed into law as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act), including expedited FDA review and extended exclusivity for approved products. 5. Based on clinical trials currently registered in clinicaltrials.gov and/ or reported QIDP designations unless otherwise noted. Bolded indications are reported QIDP designations.6. Not currently registered on clinicaltrials.gov . Information obtained from the company via a corporate website, press release, and/ or direct communication. 7. Avibactam is a new beta-lactamase inhibitor being tested in conjunction with three individual antibiotics. We list all three combinations here. 8. Approved for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in Taiwan; new drug application submitted in China. 9. Taksta was granted an orphan drug designation for the indication of prosthetic joint infections. 10. Registered in clinicaltrials.gov , but with no current study sites within the United States. 11. Plazomicin received the QIDP designations after the December review, but before this update was published. 12. This licensing deal was announced after the December review, but before this update was published. 13. Phase 2 trials do not currently include any U.S. study sites; however, the company indicated in a December 2012 press release that the trial was based on updated guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
