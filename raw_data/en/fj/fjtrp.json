These extracts contain complex compounds. The essential oils present many previous works, especially in Morocco. The present work is a continuation of chemical study of the essential oils of some mints grown in the Settat Morocco region: Mentha Sitophilus Zeamais. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory using different doses of these oils to evaluate the mortality they cause on the adults of the insects tested. The results of the sensitivity showed that the three essential oils of mint had important insecticidal properties against the pests studied. And as a result, they were able to destroy all the insects at a concentration of 2 l/cm3 for a duration of 24 hours of treatment.
