Analytical performance characteristics. 9.1 Accuracy of measurement: This section should describe both trueness and precision studies. Explanation.- The general term measurement accuracy is currently used to cover both trueness and precision, whereas this term was used in the past to cover only the one component now named trueness. While measurement trueness, affected by systematic error, is normally expressed in terms of bias, measurement precision, affected by random error, is natura lly expressed in terms of standard deviation, Accuracy is affected by a combination of systematic and random effects that contribute as individual components of the total error of measurement. 9.2 Reproducibility: This section should include reproducibility estimates and information about the studies used to estimate, as appropriate, variability between days, runs, sites, lots, operators and instruments. Such variability is also known as \"Intermediate Precision\". Reproducibility data is obtained for instrumentation in conjunction with an appropriate assay. Note 1.- Such studies should include the use of samples that represent the full range of expected analyte (measurand) that can be measured by the test as claimed by the manufacturer. Note 2.- If a recognized standard is used, a declaration/certificate of conformity to the recognized standard along with a summary of the data and conclusions. 10. Analytical sensitivity: This section should include information about the study de sign and results. It should provide a description of specimen type and preparation including matrix, analyte (measurand) levels, and how levels were established. The number of replicates tested at each concentration s hould also be provided as well as a description of the calculation used to determine assay sensitivity. For example: (a) Number of standard deviations above the mean value of the sample without analyte (measurand), commonly referred to as limit of blank (LoB). (b) Lowest concentration distinguishable from zero, based on measurements of samples containing analyte (measurand), commonly referred to as limit of detection (LoD). (c) Lowest concentration at which precision and/or truene ss are within specified criter ia, commonly referred to as limit of quantitation (LoQ). For Class C and D in vitro diagnostic medical devices, detailed information would be provided. 11. Analytical specificity: (i) This section should describe interference and cross reactivity studies to determine the analytical specificity, defined as the ability of a measurement procedure to de tect or measure only the analyte (measurand) to be detected, in the presence of other substances/agents in the sample. (ii) Provide information on the evaluation of potentially interfering and cross reacting substances/agents on the assay. Information should be provided on the substance/agent type and concentration tested, sample type, analyte (measurand) test concentration, and results. (iii) Interferents and cross reacting substances/agents, wh ich vary greatly depending on the assay type and design, could derive from exogenous or endogenous sources such as: (a) substances used for patient treatment (e.g. therapeutic drugs, anticoagulants, etc.); (b) substances ingested by the patient (e.g. over the counter medications, alcohol, vitamins, foods, etc.); (c) substances added during sample preparation (e.g. preservatives, stabilizers); (d) substances encountered in specific specimens type s (e.g. hemoglobin, lipids, bilirubin, proteins); (e) analytes of similar structure (e.g. precursors, metabolites) or medical conditions unrelated to the test condition including specimens negative for the assay but positive for a condition that may mimic the test condition (e.g. for a hepatitis A assay: test specimens ne gative for hepatitis A virus, but positive for hepatitis B virus). Explanation,- Interference studies involve adding the potential interferent to the sample and determining any bias of the test parameter relative to the control sample to which no interferent has been added. 12. Metrological traceability of calibrator and control material values: Where applicable, summarize the information about metrolog ical traceability of values assigned to calibrators and trueness control materials. Include, for example, methods and acceptance criteria for the metrological 188 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [P ART II\u2014S EC. 3(i)] traceability to reference materials and/or reference measurement procedures and a description of value assignment and validation. Precision control materials, used when establishing the reproducibility of a measurement procedure do not require the assessment of metrological traceability to a reference material or a reference method. 13. Measuring range of the assay: This section should include a summary of studies which define the measuring range (linear and non-linear measuring systems) including the limit of detection and describe information on how these were established. This summary should include a description of specimen type, number of samples, number of replicates, and preparation including information on matrix, analyte (meas urand) levels and how levels were established. If applicable, add a description of high dose hook effect and the data supporting the mitigation (e.g. dilution) steps. 14.

The investigator shall provide information about the study verbally and through the patient information sheet, in a language that is non-technical and is understandable by the study subject. The Subject's consent must be obtained in writing using an 'Informed Consent Form'. The patient information sheet as well as the Informed Consent Form shall be approved by the Ethics Committee and furnished to the Central Licensing Authority. Any change in the informed consent documents should be approved by the Ethics Committee and submitted to the Central Licensing Authority before such changes are implemented. (ii) Where a subject is not able to give informed consent (e.g. an unconscious person or a minor or those suffering from severe mental illness or disability), the same may be obtained from a legally acceptable representative. If the subject or his legally acceptable re presentative is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent process wh o must append his signatures to the consent form. Explanation : a legally acceptable representative means a person who is able to give consent or authorise an intervention in the patient as provided by the law in India. \u00b9Hkkx II[k.M 3 (i)\u00ba Hkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k 205 (iii) A checklist of essential elements to be included in the study subject's informed consent document as well as a format for the Informed Consent Form for study Su bjects is given in Table 8 of this schedule. (iv) The informed consent process, in case of vulnerable s ubjects in clinical investigations of an innovative medical device which is not approved anywhere in the world, shall be audio-video recorded. (6) Pilot Clinical Investigation (i) Pilot clinical investigation is defined as those clinical investigations which are used to acquire specific essential information about a device before beginning the pivotal c linical investigation. Pilot clinical investigation is exploratory study which may be conducted in a few numb ers of patients with the di sease or condition being studied before moving to large population and scope that give insight into the performance and safety of a device but cannot provide definitive support for specific mechanistic or therapeutic claims. (ii) The objectives of a pilot clinical investigation typically include assessing feasibility (e.g, preliminary device performance), exploring eligibility criteria and their practical application for pivotal controlled investigation, ascertaining potential harm (preliminary safety evaluations), studying device mechanism, validating a method for determining an outcome measure, using a defined device mechanism to validate a surrogate outcome measure, and evaluating the logistics of pivotal investigation for performance. (iii) If the application is for conduct of clinical investig ation as a part of multi-national clinical development of medical device, the number of sites and the patients as well as justification to conduct such clinical investigation in India shall be provided to the Central Licensing Authority. (7) Pivotal Clinical Investigation: (i) The pivotal clinical investigation is a definitive study in which evidence is gathered to support the safety and effectiveness evaluation of the medical device for its intended use. Pivotal clinical investigation is confirmatory study that may be conducted in large number of patients with disease or condition being studied and scope to provide the effectivene ss and adverse effects. (ii) For investigational medical device which does not have a predicate medical device but has been approved for sale or distribution in any country other than India, pivo tal studies need to be carried out primarily to generate evidence of safety and effectiveness of the medical devi ce in Indian patients when used as recommended in the prescribing information except in cases of investigational medical device classified under class A which shall be governed as per permission of para 6 above. Prior to conduct of pivotal clinical investigation in Indian subjects, the Central Licensing Authority may require making the pilot study data available to assess whether the pilot data is in conformity to the data already generated outside the country. (iii) If the application is for conduct of clinical investigation as part of a Global Clinical Investigation of medical device, the number of sites and patients as well as just ification for undertaking such clinical investigation in India shall be provided to the Central Licensing Authority. (8) Post Marketing Clinical Investigation: Post marketing clinical investigation is the study other than surveillance performed after marketing approval has been given to the medical device in relation to the approved indication. This investigation may not be considered necessary at the time of medical device approval but may be required by the Central Licensing Authority for optimizing the intended use of the medical device. Post Marketing Clinical investigation includes additional drug- device interaction, safety studies, investigation designed to support use under the approved indication e.g. mortality or morbidity studies, etc,. (9) Studies in special populations: The clinical investigation data of the medical device is required to be submitted to support the claim sought to be made for use of medical device in children, pregnant women, nursing women, elderly patients with renal or other organ system failure as given below: (i) Geriatrics: Geriatrics patients can be included in pivotal study (and in pilot study at the sponsor's option) in meaningful numbers, if- (a) the disease intended to be treated is characteristically a disease of aging; or (b) the population to be treated is known to be included in substantial numbers of geriatric patients; or (c) there is specific reason to expect that conditions common in the elderly are likely to be encountered; or (d) the investigational medical device is likely to alter the geriatric patient's response in regard to safety or performance compared with that of non-geriatric patient. (ii) Paediatrics: (a) The timing of pediatric studies in the medical device development program shall depend on the device, the type of disease being treated, safety consideration, an d the safety and effectiveness of available treatment. (b) The medical device expected to be used in children; the performance and safety shall be made in the appropriate age group. When clinical investigation is required to be conducted in children, it is usually 206 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [P ART II\u2014S EC. 3(i)] appropriate to begin with older children before exte nding the investigation to younger children and then infants. (c) If the medical device is predominantly or exclusively used in paediatric patients, clinical investigation data should be generated in paediatric population except for initial safety and performance data, which will usually be obtained in adults unless such initial safety studies in adults would yield little useful information or expose them to inappropriate risk. (d) If the medical device is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases, occurring in both adults and paediatric patients, for which there are currently no or limited therapeutic options, paediatric population may be included in the clinical investigation early , following assessment of initial safety data and reasonable evidence of potential benefit. In circumstances where this is not possible, lack of data has to be justified. (e) If the medical device has a potential for use in paediatric patient, paediatric studies may be conducted. These studies may be initiated at various stages of clinical development or after post-marketing surveillance in adults, if a safety concern exists. In cases where there is limited paediatric data at the time of submission of application, more data in paediatric patients would be expected after marketing authorization for use in children is granted. (f) Paediatric subjects are legally unable to provide written informed consent, and are dependent on their parents or legal guardian to assume responsibility for their participation in clinical investigation. Written informed consent shall be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. However, all paediatric participants shall be informed to the fullest extent possible about th e study in a language and in terms that they are able to understand. Where appropriate, paediatric participants should additionally assent to enroll in the study. Mature minors and adolescents should personally sign and date a separately designed written consent form. Although a participant's wish to withdraw from a study shall be respected, there may be circumstances in therapeutic studies for serious or life-threatening diseases in which, in the opinion of the investigator and parent or legal guardian, the welfare of a pediatric pa tient would be jeopardized by his or her failing to participate in the study. In this situation, continued parental or legal guardian consent will be sufficient to allow participation in the study. (g) For clinical investigations conducted in paediatric population, the reviewing Ethics Committee shall include members who are knowledgeable about pediatric, ethical, clinical and psychosocial issues. (iii) Pregnant or nursing women: (a) Pregnant or nursing women shall be included in clinical investigation only when the medical device is intended for use by pregnant or nursing women or fetuses or nursing infants and where the data generated from women who are not pregnant or nursing, would not be suitable. (b) For medical device intended for use during pregnancy, follow-up data pertaining to a period appropriate for that medical device on the pregnancy, foetus and child will be required. 3. Post Marketing Surveillance: (i) Subsequent to approval of an Investigational medical device, it shall be closely monitored for their clinical safety once they are marketed. The applicants shall furnish Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) in order to,- (a) report all the relevant new information from appropriate sources; (b) relate these data to patient exposure; (c) summarise the market authorisation status in differ ent countries and any significant variations related to safety; and (d) indicate whether changes will be made to product information in order to optimize the use of the product. (ii) One medical device should be covered in one PSUR. Within the single PSUR separate presentation of data for different indications or separate population need to be given. (iii) All relevant clinical and non-clinical safety data will cover only the period of the report (interval data). The PSURs shall be submitted every six months for the first two years after marketing approval of the medical device. For subsequent two years, the PSURs need to be submitted annually. The Central Licensing Authority may extend the total duration for submission of PSURs if it is considered necessary in the interest of public health. PSURs due for a period must be submitted within thirty calendar days of the last day of the reporting period. However, all cases involving suspected unexpected serious adverse event shall be reported to the licensing authority within fifteen days of initial receipt of information by the applicant. If marketing of the \u00b9Hkkx II[k.M 3 (i)\u00ba Hkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k 207 medical device is delayed by the applicant after obtaining approval to market, such data will have to be provided on the deferred basis beginning from the time the medical device is marketed. (iv) New studies specifically planned or conducted to exam ine a safety issue should be described in the PSURs. (v) A PSUR should be structured as follows: (a) Title Page: The title page of PSUR shall capture the name of the Medical device; reporting interval; approved indication of Medical devices; date of approval of the medical device; date of marketing of medical device; licence name and address.
