America's health care workers are dying. In some states, medical personnel account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. They tend to patients in hospitals, treating them, serving them food and cleaning their rooms. Others at risk work in nursing homes or are employed as home health aides. \"Lost on the Frontline,\" a collaboration between KHN and The Guardian, has identified 922 such workers who likely died of COVID-19 after helping patients during the pandemic. We have published profiles for 164 workers whose deaths have been confirmed by our reporters. Some cases are shrouded in secrecy. Our team contacts family members, employers and medical examiners to independently confirm each death. Many hospitals have been overwhelmed and workers sometimes have lacked protective equipment or suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to the highly infectious virus. In the chaos, COVID casualties might otherwise get overlooked. This project [aims to document](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/why-were-tracking-every-us-health-worker-who-dies-from-coronavirus) the lives of U.S. health workers who die of COVID-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic. Home Health Aide Was Active in Her Local Community (Naorin Ahmed) Rashida Ahmed Age: 46 Occupation: Home health aide Place of Work: CarePro of NY in New York City Date of Death: April 30, 2020 There's not a single photo of Rashida Ahmed where she doesn't have \"a very, very big smile,\" said Naorin Ahmed, her daughter. Rashida emigrated from her native Bangladesh in 2015 to be closer to her daughter, who had moved to the U.S. for an arranged marriage a few years earlier. In Queens, she became active in the local Bengali community, joining a [local rights group](https://www.drumnyc.org/) that advocates for South Asian and Indo-Caribbean workers. \"She was a very people's person,\" Naorin said. \"If you met her, you would remember her.\" Rashida loved to sing and cook \u2014 Naorin especially relished her biryani. Community activist Fakrul Islam Delwar called Rashida a \"very helping, kind-hearted person\" who brought food to her neighbors in Jackson Heights. Rashida cared for an older woman on Long Island who died on March 30 of COVID-19 complications. It's unclear whether Rashida became infected from her patient or during her train commute. She developed debilitating fatigue and fever, checking into a hospital on March 31. Representatives from CarePro confirmed that Rashida worked in an area with many COVID-19 patients and said that all aides are provided the necessary personal protective equipment. Naorin said her mother did not have adequate PPE but, despite the risks, insisted on caring for her patient. \u2014 [Elizabeth Lawrence, Kaiser Health News](/news/author/elizabeth-lawrence/) | Published July 29, 2020 Working Two Jobs, She Was Still the 'Best Listener Ever' Clea Alverio-Hume and her husband, Dave Woods Photography ) Clea Alverio-Hume Age: 57 Occupation: Medical records director and lead admissions coordinating assistant Place of Work: Queen Anne Healthcare and Swedish Medical Center-First Hill, both in Seattle Date of Death: June 12, 2020 Flowers of all kinds \u2014 particularly purple ones \u2014 were Clea Alverio-Hume's passion. She helped her mother, Felicidad, 82, tend them. Husband Dave often left bouquets at two health care facilities where she worked a combined 72 hours weekly. She did so, he said, to spare her daughter, Minerva, from working while in college. Over Memorial Day, Clea and Dave started to build a shed as a prelude to her own flower garden. Nursing a cough, Clea was tested for COVID-19 that Monday. Thirty-six hours later, Dave summoned paramedics. The test they administered came back positive. Erin Doss, administrator of Queen Anne, where Clea began working soon after emigrating from the Philippines in 1994, said they don't know whether she was exposed there. \"We miss her terribly,\" Doss said. On its website, the facility reports two staff deaths, including Clea's, and 19 patient deaths. Clea's Queen Anne colleagues gave Dave a framed photo of her and Minerva with dozens of notes on the matting. \"They all say the same thing \u2014 how much she meant to them ... the best listener ever,\" he said. \"Clea has touched hundreds in that manner.\" \u2014 Cynthia Mitchell | Published July 29, 2020 Social Worker Was a 'Voice for the City' (Paula Jackson) Lisa Burhannan Age: 50 Occupation: Social worker Place of Work: Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Date of Death: June 11, 2020 In June 2015, Lisa Burhannan rode to Nashville with \"her babies,\" a gospel dance troupe \u2014 God's Chozen Praise \u2014 that was performing on \"Bobby Jones Presents.\" Burhannan coached the young women through their Marvin Gaye number that weekend and at many local shows afterward. \"Beyond the shows, she brought the ladies together,\" said Portia Bolen-Geter, her aunt. \"She taught them, by example, how to live.\" Described by her mother, Paula Jackson, as an \"energizer bunny,\" Burhannan was committed to her community. She provided trauma rehabilitation to victims of crime, and as a volunteer chaplain at Pinnacle Medical Center, Burhannan counseled grieving families. \"She had a servant's heart,\" said Jackson, \"a true voice for the city.\" When Pennsylvania entered lockdown in late March, Burhannan did what she could \u2014 including delivering masks to clients. The family said she was finding her own protective equipment; CSSJ did not respond to requests for comment. On May 27, a \"horrible\" cough worsened, and Burhannan asked Jackson to write down requests for her own funeral. She wanted CeCe Winans' \"Alabaster Box\" sung. The next day, she was hospitalized. Burhannan's funeral proceeded as she'd hoped. The mayor spoke, her babies danced, and the mourners sang her home. \u2014 [Eli Cahan](/news/author/eli-cahan/) | Published July 29, 2020 A Public Servant Who Was the Heart of Her Community Priscilla Carrow Age: 65 Occupation: Coordinating manager Place of Work: Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York Date of Death: March 30, 2020 On March 10, when Priscilla Carrow attended her community board's last in-person meeting, she brought masks, hand sanitizer and information on COVID-19 for every committee member. \"She was someone who you could go to if you had a problem in the community, and you needed answers,\" said Ashley Reed, who served on the board with Carrow. \"We always counted on her to be on the front lines of what was going on.\" Carrow, who was born in Harlem and moved to Queens as a child, was passionate about giving back. In addition to serving on Queens Community Board 4, she was a shop steward in the local chapter of the Communications Workers of America union. \"She loved helping people. She knew she was blessed in her life, so she wanted to carry that blessing on to others,\" said Gloria Middleton, president of CWA Local 1180. Her sense of civic duty, paired with a bubbly personality and ability to command a room, made her a natural leader. Elmhurst Hospital was inundated with COVID-19 cases. Carrow, a year from retirement, managed the inventory and distribution of PPE to health care workers amid severe shortages. But friends say she was exposed to the virus at work and hospitalized in March. Her death was met with an outpouring of grief on social media from neighbors, friends and her congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u2014 Isoke Samuel, City University of New York | Published July 29, 2020 'He Did All the Unseen Things to Help Out' (Kyle Charon) Paul Charon Age: 62 Occupation: Traveling radiology technologist Place of Work: Multiple facilities via Premier Healthcare Staffing in Oswego, New York Date of Death: June 5, 2020 A devoted member of the Adirondack 46ers mountain club, Paul Charon would, without hesitation, clear branches that blocked a trail. When hikers left Nutri-Grain wrappers in the bramble, he picked them up. When overflowing creeks obstructed a path, he bridged them. The Saratoga Springs, New York, native \"loved being one with nature,\" said his son, Kyle Charon. \"He did all the unseen things to help out\" so others could enjoy it, too. Charon also spent over three decades with the Red Cross, where he volunteered during hurricanes, floods and wildfires across the country, Kyle said. During quarantine, Charon dropped by his adult children's homes unannounced with gifts like a Dutch oven and a pullup bar \u2014 he wanted to create a sense of normalcy for them. As regional COVID caseloads mounted, he continued caring for patients. From March to May, he performed X-rays at dozens of facilities near Rochester, Utica and Poughkeepsie. Friends on staff welcomed him with coffee, snacks and masks (he lacked sufficient protective equipment, Kyle said). Premier Healthcare Staffing did not respond to requests for comment. On May 9, feeling \"a little down,\" Charon requested a pot of Kyle's signature vegetable soup. But it didn't help, and on May 14, he was hospitalized. A few weeks later, after his father suffered several strokes and multiple-organ failure, Kyle signed a do-not-resuscitate order. \u2014 [Eli Cahan](/news/author/eli-cahan/) | Published July 29, 2020 Home Health Aide 'Embodied Family in Every Sense' (Jodie Antonio) Roberta Gruber Age: 66 Occupation: Home health aide Place of Work: Circle of Life Soaring Eagles Home Care Services in Gallup, New Mexico Date of Death: May 29, 2020 Months before Halloween, Roberta Gruber would start sewing. She'd craft costumes for \"her children and everyone else's children,\" said Jodie Antonio, her daughter. Then, dressed as Betty Boop, she'd transform her two-story home into the community's haunted house, going \"all out to make it spooky spectacular,\" said Evander Antonio, her grandson. Beyond Halloween, she had an open-door policy, allowing struggling neighbors to stay indefinitely. \"She'd leap to help someone in need,\" Jodie said. On the job, Gruber would drive Evander hours away to chop firewood or run errands for elderly clients he called shicheii (grandpa) or shimasani (grandma). \"K'\u00e9 means family\" in Navajo, said Evander. \"She embodied that in every sense.\" As the coronavirus spread, Gruber continued to care for patients and sewed masks for herself and others. Her employer said that it had distributed thousands of gloves and masks since mid-March but that it is impossible to rule out the possibility that she contracted the virus at work, despite precautions. On April 16, Gruber started to feel \"off,\" and on April 26, she tested positive for COVID-19. The next morning, she developed excruciating leg pain. After being sent home by one hospital, she was admitted to another and urgently evacuated to Albuquerque. Four failed surgeries and 36 hours later, Gruber was in a coma. The family never spoke with her again. \u2014 [Eli Cahan](/news/author/eli-cahan/) | Published July 29, 2020 Youth Mental Health Counselor 'Had a Heart of Gold' (Vicky Howard Stewart) Torrin Howard Age: 26 Occupation: Mental health counselor Place of Work: Boys & Girls Village in Milford, Connecticut Date of Death: April 7, 2020 Torrin Howard was a fixture in his hometown's gospel music scene, having played for greats like Donnie McClurkin, Marvin Sapp and Dorinda Clark-Cole. \"Anyone who heard him connected with him,\" said his aunt, Vicky Howard Stewart. As children, Torrin and his siblings formed a family band, and they traveled to churches, community centers and gyms across the country. They'd load the bus on Friday and return home by Sunday night \u2014 the children, half-asleep, already swaddled in safari pajamas. Torrin's teachers adored him, and his football teammates looked up to the \"Tank.\" As an adult, he connected with the troubled youth for whom he provided behavioral health and rehabilitation coaching. In late March, Torrin developed persistent flu-like symptoms. \"PPE was in extremely limited supply\" at that time and \"used only for individuals who actively had symptoms,\" per CDC guidance, his employer said. On March 28, Torrin tested positive. A week later, he was hospitalized and intubated. \"Next thing we knew, he was gone,\" said Howard Stewart. \u2014 [Eli Cahan](/news/author/eli-cahan/) | Published July 29, 2020 'When You Lose People Like Sue, You Lose the Community's Glue' (Royal Davis) Sue Williams-Ward Age: 68 Occupation: Home health aide Place of Work: Together We Can Services in Indianapolis Date of Death: May 2, 2020 Three decades ago, Sue Williams-Ward and her husband, Royal Davis, bought a bar. The dive \u2014 an azure duplex in Indianapolis' Haughville neighborhood \u2014 made decent money; but after \"seeing the love of God,\" Davis said, they turned it into a community center. The center is now a bodega and hub for social activism. \"We took it as our responsibility to bring light to the too-often-forgotten people in this community,\" Davis said. A home health aide, Williams-Ward bathed, dressed, and fed her clients. She brought her grandchildren to visit them and often delivered Thanksgiving turkeys and Christmas hams. In early March, Williams-Ward took a new job, earning $13 an hour (a $1 raise). She was hired after other workers resigned due to concerns over COVID-19 safety concerns. Within weeks, she started coughing. She kept going to work, Davis said, without protective equipment. Her employer did not respond to requests for comment. She was hospitalized and intubated March 23 and died six weeks later. \"When you lose people like Sue,\" Davis said, \"you lose the community's glue.\" \u2014 [Eli Cahan](/news/author/eli-cahan/) | Published July 29, 2020 A Tireless Advocate for Patients (Abigail Baltazar) Nicanor \"Nick\" Baltazar Age: 60 Occupation: Director of nursing Place of Work: Long Island Care Center in Flushing, New York Date of Death: March 31, 202 Nick Baltazar loved to sing, even when no one was at home. His wife, Grace, and daughter, Abigail, often joined in. Nick even brought a karaoke machine to the nursing home where he worked, and he and Abigail once serenaded patients there with \"Endless Love.\" Nick had boundless energy. He exercised twice a day and walked to work. He was a tireless advocate for patients and his employees, taking novice nurses under his wing and helping them achieve their dream jobs. A cook and baker, he would stay up past 10 p.m. baking treats to share with co-workers; his most famous treat was cassava cake. When Abigail was studying nursing in Buffalo, her parents would pack the car with groceries and Tupperware full of food he'd spent the whole week making. \"I would tell him, you know, there are grocery stores in Buffalo!\" Abigail said. Avid gardeners, Nick and Grace started with mint and basil. Their last harvest was so abundant that he invited co-workers to pick peppers, tomatoes and bitter melon. After 40 years in nursing, he planned on retiring in two more. On March 20, a cough and fever came on after work. He tested positive for COVID-19 and, within two weeks, died waiting to be admitted to the hospital. Long Island Care Center did not respond to requests for comment. \u2014 Natalie Mufson | Published July 24, 2020 Grandmother Worked Extra Hours in Nursing Home Ravaged by COVID Kettely Desire Age: 64 Occupation: Certified nursing assistant Place of Work: Alliance Health at West Acres in Brockton, Massachusetts Date of Death: April 11, 2020 In April, the coronavirus swept through the nursing home and rehabilitation center where Haitian-born Kettely Desire had worked part time. By April 25, 23 staff members had tested positive for COVID-19, and 22 of the facility's patients had died, [according to The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/25/metro/nursing-assistant-brockton-nursing-home-dies-covid-19/). By that time, Desire, who'd been planning a party for her granddaughter's high school graduation in Miami, had already died. Her son Frantz told the Globe that Desire had just completed a double shift in late March before feeling ill. She was hospitalized and put on a ventilator. Frantz confirmed to KHN that her death certificate names complications from COVID-19 as cause of death. Alliance Health spokesperson Kate Kahn said the facility started having staff \"wear protective gear before it was mandated by the state.\" \"Plans are underway to create a memorial at the facility in [Desire's] honor,\" Kahn said. \"She was well respected for her compassionate caregiving and professional demeanor.\" Desire has been laid to rest in a mausoleum in Florida, where Frantz lives.

He could sing. He loved wine, Italian dinners and concerts: Springsteen, Madonna, Diana Ross. Always with his wife, Joy. \"He was brilliant,\" she said, \"and he also liked to party.\" Norman had had an optometry practice since 1983 but also worked in neuro-optometry, helping people whose illnesses or injuries impair their vision. He treated stroke patients, Special Olympic athletes and accident victims. \"It's like physical therapy,\" Joy said, \"but for the eyes.\" After governor's orders shuttered his office, he saw neuro-optometry patients at three rehab centers. At one, his family believes, he contracted COVID-19. In May, the Einhorns visited family in Connecticut. They left for home May 9, stopping to see two patients at Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Tinton Falls. Days later, Norman lost his appetite and started coughing. Other family members got sick, too \u2014 but not the Connecticut crew. Norman died in the hospital about two weeks after diagnosis. Joy learned the rehab centers were accepting COVID patients, who were segregated. In a statement, Todd Cooperman, medical director at Tinton Falls, praised Norman as \"an extremely skilled neuro optometrist\" with \"a wonderful bedside manner.\" He didn't address questions about COVID-19. Norman thought he was protecting himself, Joy said, \"but it's just so contagious.\" \u2014 Maureen O'Hagan | Published July 24, 2020 Lab Assistant Spoke Out About Employee Safety (Vanessa Campos) Sally Lara Age: 62 Occupation: Lab assistant Place of Work: Riverside Community Hospital in Riverside, California Date of Death: June 8, 2020 Sally Lara was so supportive of daughter Vanessa Campos' childhood dream of becoming an astronaut that before middle school the two had traveled to Kennedy Space Center, eaten astronaut food and ridden in a flight simulator. Lara, 62, extended her generosity and kindness broadly, Campos said. She recalls her mother helping homeless women regain custody of their children and treating them to a fancy meal to celebrate. When COVID-19 came to the hospital, people were scared. So Lara picked up extra shifts. She pressed management about employee safety and PPE practices, encouraging her daughter to do the same at her nursing home job. Lara developed symptoms on Mother's Day. Riverside Community Hospital said in a statement it was devastated by the loss of Lara, also \"our focus has been on protecting our caregivers and colleagues and ensuring they have enough personal protective equipment.\" During her mother's month of illness, Campos drove in the car with her husband, tears streaming down their faces and praying for a miracle, she recalled. The hospital staff tried everything, Campos said. Her final words reached her mother through an iPad at her ear: \"If it's your time, go peacefully. If it's not your time, I need you to fight.

The two, along with brother Aric, grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland. Their single mother, Sue Ann Mack, a nurse, sometimes took Chantee to work, inspiring a love of health care. For 19 years, Chantee served the community at the health department, where one of her jobs was to tell people the results of tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Chantee, who never married or had children, considered her mother her best friend. The two lived together for years, and when Sue Ann became paraplegic, Chantee cared for her. When her mother died a decade ago, Chantee sank into a depression, but she remained committed to helping people. She hoped eventually to follow her mother into nursing. \"She was a good soul,\" Roland said. Family and friends believe she contracted the COVID-19 from a co-worker in March when, according to union officials, personal protective equipment was spotty and people were not routinely social distancing. Health department leaders wouldn't discuss Chantee's death but said the safety of workers is a top priority and workplace protections now include PPE and social distancing.

His wife said he requested a coronavirus test but was diagnosed with pneumonia instead. He died within days without being tested for COVID-19. The coroner confirmed it as his cause of death. Rose, also a nurse, fell ill, too, making it hard to care for their three, school-age children.

But on May 11, she was called in for the day and took blood on the COVID floor, Williams said, adding \"we begged her not to go back in.\" Within days, she felt sick. Tsosie was hospitalized at San Juan from May 22 to June 2 before being airlifted to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque. \"She will be deeply missed by her SJRMC family, the laboratory department specifically and by all who knew and loved her,\" said San Juan spokesperson Laura Werbner.

The photos depicted surgical masks and a face shield, but Escher remained concerned. \"He would tell us that he had enough PPE, and he was worried about other staff who he didn't know if they had enough,\" Max said. \"He was always concerned for others instead of himself.\" (Escher's employer, TeamHealth, declined to comment.) Escher, who earned his medical degree at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium after studying at Columbia University in New York City, started showing COVID-19 symptoms in April.

About 5 feet tall, Hardy-Rogers was \"all spunk, all enthusiasm.\" Hardy-Rogers arrived in the United States as a young woman, working first as a nanny and then as a home health aide, then got a job at the hospital, eventually settling into an overnight shift in the emergency department. Hardy-Rogers was devoted to family and loved traveling with relatives. She was thrilled every time she built a Lego set with her son, now 16. She put others' needs ahead of her own.

That same year, Hoffman's son, Karl, returned home from the Army and also wanted to take a course. Mother and son ended up in the same introductory computer class. \"She had the No. 1 grade in the class, and he had No. 2,\" Winkler said. Hoffman had previously worked as a 911 dispatcher, EMT and, most recently, a real estate appraiser. At 65, when most of her peers were thinking about retirement, she graduated from a local community college with high honors and an associate degree in arts. She took the nursing licensing exam and passed. She never let others tell her what to do, said daughter Jessica Allen. Hoffman's hobbies included canning dandelion jelly, gardening and going to garage sales with her grandchildren. In January, Hoffman started her first nursing job at the Alden Terrace rehabilitation center, after taking a few years post-graduation to tend to both her husband's health and her own. She needed the income to afford their medications that weren't covered by Medicare, her family said. Her family believes she was infected in early April, shortly after she completed orientation training. Her family said that the facility's nurses were not provided personal protective equipment unless they were working on the designated COVID-19 floor, which Hoffman was not. Yet all staff used the same break rooms, Winkler said.

On April 13, Anderson was rushed to the hospital, where he died of acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19. David Stern, a lawyer pursuing a workers' compensation claim on behalf of Anderson's family, said Anderson was exposed to contaminated air filters and spaces.

Neither imagined they would meet again as doctor and patient in a pandemic. The two had not seen each other since Bongiorno chose to focus exclusively on private practice toward the end of his career. \"He was a one-on-one type of person, you know, and I think that's kind of why he decided to do what he did with the last years of his life,\" Sullivan said. \"He found the thing that made him happy.\" His daughter Madeleine said his work in health care took many forms. He served as a U.S. Air Force Medical Service Corps officer providing psychiatric service to Vietnam War returnees at Eglin Air Force Base. In 1974, he started his private practice in Illinois and also provided services to the Archdiocese of Chicago. Bongiorno was hospitalized in mid-March and died after being on a ventilator for over 20 days. \"I've probably got 30 or 40 emails from patients who found out, and they all pretty much say that he saved their life with his help and changed their lives,\" his son Joseph Jr. said. \"He never ever, ever planned on retiring.\" \u2014 Ayse Eldes, University of Michigan | Published July 14, 2020 'He Would Come Running in a Heartbeat if Something Happened' (Beatrice Carrillo) Emmanuel J.

He had been a mechanical engineer in his native Philippines and became a nurse after immigrating to the U.S. in 1988. \"We were very dependent on him,\" said his daughter, Beatrice Carrillo. Earlier this year, when she injured her leg in an accident, her father immediately came to her aid, crutches in tow. \"He would come running in a heartbeat if something happened,\" she said. She described her father as devoted to his family and \"lively and silly. Always making jokes,\" she said. Emmanuel Carrillo was only a few weeks into a new job when patients with symptoms of COVID-19 began showing up. Days after working a 72-hour shift, he developed a fever, sore throat and cough. Beatrice, who is also a nurse, said her father did not have adequate personal protective equipment. The care center did not respond to questions about protective gear. Beatrice said her father, one of 10 siblings, longed to travel the world and spend more time with his family back in the Philippines.

At 14, he was diagnosed with cancer; he recovered, but his cousin Elizabeth Duplago said this early brush with illness influenced his decision to go into nursing. As a nursing assistant at a nursing home, Darby cared for his patients at their most vulnerable: He brushed their teeth, and bathed and clothed them. Duplago described him as sensitive, caring and selfless. \"He would spend his money and buy [friends] a drink and go without a drink for himself,\" she said. Darby continued working even as COVID-19 tore through the nursing home where he worked \u2014 by May, some 130 residents and staff members had become infected. He became sick in early May and died on May 20. Darby's family believes he contracted the virus at work, and Duplago said Darby's colleagues told her the nursing home did not have adequate PPE at the outset of the pandemic. A spokesperson for Centers Health Care, which owns the Fulton Center, denied that the center experienced PPE shortages. Duplago said she's looking into ways to help families facing pediatric cancer, in Darby's name. \u2014 Kelsie Sandoval, City University of New York | Published July 14, 2020 Friends Say Neonatal Nurse Was a Baby Whisperer (Lowelia Avellana) Susan Place of Work: Bellevue Hospital in New York City Date of Death: April 8, 2020 With eight siblings, Susan Sisgundo had to fight to stand out, whether it was academics or a new dance move, friend Lowelia Avellana said. The two met in grade school in the Philippines. Avellana moved to New York City; her friend followed. They studied nursing and lived in Queens, 10 minutes from each other. Sisgundo worked in one of the country's busiest hospitals, which was beset by COVID-19 patients. A hospital spokesperson said its employees had appropriate personal protective equipment. In the NICU, Sisgundo was a baby whisperer, adept at coaxing the fussiest newborn to sleep. \"She wanted to have babies,\" Avellana said, \"but she wasn't lucky to find a good guy.\" In March, Sisgundo started feeling sick. Struggling to breathe, she was taken to Queens Hospital, where Avellana works. The hospital was overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, and Avellana couldn't reach Sisgundo before she was intubated. \"It was crazy, crazy,\" Avellana recalled, her voice trailing off. She visited Sisgundo every day until her death. The friends were supposed to travel to the Philippines to celebrate their birthdays.

In April, Julian was taken by ambulance to his own ICU and, later, placed on a ventilator by colleagues. In May, doctors at a trauma center used ECMO \u2014 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation \u2014 in a last-ditch effort to save him.

She had no children of her own but loved to spoil and care for her nieces and nephews. She was a nurse who would listen to others' problems. And she could amplify those concerns for management without losing her composure, Rodriguez said. Oldfield had concerns of her own in mid-March while caring for critically ill patients in the telemetry unit. She was upset that she was given a surgical mask \u2014 not nearly as protective as an N95 respirator \u2014 to treat patients as COVID-19 was spreading. Her concern was on point: She cared for a patient whose initial symptoms didn't meet the well-known COVID profile, but who tested positive for the virus. \"I feel if she had an N95, she would be here today,\" Rodriguez said. \"I don't want to see anyone else lose their life like my sister did.\" Kaiser Fresno said it has followed state and federal guidelines on protective gear. (KHN is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.) Rodriguez said her sister resisted going to the hospital as her symptoms worsened, reluctant to expose paramedics or hospital staffers to the virus. When Oldfield agreed that an ambulance should be called, she wanted the paramedics to be advised to take every precaution. \u2014 [Christina Jewett, Kaiser Health News](/news/author/christina-jewett/) | Published June 30, 2020 The 'Life of the Party' Who Bonded With Patients (Christina Ravanes) John Abruzzo Age: 62 Occupation: Registered nurse Place of Work: Huntington Hospital in Huntington, New York Date of Death: April 2, 2020 Long Island is where John Abruzzo was born, raised, worked and died. The second of 14 children, he was the \"life of the party,\" said his daughter, Christina Ravanes. He loved poker and fishing. He had a son as well, and three grandchildren. Abruzzo developed strong friendships with patients, said Susan Knoepffler, the hospital's chief nursing officer. \"He had a winning smile. He was kind of a teddy bear,\" she said. He tested positive for COVID-19 in late March and died five days later. \"I went from seeing my dad at a wedding,\" Ravanes said, \"to the next time I see him, it's ashes.\" John's wife, Mary Abruzzo, died eight days later, on her birthday, Ravanes said, likely from complications related to Type 1 diabetes (she had not been exposed to John when he was infected). As of June 18, no other nurses at Huntington hospital had died of COVID-19, Knoepffler said, adding that the facility was well prepared and never ran out of supplies. What's missing, she said, is Abruzzo. \u2014 James Faris, James Madison University | Published June 26, 2020 A Nurse and Pastor Who Tended to Bodies and Souls (The Boles family) Dorothy Boles Age: 65 Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of Work: Greenwood Leflore Hospital in Greenwood, Mississippi Date of Death: April 3, 2020 Dorothy Boles had two callings: one as a healer and the other as an ordained minister. \"Mama Boles,\" as she was known, was a counselor and caretaker, said longtime friend and colleague Glory Boyd. Boles mentored aspiring ministers at First Chosen Tabernacle Church and welcomed recovering patients into her home. \"She went over, above and beyond,\" said Boyd, the hospital's chief nursing officer. \"She cared for other people before she cared for herself.\" When patients leaving the hospital didn't have the means to recover on their own, Boles opened her home to them, her son Marcus Banks [told](https://www.gwcommonwealth.com/news/article_8d104dea-7875-11ea-a864-6b3c4b5e805d.html) a local newspaper. Most stayed a few days. One young man stayed five years. \"Once she nursed him back to health, he just hung around,\" Banks told the paper. \"She just felt that nobody could take care of him like she could.\" Boles was admitted March 22 to the hospital where she had worked for 42 years. She was among the first four people to die of COVID-19 in Leflore County.

She dreamed of becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon. Hurdles getting into medical school dampened her spirits. Then she pursued nursing, a field in which she blossomed. \"She was so full of joy, so happy with her work,\" said Dominguez, a doctor. She wore scrubs with cartoon Minions and managed to connect with even the most challenging patients, her father said. A few years into her nursing career, she considered reapplying to medical school, but ultimately decided to stick with nursing because it allowed for more interaction with patients. In early April, she began experiencing excruciating headaches \u2014 symptoms that have since been associated with COVID-19. She visited urgent care and the emergency room and was twice denied a coronavirus test. She was eventually hospitalized. Tests revealed she had the virus and CT scans showed brain hemorrhaging. Dominguez doesn't know how his daughter contracted the virus but suspects she may have contracted it at work.

She enrolled to become a certified nursing assistant, which turned out to be a calling. \"She was truly happy working,\" her daughter Charmayne Bedonie said. \"I've been hearing so many stories from families she's helped.\" For 17 years, Barbara worked at a nursing home and received awards for perfect attendance. Management admired her work ethic enough to pay for her to become a certified medication aide. She was Navajo and could speak to residents at the home in their Indigenous tongue. \"I know she helped a lot of people just by speaking the language,\" Charmayne said. The home had reported a number of COVID cases. Bedonie tested negative for the virus repeatedly, but, overwhelmed by fatigue, she knew something was wrong.

He made house calls. He visited his patients in the hospital rather than asking another physician to check in on them. He saw generations of the same family. \"Some patients would show up here at the house,'\" said Giuliano's wife, Marylu, a nurse and the office manager of his solo practice. \"Patients would call and he'd say, 'Come on over, I'll check you out.'

He liked to tell patients, \"I'll fix you up.\" \"He treated all of his patients like family,\" said Nutley Mayor Joseph Scarpelli. When COVID-19 hit the U.S., Giuliano ordered N95 masks, his family said, but suppliers were out and sent surgical masks instead. Giuliano wore two at a time.

Born in Washington Heights in northern Manhattan, she went to nursing school in Greenwich Village and raised her five boys on the Lower East Side. In the 1960s, she traveled to Berlin, where she worked as a nurse for the British army and met her future husband, Peter. A lifelong love of travel was born. Gregarious and high-energy by nature, she loved meeting new people. \"Wherever she'd go, she'd make a new friend,\" said her son, also named Peter. In later years, Sell spent much of her time in Florida. But she jumped at opportunities to lend her nursing skills to her home city and see her grandchildren and friends. In February, she was contacted by a firm that places nurses on temporary assignments. Her children were concerned about the encroaching pandemic, especially given her age. \"But they need a nurse,\" she responded. She traveled to New York to fill in as a nurse at several schools citywide just as the pandemic took hold. The firm, Comprehensive Resources, did not respond to questions on protections for its contractors. Sell began developing symptoms in mid-March, just before the citywide school closure went into effect. She returned home to Florida, where she died from pneumonia caused by COVID-19.
