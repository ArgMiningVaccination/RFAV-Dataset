How To Use Homeopathy First, observe the symptoms. Pay special attention to any that are unusual or exceptionally strong. Notice whether there has been a change in mood and what behaviors or environmental factors seem to make symptoms better or worse. You may want to write down your observations. Second, choose the remedy. Take the list of symptoms and compare it to the descriptions of the recommended remedies for the short-term illness. Choose the remedy that most closely fits the symptoms, keeping in mind that not every symptom has to match. Third, wait and observe. Once you select a remedy, give one dose (3-5 pellets) under the tongue and then WAIT and OBSERVE. If there is no improvement at all within a few hours, give another dose. If after three doses there is no change, it is time to try a different remedy or contact a healthcare professional. How Homeopathic Remedies Are Made Homeopathic remedies are derived from plant, mineral, and animal products. Remedies are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they are made by homeopathic pharmacies according to [HPUS](https://homeopathycenter.org/homeopathic-pharmacopoeia/) guidelines. Homeopathic remedies are non-drowsy, non-habit-forming, and non-toxic. The remedies have no known side effects and no known drug interactions. Step 1: Make a tincture. Clean and prepare the substance and mix it with alcohol and water. Step 2: Dilute and succuss. Add more alcohol and vigorously shake. Step 3: Medicate the pellets. Dropper the remedy mixture onto remedy pellets. How To Choose A Remedy Potency Homeopathic remedies come in various strengths, also known as potencies. The 6c, 12c, and 30c potencies are gentle and perfect for home use. A 30c potency is ideal for most short-term illness or injury. The goal is to find the lowest dose of a remedy that works. Start with the lowest potency and move up only if the remedy stops working.
