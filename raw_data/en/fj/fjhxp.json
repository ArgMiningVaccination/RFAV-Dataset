These results did not come about by accident. Instead, they were supported by our foundational pillars for eco - nomic growth that put Americans first, including tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence, and trade renegotiation. Our success has created a historically strong labor market and greater economic security for millions of American families. The Transformative Power of Work My Administration's focus on economic growth comes from a deep apprecia - tion of the power of work to drive the economy and transform lives. The truth is, jobs do not just provide paychecks; they give people meaning, allow them to engage with their communities, and help them reach their true potential. As we have shown, the right policies offer Americans paths to self-reliance rather than trapping them in reliance on government programs. The unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, the lowest it has been in 50 years. Since I came into office, labor force participation is up and wages are growing fastest for historically disadvantaged workers, reversing the trends seen under the previous administration. Under my Administration, and for the first time on record, job openings exceeded people looking for work, with 1 million more open jobs than job seekers at the end of 2019. Because of record-low unem - ployment rates across demographic categories and continued job creation, people from all backgrounds can more easily find work, build their skills, and grow their incomes. In today's tight labor market, employers realize the vast potential of many individuals whom they may have previously overlooked. This includes those facing long-term unemployment, balancing family responsibilities, thinking they lack necessary job skills, overcoming substance abuse, return - ing from the justice system, or living in poverty. It is also encouraging those individuals to put themselves back in the workforce. My Administration has placed a special focus on these forgotten Americans because every individual deserves to experience the dignity that comes through work. In the fourth quarter of 2019, three quarters of workers entering employ - ment came from outside the labor force rather than from unemployment, the highest share in the series' history. As paid parental leave spreads across the country, including the expansion to Federal workers that I signed in December, 250-840_text_.pdf 7 2/7/20 3:46 PM4| Economic Report of the Presidentparents will have more freedom to choose a balance between working outside the home and caring for their children. And in another encouraging sign that people previously on the sidelines will continue entering the workforce, more than 420 companies have signed the Pledge to America's Workers. These companies have pledged to create upward of 14 million new job and training opportunities for current and future employees over the next five years. Apprenticeships are one way for these companies to deliver on their pledges, and expanding apprenticeships has been a top priority since I took office. During my presidency, more than 680,000 new apprenticeships have been created. To have a labor market that works for everyone, the Federal Government must encourage a variety of paths for people to get the skills they need to build family-sustaining careers. Although all sectors benefit from more apprenticeships, my Administration knows that manufacturing is a pillar of the American economy. Manufacturing spurs innovation and fuels economic growth, which is why I am so pleased that more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since my election. Rather than still shrinking, American manufacturing is now growing again. Critically, wages for nonsupervisory and production workers are rising at an even higher rate than managers' wages. Renegotiated or new trade deals with Canada and Mexico, China, South Korea, and Japan will modernize international trade and create freer, fairer, and more reciprocal trade between the United States and our largest trading partners, allowing the manufacturing renaissance to continue. Trade deals are in development with the United Kingdom and the European Union, among other countries that need access to the coveted United States market. These deals will both expand United States markets abroad and keep businesses here in America, which means keeping jobs here in America. I have the deepest respect for America's workers and job creators who have made this economic boom possible. That is why we are fighting back against other nations that have exploited the pioneering spirit of our country's entrepreneurs. Through combating intellectual property theft and unfair trade deals, along with leading the way on 5G development and deployment, my Administration is standing up to countries around the world to give American job creators the freedom to innovate and make life better for their fellow citi - zens. These proactive steps will benefit everyone, from large companies that employ hundreds or thousands of Americans to budding entrepreneurs trying to turn their ideas into reality. The labor market experiences that people are gaining today will change the trajectories of their lives\u2014and those of their children\u2014for years to come. No matter their pasts, people deserve agency over their own lives, and my Administration will never tell Americans that they cannot or do not deserve the ability to work and earn a living for themselves and their families. 250-840_text_.pdf 8 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Report of the President |5Previously Forgotten Americans Are Forgotten No More America's labor market successes are also helping us defeat the opioid crisis. While the causes of the crisis are multifaceted, work must play an integral role in any solution. Research shows that holding a job is a key factor in helping people overcome drug addiction. Over the rest of my presidency, I will continue to promote policies that beat back this deadly crisis and encourage work for Americans who are rebuilding their lives after struggling with addiction. Because of my Administration's aggressive efforts to end the overpre - scription of opioids, promote effective treatment, and secure the border, the tide is finally turning on the opioid crisis. Overdose deaths and first-time users are down, but that does not mean the crisis is over. Failure is not an option when it comes to helping people avoid the pain and suffering caused by addiction. Unfortunately, the largest drug crisis in our history has left many people with criminal records. After someone leaves the justice system, they face two options: find honest work and successfully reenter society, or stay out of work and face the increased likelihood of committing another crime. Finding work is one of the top indicators of whether someone who commits a crime will turn his or her life around and live crime-free. This is why work is not just essential for reforming individuals; it is also necessary for promoting public safety. Beyond signing the landmark First Step Act to promote public safety and make America's justice system fairer, my Administration is also putting substantial resources behind programs that improve employment outcomes for the for - merly incarcerated. Likewise, criminal justice reform that emphasizes work helps break the cycle of generational poverty. In 2018 alone, 1.4 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, and the poverty rate fell to its lowest level since 2001. For African Americans and Hispanic Americans, poverty rates are at historic lows, and the poverty rate for single mothers and children is falling much faster than the average. Since I took office, food insecurity has fallen and nearly 7 million people have been lifted off food stamps. Beneficiaries entering the labor market or increasing their incomes through work is likely driving falling enrollment in Medicaid, TANF, and disability insurance. These Americans are not simply rising out of poverty; they are building careers of which they and their families can be proud. Wages are rising fast - est for people with the lowest incomes, meaning people currently working in lower-paying jobs will not have low incomes for long. Getting that first job is critical, because it serves as a foundation for progressively better jobs over a worker's career. A commitment to the transformative power of work is why I signed an Executive Order instructing agencies to reduce dependence on welfare pro - grams by encouraging work. Less than 3 percent of people who work full time 250-840_text_.pdf 9 2/7/20 3:46 PM6| Economic Report of the Presidentlive in poverty. Individuals will not be able to build the lives they want through welfare alone: Work is a necessary condition for upward mobility. While strengthening and expanding work requirements for public assis- tance programs lead people to reenter the workforce and increase their household incomes, work requirements are most effective when employers are hiring. This is one reason why my Administration emphasizes policies that lead to job creation. Pro-Growth Policies Are Pro-Worker Policies One foundational policy that continues to drive job creation is tax reform. Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2014the biggest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in our country's history\u2014took effect, more than 4 million jobs have been created and economic growth has beaten previous projections. America's outdated tax code drove away businesses and investment, but tax reform has brought rates down and made the United States globally competitive again. Many workers saw bonuses and raises immediately after tax reform, and nearly 40 million American families received an average benefit of $2,200 in 2019 from doubling the child tax credit. Yet the biggest payoff is still to come. Tax reform put an end to America's counterproductive policy of punishing business investments, which means that workers will see even greater benefits once these investments pay off. My Administration has also prioritized healthcare reforms that make the system more competitive and, therefore, more affordable. We are giving patients increased choice and control, and protecting the high-quality care that Americans expect and deserve. Healthcare is a top priority because health - care costs are among the top annual expenses for American families. Under my Administration, the Food and Drug Administration has approved more generic drugs than ever before in United States history and enhanced its approval process for new, lifesaving drugs. This past year, prescription drug prices expe - rienced the largest year-over-year decline in more than 50 years. Whether it is through reforms that bring choice to Veterans Administration care, promote Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or give terminally ill patients access to potentially lifesaving drugs, among many other successes, every healthcare reform that lowers costs and increases quality allows American workers to live longer, healthier lives and keep more of their paychecks. Tax cuts and healthcare reforms put more money in the hands of working families and job creators, creating a virtuous cycle of even more jobs and even higher paychecks. On the other hand, when regulations limit individuals' ability to experience the dignity that comes through work, those regulations deserve additional scrutiny. Over the previous decades, the Federal Government has disproportionately regulated sectors of the economy\u2014like energy and manu - facturing\u2014that offer fulfilling, blue collar jobs for the majority of Americans who do not have a college degree. These misguided policy decisions imposed 250-840_text_.pdf 10 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Report of the President |7real-world costs that created barriers to success and prosperity for hardwork- ing Americans. Those days are over. American energy powers our cities and towns, empowers innovators, and ultimately drives our economy. Energy companies across the world are ready to build in our Nation, and permitting reform that cuts red tape shows that we welcome their investments. My Administration continues to support the energy industry's growth by removing unnecessary regulations and unleash - ing America's vast natural and human resources. Through these actions, the United States is now on track to be a net exporter of crude oil and natural gas for all of 2020, a major milestone not achieved in at least 70 years. In addition to being the world's largest natural gas producer, we also became the world's top crude oil producer in 2018. The positive records of our energy boom are widespread. Energy produc - tion has created jobs in areas of the United States where job opportunities were scarce. It also provides enormous benefits to families across the Nation by lowering energy prices. And it further distances us from geopolitical foes who wish to cause us harm. More jobs, lower costs, and American dominance\u2014these are the predictable results of our pro-growth policies. Many pundits and Washington insiders laughed when I promised to cut two regulations for every new regulation. They were correct that two-for-one was the wrong goal. Instead, the Federal Government has cut more than seven regulations for every significant new regulation. After only three years, my Administration has already cut more regulations than any other in United States history, and we have put the brakes on an endless assault of new, costly actions by Federal agencies. Our commitment to regulatory reform stems from the simple truth that the vast majority of business owners want to do the right thing, comply with the law, and treat their workers fairly. The Federal Government ignored this reality for far too long and abused its authority to go after businesses, espe - cially small businesses and entrepreneurs, in ways that can only be described as arbitrary and abusive. To promote regulatory fairness, I signed two Executive Orders that will improve Federal agencies' transparency and fairness while holding them accountable for their actions. Agencies will now need to give people fair notice and a chance to respond to any Federal complaint filed against them. Furthermore, the rules agencies enforce will no longer be secret, because all agencies' interpretations of rules will need to be made publicly accessible. Additionally, significant interpretations of rules will need to go through the public review process that is central to a flourishing democracy. Deregulation and increased transparency will save job creators money, leading to more hir - ing and higher paychecks. Every American, no matter his or her background, can share in the dignity of work. The era of putting American workers second and doubling down on 250-840_text_.pdf 11 2/7/20 3:46 PM8| Economic Report of the Presidentthe failed Federal policies of the past is over. While job creation during my Presidency has surpassed expectations, the credit belongs to the job creators and workers who risk everything and devote themselves to building a better future for themselves, their families, and their Nation. The Federal Government does not create jobs; hardworking Americans create jobs. My Administration's role is to follow our foundational policy pillars and allow our job creators and workers to do what they do best. As the following Report shows, because of the strength, resiliency, and determination of the United States workforce, which is the envy of the world, my pro-growth policies continue producing unquestionably positive results for the economy. The Report also makes it clear that, though the American economy is stronger than ever, my Administration's work is not yet done. With a continued focus on policies that increase economic growth, promote oppor - tunity, and uplift our workers, there is no limit on how great America can be. The White House February 2020 250-840_text_.pdf 12 2/7/20 3:46 PM9The Annual Report of the Council 13 2/7/20 3:46 PM250-840_text_.pdf 14 the President |1111Letter of Transmittal Council of Economic Advisers Washington, February 20, 2020 Mr. President: The Council of Economic Advisers herewith submits its 2020 Annual Report in accordance with the Employment Act of 1946, as amended by the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. Sincerely yours, Tomas J. Philipson Acting Chairman Tyler B. of the President |13Introduction Three years into the Trump Administration, the U.S. economy continues to outperform expectations across numerous metrics, with growth in output, employment, and employee compensation all exceeding pre-2017 forecasts. The evident success of the Administration's economic policy agenda demon - strates that its foundational policy pillars are enabling the U.S. economy to overcome structural trends that were previously suppressing growth. During the four quarters of 2019, real gross domestic product grew 0.7 percentage point faster than had been projected by the independent Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) August 2016 projections. As shown in figures I-1 and I-2, the U.S. labor market added 2.1 million new jobs\u20142.0 million more than projected in 2016\u2014bringing the civilian unemployment rate down to 3.5 percent, which is its lowest level since 1969 (and 1.4 percentage points below 2016 CBO projections). 1 Higher pay accompanied abundant job vacan- cies, as employee compensation rose to 1.4 percent above the 2016 forecast, implying an additional $1,800 in compensation per household. In July 2019, the current expansion of the U.S. economy became the longest on record. Contrary to expectations that the expansion would slow as it matured, economic output has accelerated over the past 3 years relative to the preceding 7\u00bd years, with output growth rising from 2.2 to 2.5 percent at a compound annual rate. In the first three quarters of 2019, U.S. economic growth was the highest among the Group of Seven countries. Reflecting this outperformance of expectations, in the first five chapters of this Report we present evidence that the Trump Administration's founda - tional policy pillars are continuing to deliver economic results. In particular, we highlight the role of the Administration's prioritization of economic efficiency and pro-market reforms in the realms of tax, labor, regulation, energy, and healthcare in elevating the growth potential of the U.S. economy and increas-ing the well-being of those previously left behind during the current expansion. In the subsequent three chapters, we then identify several challenges to continued growth. Efforts to address these obstacles include ensuring that U.S. markets remain economically fair and competitive, combating the ongoing threat of widespread opioid addiction, and addressing the overregulation of housing markets. We conclude by setting forth the Administration's long-run, policy-inclusive economic projections, and highlighting potential risks to the outlook. We begin in chapter 1 by documenting that, despite strong head - winds from the global economy and several idiosyncratic adverse shocks, Administration policies have helped to keep the U.S. economy resilient. As a result, output has grown at the fastest rate among the Group of Seven 1 In preparing this Economic Report of the President, data available as of January 30, 2020, were incorporated as publicly reported and are reflected in the chapters that follow. 250-840_text_.pdf 17 2/7/20 3:46 PM14| the CBO, 2012-19 250-840_text_.pdf 18 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Report of the President |15economies in the past year. During 2019, several macroeconomic indicators\u2014 including consumer spending, productivity, and labor share of income\u2014grew at faster rates than preelection projections. The labor market also tightened further, even after strong gains during the previous two years. During this Administration, the unemployment rate hit a 50-year low, and the number of job openings exceeded job seekers for the first time in recorded U.S. history, which has helped to pull potential workers into the labor force and boost real wages. The stabilization of labor force participation after years of decline, particularly among prime-age workers, has also boosted long-term potential output. We continue to evaluate the performance of the U.S. labor market in chapter 2, paying particular attention to how the Administration's pro-growth agenda has disproportionately benefited those previously left behind during the current expansion. We document how, in stark contrast to the expansion through 2016, policies that both raised labor demand and incentivized employ-ers to invest more in their workers have resulted in wage gains for historically disadvantaged Americans. Average wage growth for workers now outpaces wage growth for supervisors; wage growth for individuals at the 10th percentile of the income distribution now outpaces wage growth for individuals at the 90th percentile; wage growth for those without a college degree now outpaces wage growth for those with a college degree; and wage growth for African Americans now outpaces wage growth for white Americans. With monthly payroll employment growth outpacing that required to maintain a stable employment-to-population ratio, we also document the extent to which the U.S. economy is pulling millions back into the labor force and out of poverty. Looking ahead, we outline the Administration's continued prioritization of initiatives aimed at promoting alternative paths to work, supporting on-the-job training and reskilling, reducing recidivism, combating opioid abuse, expanding access to affordable childcare, and enabling economic growth that provides expanded employment opportunities for every American who seeks work. In chapter 3, we analyze the effects of the Administration's regulatory reform agenda. We estimate that after 5 to 10 years, the Administration's approach to Federal regulation will have raised real incomes by $3,100 per household per year, with 20 notable Federal deregulatory actions alone saving American consumers and businesses about $220 billion per year once they go into full effect, which will raise real incomes by about 1.3 percent. We further calculate that the ongoing introduction of costly regulations had previously been subtracting 0.2 percent a year from real incomes. By increasing competi-tion, productivity, and wages, and reducing the prices of consumer goods, the Administration's approach to regulation is raising real incomes while maintaining regulatory protections for workers, public health, safety, and the environment. 250-840_text_.pdf 19 2/7/20 3:46 PM16| Economic Report of the PresidentContinuing the focus on regulation, in chapter 4 we focus specifically on U.S. energy markets. By lowering prices, the CEA estimates that the shale revo - lution saves the average family of four $2,500 annually. Because low-income households spend a larger share of their income on energy bills, they benefit disproportionately from lower energy prices: shale-driven savings represent a much larger percentage of income for the poorest fifth of households than for the richest fifth. At the same time, shale-driven production growth has affected U.S. energy independence. This goal, initiated by President Nixon and pursued by every subsequent Administration, was finally achieved under the Trump Administration. In September 2019, the United States became a net exporter of petroleum, and the United States is projected to remain a net exporter for all of 2020, for the first time since at least 1949. We estimate that from 2005 to 2018, the shale revolution in particular was responsible for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the electric power sector by 21 percent. Finally, we demonstrate how, by limiting unnecessary constraints on private innovation and invest - ment, the Administration's approach to eliminating excessive regulation of energy markets supports further unleashing of the country's abundant human and energy resources. In chapter 5, we identify government barriers to market competition in healthcare that increase prices, reduce innovation, and hinder improvements in quality. We also summarize the achievements and expected effects of the Administration's health policy initiatives to reduce these impediments and facilitate greater competition in healthcare markets. The Administration's reforms aim to foster a healthcare system that delivers high-quality services at affordable prices through greater choice, competition, and consumer-directed spending, in contrast to government mandates that too often reduce consumer choice in healthcare markets and increase premiums. The Administration has addressed many of these problems through a series of Executive Orders, regu - latory reforms, and legislation. Turning to potential obstacles, in chapter 6, we analyze concerns about possible trends in market competition, recognizing the vital role that competi - tion plays in economic growth, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and serving consumers. We find that the best available evidence suggests there is no need to rewrite the Federal Government's antitrust rules. Because Federal enforcement agencies are already empowered with a flexible legal framework, they possess the necessary tools to promote economic dynamism. Ongoing investigations and resolved cases show that these agencies are well equipped to handle the competition challenges posed by the changing U.S. economy. We conclude that in addition to vigorously combating anticompetitive behavior from companies using existing tools, the Administration will focus on chang - ing government policies that create an unfair playing field. As the recent historic regulatory reform across American industries has shown, eliminating 250-840_text_.pdf 20 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Report of the President |17government-imposed barriers to innovation leads to increased competition, stronger economic growth, and a revitalized private sector. In chapter 7, we analyze the ongoing threat of widespread opioid addic - tion that, since 2000, has been responsible for more than 400,000 deaths. We find that actions taken by the Administration to lower the supply of opioids, reduce new demand for opioids, and treat those with current opioid use disorder may have contributed to a flattening in overdose deaths involving opioids. Recognizing that understanding the origins of the crisis is essential to effectively combating it, we find that a first wave of the crisis, from 2001 to 2010, was driven in large part by steep declines in out-of-pocket prescription opioid prices. Prices fell due to expanded government healthcare coverage, as well as to the increased availability of prescription opioids due to pain management practices that encouraged liberalized dispensing practices by doctors. We then find that a second wave of the opioid crisis, starting in 2010, likely began because of efforts to limit the supply of the powerful prescription opioid OxyContin, an unintended consequence of which was the creation of a large illicit market for the development and sale of cheaper illegal substitutes. In chapter 8, we study the challenges posed by rising housing unafford- ability in some U.S. real estate markets. We find that a key driver of the housing unaffordability problem is the overregulation of housing markets by State and local governments, which limits supply. By driving up home prices, over-regulation adversely affects low-income Americans in particular, who spend the largest share of their income on housing. Among 11 particularly supply-constrained metropolitan areas, we estimate that regulatory reform would increase the housing supply and decrease rents enough to reduce homeless - ness by 31 percent on average. In addition, we find that overregulation of hous - ing markets has broader negative effects on all Americans by reducing labor mobility and thus productivity growth, amplifying inequality across regions and workers, and harming the environment by forcing longer commutes. We conclude by documenting the Administration's actions to address the hous - ing unaffordability challenge by incentivizing State and local governments to increase housing supply in supply-constrained areas and by establishing the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. Finally, in chapter 9, we present the Trump Administration's full, policy- inclusive economic forecast for the next 11 years, including risks to the eco - nomic outlook. Overall, assuming full implementation of the Administration's economic policy agenda, we project that real U.S. economic output will grow at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent between 2019 and 2030. We expect growth to moderate, from 3.0 percent in 2020 to 2.8 percent in the latter half of the budget window, as the capital-to-output ratio asymptotically approaches its new, postcorporate tax reform steady state and as the near-term effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's individual provisions on the rate of growth dissi - pate into a permanent-level effect. Partially offsetting this moderation are the 250-840_text_.pdf 21 2/7/20 3:46 PM18| Economic Report of the Presidentexpected positive contributions to growth from enacting the Administration's infrastructure plan, making permanent the individual provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reforming the U.S. immigration system, continuing deregu - latory actions, improving trade deals with international trading partners, and incentivizing higher labor force participation through additional labor market reforms. 250-840_text_.pdf 22 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Report of the President

As of December 2019, the U.S. economic expansion reached its 127th month, the longest in the Nation's history. This chapter shows that, despite headwinds from the global economy and the maturing length of the expansion, the U.S. economy remains resilient. As a result, it grew at the fastest rate among the Group of Seven countries in the first three quarters of 2019. During 2019, several macroeconomic indica - tors\u2014including consumer spending, productivity, and labor shares of income\u2014continued to grow at faster rates than pre-TCJA projections. The labor market also tightened further, even after strong gains in the previous two years. During 2019, the unemployment rate hit a 50-year low and, for the first time on record, job openings exceeded job seekers, which have helped pull potential workers from the sidelines and into the labor force. Wages rose faster than inflation, which ultimately boosted real middle-class incomes. After years of decline, the labor force participation rate stabilized because of increased prime-age participation, which also boosts long-term potential output. The tepid recovery from the Great Recession prompted economic forecasters in 2016 to project historically modest growth into the future. Many observers concluded that low growth would persist indefinitely. However, the experience of the first three years of the current Administration proves that a prolonged period of low growth was in fact far from inevitable. This increased growth 250-840_text_.pdf 35 2/7/20 3:46 PM32| Chapter 1has coincided with Administration policies favoring lower taxes, substantial deregulation, and pro-innovation energy policy. The CEA forecasts that there is substantial additional room to grow\u2014given the historically strong labor market, the potential for further deregulation, and the supply-side impact of TCJA on long-term growth. After growing briskly in 2017 and 2018, the U.S. economy continued to expand at a healthy pace in 2019. During the year's four quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) moderated to 2.3 percent at an annual rate, from its 2.5 percent pace in 2018. This growth rate is notable considering the maturing length of the current expansion and that it was achieved despite headwinds from a slowing global economy. As of December, the U.S. economy marked the 127th month and the 42nd consecutive quarter of expansion ( fig- ure 1-1), surpassing the longest U.S. expansion, which ended in March 2001 after 120 months or 40 quarters. The U.S. economy is currently operating with a strong labor market and subdued inflationary pressure. Evidence of the strength of the labor market can be observed across many indicators. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.5 percent as of December 2019, a 50-year low previously hit in September and November 2019. Nominal average hourly earnings increased 2.9 percent dur - ing the 12 months of 2019, but had been at or above 3 percent for the prior 16 consecutive months. The tightness of the labor market and rising demand for workers have continued to pull people from outside of the labor force into the labor market, increasing the labor force participation rate to 63.1 percent for the year as a whole, up 0.2 percentage point from a year earlier. Specifically, the prime-age adult (25-54 years) participation rate increased to 82.5 percent during these 12 months, the fourth year of increases after years of decline since 2008. During the 12 months of 2019, the U.S. economy added 2.1 million nonfarm jobs, averaging 176,000 jobs per month. Despite the strong labor market, core consumer price inflation was subdued, at 1.6 percent in 2019 (as measured by the price index for core per - sonal consumption expenditures, PCE). Because nominal disposable personal income grew faster than inflation, real disposable personal income grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate during the four quarters of 2019. For the median household, real income rose by $1,834 in the first 10 months of 2019, reaching the highest level on record, at about $66,500 in 2019 dollars (Green and Coder 2019). In addition to rising real income, household wealth surged as stock market valuations rose to new heights in 2019. An increase in real household income and wealth has supported con - sumer spending, which constitutes 70 percent of GDP. In the four quarters of 250-840_text_.pdf 36 2/7/20 3:46 PMThe Great Expansion |332019, real consumer spending maintained the 2.6 percent pace of 2018, and accounted for nearly 80 percent of real GDP growth. Government purchases have also supported aggregate demand, rising 3.0 percent during 2019, com - pared with 1.5 percent in 2018. Although American consumers have sustained the U.S. expansion, a gen - eral slowdown in the global economy has restrained U.S. growth. The Group of Seven (G7) countries' economies slowed sharply in the past year; in particular, real GDP growth in Germany and the United Kingdom contracted in 2019:Q2. Major emerging market economies such as China and India also experienced slowdowns. These countries' slowdowns reduced global aggregate demand, which dampened U.S. economic growth. Despite the headwinds from abroad, the U.S. economy was the fastest- growing in the G7 in the first three quarters of 2019. The United States was one of only two G7 countries (the other being Japan, where projected growth was a moribund 0.9 percent) that did not require the International Monetary Fund to make large downward revisions to its one-year-ahead growth projections for 2019 (IMF 2018, 2019c), whereas the other advanced countries saw large downward revisions. Moreover, growth in the U.S. economy, for the third consecutive year, exceeded the consensus real GDP growth projection made before the 2016 election, as well as projections made before the 2017 TCJA. Three years ago, a widespread belief among economic forecasters was that subpar growth in the 1970-732001-72009-19 1975-80 1980-811982-901991-20 011961-69 100105110115120125130135140145 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42Figure 1-1.

In 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) forecast real GDP over the four quarters of 2019 to be 1.8 percent, while the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast real GDP growth of just 1.6 percent over the same period (see figure 1-2). The 2.3 percent real GDP growth during 2019 surpassed these forecasts. Similarly, actual real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 surpassed preelection projections from the FOMC and the CBO. Relative to the 2016 real GDP projections by the Blue Chip panel of private professional forecasters, the annual level of U.S. real GDP in 2019 was 1.2 percent higher (figure 1-3). Although the strong growth was a surprise relative to pre-2017 forecasts by the FOMC, the CBO, and the Blue Chip consensus panel, it was largely anticipated by the current Administration. In May 2017, the Administration forecasted average annualized growth over the three years 2017-19 to be 2.5 percent; subsequently the Administration revised 2018 and 2019 forecasts up to 3.1 percent, which was deemed optimistic and unrealistic compared with external forecasts. The optimism of the CEA's forecasts was grounded 1 Hansen (1939) was the first to put forward this concept, which was popularized by Summers (2013, 2014, 2016) and more recently by Rachel and Summers (2019). Specifically, Summers argued that when neutral real interest rates fall to an abnormally low level because of decreasing propensity to invest but increasing propensity to save, and are below nominal interest rates, the resultant excessive savings would act as a persistent drag on demand and growth.0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 2017 2018 20192016 FOMC 2016 CBO ActualFigure Relative to Pre-November 2016 Projections, 2017-19 Percent Sources: Congressional Budget Office, August 2016 Baseline Forecast; Federal Open Market Committee, September 2016; Bureau of Economic Analysis; CEA calculations.

In the 2018 Economic Report of the President , the CEA drew on an extensive body of academic literature to predict that tax reform would raise real capital invest - ment and the growth rate of output. In the 2019 Report, we reviewed data through 2018:Q3 showing that the U.S. economy's responses along multiple margins were consistent with predictions from that academic literature. Over the 12 quarters through 2019:Q4, the actual average annual growth rate of real GDP was 2.5 percent, slightly outpacing the May 2017 forecast, and an increase compared with the 2.2 percent average annual growth rate over the 26-quarter expansion period from 2009:Q3 through 2016:Q4 (see figure 1-4). As figure 1-5 shows, the average absolute errors of the ex-ante Administration forecasts under the current Administration were the lowest among those of the last five administrations. The Trump Administration adopted structural reforms and policies that were designed to support continued U.S. economic growth. The TCJA, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, permanently reduced the statutory corpo - rate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, sharply lowering the user cost of capital. It also enabled 100 percent expensing of new equipment investment, retroactive to September 27, 2017 (the date of the first draft of the proposed tax legisla - tion that included the 100 percent expensing provision from the House Ways and Means Committee).

The alterations in the tax treatment of foreign affiliates came in two parts: one for past earnings (a one-time transition tax at a low rate on past earnings held overseas), and one for future foreign-subsidiary earnings (eliminating the tax on normal repatriated dividends). Businesses responded to the lower user cost of capital and geographi - cal incentives under the TCJA with an increase in domestic investment. This investment led to capital deepening, increasing capital services per unit of labor input, which raised labor productivity, real wages, and U.S. real out - put. In addition, as discussed in more detail in chapter 3 of this Report, the Administration's deregulatory agenda also helped lower prices, from Internet prices to drug prices, and increased real income for American households. The 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act also increased government spending, raising aggregate demand. The combination of these factors lays the foundation for continued prosperity in the future. As the current record expansion matures beyond the 42nd quarter, some worry that the expansion will \"die of old age.\" But evidence suggests that expansions do not end simply because of their length. A study by Diebold and Rudebusch (1990) was among the first to find that in the postwar period, the probability of an expansion coming to an end was not increasing in the age of the expansion. In a follow-up study, Rudebusch (2016) provided empirical evidence that long expansions during the past 70 years are \"no more likely to end than short ones.\" Australia's economy, which has experienced the longest expansion of any advanced economy in modern history, at 28 years, exempli - fies how expansions can continue for decades. Old age does not kill expan-sions, though bad policies and adverse shocks can lead to recessions. The remainder of this chapter provides evidence on the strength of differ - ent areas of the U.S. economy in the recent past, including: productivity, wages and income, consumer spending, employment, investment, and subdued infla - tion. The chapter also discusses the impact of the global economic downturn, monetary policy, and domestic factors slowing U.S. growth. Productivity Productivity growth is a key driver of long-term real output growth. Labor productivity in the post-TCJA period, 2018:Q1-2019:Q3, increased at an aver-age annual pace of 1.4 percent\u2014in particular, it picked up to 1.9 percent in the three quarters through 2019:Q3, a faster pace than the average growth rate 250-840_text_.pdf 41 2/7/20 3:46 PM38| Chapter 1of 1.1 percent in the pre-TCJA economic expansion period 2009:Q3-2016:Q4 (figure 1-6).2 Academic research suggests at least two channels through which the current Administration's policies can increase labor productivity. The first is through deregulatory actions pursued since the end of 2016 that have increased competition and productivity (CEA 2019a). The second channel is through capital deepening in response to a lower cost of capital under the TCJA. By raising investment, capital services per worker rises and, as a result, so does labor productivity (CEA 2019b). Since the passage of the TCJA, capital services have grown faster than projected by outside forecasters. 3 Comparing the performance of the U.S. economy with other advanced economies provides another instructive benchmark. Since the start of the cur - rent Administration and through 2019:Q3 (the latest quarter available for all G7 countries as of the date of writing), U.S. productivity growth, as measured by output per worker, notably outperformed that of other countries ( figure 1-7). 2 Comparisons can be made with other subperiods in the past. Excluding the contractionary periods during the Great Recession, labor productivity grew at just a 1.1 percent compound annual rate during the period 2009:Q3-2016:Q4. 3 Actual capital services grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent over the two years after passage of the TCJA, compared with 2.9 percent as projected by Macroeconomic Advisers in October 2017, and 3.1 percent projected by Blue Chip Econometric Detail in February 2018. With a slightly different accounting method, the CBO also expected overall capital services to grow at 2.3 percent, compared with the actual annual growth rate of 2.7 percent. 1.1 0.9 1.3 1.4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.52009:Q3-2016:Q4 2013:Q1-2016:Q4 President Trump pre-TCJA 2017:Q1-2017:Q4 President Trump Business Growth, 2009-19 Annual g rowth rate ( percent) Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; CEA calculations.

Another striking observation is that the United States is the only econ - omy among this group of advanced economies to experience an acceleration in labor productivity. As noted in the 2017 Economic Report of the President , from 2005 to 2015 all G7 countries experienced a sharp decline in labor productivity growth from the 10 earlier years, due to slowdowns in both capital deepening and total factor productivity (CEA 2017). Figure 1-7 shows the later of these periods, with the inclusion of 2016, when labor productivity growth in the United States was similar to that in the other G7 countries (plus Australia). In the 11 quarters since that period, productivity growth has been flat or falling in all these advanced economies, while productivity growth has risen in the United States. Wages and Income In traditional economic models, equilibrium in the labor market requires that nominal hourly compensation equals the marginal product of labor. Although real output per unit of labor is a measure of the average instead of the mar - ginal product, the measure is a convenient proxy for the marginal product. 1.21.0 0.81.2 0.40.90.81.1 -0.40.50.8 0.4 0.00.10.41.2 -1.0-0.50.00.51.01.5 Australia Canada United KingdomUnited States2009:Q3-2016:Q4 (30 quarters) 2017:Q1-2019:Q3 (11 quarters)Figure 1-7.

Real average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent during the post-TCJA period and 1.3 percent for non - supervisory workers, compared with 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, in the first seven and a half years of the expansion through 2016:Q4. Real wage growth further picked up for nonsupervisory workers, to 1.4 percent in the four quarters of 2019, as the labor market continued to heat up. The net tax savings from the TCJA\u2014from a combination of increasing standard deductions, lowering marginal rates, and doubling the child tax credit\u2014is also expected to boost real disposable income. In its pre-TCJA projections (March 2017), the Blue Chip consensus panel forecasted that real disposable personal income would grow at an average of 2.65 percent during 2018 and 2019; in actuality, it grew at a 3.5 percent rate (figure 1 -8), well above the consensus forecast and well above the 2.1 percent average annual growth rate over the period 2009:Q3-2016:Q4. A similar pattern is observed on a per-household basis, where real disposable personal income per household grew in the post-TCJA period at an annual average rate of 1.7 percent, outpacing the 1.3 percent of the earlier period (figure 1-9). As income accelerates, labor's share of gross domestic income (GDI) also continues on an upward trajectory. Measuring labor's share as total employee - -\u0007$\"0- \u0001\u0001 *-\u0001\u0014# - Chapter 1compensation as a percentage of GDI, the series partially retraced a multide - cade trend decline through 2014. During the 11 quarters through 2019:Q3, it rose a further 0.5 percentage point, to 53.6 percent (figure 1-10). While labor's share of GDI and real disposable income growth has increased, total household wealth has also increased. The cumulative change in nominal household and nonprofit-sector wealth, as reported by the Federal Reserve's Financial Accounts of the United States, in the first 11 quarters through 2019:Q3 exceeds the cumulative change in the preceding 11 quarters by over $4 trillion (figure 1-11). Consumer Spending A more productive workforce with greater disposable income has bolstered overall economic growth. Consumer spending as a share of nominal gross domestic product averaged 67.9 percent during the 10 years through 2018. Given this sizable share of GDP, changes in consumer spending carry substan-tial contributions to overall real GDP growth. In 2019, real consumer spending grew by 2.6 percent, maintaining the same pace as in 2018. Since the TCJA's passage, real consumer spending has grown 2.6 percent at an annual rate, higher than the 2.3 percent pace during the 7\u00bd years from 2009:Q3 through 2016:Q4, when real consumer spending contributed 1.6 percentage points to real GDP growth.

Gains in household wealth (also known as net worth) have supported the solid growth of real consumer spending during the past three years ( figure 1-13), with gains in stock-market wealth and other housing wealth accounting for the increase. Over long-periods, gains in the wealth-to-income ratio are cor - related with consumer spending (Poterba 2000; Lettau and Ludvigson 2004). From that point of view, the gains in the wealth-to-income ratio could have supported an even larger increase in consumer spending. The prospect of future consumer spending supporting overall output growth is strong, given the elevated levels of consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 97.2 in 2019:Q4\u2014in the middle of the range in which it has fluctuated in the past three years\u2014and is currently 5.4 points above its 2016 level. The Conference Board's version of consumer sentiment fell to 126.5 in 2019:Q4, toward the lower end of the range in which it has fluctuated in the past three years, but is still 26.7 points above 2016. These persistently strong readings for both measures indicate resilient consumer demand, which represents a sizable portion of the U.S. economy, and thus point to its continued support of growth. Further, personal saving as a share of disposable personal income remains elevated. After notable upward revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in July 2018, as reported in chapter 10 of the 2019 Economic Report of \u0007$\"0- \u0001\u0001\u0011 Great Expansion |45the President, the saving rate was further revised upward in the Bureau's July 2019 annual revision. The personal saving rate during 2019 of 8.0 percent far exceeds the average of the last two decades ( figure 1-14). The saving rate has been increasing in the past three years due to the faster increase in personal disposable income relative to the already robust growth in personal outlays. The high saving rate together with elevated levels of household wealth, leave some room for saving to buffer consumer spending against temporary adverse developments in income. Investment In the past volumes of the Economic Report of the President , the CEA projected that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would raise real capital investment on the basis that lowering the user cost of capital would increase the target steady-state flow of capital services; and this projection was based on a substantial body of academic research. Chapter 1 of the 2019 Economic Report of the President confirmed these anticipated positive effects with the then-available data up through 2018:Q3. The positive effect of the TCJA on investment was also cor - roborated by outside studies (Kopp et al. 2019). During the 9-quarter post-TCJA period, the annual rate of real private nonresidential fixed investment growth averaged 3.4 percent, with growth being faster in the first 4 quarters (6.8 percent) than in the next 5 quarters (0.8 percent).4 Some moderation of the investment growth rate was anticipated by most models, which predicted that the positive effects on investment and over - all economic activity would be front-loaded in 2018 (CEA 2019b; Mertens 2018). In particular, standard neoclassical growth models suggest that during the transition to the new steady state, the rate of growth in fixed investment would initially spike, and would subsequently return to its pre-TCJA trend. Absent other, exogenous shocks, the level would then remain at a higher, post-TCJA level, with the capital-to-output ratio thereby asymptotically approaching its new, higher steady-state level (CEA 2019b). Figure 1-15 shows that the level of investment has been higher through - out the post-TCJA period than the consensus pre-TCJA projections (the March 2017 Blue Chip consensus). In 2018 as a whole, investment was 2.3 percent higher than the consensus projection. In 2019, even with the recent invest - ment slowdown, private nonresidential fixed investment was still 0.8 percent higher than the pre-TCJA consensus projection. Also, compared with other G7 countries, the cumulative increase in investment, or the cumulative addition 4 Nine quarters are included in the post-TCJA period because the TCJA's allowance for full expensing of new equipment investment was retroactive to September 27, 2017 (the date of the first draft of the proposed tax legislation that included the full expensing provision from the House Ways and Means Committee). 250-840_text_.pdf 2/7/20 3:46 PM46| projection 97100103106109112115 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Figure 1-15.

Outside the expected slowdown in investment growth, other forces sup - pressed investment in 2019. One is the increase in the user cost of capital since 2018:Q3. From the CEA's calculations, the user cost of capital is measured by the Shiller cyclically adjusted Standard & Poor's price/earnings ratio, in addi - tion to a function of corporate tax rates and depreciation allowances. As seen in figure 1-17, the user cost of capital fell sharply in 2018:Q1, when the TCJA lowered the top statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, but increased over the period 2018:Q4-2019:Q3. A confluence of factors\u2014tighter domestic monetary policy and lower stock market valuations, possibly due to a global growth slowdown\u2014all ultimately led to a tightening of financial condi - tions in 2018:Q4 and thereafter raised the user cost of capital. The imprints of weaker global factors on investment can be seen in a decomposition of nonresidential investment growth ( figure 1-18). The slow - down in nonresidential investment in 2019 was mainly accounted for by busi-ness structures, which shrank 7.0 percent in 2019, and by equipment, which decreased 1.5 percent. Intellectual property products investment, which is less exposed to fluctuations in global conditions, grew at a robust pace of 6.2 percent in 2019. The decline in structures investment was primarily because of a pull - back in energy investment.

As seen in figure 1-19, investment in mining and wells started contracting in 2018:Q3, when market concerns about global growth escalated and as oil prices fell to near the breakeven price for shale producers, which is about $50 a barrel. As oil prices approached or fell below the breakeven price for some producers, they responded by slowing drilling or deciding to reduce the large inventory of drilled but not completed wells ( figure 1-20). Indeed, the U.S. rig count fell by 236 in December compared with a year earlier. Equipment investment also contracted by 1.5 percent in 2019, compared with 5.0 percent growth in 2018. Investment in equipment turned negative in the first quarter, briefly bounced back in the second quarter, and returned to negative in the third quarter. The two main equipment categories that most exacerbated the slowdown are information processing and transportation. As is discussed in more detail in the \"Global Macroeconomic Situation\" section of this chapter, the transportation sector experienced a series of negative supply and demand shocks from economies abroad, but by far the largest drag was the decrease in domestic sales at the aircraft supplier Boeing. Confirming the importance of global factors, the CEA finds that an investment accelerator model augmented with foreign growth (proxied by a weighted average of non-U.S. G7 growth) can explain a sizable portion of the recent slowdown in equipment investment (see figure 1-21), compared with a fundamental version of the neoclassical model.

Indeed, as figure 1-18 shows, the current slowdown in investment is similar to the slowdown in 2015-16, a period that also experi-enced an investment slowdown precipitated by weakening conditions abroad. A later section of this chapter further explores the international economic developments that are weighing on U.S. growth. To the extent that changes in business fixed investment predominantly reflect actions of large multinational firms that were responding to fluctuations in global demand conditions, this situation could conceal the developments among smaller firms that are more domestically oriented. 5 One of the TCJA's aims is lowering the business costs of small firms, which tend to be more credit-constrained than large multinational firms. As figure 1-22 shows, this predicted effect of the TCJA is supported by survey data, with 2018 level small business optimism rising to the highest level in almost two decades, and the number of private establishments surging in 2019. Inflation Despite a tight labor market, price inflation remains low and stable. Measures of inflation expectations have also been stable. The stability of price infla - tion and of inflation expectations indicate the economy is not facing supply constraints and has been a key factor in extending the duration of the current expansion. What is different about the structure of the recent economy that accounts for the coexistence of a tight labor market and low and stable inflation\u2014that is, the flattening of the Phillips curve? Partial explanations include the fall - ing relative price of imports, a different monetary policy regime, and recent deregulatory actions. Price Inflation Key measures of price inflation are essentially flat, and are all roughly in the range of 2 percent at an annual rate. The price index for GDP, the aggregate price for everything that is produced in the United States, rose 1.7 percent dur-ing the four quarters of 2019, down from 2.0 and 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Consumer price inflation\u2014as measured by the price of personal consumption expenditures in the National Income and Product Accounts (known as the PCE Price Index)\u2014was only 1.5 percent during the four quarters of 2019. With the exception of the third quarter in 2016, consumer price infla - tion has generally been below (or equal to) GDP price inflation for each of the past eight years, as shown in figure 1-23. 5 A well-documented stylized fact in the international economics literature is that larger firms have a higher propensity to export and import (WTO 2016). 250-840_text_.pdf |53One reason that consumer price inflation has been below the pace of GDP price inflation has been the persistent decline in the relative price of imports. During the eight quarters through 2019:Q4, import prices did not increase, while GDP prices (i.e., goods and services produced in the United States) increased at a much faster rate of 2.0 percent, so that the relative price of imports fell at a 2.0 percent annual rate. The declining relative price of imports has held down consumer price inflation (1.7 percent over eight quarters) by more than it has held down GDP price inflation because imported goods and services are included directly in consumer prices, but influence GDP prices only indirectly through competition. A situation of declining relative prices of imports has not always been the case, as can be seen in figure 1-24, which shows the log levels of GDP prices and the log levels of import prices. In particular, import prices increased 1.6 percentage points per year faster than GDP prices from 1955 to 1981, increased 1.7 percentage points more slowly from 1981 through 2011, and increased 3.1 percentage points more slowly during the eight years since 2011. As can be seen in figure 1-24, the separation between the log levels of GDP and import prices is currently the largest recorded in the 1955-2019 period. Different Measures of Inflation: The CPI, Chained CPI, and PCE Price Index and Their Cores The Consumer Price Index (CPI) tends to increase slightly faster\u2014by about 0.29 percentage point a year, on average\u2014than the PCE Price Index. 6 These two commonly used measures of consumer prices are both important. The CPI tends to overstate a cost-of-living price index, however, largely because it uses a fixed market basket updated every two years, which means that it does not capture real-time substitution by consumers toward goods and services with declining relative prices. Another version of the CPI, known as the chained CPI, corrects for this substitution bias, and as a result also rises about 0.28 percent - age point per year less than the official CPI. The chained CPI is now used to index the notches in the new TCJA tax schedules. The PCE Price Index also begins with most of the same CPI components and aggregates with a formula that allows for substitution. Price indices that exclude the volatile components of food and energy provide a smoother signal of inflation trends than the overall index. The core CPI (which excludes food and energy) increased 2.3 percent during the 12 months of 2019, up only slightly from the 2.2 percent year-earlier pace. The PCE Price Index version of core inflation rose 1.6 percent in 2019, down from the year-earlier pace of 1.9 percent. The 2019 rate of core PCE inflation was below the Federal Reserve's target of 2.0 percent, as was the rate of overall PCE infla - tion, as shown in figure 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Percent chan ge (12-month) 3.0 2.5 Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis; CEA calculations.

Buttressed by the stability of core inflation, and of expectations of core inflation, the Administration forecasts rates of increase in the CPI at 2.3 percent and the GDP price index at 2.0 percent during the 11-year Budget forecasting interval. Hourly Compensation Inflation, Productivity Growth, and Stable Inflation Nominal hourly compensation inflation\u2014as measured by the Employment Cost Index for the private sector\u2014increased by 2.7 percent at an annual rate during the 12 months of 2019, down slightly from the 3.0 percent 2018 pace. This 2.7 percent pace edged up from the annual pace of 2.1 percent during the four years through 2016. Over long periods, wage inflation can exceed price inflation by the rate of labor productivity growth. And over the seven quarters through 2019:Q3, nonfarm labor productivity grew at a 1.4 percent annual rate. As a result, the roughly 3.0 percent rate of annual hourly compensation growth (which sug - gests unit labor costs rising at 1.6 percent) is compatible with price inflation of 2 percent (or slightly less), without putting upward pressure on the price structure. The sensitivity of inflation to fluctuations in the unemployment rate has decreased during the past two decades, as shown in the scatter diagram given in figure 1-27, which illustrates a version of the Phillips curve. The vertical axis shows the difference in core PCE inflation relative to a year-earlier survey of inflation expectations. The horizontal axis shows a version of the unemploy - ment rate, one that is demographically adjusted to control for the major fluctuations in the share of young people in the labor force during these past 60 years. (The share of young people in the labor force was exceptionally high in the 1970s, when the baby boom cohorts entered the labor market.) As can be seen in figure 1-27 by the blue regression line fitted through the early years 1960-2000, an extra percentage point of unemployment low - ered the rate of inflation by 0.36 percentage point a year. In contrast, the red regression line fitted on the last 19 years (2000-2018) indicates that an extra percentage point of unemployment lowered the rate of inflation by only 0.08 percentage point. One could argue that this shallow slope estimated during the past 20 years provides the best guide to the future. Or one might argue that the best estimate of the slope is the one covering the entire 60-year sample (0.27 percentage point of inflation per 1 percentage point of unemployment; not shown). 250-840_text_.pdf 59 2/7/20 3:46 PM56| Chapter 1Explanations for the declining slope of the Phillips curve include the influence of import prices in holding down the rate of inflation in recent years (as argued above), the wage and price rigidity that kept inflation from falling below zero during the early years of this recovery (2009-13), the diminishment of the Phillips curve coefficient in a monetary policy regime that effectively targets inflation (Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi 2019), and the evolution of the input-output structure of the economy toward increasing intermediate inputs (Rubbo 2020). Another possible explanation is the deregulation efforts of the current Administration. -3-2-10123456 23456789 1 0Figure 1-27.

We calculate that these effects lower total inflation by about 0.05 percentage point a year. The relative price of prescription drugs, in particular, is increasing by 2.6 percentage points a year less that during the 10 years through 2016; see table 1-1. To summarize this analysis, inflation remains low and stable, inflation expectations are well anchored at this low level, and recent estimates of the Phillips curve suggest a diminishing sensitivity of inflation to unemployment rates. The Global Macroeconomic Situation As alluded to in previous sections, a major headwind to growth in 2019 was a synchronized slowdown in global growth. In its latest semiannual economic outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2019c) revised down global growth sharply, by 0.7 percentage point, to what would be the lowest growth rate since the Global Recession, 3 percent\u2014one of the largest one-year downward-revisions in recent years ( figure 1-28). Among advanced econo - mies, growth was revised down by 0.4 percentage point, with growth disap-pointments concentrated in Europe, especially Germany. Emerging market economies also saw a downward revision, of 0.8 percentage point. Amid this global slowdown, the U.S. economy has performed largely as projected by the IMF in October 2018, growing faster than any other G7 country in the first three quarters of 2019 (figure 1-29). At the heart of the current global slowdown has been a manufacturing downturn. Uncertainty about trade policy is one often-cited culprit in the manu - facturing slowdown, particularly uncertainty surrounding the Administration's negotiations toward a bilateral trade agreement with the People's Republic of China on enforceable commitments to remove or lower structural barriers in China (BIS 2019a, 2019b; IMF 2019a, 2019b; OECD 2019a; World Bank 2019a, 2019b). However, other reasons for the global manufacturing slowdown also preceded, or were contemporaneous with, trade policy developments. These reasons make it difficult to isolate the effects of trade policy uncertainty, and possibly result in an upward bias of its effects on the global economy. Other factors weighing on manufacturing include a change in European automobile emission standards in September 2018 that caused a production bottleneck in Europe, especially Germany, and a growth slowdown in China caused by the government's efforts to deleverage the financial system beginning in 2017. The manufacturing sectors of these two countries\u2014two of the world's preeminent manufacturing powerhouses\u2014had begun slowing down before or around the time of the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods by the current Administration (figure 1-30). 250-840_text_.pdf 61 2/7/20 3:46 2018 WEO Oct. 2019 WEOFigure 1-29.

Negotiations have covered a wide range of critical issues, including the ways that U.S. companies are required to transfer proprietary technology as a condi - tion of market access; the numerous tariff and nontariff barriers faced by U.S. businesses in China; and China's other market-distorting practices and policies that have weighed on U.S. and global economic growth, such as industrial subsidies and support for state-owned enterprises. China's weak protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is symptomatic of a broader challenge. Chinese firms engage in systematic theft of U.S. intellectual property because the costs are insufficient to incentiv - ize them to do otherwise. 7 Instead of pursuing an enforceable bilateral trade agreement through targeted tariffs, prior Administrations took a multilateral approach that imposed no costs on the offenders and failed to resolve these issues. The Administration first imposed tariffs on imports from China based on 7 There is a common misconception that the grievances against China relate exclusively to intellectual property. Although Chinese forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft (discussed at length in the Section 301 investigation) are important, the actions are also designed to address a number of other long-standing trade issues with China: expanding the Chinese market access for services and agriculture, implementing an agreement like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement's provision on currency, addressing the many nontariff barriers on U.S. exports to China, and increasing Chinese purchases of U.S. products (White House 2018).

The Administration then took supplemental action in 2018 and 2019 in response to China's imposition of retaliatory tariffs and failure to eliminate these unfair acts, policies, and practices. These Administration actions have prompted a renegotiation of the trad - ing relationship between the two countries. Studies that examined the effect of the tariffs point out that tariffs impose near-term costs on the United States (Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein 2019a, 2019b; Caldara et al. 2019; Fajgelbaum et al. 2019). 8 Negotiations over a new agreement necessitate a degree of uncertainty over how that agreement will be shaped, exacerbating near-term costs. However, achieving a new trade relationship with China that is balanced and reciprocal will deliver long-term economic benefits for the United States, including a reduction in near-term costs. In January 2020, the Administration finalized a historic and enforceable agreement on phase one of the trade deal. The trade deal requires structural reforms and other changes to China's economic and trade policies in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. The ultimate goal is that, with lower market barriers and further market orientation in China, the global trading system will operate in a more balanced, reciprocal environment. Global growth, as a result, would benefit from the increase in trade liberalization. While trade policy uncertainty has held the spotlight, another underap- preciated reason for the global manufacturing slump was both supply and demand problems in the global motor vehicle industry. Supply problems in the European motor vehicle industry were precipitated by a change in the European Union's emissions regulations in September 2018, which led to bottlenecks at testing agencies and production cuts from automobile manu - facturers to avoid unwanted inventory accumulation. Germany, a global hub for automobile production, particularly felt the impact of the supply disruption (Deutsche Bundesbank 2019; IMF 2019b). German automobile production fell 10 percent in 2018 as a whole, and shrank another 9 percent in 2019. Given its long global value chains and sizable share in global output and global exports, weaknesses in the automobile sector extend well beyond the industry in Europe, propagating the shock through upstream industries around the world like steel, metal, and automobile parts, as well as downstream industries like services (OECD 2019b).9 8 Caldara et al. (2019) look at the costs imposed by this trade policy uncertainty and find cumulative costs of up to 1 percent of GDP after two years. Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019b) examine the direct impact of implemented tariffs in 2018 and 2019 and find that they impose a net deadweight loss of 0.4 percent of GDP per year. Fajgelbaum et al. (2019) find that the additional tariffs in 2018 imposed a cost of 0.04 percent on GDP after accounting for tariff revenues and gains to domestic producers.9 The automobile sector accounts for 5 percent of global output and 8 percent of global exports. 250-840_text_.pdf 64 2/7/20 3:46 PMThe Great Expansion |61These adverse shocks to the motor vehicle industry were further com - pounded by a cyclical downturn in automobile demand in China. Efforts by China's authorities to deleverage the shadow-banking sector since 2017 have led to a protracted slowdown in credit growth, including consumer credit. Increasing difficulty in accessing credit, heightened risk aversion among house-holds in a slowing economy, and the termination\u2014in 2019\u2014of consumer tax breaks for automobile purchases in 2017-18 all led to a substantial pullback in Chinese automobile consumption. As a result, China's automobile con - sumption has contracted in consecutive quarters since mid-2018 ( figure 1-31), and has accounted for over half the global contraction of automobile sales. Accordingly, the quantity of German automobile exports, for which China is an important market, have plunged since early 2018, and were 14 percent below the mid-2018 level, as of November 2019 (figure 1-32). Beyond the problems in the automobile industry and the slowdown in China, country-specific shocks have also exacerbated the global slowdown. In the United Kingdom, uncertainty over Brexit has continued to weigh on growth. After the U.K. Parliament failed to ratify a deal negotiated between Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government and the EU, his government secured an extension of the Brexit deadline to January 2020. With the December 2019 elec - tions in the U.K. securing a large majority for Johnson's party in Parliament, Parliament passed legislation for Britain to leave the European Union with a -20-15-10-50510152025 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Figure 1-31.

Japan, after experiencing surprisingly positive growth of 2.3 percent at annual rate in the first half of 2019, saw its growth edge down to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, as exports slumped amid weakening global demand, mainly due to a drop in demand from China and a boycott of Japanese goods in South Korea. The long-planned sales tax increase from 8 to 10 percent also came into effect in October, causing consumer spending to plummet. Emerging market economies, which until 2018 had been an engine of global growth, became a drag in 2019. After months of antigovernment pro - tests, Hong Kong entered its first recession since the global financial crisis. 10 In India, increasing defaults in the shadow-banking sector have resulted in a large pullback of domestic credit growth, causing GDP growth to slow sharply. In Mexico, uncertainty over domestic policies, reinforced by the sudden resig-nation of Mexico's financial minister, and the slowdown in global trade have impeded growth. Meanwhile, growth remains weak in Brazil, as high public debt levels have constrained the government from using fiscal stimulus to further support the economy in the face of subdued domestic and external demand. 10 Hong Kong's real GDP contracted by 1.9 percent at an annual rate in 2019:Q2 and by 12.1 percent in 2019:Q3.Quantity Value 859095100105110 2016 2017 2018 2019Figure 1-32.

In particular, the European Central Bank announced in September that it would resume its asset purchase program at a pace of \u20ac20 billion a month, and it lowered its policy rate by 10 basis points to -0.5 percent. The National Bank of Denmark (a non-euro country) also followed the European Central Bank in lowering its policy rate further into negative territory. Global negative-yielding sovereign debt\u2014mostly issued by European countries\u2014has recently reached a record amount of about $15 trillion. In contrast, in response to an improved outlook for the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve began to normalize its balance sheet in December 2015. During the years 2016-18, the Federal Reserve raised its policy rate eight times, while several central banks across Europe (Denmark, the European Central Bank, Sweden, and Switzerland) kept their policy rates negative (figure 1-33). Though the Federal Reserve subsequently reduced rates on three occa - sions in 2019, U.S. policy rates continued to exceed those of other advanced economies, which induced capital inflows into the United States, and in turn contributed to an appreciation of the dollar through September 2019, before it edging lower during the final three months of the year. Looking through the fluctuations of 2019, the real and nominal trade- weighted broad dollar was little changed from December to December.

Curcuru (2017) finds that for every divergence of 1 percentage point in interest rates between the United States and other advanced economies, the real advanced dollar index appreciates 3.4 percent. Applying this elasticity, one finds that the interest rate differential between the United States and the other G7 countries would have predicted a depreciation of 2.6 percent in the advanced dollar. 11 As of December, the real level of the broad dollar is 7.8 percent higher than its historical average calculated from 1973 January to the present, though most of the appreciation occurred from the summer of 2014 to 2015 ( figure 1-34). The real broad dollar is, however, still below the record highs of 1985 and 2002. Although higher U.S. interest rates than in other advanced countries would, ceteris paribus, cause some dollar appreciation and reduce U.S. exports, monetary spillovers from abroad also have an offsetting positive eco - nomic effect by lowering the longer end of the Treasury yield curve. This effect could be observed in August 2019, when data in Germany and China that were weaker than expected triggered global growth concerns that caused an imme-diate influx of safe haven flows to the U.S. Treasury market. Market expecta-tions of future easing actions by the European Central Bank then caused an immediate decrease in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, contributing to the 11 Collins and Truman (2019) employed the same methodology for the period July 2014-September 2019, and found that 4.1 percentage points of the 21 percent appreciation in the major dollar over this period was due to the United States / G7 interest rate differential. 2/7/20 3:46 PMThe Great Expansion |65inversion of the yield curve at that time. As a result, U.S. mortgage rates came down, which on the whole supported the U.S. housing market and allowed U.S. households to refinance their mortgages, unlocking more disposable income for consumption. Domestic Headwinds In addition to international headwinds, four other idiosyncratic domestic fac - tors impeded U.S. growth by almost 0.3 percentage point in 2019: (1) the partial government shutdown for 25 days in January, (2) the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, (3) industrial action at General Motors, and (4) the Midwest's spring flooding.12 Boeing. After two fatal accidents of the Boeing 737 MAX in 2018 and 2019, civil aviation authorities around the world (including the United States) grounded the aircraft. The accidents and eventual grounding caused Boeing 737 deliveries to collapse to nearly zero, and production to fall. This drop in production and deliveries lowered GDP because fewer planes were produced, and those produced were placed into inventory instead of being delivered. The CEA estimates that these effects depressed real GDP growth during the four quarters of 2019 by 0.14 percentage point. GM strikes. In mid-September, the United Auto Workers began a work stoppage that halted production at General Motors for six weeks. The CEA estimates that the strike subtracted at most 0.08 percentage point from GDP growth in the four quarters of 2019; but the effects will be reversed by an equal amount in 2020. Midwest flooding. Production of corn and soybeans (the Nation's most valuable crops, at about $51 billion and $39 billion in 2018, respectively) fell in 2019 by 4.4 percent and 19.8 percent. Spring flooding\u2014due to excessive rain and snowmelt, which damaged production in the Upper Midwest\u2014may be partly responsible for the decline in production. We estimate that these declines reduced the value of corn and soybean crops (the major crops throughout the Midwest) by $10 billion in 2019, or 0.04 percent of GDP. Conclusion This chapter has shown that despite strong headwinds from the global economy and expectations of growth moderating as the current expansion matures, the U.S. economy continued expanding at a healthy pace in the past year. During 2019, consumer spending continued to grow strongly, while the labor share of income continued to increase. The labor market tightened further, even after strong gains in the previous two years. Wages rose faster 12 The partial government shutdown affected the 2019 level of real GDP, as well as the 2019 annual average-to-annual average growth rate, but not the 2019 fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter growth rate. 250-840_text_.pdf 69 2/7/20 3:46 PM66| Chapter 1than inflation, which ultimately boosted real middle-class incomes. After years of decline, the stabilization of labor force participation, due to increased prime-age participation, combined with capital deepening to boost potential long-term output. The tepid recovery from the Great Recession in the years before the Trump Administration prompted economic forecasters to project pessimistic growth into the future, reflecting a widespread belief that the U.S. economy is in the midst of a period of secular stagnation. But the first three years of the current Administration have demonstrated that stagnation is not inevitable. And the Administration's structural reforms\u2014including lower taxes, deregula - tion, and pro-innovation energy policies\u2014can overcome secular stagnation and have set the stage for continued economic strength. As the current record expansion matures beyond the 42nd quarter, some worry that the expansion will \"die of old age.\" But academic evidence indicates that expansions do not end simply because of their length. Old age does not kill expansions, though bad policies and exogenous shocks can and do lead to recessions. The United States' historically strong labor market, the potential for further deregulation, and the capital deepening that is having a positive impact on productivity suggest that there is still substantial room to grow in the present U.S. expansion. 250-840_text_.pdf 70 2/7/20 3:46 PM67 xChapter 2 Economic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans The U.S. labor market is the strongest it has been in the last half cen - tury, as President Trump's pro-growth economic policies continue boosting labor demand and lowering structural barriers to entering the labor market. Economic data show that recent labor market gains disproportionately benefit Americans who were previously left behind. These groups are becoming more and more self-reliant through their economic activity, rather than remaining inactive in the labor market to qualify for means-tested government programs. Under the Trump Administration, and for the first time on record, there are more job openings than unemployed people. In 2019, the U.S. unemploy - ment rate has reached 3.5 percent, the lowest rate in five decades. Falling unemployment has reduced the share of the population on unemployment insurance to the lowest level since recording started in 1967. Importantly, the African American unemployment rate has hit the lowest level on record, and series lows have also been achieved for Asians, Hispanics, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, veterans, those without a high school degree, and persons with disabilities, among others. Since the 2016 election, the economy has added more than 7 million jobs, far exceeding the 1.9 million predicted by the Congressional Budget Office in its final preelection forecast. These gains have brought people from the sidelines into employment. In parts of 2019, nearly three quarters of people entering employment came from out of the labor force\u2014the highest rate on record. And the prime-age labor force is growing, reversing losses under the 250-840_text_.pdf 71 2/7/20 3:46 PM68| Chapter 2prior administration's expansion period. This evidence suggests that the labor market's revival over the past three years is not a continuation of past trends but instead is the result of President Trump's pro-growth policies. The Trump Administration's policies are not only leading to more jobs but also to higher pay. While nominal wage growth for all private-sector workers has been at or above 3 percent for all but one month in 2019, wage growth for many historically disadvantaged groups is now higher than wage growth for more advantaged groups, as is the case for lower-income workers compared with higher-income ones, for workers compared with managers, and for African Americans compared with whites. These income gains mark a fundamental change relative to those opposite trends observed over the expansion before President Trump's inauguration, contributing to reduced income inequality. Employment and earnings gains continue pulling people out of poverty and off of means-tested welfare programs. The number of people living in poverty decreased by 1.4 million from 2017 to 2018, and the poverty rates for blacks and Hispanics reached record lows. Food insecurity has fallen, and there are nearly 7 million fewer people participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP , formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) than at the time of the 2016 election. The caseload for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) has fallen by almost 700,000 individuals, and the number of individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance has fallen by almost 380,000 since the 2016 election. Similarly, due primarily to rising incomes, Medicaid rolls are decreasing. Today's strong labor market helps all Americans, but the largest benefits are going to people who were previously left behind during the economic recovery. Additional deregulatory actions targeted at remaining barriers in the labor market will allow the economy to add to its record-length expansion and lead to further employment and income gains, particularly for these historically disadvantaged groups. 250-840_text_.pdf 72 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |69The U.S. labor market is the strongest it has been in the last half century, as shown by economic data across various metrics. President Trump's pro-growth economic policies are contributing to this strength. While the economic gains realized over the past three years are widespread, this chapter shows that they are disproportionately benefiting Americans who were previously left behind during the recovery. The Administration's poli - cies increase labor demand and decrease structural barriers to entering labor markets. This approach has contributed to reduced inequality through an eco - nomic boom that is greatly benefiting historically disadvantaged groups. These groups are becoming more and more self-reliant through economic activity rather than by remaining economically inactive to qualify for means-tested government programs. Today's tighter labor market and the resulting wage growth are pre - dictable outcomes of the Administration's historic tax cuts and deregulatory actions, which have delivered continued economic expansion. Eliminating unnecessary regulatory burdens and lowering taxes spur labor demand and incentivize firms to make productivity-enhancing investments (see chapter 3). As a result, worker productivity, wages, and employment all increase. Ultimately, these policies help boost the job market's continued expan - sion, as increased demand with unchanged supply raises quantity (employ - ment) and prices (wages) in labor markets. 1 The United States has experi - enced 111 consecutive months of positive job growth, continuing the longest positive job growth streak on record. The civilian unemployment rate, which in December 2019 remained at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent, has been at or below 4 percent for 22 consecutive months. Today's historically low level of unemployment makes rapid job creation more difficult as it becomes harder for companies to find available workers. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) started collecting data on job openings in 2000, the number of unem - ployed people exceeded the number of recorded available jobs until March 2018. Since then, there have been more job openings than unemployed people for a remarkable 20 consecutive months. In total, since the 2016 election, the economy has added 7 million jobs, more than the population of Massachusetts.2 These job gains are impressive, given that the economic recovery since the Great Recession became the lon - gest in United States history during the summer of 2019. Figure 2-1 shows the total number of jobs by quarter. Before the 2016 election, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expected job growth to slow and the total number of jobs to level off, as workers who were out of the labor force were largely expected to remain on the sidelines (CBO 2016). Instead, job growth under President Trump 1 Tax cuts also increase the supply of labor, as after-tax wages increase for a given pretax wage. Because supply and demand both increase, quantity will increase and the effect on price (wage) will depend on the relative magnitude of the increases.2 The most recent jobs data are preliminary and are subject to revision. 250-840_text_.pdf 73 2/7/20 3:46 PM70| Chapter 2has far exceeded the 1.9 million predicted by this point in the recovery by the CBO in its final preelection forecast. Americans coming from the sidelines to get jobs have led to employment growth at a similar rate as before the election, even as the unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows. Similarly, before the election, the CBO and the Federal Reserve forecasted that the unemployment rate, which had been declining steadily for many years, would level off at about 4.5 percent, as seen in figure 2-2 (FOMC 2016). As it becomes more difficult for employers to find available workers, employers will offer higher pay or expand the pool of workers whom they consider. Annual nominal wage growth reached 3 percent in 2019 for the first time since the Great Recession, and nominal wage growth has been at or above 3 percent for all but one month in 2019. Importantly, wage growth for many disadvantaged groups is now higher than wage growth for more advantaged groups. And the lowest wage earners have seen the fastest nominal wage growth (10.6 percent) of any income group since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Beyond this pay increase for low-income workers, from the start of the current expansion to December 2016, average wage growth for workers lagged that for managers, and that for African Americans lagged that for white Americans. Since President Trump took office, each of these trends has been reversed, contributing to reduced income inequality. When measured as the share of income held by the top 20 percent, income inequality fell in 2018 by the largest amount in over a decade. The Gini coefficient, an overall measure of inequality in the population, also fell in 2018 (U.S. Census 2019). \u000f*/ Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |71These employment and income gains have brought people from the sidelines into employment. In the fourth quarter of 2019, 74.2 percent of work- ers entering employment came from out of the labor force rather than from unemployment, which is the highest share since the series began in 1990. 3 Additionally, the prime-age labor force is growing, reversing losses under the prior administration's expansion period until the 2016 election. Under the prior administration's expansion period, the prime-age labor force shrank by roughly 1.6 million; in contrast, under the current Administration it has expanded by 2.3 million people so far. Importantly, a strong market for jobs creates work opportunities for those with less education or training, prior criminal convictions, or a disability. This movement from the sidelines into the labor market also pulls people out of poverty and off of means-tested welfare programs, increasing their self-reliance through economic activity while decreasing their reliance on govern - ment programs that incentivize people to limit their hours or stop working to qualify. The number of people living in poverty decreased by 1.4 million from 2017 to 2018, and the poverty rates for blacks and Hispanics reached record lows. Furthermore, the number of working-age adults without health insur-ance who are below the Federal poverty line fell by 359,000 between 2016 and 2018. Because of the strong job market and sustained wage gains, food insecurity has fallen and, as of August 2019, there are nearly 7 million fewer 3 This CEA calculation is from labor force transition data reported by the BLS.\u0016) (+'*4( participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) than at the time of the 2016 election. The caseload for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) has fallen by almost 700,000 individuals, and the number of individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance has fallen by almost 380,000 since the 2016 election. Similarly, Medicaid rolls are decreasing even as the U.S. population increases. Our analysis shows that this decrease is predominantly due to a reduction in the number of Medicaid-eligible individuals because of income growth, not eligibility restrictions. In addition to having encouraged these unprecedented gains for disad - vantaged groups, the Trump Administration is launching several new initiatives to increase economic opportunity by removing barriers to work. One of the most significant barriers is that available workers do not always have the skills and training required to fill available jobs. Additionally, available workers may not be located near available jobs. The increase in prevalence in occupational licensing has made it more difficult for individuals to find and take jobs in dif - ferent States. Individuals' labor market participation can also be limited by a struggling local economy, childcare responsibilities, opioid addiction, and prior criminal convictions. The Administration is addressing these barriers with initiatives like the National Council for the American Worker, the Pledge to America's Workers, the Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse, and the Second Chance Hiring Initiative. The Trump Administration continues its relentless focus on reducing poverty by expanding self-sufficiency. The CEA (2019a) accounted for the value of government subsidies for goods (in-kind transfers) like healthcare, food, and housing, and we found that\u2014contrary to claims from the policy community and the media\u2014poverty has decreased dramatically since the War on Poverty began in the 1960s. However, the war was largely \"won\" through increasing government dependency (demand side) rather than through promoting self-sufficiency (supply side), meaning that there is still more progress to be made. This is where Opportunity Zones come in. Opportunity Zones, which were created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are best understood as supply-side economic policies. These zones entail tax cuts, analogous to the corporate tax cut, designed to spur investment and drive up labor demand, and thus directly help the disadvantaged achieve self-sufficiency through increased economic activity. Supply-side tax cuts are the opposite of the traditional, failed approach to fighting poverty, which entails higher taxes to fund demand-side subsidies for healthcare, food, and other goods or services that incentivize people to limit their hours or stop working to qualify. Although the economic benefits of the Trump Administration's policies are widespread, this chapter's main finding is that a stronger U.S. economy over the past three years has especially helped racial and ethnic minorities, 250-840_text_.pdf 76 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |73less-educated individuals, people living in poverty, and those who had been out of the labor force. As the Administration continues to implement a pro-growth agenda, the benefits to these historically disadvantaged groups are likely to persist and intensify. This chapter is organized in two main sections. In the first, we outline how today's strong labor market is benefiting lower-income individuals and individuals in historically disadvantaged groups. In the second section, we discuss barriers that continue keeping some individuals from benefiting from a strong national economy, along with the actions the Administration is taking to address these barriers and add to historically disadvantaged groups' employ - ment and income gains.4 Shared Prosperity from Strong Economic Growth The Trump Administration's tax and deregulatory policies increase labor demand of firms. The continued economic expansion enabled by these policies has predictably been accompanied by a very strong labor market. As additional workers became more difficult to find, firms started considering a broader pool of potential workers. Low unemployment and strong wage growth have drawn workers into the labor force from the sidelines, increasing the quantity of labor supplied. The Current State of the Labor Market In December 2019, the national unemployment rate was 3.5 percent\u2014match - ing the lowest rate in 50 years.5 The unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for 22 consecutive months. This consistently low unemployment rate is an indication of a relatively tight labor market. Just as a low unemployment rate signals a strong labor market, a high number of job openings\u2014as measured by the BLS's Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\u2014indicates strong labor demand. Compared with the time of the 2016 election, there were over 1.4 million more job openings in October 2019. In total, there were 7.3 million job openings in October\u20141.4 million more than the number of unemployed persons. October was the 20th consecutive month in which there were more job openings than unemployed. Figure 2-3 shows the number of unemployed workers and job openings over time. Since the JOLTS data began being collected by the BLS in 2000, the cur - rent period beginning under the Trump Administration is the first time when there have been more job openings than unemployed people. 4 A version of this chapter was previously released as \"The Impact of the Trump Labor Market on Historically Disadvantaged Americans\" (CEA 2019b). 5 Unemployment statistics are produced by the BLS and are calculated from data collected in the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). Unless otherwise stated, the data are seasonally adjusted. 250-840_text_.pdf 77 2/7/20 3:46 PM74| Chapter 2As a result of a more robust U.S. economy, many groups that histori - cally have had a tougher time getting ahead are now gaining ground. Under the Trump Administration, many of these groups have reached notable lows in their unemployment rates (see table 2-1). In August 2019, the unemploy-ment rate for African Americans fell to 5.4 percent\u2014the lowest rate on record since the series began in 1972. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for African American women also reached its series low in August 2019. For Hispanics, the September 2019 unemployment rate achieved its series low of 3.9 percent (the series began in 1973). In 2019 the unemployment rate for American Indians or Alaska Natives fell to 6.1 percent\u2014the lowest rate since the series began in 2000. Figure 2-4 shows the unemployment rates for different racial and ethnic groups compared with their prerecession lows. The decline in unemployment after the recession and before the start of the Trump Administration was largely the result of a recovery from the losses during the recession. During the last two years, the black and Hispanic unemployment rates have fallen below their prerecession lows and Asian unemployment has fallen to its prerecession low. Among various levels of educational attainment, those with less educa - tion typically face tougher labor market prospects. The Administration's tax and regulatory policies, however, are stimulating labor demand and are help - ing to provide labor market opportunities for those with less education and of the Trump Administration (date)The Trump low is lowest since Education Less than high school 5.2 4.8 (Sept. 2019) 4.8 (Sept. 2019)Series began (Jan. 1992 ) High school diploma 3.7 3.2 (Nov. 1999) 3.4 (April 2019) April 2000 Some college 2.7 2.4 (Oct. 2000) 2.7 (Dec. 2019) Nov. 2000 Bachelor's or higher 1.9 1.5 (Dec. 2000) 1.9 (Dec. 2019) Mar. 2007 Race and ethnicity African American 5.9 5.4 (Aug. 2019) 5.4 (Aug. 2019)Series began (Jan. 1972 ) Hispanic 4.2 3.9 (Sept. 2019) 3.9 (Sept. 2019)Series began (Mar. 1973 ) White 3.2 3.0 (May 1969) 3.1 (April 2019) May 1969 Asian 2.5 2.1 (June 2019) 2.1 (June 2019)Series began (Jan. 2003 ) Age and gender Adult women (age 20+) 3.2 2.4 (May 1953) 3.1 (Sept. 2019) Aug. 1953 Adult men (age 20+) 3.1 1.9 (Mar. 1969) 3.1 (Dec. 2019) Oct. 1973 Teenagers (age 16-19) 12.6 6.4 (May 1953) 12.0 (Nov. 2019) Dec. 1969Table 2-1.

In September 2019, the unemployment rate for individuals without a high school degree fell to 4.8 percent, achieving a series low (the series began in 1992). Since the President's election, the unemployment rate for those without a high school degree has fallen at a faster rate than the rate for those with a bachelor's degree or higher. The gap between the two rates reached a series low under the Trump Administration. For people with a high school degree but not a college education, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent in April 2019, the lowest it has been in over 18 years. And for individuals with some college experience but no bachelor's degree, the rate fell to 2.7 percent in December 2019, the lowest since 2001. Persons with disabilities can have a harder time finding work, as can vet - erans. However, President Trump's policies are translating into economic gains for these populations as well. In September 2019, the unemployment rate for persons with a disability dropped to 6.1 percent, the lowest it has been since the series began in 2008.6 In April 2019, the unemployment rate for American veterans fell to 2.3 percent, matching the series low previously achieved in 2000.7 6 The unemployment rate by disability status is not seasonally adjusted. 7 The unemployment rate for veterans is not seasonally adjusted. \u0007$\"0- \u0001\u0001\u000e0'/$+' \u0001 * #*' -. Historically Disadvantaged Americans |77Working multiple jobs can be a negative labor market indicator if indi - viduals must work multiple part time jobs due to the lack of available full time work. However, having multiple jobs is not necessarily a negative economic indicator as the opportunities to supplement one's main source of income may be greater during expansions. The share of people with multiple jobs has been around 5 percent since the end of the Great Recession ( figure 2-5). It reached a high of 6.5 percent in 1996 and has been decreasing since that year. The data does not exhibit a strong cyclical trend, as the share of people working multiple jobs has declined during the last two recessions. It has declined by 0.2 percent - age point since the election; but the average under the Trump Administration has been 5 percent, and the annual average has been between 4.9 and 5.1 percent since 2010. Demographic Change and Labor Force Statistics In this subsection, we construct labor force participation rates that control for changing demographics over time. The demographically adjusted par - ticipation rates are near prerecession levels for Hispanics and have exceeded prerecession levels for blacks. The adjusted participation rates show that due to the strong labor market in recent years, many workers are coming from the sidelines and are reentering the labor force. Various measures of the labor market such as job growth and the unem - ployment rate indicate a strong labor market, but the labor force participa- tion rate has not recovered to its prerecession level. Before the recession, in December 2007, the participation rate was 66.0 percent. The participation rate fell during the recession and continued to fall during the recovery, reaching a low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, before rebounding slightly to its current level of 63.2 percent (in December 2019). In past recoveries, workers reentering the labor force due to the stronger economy caused the participation rate to increase. However, comparing participation rates over time can be compli - cated by demographic changes. To get a clearer picture of the labor market, we construct demographically adjusted participation rates by race and ethnicity, using 2007 as the reference period.8 Adjusting the labor force participation rate for changing demographics is necessary because participation varies predictably over a person's lifetime. The overall participation rate will depend on participation at each age and on the share of people in each age group. For example, as the overall population ages, a larger share of people are in the older age groups, where participation is lower due to retirement. The aging of the population therefore will likely cause a decrease in the participation rate, even if participation at each age is unchanged. The baby boom generation, which is currently leaving the labor force through retirement, is a relatively large generation. Even though workers 8 The choice of reference year is arbitrary; 2007 is chosen to facilitate comparison between current rates and precrisis rates. 250-840_text_.pdf 81 2/7/20 3:46 PM78| Chapter 2are coming from the sidelines and reentering the labor force due to the strong labor market, the positive effect on the participation rate is largely offset by retiring baby boomers, even as some boomers are working longer. Narrower measures such as the prime-age labor force participation rate (i.e., those age 25-54 years) offer one alternative to mitigate the effects of demographic changes on labor market measures across time. But this is only a partial solution, because there is still heterogeneity among groups of prime-age individuals, so prime-age participation is still subject to demographic shifts among the different age groups within the larger prime-age category. There can also be important participation trends among both older and younger workers that will affect the overall participation rate. Demographically adjusted par-ticipation rates are a single measure of participation that separates changes in participation from changes in demographics by holding demographics con - stant (Szafran 2002). To find this adjusted rate, the age and sex distribution of the population is first held fixed at a given reference period. The demographi - cally adjusted participation rate for each period is constructed by using that period's age- and gender-specific participation rates and the population of the reference period.9 Keeping in mind that the demographically adjusted labor force par - ticipation rate holds the age, race, and sex population distribution constant at 2007 levels, figure 2-6 presents the demographically adjusted labor force 9 We use the following age groups: 16-19, Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |79participation rate for blacks. The data are aggregated to the annual level due to the relatively small sample size at the level of race by gender by age group.10 The overall participation rate for blacks has fallen since the global financial crisis of 2007-8, although the decline during the recession was the continuation of a longer-term, downward trend starting in the late 1990s. The adjusted participation rate shows that much of this decline can be explained by demographic changes. The participation rate for blacks was higher in 2018 than it was before the Great Recession, and it is slightly below the peak in 2000 once the effects of an aging population are removed. For comparison, the adjusted participation rate for the entire population age 16 and above fell from 66 percent in 2007 to a low of 64.5 percent in 2015, before recovering to 65.9 percent in 2019. Adjusting for demographic change has a large impact on the labor force participation rate for Hispanics in recent years. Figure 2-7 shows the demo - graphically adjusted participation rate for Hispanics. From 1994 to the start of the Great Recession, demographic changes had a minimal effect on the overall participation rate for this group, as there tends to be little difference between the adjusted and unadjusted rates. However, the adjusted and unadjusted par - ticipation rates have diverged since the Great Recession. The unadjusted rate 10 The BLS does not produce seasonally adjusted monthly or quarterly labor force participation data by race for the finer-grained age groups needed to produce the demographically adjusted participation \u0016) 2initially fell by a relatively large amount and has only increased slightly during the recovery. The demographically adjusted rate has fully recovered and now exceeds its preelection level. Wage and Income Growth Over the past three years, the higher demand for labor and the tighter job market have been leading to larger wage gains, especially for the lowest-income workers. In the third quarter of 2019, the 12-month change in nominal weekly wages for the 10th percentile of full-time workers was up 7.0 percent (see figure 2-8).11 This is higher than the year-over-year change in the nominal weekly wage for the median worker (3.6 percent), and well above inflation. Furthermore, in 2019:Q3, median weekly wages for full-time workers without a high school degree were up 9.0 percent over the year. Figure 2-9 shows that, as of November 2019, nominal average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers grew at 3.4 percent year over year.12 Inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, remains modest, at 1.5 percent year over year in November. 13 Therefore, the real wages of private sector production and nonsupervisory workers increased by 1.9 percent during the year ending in November 2019. 11 Weekly earnings data are released by the BLS and are from the CPS. 12 Average hourly earnings are measured by the BLS in the Current Employment Statistics.13 December inflation data are not yet available at the time of Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |81Minorities are experiencing some of the fastest increases in pay. In 2019:Q3, African Americans saw their weekly earnings grow by 6.0 percent over the year, while Hispanics' weekly earnings grew by 4.2 percent. For com - parison, the 12-month change in weekly earnings for all Americans rose by 3.6 percent. In addition to faster earnings growth, lower-income households are seeing the largest benefits from deregulatory actions that lower the costs of goods and services. Box 2-1 shows an example of the beneficial impact of the Administration's deregulatory agenda on lower-income households. Poverty and Inequality The gains in employment and wages for those who had previously been left behind are lifting many out of poverty. In September 2019, the Census Bureau released its official measures of the economic well-being of Americans for 2018 using data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS). While Americans across the board generally saw improvements, the data show that there were larger gains among histori - cally disadvantaged groups. In 2018, the official poverty rate fell by 0.5 percentage point, to 11.8 percent, the lowest level since 2001, lifting 1.4 million Americans out of pov- erty. This decline follows a decline of 0.4 percentage point in 2017, meaning that the U.S. poverty rate fell almost a full percentage point over the first two years of the Trump Administration. In the CPS-ASEC, income is defined as \u0011\u0004\u0006\u0001\u0011-$ Bears the Burden of Regulatory Costs? Well-designed regulations promote important social purposes, but at a cost. The question of who bears the burden of regulatory costs is like the question of who bears the burden of the taxes needed to fund government spending programs. The Federal income tax has a progressive structure; thus, compared with lower-income households, higher-income households bear a greater share of the burden of taxation. Unfortunately, however, lower-income households can bear a disproportionate share of the burden of regulatory costs. We estimate that the cost savings from deregulatory actions in two sectors\u2014Internet access and prescription drugs (see figure 2-i)\u2014espe- cially helped lower-income households. These are two of the regulations whose benefits were estimated by the CEA (2019c). The lower burden of regulatory costs reinforces the gains in employment and wages from today's strong labor market. Costly regulations hurt lower-income households because they spend a larger share of their budgets on goods and services produced by regulated sectors of the economy. For example, in data from the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey, the poorest fifth of households spend 2.7 percent of their incomes out-of-pocket on prescription drugs, while the richest fifth of house - holds spend only 0.3 percent. The poorest fifth of households also spend a 2.4 1.3 0.9 0.6 0.3 *2 ./\u0001 + - )/\u0014 *) \u0001 + - )/\u0015#$- \u0001 + - CEA's estimates of consumers' savings as a share of their income, which applied the Consumer Expenditure Survey's quintile and expenditure data to national $) *( \u0001 / \u0001 250-840_text_.pdf 86 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |83money income before taxes. It includes cash assistance but not the value of in-kind benefits for government assistance programs or refundable tax credits targeted at low-income working families. Including the value of these benefits raises the total resources available to households at the bottom of the income distribution. We conduct an analysis later in this chapter that examines the effect of using after-tax and after-transfer income (including the value of in-kind transfers) on the changes in poverty during the Administration. Disadvantaged groups experienced the largest poverty reductions in 2018. The poverty rate fell by 0.9 percentage point for black Americans and by 0.8 percentage point for Hispanic Americans, with both groups reaching his - toric lows (see figure 2-10). The poverty rates for black and Hispanic Americans in 2018 were never closer to the overall poverty rate in the United States. Children fared especially well in 2018, with a decrease in poverty of 1.2 percent - age points for those under 18. Poverty among single mothers with children fell by 2.5 percentage points. Although real income at the bottom of the income distribution increased and the percentage of people in poverty fell, it can also be informative to exam-ine how these gains compare with gains elsewhere in the income distribution, which will be reflected in the changes in various measures of income inequal - ity. Inequality fell in 2018, as the share of income held by the top 20 percent fell by the largest amount in over a decade, as did the Gini index (an overall mea-sure of inequality in the population). In fact, households between the 20th and higher percentage of their incomes on Internet access. As a result, the costs savings from deregulatory actions in these two sectors represent 2.4 percent of the income for the poorest fifth of households, compared with 0.3 percent for the richest fifth. Many regulations also hurt lower-income households because they impose standards that tend to increase the price of those goods that are dis-proportionately purchased by lower-income households. For example, after controlling for other differences, Levinson (2019) finds that higher-income households purchase more fuel-efficient cars. As a result, he estimates that the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards are regressive and disproportionately burden lower-income households. The CAFE standards matter less to higher-income households because they prefer to purchase more fuel-efficient cars anyway. The 20 notable actions analyzed by the CEA (2019c) include other deregulations of standards that restricted the ability of lower-income households to choose the products that best suited their preferences and budgets. 250-840_text_.pdf 87 2/7/20 3:46 PM84| Chapter 240th percentiles of the distribution experienced the largest increase in average household income among all quintiles in 2018, with a gain of 2.5 percent. 14 Low unemployment, rising incomes, and declining poverty mean that more Americans are becoming self-sufficient. The caseload for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is on the decline, falling by almost 700,000 individuals since the election, as of March 2019. Meanwhile, the num-ber of individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) has fallen by almost 380,000 since the 2016 election. The decline in the official poverty rate mirrors a decline of 0.7 percentage point in food insecurity in 2018. 15 Since the 2016 election, nearly 7 million Americans have moved off the SNAP rolls. These substantial declines in enrollment suggest that a growing economy may lead to positive outcomes in moving families toward self-sufficiency. While some of the enrollment decline in welfare programs could be due to administrative or policy changes designed to prevent ineligible individuals from receiving 14 Data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which is a separate data source also released by the Census Bureau, showed that inequality increased from 2017 to 2018. The ACS has a much larger sample size than the CPS-ASEC, but it measures income less accurately. For this reason, the Census recommends using the CPS-ASEC for national income statistics, like inequality. 15 U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, using data from the December 2018 Current Population Survey Food Security Disadvantaged Americans |85benefits, it is possible that some otherwise-eligible individuals would be affect - ed.16 However, the decline in food insecurity combined with the decline in poverty suggests that the net effect of any administrative changes and the strong economy has been to reduce hardship, in turn reducing reliance on public benefits. Health Insurance and Medicaid Strong job growth is the key to expanding and improving access to health insurance. Employer-sponsored health insurance is by far the largest source of health insurance coverage in the United States. The employment and earn - ings gains that are reducing poverty are also driving a decrease in the number of people on Medicaid. Medicaid rolls are decreasing in both expansion and nonexpansion States, even though the U.S. population is increasing (see figure 2-11). Our analysis of the data indicates that the reduction in the number of people on Medicaid is due predominantly to a reduction in the number of Medicaid-eligible individuals because of income growth as opposed to eligibil - ity restrictions. The Census Bureau asks about health insurance coverage during the previous year in the CPS-ASEC. Individuals are classified as being uninsured if they lack coverage for the entire year. For each of the insurance types, indi - viduals are asked if they were covered by that type of insurance at any point during the year. Comparisons of insurance coverage in recent years have been complicated by changes in the CPS-ASEC data. In 2014, the CPS-ASEC revised its questionnaire to better measure health insurance coverage. Starting with the release of the 2019 data, the Census Bureau implemented improvements in data processing to fully take advantage of the revised questionnaire. Data for 2017 and 2018 have been released with the updated data processing, so consistent comparisons can be made for health insurance coverage in 2016, 2017, and 2018 using CPS-ASEC data.17 Table 2-2 shows the change from 2016 to 2018 in the number of people between age 18 and 64 with different types of health insurance coverage at different levels of income in the CPS-ASEC. For all individuals, the number of uninsured increased by about 2 million and the number covered by employer provided coverage increased by about 1.4 million. Directly purchased individ - ual coverage fell by 2.35 million people and Medicaid fell by 1.6 million people. The distribution of income relative to the Federal poverty line for the overall population of those age 18-64 shows that income relative to the poverty level 16 Administrative costs of program participation can prevent eligible individuals from enrolling in public programs (Aizer 2007). Administrative changes that increase the nonmonetary cost of enrollment could lead to an increase in the number of eligible individuals choosing not to enroll.17 The updated files are the 2018 ASEC bridge files and the 2017 ASEC research files. Note that the updated data processing will cause the health insurance estimates for these years to differ from the results using the production files that were published by the Census Bureau in the works by Barnett and Berchick (2017) and Berchick, Hood, and Barnett (2018). 3:46 PM86| Chapter 2increased, and the number of people living below the Federal poverty line fell by 1.6 million. Of the 2 million increase in the number of uninsured, 1.35 mil - lion have a family income 300 percent or more of the Federal poverty line. The number of people without insurance who are below the Federal poverty line fell by 359,000 between 2016 and 2018. These results indicate that from 2016 to 2018, the income gains for working age adults led to reduced participation in Medicaid. A particularly vulnerable population is children living in poverty. Table 2-3 presents the change in the number of people under the age of 18 years with different types of insurance by family income level. The number of uninsured children increased by 340,000 between 2016 and 2018, even as the total num - ber of children fell. Almost half the increase in the number of uninsured chil - dren is due to children in families that earn at least 300 percent of the Federal poverty line. The number of children on Medicaid (includes the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP) fell by 1.45 million, which is largely due to a decline in the number of children living in poverty. Some have argued that the decrease in the number of children enrolled in Medicaid and the increase in the number of uninsured is due to administrative changes that exclude eligible children and discourage otherwise-eligible children from being enrolled. 18 The small increase in the number of children below the poverty line who are 18 For example, see Goodnough and Sanger-Katz Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |87uninsured suggests that administrative changes may be playing a small role. However, the data indicate that income gains and the reduction in the number of children living in poverty are primarily responsible for the large decline in the number of children on Medicaid. The number of people without health insurance can increase for a num- ber of reasons. Two factors behind the increase in the number of uninsured over the past couple of years are the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) individual mandate penalty and a decline in the number of people who qualify for Medicaid and ACA exchange subsidies. One consequence of higher household incomes is that households will lose eligibility for public assistance programs. Because households have a choice to remain eligible by working less, revealed preference shows that the higher income more than offsets the loss of Medicaid or ACA subsidies in terms of their overall level of utility. The other reason why a lack of insurance is increasing is that some individuals thought the elimination of the mandate penalty applied to 2018, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set the mandate penalty to $0 starting in 2019. The CBO estimates that about 1 million people opted out of insurance coverage in 2018 due to the mistaken belief about the timing of the elimination of the mandate penalty (CBO 2019). For individuals who were only buying insurance to avoid the mandate penalty, the elimination of the penalty makes them better off (CEA 2018b). Full-Income Measures of Poverty Income at the bottom of the distribution is rising, and poverty, based on the Official Poverty Measure (OPM), is falling.

The potential to lose government benefits acts as a disincentive to participate at all in the labor market for those who are out of the labor market or to increase participation for those who are in the labor market, as the loss of benefits acts as a tax on increasing engagement with the labor market. Because of the level of wages and the available jobs, the labor market gains that are pulling people out of poverty on average more than offset the loss in government benefits in terms of total available resources. The OPM, which is based on pretax money income, has many limita - tions as a measure of the total resources available to a family, which leads it to understate resources for low-income families. The Full-Income Poverty Measure (FPM) overcomes these limitations by considering a broader resource-sharing unit\u2014the household instead of the family\u2014and by including a compre - hensive set of income sources. The FPM estimates the share of people living in poverty using a posttax, posttransfer definition of income. It subtracts Federal income and payroll taxes and adds tax credits (e.g., the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit) and cash transfers. It also includes the market value of SNAP, subsidized school lunches, rental housing assistance, employer-provided health insurance, and public health insurance (Medicare and Medicaid). 19 It is important to note, however, that despite using a comprehensive set of income sources, the FPM may still understate income due to the underreporting of income sources and especially transfers in survey data (Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan 2015). For more details on the FPM, see Burkhauser and others (2019) and chapter 9 of the CEA's 2019 Economic Report of the President . The OPM and FPM differ in how they define the unit that shares resources. Because there are economies of scale in consumption, the cost per person of achieving a given standard of living falls as the number of people in the unit increases. The FPM treats the household as the resource-sharing unit and adjusts the thresholds proportionally based on the square root of the number of people in the household. In contrast, the OPM restricts the sharing unit to those in the same household who have family ties. By using the household as the resource-sharing unit (which is standard in studies of income distribution), the FPM reflects the increasing rates of cohabitation among non-family mem - bers in the United States. Figure 2-12 shows the change in the poverty rate under the OPM from 2016 to 2018 compared with poverty measures that incorporate progressively broader measures of income. All measures are anchored to equal the official 19 We calculate the market value of public health insurance based on the cost of its provision, and it is adjusted for risk based on age, disability status, and State of residence (for additional details, see Elwell, Corinth, and Burkhauser 2019). The market value of employer-provided health insurance is included as well, and is imputed for 2018 because employer contributions are no longer reported in the CPS-ASEC. The CBO has used a similar method for valuing health insurance since 2013 in its reports on the distribution of income. 250-840_text_.pdf 92 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |89poverty rate in 2016 of 12.7 percent. The official poverty rate fell by 0.9 percent - age point from 2016 to 2018. Using the adjusted equivalence scale, making the sharing unit the household, and using the PCE as the preferred measure of inflation instead of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (called the CPI-U) caused the poverty rate to fall by 1.1 percentage points from 2016 to 2018. Moving to posttax and posttransfer income causes the reduction in pov - erty to be smaller. This reflects the fact that as individuals gain labor income (which is included in the OPM poverty measure), they receive less in tax credits and transfer income (including the value of in-kind transfers).The effective tax rate of individuals on public assistance can be very high, which can be a disincentive to increasing labor market participation. Given that the posttax and posttransfer poverty rate still fell by 0.6 percentage point, we can conclude that, overall, the increase in labor income more than offset the decrease in tax credits and transfers. Finally, including the value of employer-provided and publicly provided health insurance leads to an even larger decline in poverty, of 1.4 percentage points. This occurred even as enrollment in Medicaid fell, because the individuals losing coverage tended to be living above the poverty threshold. The decline is partially due to the value of public health insurance increasing over this period, which raised the full incomes of those who remain enrolled. The choice of income measure also affects the measurement of income inequality. When taxes and transfers are progressive, using pretax income \u0010\u0011\u000e % overstate the level of inequality. The United Nations' handbook on income statistics notes that the preferred measure of income is posttax and posttransfer (including in-kind transfers), as that allows for an evaluation of the effectiveness of redistributive policies as well as for meaningful com - parisons between countries with different degrees of redistribution (Canberra Group 2011). Elwell, Corinth, and Burkhauser (2019) calculate income growth by decile from 1959 to 2016. Using a posttax and posttransfer measure of income that includes government health insurance and the value of employer-sponsored health insurance, they calculate that the Gini coefficient was 0.341 in 2016, but it was 0.502 for the same year using pretax and pretransfer market income adjusted for household size. 20 Furthermore, the posttax and posttrans - fer income Gini coefficient was lower in 2016 than it was in 1959. Supporting Further Economic Gains The strong U.S. labor market has led to historic labor market successes, includ - ing higher incomes, lower poverty, and a reduced reliance on government programs for many groups of people who had been previously left behind during the economic recovery. In this section, we discuss some of the remain - ing barriers that are preventing people from fully benefiting from the strong labor market. The skills of the available workers may not match those needed by employers. There can also be a geographic mismatch between workers and jobs. Childcare costs, a criminal record, or drug addiction can also prevent certain individuals from fully participating in the labor market. Continuing the current rate of job growth, with the unemployment rate at a historically low level, will likely require drawing even more workers from the sidelines. This will require targeted policies, which the Trump Administration is pursuing, to address the barriers that have prevented these individuals from entering the labor force despite a very strong labor market. Making Sure That Workers Have the Skills to Succeed In a previous report, \"Addressing America's Reskilling Challenge\" (CEA 2018a), we outlined the emerging issue of the skills gap in the ever-changing U.S. economy. The skills gap refers to the situation whereby the skills of available workers are not matching the skills needed by employers. Even in a booming economy, the lack of necessary skills can prevent some individuals from enjoy-ing the benefits of a robust labor market. Our previous report highlighted the importance of addressing this issue, as well as the challenges facing workers and firms that seek to do so. The CEA also examined the existing infrastructure of Federal worker training programs and reviewed the evidence regarding their effectiveness 20 The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1, where values closer to 0 indicate greater equality. 250-840_text_.pdf 94 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |91(CEA 2019d). Overall, we found mixed evidence that these programs improve labor market outcomes. The programs may have small positive effects overall, but they may be more effective for particular groups of people and at certain times in the business cycle. The large number of these programs and their heterogeneity make it difficult to reach a single, general conclusion, but rather suggest that some programs are effective whereas others are failing to live up to their hoped-for potential. To help close the skills gap, the Trump Administration has taken action to address the limitations of these existing Federal worker training/reskilling pro - grams. The United States needs innovative solutions for worker training given the mixed effectiveness of the existing Federal programs. Addressing this prob - lem is necessary in response to employers' struggles to find skilled workers and to enable more people on the sidelines to benefit from the booming economy. In this context, to develop a national strategy for workforce develop - ment, the Administration has created the National Council for the American Worker (NCAW). The NCAW is addressing issues related to improving skills-training programs, focusing on private-sector-led approaches and promoting multiple education and training pathways for individuals to enable them to achieve family-sustaining careers. The NCAW is also focusing on enhancing transparency in the outcomes of Federal and State workforce programs to allow job seekers, policymakers, and program administrators to better under - stand which programs are effective. Additionally, with better data, there are opportunities to learn from the successes and failures across public programs and to shift resources to the types of programs that show the greatest returns. In the previous CEA (2019d) report, we did not determine an optimal level of government spending on employment and training programs, but we did argue that Federal efforts should shift their spending, depending on what the evidence says is the most effective. Among the current Federal worker training programs, Registered Apprenticeships have shown strong improvements in labor market outcomes, and the Administration has already increased spend-ing on these types of \"learn while you earn\" models. Additionally, job search assistance provided through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is more effective in improving job outcomes than is access to training funded by this act. Job search assistance aims to reduce the time an individual is unem-ployed and helps individuals assess their skill sets and address other barriers that may be preventing them from entering the workforce. Along with existing dedicated Federal programs, industry-led and non - profit-led sectoral training programs have shown significant promise in ran - domized studies. Sectoral training programs are industry-specific programs that seek to provide training for skilled, entry-level positions within a given industry. Currently, these programs tend to be small, focusing on a particular industry in a particular city, and are run by nonprofit groups in cooperation with State and local governments. A randomized study of three sectoral training 250-840_text_.pdf 95 2/7/20 3:46 PM92| Chapter 2programs found that they were effective at increasing participants' earnings (Maguire et al. 2010). A follow-up study of one of these programs found that the gains persisted and may have grown over time (Roder and Elliot 2019). Other randomized studies of sectoral training programs have also shown evidence of effectiveness (Hendra et al. 2016; Fein and Hamadyk 2018). The sector-based approach guides the Administration's proposed Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Program, which seeks to expand the apprenticeship model into sectors that have not traditionally used it. The private sector has taken note of the success of the sector-based approach and has launched similar programs to address industry-level worker shortages (see box 2-2). One option is to further scale up these existing industry-led sectoral training programs through Federal support. Finally, it could be beneficial to incentivize the private sector to invest in training. Private firms generally have a disincentive to provide training in general human capital because trained workers can be poached by other firms before the firm has recovered the cost of training. Yet even with this risk of employee poaching, firms will provide training in general skills when the labor market is tight and new workers are difficult to find. Firms also provide general training as a fringe benefit in order to improve employee retention. Financial incentives, in the form of subsidies for private sector training, are less likely to be effective if they end up subsidizing training that the firms would have Box 2-2. The Federation of Advanced Manufacturing Education Industry collaboration is one solution to the shortage of skilled workers in a given area. An example of a program built on this model is the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME), which is a cooperative orga - nization of employers that seeks to build advanced manufacturing career pathways. Businesses form partnerships with local community colleges to provide a specialized degree program whereby students can work at the busi-nesses while completing their associate degrees. FAME began as a successful partnership between Toyota and Bluegrass Community and Technical College in Lexington, Kentucky. A company sponsors a student in the Advanced Manufacturing Technician (AMT) program. The student goes to classes two days a week, and works at the sponsoring company three days a week. Once the student completes the associate degree, they have the option to continue full time at the company or to continue on to pursue a four-year engineering degree. The first class completed the AMT program in 2010, and FAME has expanded rapidly to additional sites. There are currently FAME operations in eight States, with multiple operations in the original state, Kentucky, where FAME now coordinates directly with and receives support from the State government. 250-840_text_.pdf 96 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |93provided even in the absence of the subsidy. The difficulty is to design incen - tives to encourage more private sector training without subsidizing training that would otherwise occur in any case. The Administration is working to better highlight the efforts of the private sector and to show the return on those investments to a company's bottom line as well as to a worker's increased wages and career opportunities. Through the Administration's Pledge to America's Workers, companies commit to pro - vide a given number of training or reskilling opportunities for their current and future workforces over a five-year period. To date, more than 350 companies have pledged to provide over 14 million new opportunities for American stu - dents and workers. Limiting Geographic Frictions in the Labor Market Although labor market data are often presented for the Nation as a whole, the national labor market is a collection of local labor markets. Available jobs and available workers do not always match geographically. Economic theory predicts that wages will rise in areas with worker shortages and fall in areas with surpluses of workers, causing workers to move to the areas with worker shortages. Yet moving itself can be very costly, which limits the degree to which migration can alleviate local labor market imbalances; but government policies and regulations can impose additional barriers and costs to moving to a different labor market. For over a year, monthly JOLTS data have illustrated the strong job mar - ket for people looking for work. The JOLTS data show that at a national level, there are more job openings than unemployed workers. For the first time, the BLS is producing experimental State JOLTS estimates that also allow for an analysis of job openings at the State level. These new data demonstrate that not only are there more job openings than unemployed workers nationwide, but this is true in most States as well (see figure 2-13). Comparing the number of unemployed people in each state from BLS data on State-level employment and unemployment to the number of job openings shows that, as of the second quarter of 2019, there were more job openings than people looking for work in 43 States and the District of Columbia. 21 Although State-level labor markets appear to generally be strong, some are in greater need of additional workers than others. The very best States in which to be looking for work, where there were fewer than 60 unemployed workers per 100 job openings, include many States in the Midwest and the Great Plains. The States where there are as many or more unemployed workers as job openings are Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Mexico. 21 The experimental JOLTS data are monthly. However, due to the limited sample size, they are calculated as three-month moving averages. The analysis here uses the June 2019 experimental State JOLTS data, which correspond to the average of the months in the second quarter. 250-840_text_.pdf 97 Historically Disadvantaged Americans |95In addition to booming job markets in many States, geographic mobility has reached the lowest rate in at least 70 years, declining by 0.8 percentage point over the year, to 9.8 percent in 2018 (see figure 2-14). This decline in mobility, which could be exacerbated by government policies that limit worker mobility, is one reason for the persistence of geographic disparities in the labor market. Although not discussed in this chapter, unnecessary regulations that drive up housing costs can also limit mobility into certain metropolitan areas with strong labor markets (see chapter 8). Reforming Occupational Licensing Occupational licensing requirements impose an additional cost on entering a given occupation. There is a wide range of licensed occupations, including plumbers, electricians, florists, and barbers (Meyer 2017). Some occupational licensing restrictions can be justified to protect the public, but the existing requirements for many occupations in many States include jobs that pose no physical or financial risk to the public. Instead, licensing is being used as a bar - rier to entry into a profession to artificially inflate wages for those already in the profession. A 2018 report from the Federal Trade Commission found that the share of American workers holding an occupational license has increased five-fold, from less than 5 percent in the 1950s to 25-30 percent in 2018 (FTC 2018). Obtaining the needed license and paying the necessary fees is a barrier that can be particularly prohibitive for those with low incomes, negatively affecting these workers by preventing them from entering professions where they would earn more even if they have the skill set to do the job. A 2015 report from the Obama Administration supports this claim, finding that the licensing landscape in the United States generates substantial costs for workers (White House 2015). One such cost is how licensing adversely affects worker mobility. Workers in licensed occupations see the largest reductions in interstate migration rates (Johnson and Kleiner 2017). Absent State agreements to recognize outside licenses, State-by-State occupational licensing laws prevent workers from being able to provide their services across State lines, or move to another State to work in a licensed profession. Johnson and Kleiner (2017) find that the relative interstate migration rate of workers in occupations with State-specific licensing requirements is 36 per - cent lower than that of workers in other occupations. There are substantial dif - ferences in relative interstate migration rates across occupations, particularly for jobs frequently held by middle- to low-income people. Teachers have one of the lowest relative interstate migration rates (about -39 percent). Electricians have a reduced relative interstate migration rate of -13 percent, while barbers and cosmetologists have such a rate of -7.5 percent. Occupational licensing can also serve as a barrier to upward economic mobility for low- to middle-income 250-840_text_.pdf 99 2/7/20 3:46 PM96| Chapter 2workers because it is associated with hefty administrative charges, test fees, tuition payments, and education and time requirements. Occupational licensing also affects the employment of military spouses. Military spouses had an unemployment rate of 18 percent in 2015, more than four times greater than the U.S. overall employment rate at that time (Meyer 2017). This is partially because military spouses regularly move across State lines, and those in licensed occupations are required to renew or reissue their licenses after moving to a new State. Additionally, military spouses are more likely to be licensed than the civilian population, and they are 10 times more likely to move across State lines in a given year. (For more details, see chapter 3 of the 2018 Economic Report to the President.) Overall, the evidence indicates that occupational licensing limits workers' ability to enter professions or move to new areas with greater opportunity. The regulation of occupational licenses is primarily at the State level, so there are limited options at the Federal level to reform occupational licens-ing, other than recognizing and supporting best practices at the State level. The Administration is currently evaluating these options. States can enter reciprocal agreements to recognize out-of-State licenses, work to standardize the licensing requirements for a given occupation across States, and expedite license applications for military spouses and others who hold an out-of-State license (FTC 2018). Opportunity Zones: Matching People, Communities, and Capital Historically, areas with less income grew faster than areas with more income, leading to convergence in income per capita. Since the late 20th century, however, this convergence has stopped or has possibly been reversed (Nunn, Parsons, and Shambaugh 2016). There are many explanations for this change, such as a slowdown in individuals with lower incomes moving to higher-income areas for better-paying jobs or businesses moving to lower-wage regions that have lower input costs (Ganong and Shoag 2017). The Opportunity Zone provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act seeks to counter the solidification of geographic economic inequality by bringing capital to low-income communities through tax cuts on capital gains. It con - trasts with antipoverty policies that increase taxes to fund transfers to low-income households, giving them income but not necessarily spurring opportu-nity in their communities. Under the Opportunity Zone provision, an investor who realizes a capital gain can defer and lower taxes on the gain if he or she invests it in an Opportunity Zone Fund. The fund, in turn, invests in businesses or properties in census tracts that have been selected as Opportunity Zones. If the investor keeps his or her money in the fund for at least 10 years, they receive the additional benefit of paying no taxes on the gains earned while invested in the fund. In doing so, the provision acts like a means-tested reduction in the 250-840_text_.pdf 100 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |97cost of capital, where the cost reduction only occurs in selected communities that meet the provision's eligibility requirements. The design of the Opportunity Zone provision improves upon that of the Federal New Markets Tax Credit (New Markets), which has arguably been the most significant Federal place-based incentive in recent years. Investors must complete an extensive application to the Department of the Treasury for approval before receiving these tax credits. In the 2018 allocation round, only 34 percent of applicants received credits (CRS 2019). This highlights another limitation of New Markets\u2014it has a cap. In 2018, the Treasury only awarded $3.5 billion in credits. In addition, recipients of credits must adhere to substantial compliance and reporting requirements (CDFI Fund 2017, 2019). The complex - ity of participating in New Markets and the limit on total allocations have led some to conclude that New Markets is unable to induce large-scale investment that can revitalize entire communities (Bernstein and Hassett 2015). The Opportunity Zone incentive, in contrast, has no application process or limitation on scale (CRS 2019). Within broad guidelines, the incentive lets investors act upon their insights about where to invest, in what to invest, and how much to invest. The Opportunity Zone statute also carves out roles for State and local governments and communities. States nominated tracts to become Opportunity Zones, and the Department of the Treasury made the final designation and ensured that the tracts met the income or poverty criteria in the statute. Many areas have incorporated the incentive into their broader development initiatives. Alabama, for example, adopted a new law to align its development incentives with the Opportunity Zone incentive. Today, there are 8,764 Opportunity Zones across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. possessions (CDFI Fund 2018). The zones are home to nearly 35 million Americans, and on average they have a poverty rate nearly twice as high as the average census tract. Opportunity Zones: Evidence of Investor Interest and Activity Early evidence indicates considerable investor interest in Opportunity Zones. The National Council of State Housing Agencies maintains an Opportunity Zone Fund Directory. As of July 2019, the directory listed 163 funds seeking to a raise a total of $43 billion (NCSHA 2019). The funds are diverse, with two-thirds hav - ing a regional focus and the rest a national focus. Most funds plan to invest in commercial development, such as multifamily residential or in hospitality, but more than half also plan to invest in economic or small business development. Evidence from real estate markets also suggests that the Opportunity Zone incentive is getting attention from investors. Data from Real Capital Analytics, which tracks commercial real estate properties and portfolios val - ued at $2.5 million or more, show that year-over-year growth in development site acquisitions in zones surged by more than 25 percent late in 2018 after the Department of the Treasury had designated the zones, greatly exceeding 250-840_text_.pdf 101 2/7/20 3:46 PM98| Chapter 2growth in the rest of the United States. Similarly, Sage, Langen, and Van de Minne (2019), using the same data, find that a zone designation led to a 14 percent increase in the price of redevelopment properties and a 20 percent increase in the price of vacant development sites. Sage, Langen, and Van de Minne (2019) only find appreciation effects for particular property types, and they conclude that the Opportunity Zone incen - tive is having limited economic spillovers in communities. Their data, however, only include very particular types of properties\u2014commercial properties valued at less than $2.5 million. An analysis by Zillow, which uses many more proper - ties and transactions, suggests that the zone incentive is bringing a broader economic stimulus. The year-over-year change in the average sales price for properties in zones reached over 20 percent in late 2018, compared with about 10 percent in tracts that met the zone eligibility criteria but that were not selected (Casey 2019). The greater appreciation in zones suggests that buyers expect zone tracts to become more economically-vibrant in years to come. Expanding Opportunities for Ex-Offenders Another barrier to employment is a prior criminal conviction, and not only because incarceration lowers the available labor force. Having a job can help someone just released from prison reenter society, and it reduces the likelihood of recidivism. There is evidence that strong job growth, particularly in manufacturing and construction, can reduce recidivism (Schnepel 2016). Guo, Seshadri, and Taber (2019) estimate that an increase of 0.01 percent in county-level construction employment decreases the county's working age population's recidivism rate by 1 percent. In December 2018, President Trump signed into law the historic First Step Act, which is aimed at establishing a fairer justice system for all, reducing recidivism, and making communities across America safer. Since this reform was signed into law, 90 percent of the individuals who have had their sentences reduced have been African American. Also since then, the Trump Administration has taken steps to provide individuals leaving prison with the opportunities and resources needed to obtain employment. This Second Chance hiring initiative is an effort coor-dinated across the Federal government, States, the private sector, and the nonprofit sector. Nonprofits serve a crucial role in assisting former prisoners to obtain transitional housing, counseling, and education. Across the Federal government, the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons have launched the Ready to Work Initiative, which links employers to former prisoners; the Department of Education is expanding an initiative that will help people in prison receive Pell Grants; the Department of Labor has issued grants to sup - port comprehensive reentry programs that promote work as well as grants to expand fidelity bonds to employers to assist formerly incarcerated individuals with job placement; and the Office of Personnel Management has made the 250-840_text_.pdf 102 2/7/20 3:46 PMEconomic Growth Benefits Historically Disadvantaged Americans |99Federal government's job posting website accessible to people serving in and released from Federal prisons. Americans are reaping the benefits of the First Step Act. Data in this area are scarce, but a number of positive anecdotes have been reported in the news. For instance, Troy Powell, a former prisoner and guest at the White House, had served 16 years in prison. When he was released in February 2019 under the First Step Act, he found a job at a lumber company in less than 10 days. A Cleveland native, Andre Badley, was released from a Federal prison in February 2019, and within three months was hired as a driver for Amazon. The number of such success stories will continue to grow as more inmates who have served their time and pose no danger to society are released and as more is done to prepare them for employment and a second chance. The Administration's initiatives in this area, like the First Step Act and Second Chance hiring, can help assist former prisoners seeking to reenter soci-ety as productive members of the community, meet the needs of businesses that may be struggling to find workers, and reduce crime across American communities. Supporting Working Families Since the start of the Trump Administration, supporting working families has been a top priority. In December 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which increased the reward for working by doubling the Child Tax Credit and increasing its refundability. The President signed into law the largest-ever increase in funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grants\u2014expanding access to high-quality childcare for nearly 800,000 families across the country. In addition, President Trump was the first president to include nationwide paid parental leave in his annual budget. The President has continued to support pro-growth, pro-family policies, including those that address obstacles that mothers of young children may face in entering the labor force. Figure 2-15 shows the labor force participation rate of mothers and fathers with young children. For fathers with a youngest child age 5 or under, the participation rate fell from 98 percent in 1968 to 94 percent in 2018. A similar decline occurred among fathers of older children. Though participation rates have fallen, the vast majority of fathers continue to either work or look for work. This high level of participation contrasts with par-ticipation among mothers with young children. For mothers with a child under age 6, participation increased from 30 percent to 66 percent between 1968 and 2000. This increase was driven largely by shifting cultural norms, as well as welfare reforms that rewarded and required work for those receiving welfare benefits and tax credits. However, participation rates stopped growing in 2000. Today, the participation rate of mothers with a child under 6 is 67 percent\u2014just 1 percentage point higher than their rate 19 years earlier. Moreover, the gender 250-840_text_.pdf 103 2/7/20 3:46 PM100| Chapter 2gap in participation rates stands at 29 percentage points for parents of children under age 6 and at 17 percentage points for parents of children age 6 to 12. Some parents opt out of the labor force on the basis of personal prefer - ence. For others\u2014especially mothers with young children\u2014the inefficiently high cost of childcare may play a role in their decision to remain out of the labor force. Thus, addressing this barrier to work by reducing inefficiently high childcare costs could potentially bring more parents into the formal labor force and increase economic efficiency. As documented in a recent CEA report (2019e), regulations that do not improve the health and safety of the children increase childcare costs, and these inefficiently high costs can weaken incentives to work. For the average State, as of 2017, the average hourly price of center-based childcare for a child age 4 represented 24 percent of the hourly median wage. Evidence on the responsiveness of work status and hours to childcare costs suggests that some of these parents would enter the labor force or increase their work hours in response to a reduction in the cost of childcare. The Administration is focused on ensuring that more parents have safe options for their children while simul - taneously giving parents more opportunities to work. Globally, the Administration is working to expand female labor opportu - nities as discussed in box Disadvantaged Americans |101Box 2-3. The Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative and Female Labor Force Participation Globally A wide range of circumstances can have an effect on a woman's decision about whether to participate in the labor force. For example, some women desire to partake in productive activities outside the formal labor market, such as taking care of children or family members. At the same time, increas - ing female labor force participation by offering opportunities to women not in the labor force who might otherwise elect to participate could have a substantial effect on a country's economy. Among the developed countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2018, the United States had a female labor force participation rate higher than 22 of 36 OECD coun - tries (the most recently available data for OECD-wide comparisons are from 2018). The lowest rate within the OECD was 34.2 percent (Turkey)\u2014a full 22.9 percentage points below the United States. Iceland had the highest female participation rate of all OECD countries\u2014about 21 percentage points higher than the United States. Although the United States has a relatively high female participation rate compared with other OECD nations, there may yet be opportunities for additional growth, given the higher rates in some peer countries (figure 2-ii). A number of factors can likely explain the differences in female labor force participation rates among developed countries in the OECD, including policy differences, cultural factors, and demographics. For example, Blau and Kahn (2013) estimate that almost 30 percent of the decrease in women's prime-age participation in the United States relative to other OECD countries between 1990 and 2010 can be attributed to differences in family-related policies such as those relating to childcare. For developing countries, too, there could be a range of reasons that women may opt against, or be prevented from, pursuing formal employment opportunities, including but not limited to discriminatory laws and practices, a failure to enforce relevant laws, and social and cultural practices that limit female employment opportunities or in other instances, a desire to partici-pate in other productive activities that are outside the formal labor market. Nevertheless, research has found that increasing opportunities for women to participate in the workforce has several potential positive outcomes. For example, the World Bank has suggested that increasing opportunities for women's workforce participation increases political stability and reduces the likelihood of violent conflict (Crespo-Sancho 2018). For low-income countries, increasing female labor force participa - tion rates also creates an opportunity for countries to increase the size of their workforce and achieve additional economic growth. When women are empowered economically, they reinvest back into their families and com - munities, producing a multiplier effect that spurs economic growth and can potentially create societies that are more peaceful. 250-840_text_.pdf 105 2/7/20 3:46 PM102| Chapter 2Accelerating women's economic empowerment is critical to ensuring that developing countries can achieve economic self-reliance, and transi - tion from being aid partners to trade partners. To this end, the Trump Administration established the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative, which seeks to spur growth in developing countries by promoting economic empowerment among women. W-GDP aims to economi-cally empower 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative fund. W-GDP focuses on three pillars: vocational education for women, empowering women to succeed as entrepreneurs, and eliminating barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the economy. W-GDP's third pillar addresses legal and cultural, employer practices, and social and cultural barriers that preclude women's economic empowerment in developing countries. On legal barriers specifically, W-GDP focuses on five foundational factors: economic empowerment on the basis of five principles: (1) access-ing institutions, (2) building credit, (3) owning and managing property, (4) traveling freely, and (5) working in the same jobs and sectors as males. There is much evidence showing that amending or passing laws in these categories results in measurable economic benefits\u2014both on an individual level and also on a global Historically Disadvantaged Americans |103Combating the Opioid Crisis Another barrier to labor market success for many are the high rates of drug addiction and overdoses. Beyond deaths from opioids, research suggest that the abuse of prescription opioids decreases labor force participation (Krueger 2017). The CEA estimates that the full cost of the opioid crisis was $2.5 trillion over the four-year period from 2015 to 2018 (CEA 2019f). This cost estimate includes the value of lives lost and also higher criminal justice costs, lost labor productivity, and higher healthcare and treatment costs. See chapter 7 for a discussion of the trends in opioid overdose deaths and steps the Administration has taken to address the opioid crisis. Conclusion The U.S. labor market is strong, even as the economy continues its record expansion. The Trump Administration's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation has contributed to a strong demand for labor and an increasing labor supply. We would expect to find the largest increases in labor demand in the indus - tries that benefit the most from deregulatory actions, but further research is required to confirm this. As unemployment falls to record low rates, groups that were previously left behind in the economy's recovery are beginning to see substantial benefits in job opportunities and income growth. The increase in labor market earnings is pulling millions of families out of poverty and off One estimate shows that eliminating discriminatory laws and prac - tices (both formal and informal) could have added $12 trillion to the global economy, 16 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP)in 2011 (Ferrant and Thim 2019). In terms of gender parity in the workforce, a McKinsey & Company report estimates that if barriers to participation in the workforce were removed and women chose to participate in the economy identically to men, up to $28 trillion would be added to global GDP (or 26 percent) in 2025 (Woetzel et al. 2015). This includes adding $2.9 trillion to India, $2.7 trillion to the Middle East and North Africa, $2.6 trillion to Latin America, and $721 billion to Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, a World Bank (2014) report found that strengthening land rights has a positive impact on female farmer productivity. Evidence using data on women's property rights spanning 100 countries over a period of 50 years shows that legal reforms was correlated with higher female labor force participation and higher rates of women in formal (wage-earning) labor, in addition to higher educational enrollment. Overall, the W-GDP initiative is backed by economic research and evidence-based policy recommendations that would help empower women around the globe and boost global GDP. 250-840_text_.pdf 107 2/7/20 3:46 PM104| Chapter 2public assistance, showing how economic growth likely benefits historically disadvantaged Americans more than expanded government programs. However, there are still barriers that prevent lower-income workers from realizing the full benefits of the strong labor market\u2014such as skill mismatches, geographic mismatches, occupational licensing, distressed communities, prior criminal convictions, childcare affordability, and drug addiction. These barriers prevent many from finding jobs. The Administration is seeking to reduce these barriers to both labor demand and supply by focusing on improving worker training, reforming occupational licensing, incentivizing private investment in disadvantaged areas, facilitating the successful reentry of ex-offenders, assisting working families with access to high-quality and affordable childcare, and reducing the impact of the opioid crisis. Successful reforms in these areas will help to grow the economy by increasing the number and productivity of workers. The Administration's current and future economic agenda will focus on ensuring that all American households can benefit from strong, sustained economic growth. 250-840_text_.pdf 108 2/7/20 3:46 PM105 xChapter 3 Regulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy The Trump Administration's focus on deregulation has led to historic reduc - tions in costly regulation. The Administration has cut more than two significant regulations for each new significant regulation it has finalized, while maintain - ing critical protections for workers, public health, safety, and the environment. This fundamental shift in how the Federal government views regulation breaks with the decades-long accumulation of regulatory mandates that place high costs on the U.S. economy. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that after 5 to 10 years, this new approach to Federal regulation will have raised real incomes by $3,100 per household per year by increasing choice, productivity, and competition. Twenty notable Federal deregulatory actions alone will be saving American consumers and businesses about $1,900 per household per year after they go into full effect. These results show that the Trump Administration's deregula - tory actions across a vast array of American industries are among the most significant in U.S. history. Beyond eliminating outdated or costly regulations established by prior admin - istrations, the Trump Administration has also sharply reduced the rate at which new Federal regulations are introduced. The ongoing introduction of these costly regulations had previously been subtracting an additional 0.2 percent per year from real incomes, thereby giving the false impression that the American economy was fundamentally incapable of anything better than slow growth in real incomes and gross domestic product. Now, consumers and 250-840_text_.pdf 109 2/7/20 3:46 PM106| Chapter 3small businesses no longer need to dread the steadily accumulating costs of new Federal regulations. Concurrently with the 2017 Presidential inauguration, real growth in gross domestic product began outperforming experts' forecasts where it was previ - ously underperforming them. This should not come as a surprise, because studies that evaluate regulation across countries show that, all else being equal, countries that deregulated experienced more economic growth. The new regulatory approach also significantly reduces consumer prices in many markets\u2014such as those for prescription drugs, health insurance, and telecommunications\u2014while it prevents price increases in other markets. Furthermore, deregulation removes mandates from employers, which espe - cially benefits smaller businesses that, unlike their large companies, do not typically have a team of in-house lawyers and regulatory compliance staff to help them understand and comply with onerous regulations. By increasing choice, productivity, and competition, the Trump Administration's regulatory reforms have cut red tape for American businesses and have extended them greater freedom to create jobs. Given the Administration's ambitious plans for this year, deregulatory benefits for consumers, job creators, and the economy are bound to grow further in 2020. The Trump Administration's focus on deregulation has led to historic reductions in costly regulation, while protecting workers, public health, safety, and the environment. In January 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13771, \"Reducing Regulations and Controlling Regulatory Costs,\" which is the cornerstone of the Administration's regulatory reform suc-cess. Executive Order 13771 requires Federal agencies to eliminate two regula-tions for every new regulation issued (2-for-1), and has created incremental regulatory cost caps. After Executive Order 13771 was issued in fiscal year (FY) 2017, there were 13 significant deregulatory actions and only 3 significant regulatory actions (4-for-1). In FY 2018, there were 57 significant deregulatory actions and only 14 significant regulatory actions (4-for-1). In FY 2019, there were 61 significant deregulatory actions and only 35 significant regulatory 250-840_text_.pdf 110 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |107actions (2-for-1). In total, the Trump Administration has exceeded its 2-for-1 goal, though many critics thought that even 2-for-1 would not happen. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) previously looked at regulation across countries, finding that, all else being equal, countries that deregulated experienced more economic growth (CEA 2018a). We then related cross-country regulatory indices to potential regulatory developments in the United States and estimated that regulatory reform had the potential to increase U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by at least 1.0 to 2.2 percent over a decade. This chapter reexamines the impact of the Administration's regulatory reform agenda now that it has been more completely implemented. It also takes an alternative approach to the CEA's earlier analysis and estimates the aggregate economic effects of deregulation by examining specific Federal rules and by accounting for the unique circumstances of the industries targeted by the rules, in addition to the rules and industries similarly analyzed in previ-ous CEA reports. 1 Our analysis utilizes an economic framework that situates each industry in a larger economy that includes market distortions from taxes, imperfect competition, and other sources. To date, we have conducted industry-specific analyses for 20 deregulatory actions. The primary subject of this chapter is the impact of regulation and deregulation on nationwide real income. In contrast, guided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB 2003), Federal agencies and OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) prepare and discuss related calcu - lations of the benefits and costs of Federal regulations that do not typically calculate effects on GDP or nationwide real incomes. GDP and real income are of independent interest because they are important aspects of national accounting, and they are included in the budget forecasts made by OMB, the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, and the Congressional Budget Office, to name a few. 2 Moreover, economists and journalists routinely use GDP and real income as familiar metrics of the performance of the economy (Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni 2018). The CEA estimates that after 5 to 10 years, regulatory reform will have raised real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. 3 Twenty notable Federal deregulatory actions alone will be saving American consumers and businesses about $220 billion per year after they go into full effect. They will increase real (after-inflation) incomes by about 1.3 percent. Many of the most notable deregulatory efforts in American history, such as the deregulation of airlines 1 The CEA previously released research on some of the topics covered in this chapter; the text that follows builds on these reports (CEA 2019a, 2019b, 2019c).2 Estimates of the welfare effects of deregulation are therefore not enough by themselves to know, among other things, how GDP forecasts should be revised to account for the economic impact of deregulation.3 Throughout this chapter, all dollar amounts are in 2018 dollars unless noted otherwise. 250-840_text_.pdf 111 2/7/20 3:46 PM108| Chapter 3and trucking that began during the Carter Administration, did not have such large aggregate effects. Regulatory reform not only reduces or eliminates costly regulations established by prior Administrations, but also sharply reduces the rate at which costly new Federal regulations are introduced. The ongoing introduction of costly regulations had previously been subtracting an additional 0.2 percent a year from real incomes, thereby giving the false impression that the American economy was fundamentally incapable of anything better than slow growth. Now, new regulations are budgeted and kept to a minimum. In the first section of this chapter, we review the trends in Federal regula - tion before and after regulatory reform. We next turn to describing our general analytical approach and how we selected 20 deregulatory actions for analysis. The subsequent sections discuss the industry-specific deregulatory actions with the largest aggregate effects. We estimate large reductions in regulatory costs in the market for Internet access, healthcare markets, labor markets, and financial markets. Next, we estimate the additional cost-savings from reversing the trend of adding new regulations and regulatory costs each year. We also explain why some pre-2017 regulations carried disproportionate costs, and we offer a brief conclusion. Reversing the Regulatory Trend Before turning to industry-specific analyses, we provide an overview of the recent history of Federal regulation. This history is one of rapid growth until 2017, when the growth was halted by regulatory reform. Between 2000 and 2016, Federal agencies added an average of 53 economically significant regula - tory actions each year ( figure 3-1). In 2017 and 2018, the average dropped to less than 30. Figure 3-1 excludes rules that were deregulatory actions. As in previous years, in 2017 and 2018 a subset of the economically significant rules included in figure 3-1 are considered \"transfer rules\" and are not considered by OMB/OIRA to be either regulatory or deregulatory actions. When the transfer rules are excluded, in 2017 and 2018 the average number of economically sig - nificant regulatory actions falls to 10. The economically significant rules shown in figure 3-1 are those the Federal agencies and OMB/OIRA expected to have an aggregate impact on the economy of at least $100 million or to adversely affect the economy in a material way (Executive Order 12866). Figure 3-1 also shows the total numbers of \"significant\" rules, which include economically significant rules and \"other significant\" rules that meet part of the definition for economic significance or are important for other reasons described in Executive Order 12866. Including economically significant and other significant rules, Federal agencies added an average of 279 significant regulatory actions per year between 2000 and 2016; the average fell to 61 in 2017 and 2018 after regulatory reform. 250-840_text_.pdf 112 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |109Last year, the CEA discussed in depth the cumulative economic impact of regulatory actions on the U.S. economy and explained why the regulatory whole is greater than the sum of its parts (CEA 2019b). Based on the annual accounting of rules published in OMB's annual Reports to Congress, we found that regulatory costs grew by an average of $8.2 billion each year from 2000 through 2016. However, OMB's annual Reports for 2000-2016 only included 200 rules with fully quantified cost-benefit analyses. Over this same period, there were just over 900 economically significant rules; including other significant rules increases the count to almost 5,000. By definition, the regulatory actions expected to have the largest effects on the economy are included in the count of economically significant rules. However, this focus misses the sheer bulk of Federal regulation. This year, we use textual analysis of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to provide a broader and longer perspective on the cumulative regulatory bur - den. The CFR lists all regulations issued by Federal agencies and departments that are currently in force at the time of its publication; it is updated annually. RegData is a database applying textual analysis to the CFR that measures the restrictions imposed by the regulations based on the number of times words such as \"shall\" and \"must\" appear (Al-Ubaydli and McLaughlin 2014). Figure 3-2 shows the RegData index of regulatory restrictions from 1970 through 2019. The total number of regulatory restrictions in the CFR nearly tripled between 1970 (the earliest available data) and 2016, increasing from 400,000 050100150200250300350400 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016Economically significant rules Significant rulesFigure 3-1.

Note: Presidential y ears begin in February and end in January of the following year. Rule coun ts for 2017 and 2018 exclude rules considered economica lly significant deregulatory a ctions. Befor e 2017, we estimate o ne economically significan deregulatory action per year. 250-840_text_.pdf 113 2/7/20 3:46 PM110| Chapter 3to almost 1.1 million. Aside from a few isolated year-to-year declines, the trend was steadily upward through 2016. From 2017 through 2019 the trend flattened and began to reverse, showing the first declines in regulatory restrictions that have been sustained for more than a single year. The turnaround in the growth of regulatory restrictions parallels the turnaround in the growth of regulatory costs that the CEA documented last year (CEA 2019b). Last year we reviewed estimates of the total regulatory costs in the United States that ranged from almost half a trillion to over a trillion dollars. Putting those estimates together with the total number of regulatory restrictions implies that each restriction is on average associated with somewhere between $380,000 and $1 million of regulatory costs. Because deregulatory actions might involve words like \"shall\" and \"must,\" the RegData index of restrictions shown in figure 3-2 cannot distinguish between the impact of regulatory and deregulatory actions. To explore this, we searched the text of two Final Rules published in the Federal Register\u2014the 2016 regulatory action and the 2018 deregulatory action on short-term health insur - ance (discussed in more detail below and in CEA 2019a). The Federal Register text of the 2018 deregulatory action was longer and included 97 restrictions, compared to only 30 regulatory restrictions in the text of the 2016 regulatory action. It is not known to what extent this pattern generalizes to the RegData index of restrictions in the CFR. It seems likely that if it were possible to adjust 02004006008001,0001,200 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015Figure 3-2. Regulatory Restrictions by All Agencies, 1970-2019 Restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations (thousands) Sources: Code of Federal Regulations ; Mercatus Center RegData.2019 250-840_text_.pdf 114 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |111for restrictions included in the deregulatory actions taken since 2017, the index in figure 3-2 would show an even steeper decline beginning in 2017. Figure 3-2 includes restrictions due to Federal agencies covered by Executive Order 13771 as well as restrictions due to independent Federal agencies that are not subject to Executive Order 13771 accounting. In recent years restrictions due to independent agencies account for about 15 percent of all restrictions. Since 1990, the number of restrictions due to independent agencies has grown by about 75 percent. Even though the independent agen - cies were not subject to Executive Order 13771 accounting, starting in 2017 the growth in their regulatory restrictions began to decline. In addition to regulations, Federal agencies also issue guidance docu - ments that advise the public about the agency's approach to adjudication or enforcement. Figure 3-2 does not include regulatory restrictions stemming from guidance documents because they are not part of the CFR. Moreover, guidance documents are non-binding, so in principle they cannot impose bind - ing restrictions. However, a common concern is that agencies can treat guid - ance documents as binding in practice. Estimates suggest that some agencies issue anywhere from twenty to two-hundred pages of guidance documents for every page of regulations they issue (Parrillo 2019). To the extent those guid - ance documents impose regulatory restrictions that are binding in practice, the restrictions should ideally be added to the count of regulatory restrictions in figure 3-2. Although not reflected in figure 3-2, Federal agencies' guidance documents are subject to Executive Order 13771 accounting of the 2-for-1 requirement and regulatory cost caps. Significant guidance documents that increase costs are defined to be regulatory actions; guidance documents that yield cost savings are defined to be deregulatory actions. Figure 3-3 shows how CFR regulatory restrictions on the manufacturing industry has grown over time, until regulatory reform. RegData uses further text analysis to determine the applicability of the regulatory restrictions to spe - cific industries. The method uses search strings to identify phrases related to each industry (Al-Ubaydli and McLaughlin 2014). The resulting measure shows that regulatory restrictions on manufacturing remained roughly constant from the late 1970s until 1986. From 1986 through 2016, the number of regulatory restrictions almost quadrupled, from a little over 50,000 to more than 200,000. Again, starting in 2017, the upward trend reverses; the index shows sustained declines in regulatory restrictions on manufacturing from 2017 and 2018. The regulatory reform results to date are notable accomplishments, given that it is difficult and time-consuming to identify opportunities for appropriate deregulatory actions. In a follow-up to Executive Order 13771, in February 2017 President Trump signed Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,\" which requires each Federal agency to designate a regulatory reform officer to oversee deregulatory initiatives and policies. In an innovative response to meet this challenge, the Department of Health and 250-840_text_.pdf 115 2/7/20 3:46 PM112| Chapter 3Human Services began exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine- learning algorithms to identify opportunities for regulatory reform. As an example of the project's potential, the department discovered that 85 percent of its regulations created before 1990 have never been updated. Because regulatory reform takes time, Federal agencies' efforts that began in 2017 are continuing to unfold. As a result, important pending and in-progress deregulatory actions cannot be included in this chapter. For example, our analysis does not include the deregulatory actions related to emission and fuel economy standards for automobiles; once finalized, the SAFE rule might be the largest deregulatory effort to date. Other important deregulatory efforts include the Department of Energy's reforms of regulatory restrictions on resi - dential dishwashers and lightbulbs. Analyzing Regulatory Reform The Trump Administration uses regulatory cost caps to reduce the cumulative burden of Federal regulation. In addition to regulation-specific cost-benefit tests, the cost caps induce agencies to view all their regulations as a portfolio, which is more congruent with the experiences of the households and busi - nesses subject to them. While pursuing their agency-specific missions, the regulatory cost caps provide the framework for agencies to evaluate regulatory 050100150200250 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015Figure 3-3.

The CEA uses a pragmatic, streamlined approach to analyze the costs that regulatory actions impose on consumers, small businesses, and other economic actors. This approach requires making estimates of a small set of key parameters that describe the market that is primarily affected by the regulatory action in question. We follow a standard approach in cost-benefit analysis and rely on revealed preferences in markets (OMB 2003). For example, the price-elasticity of demand\u2014which shows how consumers change their con - sumption in response to a price change\u2014reflects the value consumers place on the good or service, relative to their next-best alternatives. For this reason, the price-elasticity of demand serves as one of the \"sufficient statistics\" to ana - lyze the impact of a policy change on consumer welfare within the regulated industry (Chetty 2009). 4 Detailed applications, and a sensitivity analysis, of our approach are given in our earlier reports (CEA 2019a, 2019b, 2019c). To account for effects outside the regulated industry, the analysis again takes a streamlined approach that does not require a fully detailed model of the economy (known as a structural general equilibrium model), but instead relies on an implementable formula that provides a good approximation of the excess burden that a regulatory action imposes on the markets for labor and capital (Goulder, Parry, and Williams 1999; CEA 2019b). For example, anticom-petitive regulation reduces the demand for labor and capital in the regulated industry and thereby reduces the aggregate quantities of those production factors. Marginal excess burdens in labor and capital markets are translated into an additional increment to aggregate output by dividing them by our 48 percent estimate of the marginal tax wedge, which is broadly interpreted 4 Our analysis is not as detailed as the regulatory impact analyses that Federal agencies conduct to comply with Executive Order 12866 (OMB 2003).This chapter is independent of the rulemaking process. Instead, this chapter contributes to the CEA's mission, as established by Congress in the Employment Act of 1946, to offer objective economic advice based on economic research and empirical evidence. Our analysis is consistent with the economic principles that guide cost-benefit analysis, including our focus on the key concepts of willingness to pay and opportunity cost. Another report (CEA 2019b) provides an additional discussion of our approach; and still another report (CEA 2019a) provides a detailed discussion of the methods used to conduct prospective cost-benefit analyses of three of the deregulatory actions considered in this chapter. Our approach complements agencies' completed analyses and fills in gaps, for example, when a regulatory impact analysis was not able to quantify costs or benefits, or when a regulatory impact analysis was not required. Note that, consistent with standard practice, shifts of resources between industries are not counted as a cost or a benefit or a real income effect, except to the extent that market prices indicate that the industries put different values on those resources. 250-840_text_.pdf 117 2/7/20 3:46 PM114| Chapter 3to include implicit taxes and imperfect competition. 5 This formula captures general equilibrium interactions that would be left out of an analysis that only considered the impact of the regulatory action in the primary market. OMB's guidance on cost-benefit analysis of federal programs (Circular A-94) recom - mends analysis of the marginal excess tax burden. To date, however, for prac-tical reasons the guidelines for regulatory cost accounting for the Executive Order 13771 regulatory budget have not required agencies to include the costs imposed on the private sector by excess tax burdens induced by regulatory actions. The analysis in this chapter demonstrates the feasibility and impor - tance of a more complete accounting of regulatory costs, including marginal excess tax burdens. The economic effects of regulation can be summarized in several ways, such as the costs to businesses, nationwide costs, nationwide benefits, or national incomes. The CEA employs three nationwide outcome concepts in this chapter: costs savings, net benefits, and real income. The distinction between the first two arises because a single regulation can create costs for one seg-ment of the population while it creates a benefit for other segments. We refer to the aggregate of these as the \"net cost\" of the regulation, which (aside from sunk startup costs) is equal to the \"net benefit\" of overturning the regula - tion. We refer to the \"cost savings\" of overturning the regulation as the costs imposed on the segment of the population that was harmed by the regulation. 6 Real income is similar to GDP, except that real income subtracts depreciation and reflects the effects of international terms of trade on the purchasing power of U.S. residents, which is an important result of one of the larger deregula - tory actions. GDP and real income, which can differ from welfare or \"utility,\" subtract the opportunity costs of the Nation's labor and capital as well as environmental and other nonpecuniary costs. As used in this chapter, all these concepts refer only to domestic benefits, costs, and incomes. The primary subject of this chapter is the impact of regulation and deregulation on nationwide real income; we estimate that over time, the impact of regulatory reform will be worth $3,100 per household each year. This chapter also estimates the net benefits of deregulatory actions. Some regulatory actions trade private goods for public goods, such as environmental quality. With public goods, and in other situations where private markets may fail, it is necessary to carefully consider the benefits and costs of regulatory actions. Even if the original regulatory action addressed a private market 5 An aggregate increase in a factor of production by 1 unit increases output by its marginal product (MP), but the entire output exceeds the net benefit (i.e., marginal excess burden) because the production factor has a marginal opportunity cost of supply. The net aggregate benefit of that 1 unit is 0.48*MP, where 0.48 is the marginal tax wedge. The additional output is therefore the net aggregate benefit divided by 0.48. 6 The CEA's concept of cost savings is analogous to the revenue savings from eliminating a Federal program, whereas the net benefit would be the difference between revenue savings and the forgone benefits of the program's expenditures. 250-840_text_.pdf 118 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |115Box 3-1. Looking Forward and Backward to Study Regulatory Reform Federal agencies conduct forward-looking, or prospective, cost-benefit analy - ses of proposed regulatory and deregulatory actions. In contrast, academic policy analysts typically conduct backward-looking, or retrospective, analy - ses of past public policies. For example, the definitive academic studies of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 were conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s (Winston 1993). The retrospective studies took advantage of data that reflected what actually happened in the deregulated airline market. However, analysts conducting either prospective or retrospective stud - ies face the challenging task of predicting market outcomes in a world that they cannot observe. Analysts in Federal agencies observe current market outcomes that, in many cases, reasonably approximate the \"no action\" base - line of \"what the world will be like [in the future] if the proposed rule is not adopted\" (OMB 2003, 2). But the agency analysts cannot look into the future and observe how the proposed rule would change market outcomes. In their prospective studies, the agency analysts use economic reasoning and empiri - cal evidence to predict what an unobserved, counterfactual world would be like if the proposed rule were adopted. Academics who conduct retrospective analyses of past policies face the opposite challenge. They observe market outcomes in the real world, where the policy was implemented, but they cannot observe the counterfactual world without the policy. The academic policy analysts must also rely on economic reasoning and empirical evidence to predict outcomes in a counterfactual world. Academic studies of airline deregulation illustrate the difficulty of doing an accurate retrospective analysis. Although the analysts observed airline market outcomes both before and after deregulation, they had to disentangle the effects of deregulation from other changes that affected the airline indus - try. In particular, airline deregulation in 1978 happened to coincide with an energy crisis that increased fuel prices and led to higher air fares and lower airline profits. Analysts took a counterfactual approach to isolate the effects of the energy crisis and to estimate the causal effects of deregulation\u2014lower air fares and higher profits (Winston 1993). When done well, prospective and retrospective analyses contribute valuable evidence about regulatory reform. Federal agencies, by necessity, must conduct prospective analysis of proposed actions. Likewise, in this chapter we mainly rely on prospective analysis in order to predict outcomes of the Trump Administration's regulatory reform agenda. Future academic research will undoubtedly conduct retrospective analysis and provide more evidence and new insights about the effects of the regulatory reforms that began in 2017. Research on the deregulations of the 1970s and 1980s provides reasons to be both optimistic and cautious about prospective analysis. When Winston compared predictions that deregulation would lead to lower prices to retrospective assessments, he described them as \"surprisingly close,\" 250-840_text_.pdf 119 2/7/20 3:46 PM116| Chapter 3failure, a deregulatory action is still warranted when the regulatory cost sav - ings outweigh the forgone regulatory benefits.7 GDP and real income capture the value of private goods production, but these measures do not capture the value of public goods or other important nonpecuniary effects. However, when including nonpecuniary costs and benefits that are not part of real income, we estimate that the deregulatory actions have a net benefit of more than $2,500 per household each year, compared with the previous trend of growing regula - tory costs. This gain stems from the implementation of the regulatory reform agenda and from achieving a better balance between the cost of regulations and their societal benefits. Because the preparation of this chapter occurred long enough after some of the regulatory or deregulatory actions to enable us to adequately measure relevant market outcomes, the CEA could also deviate from the regulatory impact analyses that accompany economically significant rulemaking by rely - ing more heavily on retrospective analysis (see box 3-1). Deregulatory Actions Considered We sampled deregulatory actions for industry-specific analyses. When appli - cable, we also examined the corresponding regulatory action taken by the previous Administration. The actions were sampled from four broad catego-ries.8 The first category consists of the statutes passed by Congress and signed by President Trump. The second category consists of the 16 Federal rules or guidance overturned under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) since January 2017.9 The third category consists of the rules in FY 2018 Regulatory Budget (i.e., the rules covered by Executive Order 13771 and finalized during that fiscal year, of which there are 261), as well as the rules in the FY 2019 Regulatory Budget 7 The concept of market failure plays a central role in cost-benefit analysis, but the existence of a market failure does not guarantee that the original regulatory action's benefits outweighed its costs. Market failure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for this conclusion. In practice, it is not clear that many of the 20 deregulatory actions we consider overturned regulations that addressed market failures. 8 In statistical terms, the categories are strata, and the overall population of interest consists of all economically important Federal regulatory actions taken since January 2017. Also see CEA (2019b, appendix I). 9 For each rule, Congress passed a resolution of disapproval that was signed by President Trump, thereby overturning the rule.even though they were \"often made more than a decade apart by different researchers\" (Winston 1993, 1272). At the same time, he noted that the eco - nomics profession's predictions failed to quantify the value of reducing the inconvenience costs of airline travel restrictions and \"grossly underestimated the benefits from deregulation\" (Winston 1993, 1276). 250-840_text_.pdf 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |117(OMB 2018).10 The fourth category consists of agency guidance documents and rulemaking by independent agencies. Because the purpose of this chapter is to estimate the aggregate eco - nomic effect of all new regulatory and deregulatory actions, as opposed to the effect of an \"average\" deregulatory action, we designed a sampling procedure to identify the likely largest actions in terms of economic impact. The average effect of the sampled actions is not necessarily a good estimate of the effect of the average unsampled action, but that is not our purpose. Rather, if the unsampled actions have an average effect that is in the same direction (but not necessarily magnitude) as the sampled actions, then the total effect of the sampled actions is a conservative estimate of the total effect of all the actions. Moreover, sampling the potentially larger effects yields a more accurate estimate of the total effect than sampling randomly. The omitted regulatory actions are those with few (most often, zero) comments from the public and little attention from Congress. These are the regulations where we have more confidence that the effects are comparatively small, so that excluding them from the total is less likely to have a large effect on our estimate of the total. 11 Our sampling procedure is not perfect. Some regulations attract atten - tion from the public or Congress for various reasons unrelated to their regu - latory costs. Our sample includes a few actions that we estimate have com - paratively small aggregate effects, even though they received many comments from the public. At the same time, there might be regulatory actions that will have large aggregate effects but are excluded from our sample because they did not receive many public comments. From the first category/stratum, we selected sections of two important new Federal laws enacted during the Trump Administration: the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. From the second category, we selected three employment rules that affect a large number of workers as well as the top four economic regula - tory actions, in terms of number of comments received from the public. From the third category, we selected the top six regulatory actions from FY 2018, in terms of the number of comments received from the public. We selected four regulatory actions from the FY 2019 Regulatory Budget that we expected to be among the comment leaders. Three of these contribute to both our estimate of the cost savings from deregulation since 2017 and to 10 A number of the 16 rules disapproved under the CRA were part of the FY 2017 Regulatory Budget. 11 To analogize, suppose that you wanted to measure the number of automobiles in a house. It would be unnecessarily inaccurate to take a random sample of rooms, because most of the time the garage would not be sampled and therefore most of the time the conclusion would be zero automobiles. Looking exclusively in the garage is the obviously superior alternative to a random sample. That is what the CEA has done with regulations: we looked exclusively at those with a significant chance of having a large economic effect. The formal statistical proof of this conclusion is provided above. 250-840_text_.pdf 121 2/7/20 3:46 PM118| Chapter 3our estimate of the costs of the growing regulatory state before that. 12 A fourth regulatory area with heavy commenting, and potentially large costs imposed by the previous Administration, relates to emission and fuel economy stan - dards for automobiles. To be conservative, we do not include any cost savings from deregulatory actions in this area.13 Finally, our sample of regulatory actions includes important guidance at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the approval of generic drugs, as well as a rule from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that received millions of comments from the public. All the comment leaders for FY 2017 and FY 2018 were deregulations rather than regulations, and most of them have had an economically significant nationwide impact. 14 And though we have not measured the economic impact of hundreds of other FY 2017 and FY 2018 Federal rules, the aggregate cost savings for the other rules reported in the Federal Register are in the direction of additional cost savings.15 Table 3-1 lists the regulations and our estimates, with 2 of the 18 rows (\"Savings arrangements\" and \"Joint Employer\") each showing the combined effect of a pair of deregulatory actions, so the table represents a total of 20 deregulatory actions.16 Although numbers of pages of regulations are not part of our quantitative analysis, it is interesting to note that the regulatory actions and their deregula - tory companions in our sample were promulgated with more than 6,000 pages of Federal statutes, the Federal Register, or separate agency impact analyses. 12 These are the Joint-Employer proposed rule (RIN 3142-AA13) from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and the Joint Employer proposed rule (RIN 1235-AA26) from the Department of Labor (DOL). Because our analysis does not separate the effects of the DOL guidance and the NLRB proposed rule on joint employers, technically we have also selected the NLRB rule, even though it is not part of any year's Regulatory Budget. The Fiduciary Rule (RIN 1210-AB82) is in the FY 2019 budget, but its temporary predecessor rule (82 FR 31278) also appears in the FY 2018 Regulatory Budget, with many comments.13 The Trump Administration has not yet finalized a rule establishing fuel economy or emissions standards for automobiles. The CEA plans to estimate its economic effects after such a rule is finalized. 14 The top 10 commented rules from each of the FY 2017 and FY 2018 budgets were all deregulatory actions. Most rules in the Regulatory Budget receive no comments.15 Some analysts have concluded that many regulatory impact analyses reported in the Federal Register omit important resource and opportunity costs of regulation (Harrington, Morgenstern, and Nelson 2000; Belfield, Bowden, and Rodriguez 2018), which holds on average in our sample. An example is the 2016 rule restricting short-term, limited duration health insurance while asserting that \"this regulatory action is not likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any one year\" (81 FR 75322), whereas the CEA (2019a) found the annual costs to exceed $10 billion (100 times the upper bound cited by the rule). This suggests that estimates of the costs savings from deregulation based on the Federal Register would be understated, although not necessarily relative to the cost additions of regulations.16 As is explained in more detail below, the pre-2017 regulatory actions that made table 3-1's deregulatory actions necessary are used to estimate the economic effects of a regulatory freeze. 250-840_text_.pdf 122 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory for joint employer rules includes anticompetitive effects of other DOL and Chapter 3Consumer Savings on Internet Access Deregulation frequently reduces consumer prices by enhancing competition and productivity. To show how this happens, we begin our analysis of specific Federal rules with two examples from the broadband or Internet service provider (ISP) industry, which includes wireless smartphone service as well as home Internet service over cables, telephone lines, fiber-optics, and satellites. Before 2016, ISPs were permitted to, and often did, use and share cus - tomer personal data, such as Internet browsing history, unless the consumer \"opted out\" of data sharing. With so many consumers staying with the default sharing option, ISPs could earn revenue both from subscriber fees, which are tracked by the industry's consumer price index (CPI), and from using or sharing customer data. Equivalently, the receipt of customer data allowed ISPs to earn the same profits with a lower subscriber fee. In effect, consumers paid for their subscription part with money and part by providing personal data. In 2016 the FCC proposed and finalized a broadband privacy rule requir - ing ISPs to have consumers to pay by default with only money, thus prohibiting the opt-out system and instead requiring the opt-in system. This rule, which was likely anticipated well before 2016 as the FCC was moving ISPs under the stricter \"Title II\" regulation (see below), was to go into effect on January 3, 2017. However, in 2017, Congress passed and President Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to overturn the 2016 FCC rule and prevent future Administrations from adopting similar rules. This 2017 deregulatory action assured market participants that the ISP market would proceed with low subscriber fees. By overturning the 2016 rule, the 2017 action restored the FCC's pre-2016 regulatory approach to protecting customer privacy. Consumers with privacy concerns may opt out and request that their ISP not share their data.17 Overturning the FCC's opt-in rule resulted in lower prices for wired and wireless Internet service, as shown by the CPIs graphed in figure 3-4. Wireless service prices fell at the same time that Congress was considering the resolu - tion of disapproval, and wired Internet prices fell a couple of months later. Both these declines are about $40 per subscriber over the life of the subscrip - tion, which is similar to independent estimates of the per-subscriber cost of 17 In 2013, AT&T introduced its Internet Preferences Program, which gave consumers the choice to opt out of data sharing. If consumers opted in and allowed data sharing, they received the lowest available subscription rate, which was at least $29 per month lower. Media reports suggest that the vast majority of consumers opted in; i.e., they were willing to allow data sharing in order to qualify for the lower subscription rate. 250-840_text_.pdf 124 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |121obtaining personal data consent from retail customers that are the basis for our quantitative analysis.18 At the aggregate level, we estimate the effect of overturning the opt-in rule to be a net savings (including a subtraction for the cost to consumers of providing personal data and an addition for producer surplus) of about $11 billion per year.19 Overturning the rule also encourages the aggregate supplies of capital and labor (CEA 2019b), as well as competition in online advertis-ing and other markets where consumer data are valuable. We estimate that these effects would create additional net benefits of $5 billion per year and 18 Staten and Cate (2003) report results from a credit card issuer that tried an opt-in program for personal customer information, and found that it cost an average of about $37 (converted to 2018 prices) per customer in terms of mailings and phone calls to obtain opt-in from their customers. Amortized over a 24-month wireless contract and over a wired Internet contract lasting 60 months\u2014i.e., about 4.0 percent and 1.0 percent of the retail price, respectively. Assuming that costs are passed through retail price according to the 60 percent markup rate measured by Goolsbee (2006) for the broadband industry, we predict retail price effects of 6.5 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. The actual price drops shown in figure 3-4 are 7.0 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. 19 We estimate that broadband industry revenue (wired and wireless combined) would be $202 billion per year under the FCC rule. We estimate that the consumers providing personal data as a result of the overturning of the FCC rule do so at an aggregate annual cost of $1.5 billion, offsetting an aggregate annual savings in subscription fees of $11 billion as well as an addition to producer surplus.Congress using CRA to nullify FCC rule 979899100101102 859095100105110Figure 3-4.

Before the Trump Administration, another FCC rule adopted in 2015 restricted the vertical pricing arrangements of ISPs\u2014that is, monetary transac - tions between ISPs and the providers of Internet content such as Netflix and Yahoo.21 The 2015 rule also imposed government oversight on communication services, making it difficult for these companies to quickly respond to competi - tion and provide new goods and services on the market. These vertical pricing and other restrictions are being removed by the FCC through its \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" order, returning to regulating ISPs under Title I of the Communications Act. Previous research shows that vertical pricing restrictions in broadband significantly reduce the quantity and quality of services received by broadband consumers.22 Hazlett and Caliskan (2008), for example, looked at \"open access\" restrictions that were applied to U.S. Digital Subscriber Line service (DSL) but not Cable Modem (CM) access. They found that three years after restrictions on DSL services were relaxed, in 2003 and 2005, U.S. DSL subscriptions grew by about 31 percent relative to the trend, while U.S. CM subscriptions increased slightly relative to the trend. Average revenue per DSL subscriber fell, while average revenue per CM subscriber was constant (although quality increased). At the same time, DSL and CM subscriptions in Canada, which was not experi - encing the regulatory changes, did not increase relative to the trend. Applying these findings to ISPs in the years 2017-27, we find that, by removing vertical pricing regulations, the Trump Administration's \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" 20 See also Goulder and Williams (2003) and Dahlby (2008). Throughout this chapter, as in our other reports (CEA 2019a, 2019b), we use a 0.5 marginal cost of public funds to approximate the extra-industry net costs of an industry's regulation, except when we estimate those costs to be primarily outside the United States (see especially figure 3-4 and the associated discussion).21 Both the vertical pricing restrictions and the opt-in requirement are linked to the alternative regulatory frameworks that the FCC has variously proposed for ISPs\u2014Title I versus Title II of the Communications Act. However, vertical pricing restrictions and the opt-in requirement are economically distinct and were also implemented by separate rulemaking (see, respectively, 81 FR 8067 and 81 FR 87274).22 See also Becker, Carlton, and Sider (2010, 499), who conclude that regulating vertical pricing in broadband \"interfere[s] with the development of business models and network management practices that may be efficient responses to the large, ongoing, and unpredictable changes in Internet demand and technology, . . .[which] is likely to harm investment, innovation, and consumer welfare.\" Flexible contracting between customer and supplier is generally expected to increase productivity because of the complementary relationship between the two, in contrast to contracts between two suppliers of the same good that have the potential to increase market power. 250-840_text_.pdf 126 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |123order will increase real incomes by more than $50 billion per year and con - sumer welfare by almost $40 billion per year. Consumer and Small Business Savings on Healthcare Deregulation is also reducing prices for healthcare. Figure 3 -5 shows an inflation-adjusted index of retail prescription drug prices compared with its previous trend growth. Prescription drug prices outpaced general inflation for decades; but in the past two years, they have fallen more than 11 percent below the previous trend as of May 2019, and below general inflation. In 2018, prescription drug prices even declined in nominal terms over the calendar year for the first time since 1972. Much of this is the result of the Trump Administration's efforts at the FDA, such as its 2017 Drug Competition Action Plan and 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap, to enhance choice and price com - petition in the biopharmaceutical markets. Under these policies, the FDA has approved a record number of generic and new brand name drugs to compete against existing drugs (CEA 2018b). 23 We estimate that the results of these actions will save consumers almost 10 percent on retail prescription drugs, which results in an increase of $32 billion per year in the purchasing power of the incomes of Americans (including both consumers and producers).24 The Trump Administration has also taken deregulatory actions in other healthcare markets, such as insurance. Previous CEA reports provided analy - ses of four healthcare deregulatory actions: the process improvements at the FDA reflected in figure 3-5, and three actions deregulating health insurance for individuals and small groups (CEA 2019a, 2019b). 25 These four actions, which remove restrictions and alleviate some of the costs of Federal policies introduced during the years 2010-16, are by themselves expected to increase average real incomes by about 0.5 percent, or an average of about $700 per 23 Another indicator of the quantitative importance of new FDA procedures is the July 2017 crash of the stock price of at least one foreign generic drug maker, which analysts attributed to \"greater competition as a result of an increase in generic drug approvals by the U.S. FDA.\" See Sheetz (2017).24 The 10 percent assumes that 1 standard deviation below the pre-2017 trend is due to factors other than deregulation. Retail prescription drug expenditures of $326 billion per year were measured by Roehrig (2018). Note that prices may have fallen even more than shown in figure 3-5, because in 2016 the Bureau of Labor Statistics changed its formula from geometric to Laspeyres, which increases the measured rate of inflation (CEA 2018b).25 The three health insurance actions are (1) reducing, through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the individual mandate penalty to zero owed by consumers who did not have federally approved coverage or an exemption; (2) permitting, via a June 2018 rule, more small businesses to form Association Health Plans (AHPs) to provide lower-cost group health insurance to their employees; and (3) expanding, through an August 2018 rule, short-term, limited-duration insurance plans. 250-840_text_.pdf 127 2/7/20 3:46 PM124| Chapter 3household each year. 26 Among those who benefit from these deregulatory actions are an estimated 1 million consumers who will save on their individual health insurance policy premiums by switching to less-regulated short-term plans, with savings that may exceed 50 percent.27 Also included are small busi - nesses, which may see substantial premium savings from obtaining access to cheaper large-group health insurance coverage. Employment Regulations Unlike large companies, small businesses do not typically have a team of in-house lawyers and regulatory compliance staff, making understanding 26 This average includes zeros for households not affected by the four deregulatory actions. For the purposes of calculating real income effects, we do not count parts of the net benefit that are consumer hassle costs because those costs are traditionally excluded from GDP, even though they are genuine costs from a consumer's point of view. Similarly, we treat the revealed preference value of public health insurance as part of \"net benefits\" but not GDP or real income, which traditionally are assigned those values according to cost rather than revealed preference value. As a result, the GDP effect of the health insurance deregulations is less than the net benefit, while the opposite tends to occur for other deregulations. 27 Part of the premium savings comes from the fact that the short-term plans restricted by the Obama Administration have different characteristics than the individual plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act. The CEA's (2019a) analysis shows how the Trump Administration's deregulatory actions reduced health insurance prices significantly, even after adjusting for differences in plan characteristics. See also our report (CEA 2019a) for sources on short-term plan premiums.Post inaugurationPreinauguration 1.71.92.12.32.5 July 2009 July 2011 July 2013 July 2015 July 2017 July 2019Figure 3-5.

Of the small businesses surveyed monthly by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) between 2012 and the election of President Trump, a plurality of surveyed businesses selected \"government requirements and red tape\"\u2014that is, regula-tions\u2014as their single most important problem 45 percent of the time they were asked. Though a plurality of small businesses have never selected regulations as their single most important problem since President Trump's election, regulations remain an important issue. During President Trump's Administration, the Department of Labor (DOL) and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) have been working to eliminate a number of regulations that disproportionately burden small businesses, reduce worker productivity and real wages, and distort competition in the labor market. The NLRB, under the Obama Administration, expanded the definitions of both joint employer and independent contractor, which, among other things, would have categorized some franchisers as joint employers of their franchisee employees. DOL had also changed its guidance under certain statutes regarding joint employers and independent contractors. Without the Trump Administration's proposed deregulatory actions, thousands of small businesses, including franchisees and subcontractors, would no longer be able to compete against larger corporations, and millions of workers' wages would have fallen due to the effect of these labor regula - tions. The CEA (2019b) estimates that, together, the Obama Administration's DOL guidance and the NLRB standard related to joint employers would have created more than $5 billion in annual net costs and reduced real incomes by about $11 billion. Federal rulemaking also plays a role in maintaining a level playing field for small businesses that are subject to State regulations. In 2015, DOL deter - mined that Federal rulemaking was likely required in order to permit States to mandate private employers to administer payroll deductions, with proceeds to be invested in State-managed individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and automatically enroll their employees in those accounts. In the revealed prefer - ence framework, the fact that a number of small businesses did not voluntarily offer these plans strongly suggests that the costs of administering these plans exceeded the value they create for employees. 28 Nevertheless, a number of States are requiring all employers to automatically enroll employees, and legislation is pending before other State legislatures to require the same. 29 If employers are forced to comply, the administrative costs, or the penalty for noncompliance, reduce what can be paid out in employee compensa - 28 Between 39 million and 72 million people work for an employer that does not offer a retirement plan (AARP 2014; Panis and Brien 2015; and the final rule). Following the standard approach in labor economics (Lazear 1979, 1981; Mortensen 2010), we assume that the composition of employee compensation maximizes the joint surplus of employer and employee.29 See State of Oregon (2015). 250-840_text_.pdf 129 2/7/20 3:46 PM126| Chapter 3tion, which is why Congress and President Trump overturned previous DOL rulemaking designed to facilitate the State-level employer mandates. The CEA uses the same economic framework for analyzing the IRA man - date that it used for health insurance mandates (CEA 2019a). 30 We assume that Federal rulemaking is relevant and will be affecting 10 million workers with an average annual IRA contribution of $1,571 per year. 31 We estimate that each $1,571 deposited in an IRA is, in present value terms, a transfer from the Federal Treasury to the worker of $526. Because employers need to be forced to provide the accounts, we infer that there is some combination of marginal employer and employee costs of providing a retirement plan that equals or exceeds $526 per worker each year. Conversely, this cost is bounded above by $526, plus the annual per-worker fine for noncompliance, which we take to be $250 per employee each year. 32 Following Harberger (1964), this makes the aggregate of the employer and employee costs $6.5 billion per year. 33 Adding in the deadweight cost of taxes, that is a net cost of $10 billion per year, most of which is borne outside the State implementing the program. As a real income loss (i.e., ignoring factor-supply costs in the net cost calculation), it is $13 bil - lion per year. In 2011, DOL proposed costly \"Persuader Rule\" amendments to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act that would potentially have generated reporting requirements for consultants (including attorneys) when the employer posed labor law questions, even if the attorney or consultant did not communicate directly with employees. 34 These amendments were 30 One difference is that the IRA mandates allow individuals to opt out without penalty. Our analysis assumes that some, but not all, workers affected by the rule will opt out. Research has found that automatic enrollment in retirement plans generates substantial inertia, so workers remain in plans that they would not have voluntarily chosen (Madrian and Shea 2001; Bernheim, Fradkin, and Popov 2015).31 \"Since 2012, 40 States have studied proposals for State-facilitated savings programs or considered or adopted legislation to create them. At least 10 States enacted legislation to expand access to retirement savings for nongovernmental workers. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon have all adopted auto IRA models\" (NCSL 2018). As to the average contribution, the CEA notes that the Illinois pilot had 196 employees investing an average of $392.86 per employee per quarter (about $1,571 a year) (Hayden 2018).32 The Illinois fine is $250 per employee a year (Hopkins 2015). California has a $250 penalty 90 days after receiving a noncompliance notice and a $500 penalty after 180 days (UC Berkeley Labor Center 2017). It is unclear whether and how often the State will send notices. It does not appear that Oregon has yet established its penalty.33 It is often the case in cost-benefit analysis that a reduction in subsidy payments is merely a transfer that leaves social benefits unchanged; the benefits to taxpayers are exactly offset by the costs to the recipients who lose the subsidy. The tax subsidy to IRA deposits is properly treated as a transfer when the task is evaluating the effects of the subsidy\u2014i.e., when comparing current policy with a hypothetical policy that has no tax subsidy for IRAs. But the purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the effect of relaxing restrictions on choices by employers and employees, not changing the tax subsidy rules for IRAs.

PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |127finalized and set to take effect in 2016, but were delayed due to ongoing liti - gation.35 The Persuader Rule amendments were rescinded by DOL in 2018. 36 Under the Persuader Rule, consultants (including attorneys) would have needed to file with DOL a Form LM-20, which becomes publicly avail - able, reporting the amount of their fee and the type of advice provided. 37 As another example, persons attending an invited talk at their local Chamber of Commerce related to employment law would have had their names \"likely disclosed to DOL and made [publicly] available.\" In order to comply with the Persuader Rule, a practitioner of labor law might have had to \"identify and segregate every increment of time billed to each of [their] clients for 'labor rela - tions advice or services' even if the firm was not doing any 'persuader' consult - ing under the New Rule for that client currently.\" The American Bar Association understood the Persuader Rule to require labor lawyers to violate their ethical duties to their clients (Brown 2016, 8-10), while some labor law firms refused to take on any work that would fall under the Persuader Rule's new reporting requirements.38 Due to the large number of employers subject to the rule, the midpoint of Furchtgott-Roth's (2016) estimates shows the rule to have ongoing compli - ance costs of $5.4 billion per year combined for employers, attorneys, and consultants. Initial costs of the rule were estimated as $3.6 billion. The CEA determined that 1 of the 18 components of the estimates may be overstated, and therefore we adjusted the ongoing costs downward to $4.9 billion per year in 2018 prices. The compliance costs come out of productivity and thereby have additional net annual costs of $2.4 billion, as they reduce aggregate sup - plies of capital and labor. These and other rules introduced by DOL and the NLRB during the Obama Administration had anticompetitive effects on the labor market.39 We do not attempt to parse the combined effects among the various rules and guidance, but instead allocate it entirely to the rules regarding joint employers, and we then avoid double-counting by omitting any competition costs of other NLRB and/or DOL regulations. The combination of regulations cited in this section would have reduced real incomes by about $45 billion per year, or an average of almost $400 per household each year. 35 See NFIB v. Perez (2016).

Congress and regulators raised banks' capital standards, imposed new stress tests, and bestowed new regulatory powers on bank regulators. Though these reforms were intended to reduce the risks created by large financial institutions, the Dodd-Frank Act's regulations imposed costly new regulatory requirements on small and mid-sized banks that did not pose a systemic risk. Ultimately, Dodd-Frank's overly broad regulations hurt lending to small businesses by unnecessarily burdening community and regional banks, which play an outsized role in supporting small businesses and local economies across the Nation. Per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's definition, community banks make up 92 percent of federally insured banks and thrifts, and they are responsible for 16 percent of total loans and leases. Community banks also hold 42 percent of small loans to farms and businesses. Also, in 2014 there were 646 United States counties in which the only banking offices belonged to community banks, and another 598 counties where community banks held at least 75 percent of deposits. Together, these counties made up almost 40 percent of all U.S. counties. The 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the \"Crapo Bill,\" signed by President Trump, removes the restrictions from smaller banks that were misapplied to them as part of earlier efforts to alleviate the \"too big to fail\" banking problem. The CEA (2019b) posits that this act \"recognizes the vital importance of small and midsized banks, as well as the high costs and negligible benefits of subjecting them to regulatory requirements better suited for the largest financial institutions. [It] is expected to reduce regulatory burdens and help to expand the credit made available to small businesses that are the lifeblood of local communities across the nation.\" Heightened consolidation among small banks (those with assets less than $1 billion) followed the enactment of Dodd-Frank, with the number of institutions declining by more than 2,000 (-31.0 percent) since 2011. Bank consolidation is not inherently uncompetitive, but consolidation that is driven by regulations reflects the distortionary burden of regulatory costs. After Dodd-Frank, the total loans by small banks has declined from $889 billion to $815 billion (-8.3 percent) since 2011. If these small banks had instead grown their loan portfolios by 1.55 percent\u2014the average of the past three expansions\u2014during this period, there would have been about 20 percent more small bank loans now than there actually are. These missing loans are associated with about $6.3 billion in additional annual value added in small banking, which we 250-840_text_.pdf 132 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |129estimate to produce about $3 billion in annual surplus for lenders and borrow- ers.40 Including effects on the entire economy due to additional employment and investment, the Crapo Bill has annual net benefits of almost $5 billion and raises real annual incomes by about $6 billion by removing regulatory burdens from small bank lenders. The CEA has also conducted industry-specific analyses of the effects of several other regulations that were introduced during the years 2010-16 and have been removed (or are in the process of being removed) during the Trump Administration. One of these was the attempt by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to largely eliminate the small dollar lending industry, which had revenues of about $7 billion per year in 2015 (82 FR 54479). Small dollar lending is a valuable service that provides consumers with important resources and flexibility to better manage their finances. The CFPB's analy - sis acknowledged that consumers found the loans helpful for paying \"rent, childcare, food, vacation, school supplies, car payments, power/utility bills, cell phone bills, credit card bills, groceries, medical bills, insurance premiums, student educational costs, daily living costs,\" and other pressing expenses (82 FR 54515). The CFPB predicted that its rule would reduce activity in the small dollar lending industry by 91 percent. The lost flexibility to use small dollar lending to help pay for pressing expenses is indicative of the opportunity costs of sharply contracting the industry. Using revealed preference methods, the CEA estimates a corresponding loss of consumer and producer surplus of $3 billion, and a reduction of real incomes by about $7 billion.41 Additional Regulations Among our sample of 20 rules, we find that 6 have comparatively small aggre - gate effects: DOL's Fiduciary Rule, the Security and Exchange Commission's Disclosure of Foreign Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, the Department of the Interior's Stream Protection Rule, the CFPB's prohibition of arbitra-tion agreements in financial contracts, the Waste Prevention Rule, and a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule implementing the Packers and 40 Our estimate of lender surplus uses the Lerner-index estimates from Koetter, Kolari, and Spierdijk (2012) and assumes a unit price-elasticity of loan demand with respect to net interest margin. 41 Assuming that the industry demand for small dollar lending is linear in the fees charged and has a point elasticity of -1, the lost consumer surplus alone is $2.7 billion. The lost consumer surplus is even more if the demand for small dollar lending has a constant elasticity, even if this elasticity were as far from zero, as is the firm-level elasticity of -4.28 estimated by McDevitt PM130| Chapter 3Stockyards Act.42 We estimated that eliminating these 6 rules, as the Trump Administration has done, increases real incomes by about 0.06 percent in total, which is about $11 billion per year. A 7th rule that has also been eliminated, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Rule, may technically have zero effect on GDP and real incomes because it raises the costs of Federal contractors whose contribution to GDP is by definition its costs. 43 Although the effects of these 7 rules are likely large compared with many of the rules not in our sample, $11 billion per year is a small fraction of the combined effects of the other 13 rules in our sample. We have not measured the economic impact of hundreds of FY 2017 and FY 2018 Federal rules, including a few regulations. However, the aggregate cost savings reported for the other rules as recorded in the Federal Register are in the direction of additional cost savings, suggesting that the cost savings from our sample of 20 deregulatory actions may be a conservative estimate of the cost savings from all regulatory and deregulatory actions since January 2017. The Doubling Effect of Shifting from a Growing Regulatory State to a Deregulatory One Before 2017, the Federal regulatory norm was the perennial addition of new regulations. As shown above, in figure 3-1, between 2000 and 2016, the Federal government added an average of 53 economically significant regulations each year. During the Trump Administration, the average has been only 10 (not counting deregulatory actions or transfer rules). Even if no old regulations were removed, freezing costly regulation would allow real incomes to grow more than they did in the past, when regulations were perennially added (shown by the dark blue line in figure 3-6), as with the 42 The Fiduciary Rule added to the costs of saving for retirement by further expanding the circumstances under which a financial adviser is considered to be fiduciary. DOL estimated at the time the rule was published in 2016 that it would benefit investors on net. The rule was vacated in toto by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Chamber of Commerce v. Department of Labor, 885 F.3d 360 (5th Cir. 2018). The Disclosure of Foreign Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule raised costs for U.S. extraction companies. \"Hydrological balance\" provisions of the Stream Protection Rule would shut down much of the U.S. longwall mining industry (Murray Energy Corporation v. U.S. Department of the Interior , 2016). The CFPB \"prohibit[ed] consumers and providers of financial products and services from agreeing to resolve future disputes through arbitration rather than class-action litigation,\" which would have raised the prices of consumer financial products (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2017). The Waste Prevention Rule added additional restrictions on \"oil and gas drilling and extraction operations on Federal and tribal lands\" (CEA 2019b, 287). The USDA rule interfered with vertical contracts in the production of poultry and pork, raising costs throughout the supply chains (8th circuit 2018).43 In contrast, raising the costs of private enterprises typically does reduce GDP and real incomes because their contribution to GDP depends on the value those enterprises create for their customers, as measured by what customers pay. The CEA notes that the production of some of the Federal contractors may be measured like those of private enterprises, in which case zero is a conservative estimate of the real income effect of overturning the rule. 250-840_text_.pdf 134 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |131yellow line in figure 3-6. The amount of extra income from a regulatory freeze depends on (1) the length of time that the freeze lasts and (2) the average annual cost of the new regulations that would have been added along the previous growth path. For the sake of illustration, figure 3-6 shows a freeze through 2021. We also have a conservative estimate of the average annual cost of regulatory additions during the years 2010-16, namely, the cost of 20 of the rules created during those years and identified in our sampling. At 1.3 percent of real income spread over those 7 years, that is an annual cost addition of about 0.19 percent a year (i.e., about $1,900 per household after 7 years). Those years are somewhat unusual in terms of numbers of new economically signifi - cant regulations, so we take the previous trend (for 2001-16) to be 0.16 percent a year. In other words, by the fifth year of a regulatory freeze, real incomes would be 0.8 percent (about $1,200 per household in the fifth year) above the previous growth path. As well as restraining the addition of new regulations, the Trump Administration has removed previous ones. As shown by the red line in figure 3-6, removing costly regulations allows for even more growth than freezing them. As explained above, the effect, relative to a regulatory freeze, of remov - ing 20 costly Federal regulations has been to increase real incomes by 1.3 percent. In total, this is 2.1 percent more income\u2014about $3,100 per household 2001 2006 2011 2016 2021Figure 3-6.

How Old Are Midnight Regulations? A number of the regulations reversed by the Trump Administration have been called \"midnight regulations,\" which are final rules published between Election Day and the inauguration of a new President. (Thus, midnight regula - tions refer to regulations finalized at the end of a Presidential term and before the change to a President of the other political party.) A new President can reverse the midnight regulations by using the standard rulemaking process to refuse to defend the regulations in court, or by (together with Congress) overturning them with procedures established by the 1996 Congressional Review Act (CRA). In theory, the publishing of a costly midnight regulation, along with its reversal soon afterward, could have little or no effect on industry or the wider economy if market participants recognize that the midnight rules would not last long enough to constrain economic activity. (If market participants anticipate use of the Congressional Review Act, a costly midnight regulation could have the opposite effect, because the CRA would prohibit all future administrations from promulgating the same or a similar rule imposing those costs, until a future Congress expressly approved that type of regulation.) However, the most costly of the 2016 mid - night regulations cannot be characterized this way because (1) they had been in the rulemaking process for years before the 2017 inauguration, (2) most of the 2016 polls and media predicted a different election outcome, and (3) the CRA had been used only once before 2017. Sixteen Obama-era regulations were ultimately nullified by the CRA. The more economically important of these are the Federal rule allowing States to mandate employers to provide retirement accounts (the \"IRA-mandate rule\"), the FCC rule regarding broadband privacy, and the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule requiring public disclosure of foreign pay-ments (RIN 1210-AB71; see also 1210-AB76, document FCC-2016-0376-0001, and RIN 3235-AL53, respectively). They date back as far as 2010 but became eligible for CRA nullification in the 115th Congress because challenges from courts and the public extended the rulemaking process until late 2016, or later. (See also Public Citizen 2016, which found that midnight regulations \"of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush took longer [3.6 years], and underwent more days of OIRA review than the average rule over the past 17 years.\") The IRA-mandate rule dates back to at least 2015. The proposed FCC privacy rule was released April 1, 2016, although arguably it was anticipated by the FCC's actions on \"net neutrality\" dating back to 2010. The CEA therefore sees the Obama-era economic regulations as part of a normal rulemaking process rather than an economically irrelevant signaling of a political platform. Although final rules follow their notices of proposed rulemakings with a time lag, and a new Administration may decline to finalize notices of proposed rulemaking from a previous Administration, the length of the time lag should not affect estimation of the medium- to long-term economic effects of deregulation or of a regulatory freeze. The length of the time lag does affect the timing of the economic effects. 250-840_text_.pdf 136 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |133each year\u2014relative to the previous growth path.44 (Also see box 3-2 on so- called midnight regulations.) Regulations Before 2017 with Disproportionate Costs The analysis thus far has primarily considered the effects of regulation on income, but regulation\u2014or the lack of it\u2014can affect well-being in nonpecuniary ways not captured by income. However, even when including nonpecuniary costs and benefits, we estimate that deregulatory actions have a net benefit of more than $2,500 per household each year, compared with the previous trend of growing regulatory costs. The gain stems from the fact that the new level of regulation strikes a better balance between the costs of regulations and their societal benefits, where benefits include things valued by people but not necessarily bought or sold in the marketplace (and that thus are not included in the National Income and Product Accounts or in the usual income measures). The Trump Administration requires Federal agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses of significant regulatory actions, including deregulatory actions, and that they only be issued \"upon a reasoned determination that benefits justify costs\" (OMB 2017). An example from health policy illustrates how regulations before 2017 created disproportionate incremental costs and benefits. The Affordable Care Act created an individual mandate in order to reduce the costs of uncompen - sated care.45 But the average annual costs of uncompensated care are about $1,000 per uninsured person (including zeros in the average for those who are uninsured who do not use uncompensated care during the year), whereas the annual economic costs of the individual mandate are over $3,000 per unin - sured person induced to purchase coverage (CEA 2019a). One economic reason that regulations before 2017 were so costly is that some of them were implemented with only a little \"safety valve\" in terms of an option for regulated businesses to pay a moderate fine in instances when compliance is especially costly. For example, whereas automobile manufactur-ers had the option of paying a penalty to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for falling short of Federal fuel economy standards, the EPA is prohibited by the Clean Air Act from adopting the NHTSA's penalty structure to enforce the greenhouse gas standard that began with model year 2012 (75 FR 25482). As another example, a consultant incorrectly filling out DOL Form LM-21 (one of the requirements under the rescinded Persuader Rule) would be exposed to criminal penalties. Another reason is that the labor 44 The red line's path in figure 3-6 is drawn as linear for illustration purposes only. The 1.3 percent effect (relative to a freeze) of deregulation is likely nonlinear over time, and it may take more than five years to be fully realized.45 Section 1501(a)(2)(F) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 250-840_text_.pdf 137 2/7/20 3:46 PM134| Chapter 3market is arguably the largest market of all, with annual revenues of more than $10 trillion, and it was the object of active rulemaking by DOL during the Obama Administration. Conclusion Coincidentally with the 2017 Presidential inauguration, real GDP growth changed from underperforming experts' forecasts to outperforming them (Tankersley 2019). The CEA's findings on the aggregate effects of regulations and deregulations may help explain this turnaround. Regulatory actions and their aggregate effects may be easily overlooked and underestimated because the actions are numerous and, if not seen through the lens of economic analy - sis, may appear cryptic to the general public. This chapter helps to narrow this information gap by showing the importance of the deregulatory agenda for everyday Americans as well as the national economy. Since 2017, consumers and small businesses have been able to live and work with more choice and less Federal government interference. They can purchase health insurance in groups or as individuals without paying for cat - egories of coverage that they do not want or need. Small businesses can design compensation packages that meet the needs of their employees, enter into a genuine franchise relationship with a larger corporation, or seek confidential professional advice on how to organize their workplaces. Consumers have a variety of choices for less expensive wireless and wired Internet access. Small banks are no longer treated as \"too big to fail\" (which they never actually were) and as subject to the costly regulatory scrutiny that goes with this designation. In addition to regaining freedoms that they once had, consumers and small businesses no longer need to dread the steady accumulation of costly new Federal regulations. In a time frame of 5 to 10 years, these landmark changes to regulatory policy are anticipated to increase annual incomes by about $3,100 per household ($380 billion in the aggregate), by increasing choice, productivity, and competition. This chapter arrives at its aggregate total by building estimates from the industry level. In doing so, it closely exam - ines specific Federal rules, accounts for the unique circumstances of the indus - tries targeted by these rules, and quantifies benefits of regulation\u2014such as consumer data privacy, environmental protection, fuel savings, and reductions in uncompensated healthcare. The analysis employs an economic framework that situates each industry in a larger economy that includes market distor - tions caused by taxes, imperfect competition, and other factors. The benefits of the newest wave of deregulation compare favorably with those during the most significant deregulatory waves of American history. Take the deregulation of airlines and trucking that occurred four decades ago, as the major parts of a deregulation wave described as \"one of the most important experiments in economic policy of our time\" (Winston 1993). Combined, the 250-840_text_.pdf 138 2/7/20 3:46 PMRegulatory Reform Unleashes the Economy |135Carter Administration's deregulation of these two industries provided net aggregate benefits of about 0.5 percent of national income. Although no 2 of the 20 deregulatory actions analyzed in this chapter have had (according to our estimates) such a large net benefit, their combined net aggregate benefits exceed 0.6 percent of national income.46 Other notable historical deregulations were of natural gas markets between 1985 and 1993, which had benefits estimated at about 0.2 percent of national income (Davis and Kilian 2011). This is hardly more than the com-bined net benefit of the three health insurance rules analyzed in this chapter. Moreover, the totals reported in this chapter reflect only deregulatory actions occurring during less than three years, whereas the full effects of the deregula - tion of airlines, trucking, and natural gas each reflect actions taken over almost a decade.47 . There is room for additional deregulation to further grow the economy, increasing benefits to American consumers, workers, and businesses. According to the accounting for Executive Order 13771, the projected cost savings from planned deregulatory actions in FY 2020 exceed the combined cost savings achieved in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Administration has also taken further steps to promote regulatory reform. On October 9, 2019, President Trump signed two regulatory reform Executive Orders. The first is titled \"Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents.\" Many dis - cussions of Federal regulatory and deregulatory actions, including most of this chapter, focus on rules adopted through the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment rulemaking process. In addition to such rules, Federal agencies issue nonbinding guidance documents. Although guidance docu - ments are not subject to the notice-and-comment requirements, some impose substantial regulatory costs. The new Executive Order's improvements to guidance documents include requirements that clarify their nonbinding status. Significant guidance documents are also now subject to cost-benefit analysis. The second Executive Order, signed on October 9, is titled \"Promoting the Rule of Law Through Transparency and Fairness in Civil Administrative Enforcement and Adjudication.\" In an economic framework, agencies' enforcement strate - gies can have important implications for regulatory costs (Fenn and Veljanovski 1988). Perhaps more important, the enforcement of regulations should be fair to the public. The new Executive Order \"prohibits agencies from enforcing rules they have not made publicly known in advance.\" Finally, in parallel with the 46 Winston (1993, table 6) reports net benefits accruing in the airline and trucking industries that hold aggregate factor supplies constant. In calculating the 0.6 percent for comparison, we also held aggregate factor supplies constant. 47 Murphy (2018, 76) cites \"U.S. Federal intervention into the petroleum industry in the 1970s [as] arguably the largest peacetime government interference with the economy in the nation's history.\" Arrow and Kalt (1979) estimate the cost of this intervention to be 0.2 percent of national income. Moreover, the 1979-81 deregulation did not realize this full amount in cost savings because price controls were replaced with a windfall profits tax. 250-840_text_.pdf 139 2/7/20 3:46 PM136| Chapter 3reforms of Federal regulations, the Administration has created the Governors' Initiative on Regulatory Innovation to encourage States to adopt regulatory reforms. The initiative will help governors and the White House work with lead - ers in local and tribal governments to cut regulatory costs, advance reforms to occupational licensing, and align regulations across levels of government. 250-840_text_.pdf 140 2/7/20 3:46 PM137 xChapter 4 Energy: Innovation and Independence U.S. energy innovation has continued to flourish under the Trump Administration. Innovation\u2014and the policies that support it\u2014lowers costs and prices, and increases production. This is illustrated by the American shale revolution and its dramatic rise in oil and gas drilling productivity in shale and similar geologic formations. Gains in shale drilling productivity have led to lower prices for natural gas, electricity, and oil, saving the average family of four $2,500 annually. Shale-driven savings represent a much larger percentage of income for the lowest fifth of households than for the highest fifth. Production growth due to shale innovation has also brought energy indepen - dence to the United States, a goal first set by President Richard M. Nixon, and pursued by subsequent Administrations, but accomplished under the Trump Administration. In 2017, the United States became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1958; and in September 2019, the United States became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products and is projected to remain a net exporter for all of 2020 for the first time since at least 1949. Historically, a rise in energy prices increased the trade deficit and costs for firms and households, sometimes pushing the U.S. economy into a recession. The innovation-driven surge in production and exports has made the U.S. economy more resilient to global oil price spikes. It has also improved the country's geopolitical flexibility and influence, as evidenced by concurrent sanctions on two major oil-producing countries, Iran and Venezuela. In addition to consumer savings and energy independence benefits, the shale revolution has reduced carbon dioxide and particulate emissions through 250-840_text_.pdf 141 2/7/20 3:46 PM138| Chapter 4changes in the composition of electricity generation sources. We estimate that from 2005 to 2018, the shale revolution in particular lowered carbon dioxide emissions in the electric power sector by 21 percent. This contributed to a greater decline in carbon dioxide and particulate emissions (relative to the size of the economy) in the United States than in the European Union, according to the most recent data. The Trump Administration's deregulatory energy policy follows earlier Federal deregulatory policies that helped to spur the shale revolution. By limiting unnec - essary constraints on private innovation and investment, the Administration supports further unleashing of the country's abundant human and energy resources. In contrast, the State of New York has banned shale production and stymied new pipeline construction, leading to falling natural gas production in the State, greater reliance on energy produced elsewhere, and higher energy prices. Similarly, evidence on renewable energy mandates at the State and Federal levels shows their costs and limitations. More broadly, predicting the evolution of energy markets and technologies remains difficult\u2014few antici - pated the shale revolution's effect on lower prices for natural gas, electricity, and oil or the current economic challenges in the nuclear power sector. This difficulty highlights the value of policies that avoid picking winners and losers and instead provides a broad platform upon which innovation will flourish. The classic effects of innovation are improvements in productivity, which lower costs and prices and increase production.1 Energy sector innovations\u2014and the policies that support them\u2014have similar effects and ultimately reduce prices for American households and businesses. This chapter describes the causes and consequences of growth in oil and natural gas production from shale and similar geologic formations, while also highlighting broader energy sector innovations and policy questions. We first discuss the dramatic rise in productivity and its effects on cost, production, and price. Second, we estimate the consumer savings brought by shale-driven declines in energy prices. Third, we document how the surge in shale production has led to 1 The CEA previously released research on topics covered in this chapter. The text that follows builds on the report \"The Value of U.S. Energy Innovation and Policies Supporting the Shale Revolution\" (CEA 2019). 250-840_text_.pdf 142 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |139U.S. energy independence, as measured by positive net exports of both oil and natural gas. Fourth, we assess total and shale-related changes in emissions in the United States. Finally, we consider the implications of deregulatory versus government-directed energy policies. From 2007 to 2019, innovation in shale production brought an 8-fold increase in extraction productivity (new well production per rig) for natural gas and a 19-fold increase for oil. These productivity gains have reduced costs and spurred production to record-breaking levels. As a result, the United States has become the world's largest producer of both commodities, surpassing Russia in 2011 (for natural gas) and Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2018 (for oil). The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimates that greater productivity reduced the domestic price of natural gas by 63 percent as of 2018 and led to a 45 percent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity. The increase in U.S. oil production linked to shale oil development helped not only moderate but also reduce the global price of oil over the same period in the face of \"peak oil\" fore-casts. By lowering energy prices, we estimate that the shale revolution saves U.S. consumers $203 billion annually, or $2,500 for a family of four. Nearly 80 percent of the total savings stem from a substantially lower price for natural gas, of which more than half comes from lower electricity prices. Because low-income households spend a larger share of their income on energy bills, lower energy prices disproportionately benefit them; shale-driven savings represent 6.8 percent of income for the lowest fifth of households, compared with 1.3 percent for the highest fifth. These consumer savings are in addition to eco - nomic benefits linked to greater employment in the sector. At the same time, shale-driven production growth has fulfilled the nearly 50-year goal of U.S. energy independence. In 2017, the United States became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1958; and in September 2019, the United States became a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products and is projected to remain a net exporter for all of 2020 for the first time since at least 1949. The long-standing goal of energy independence was motivated by the historic vulnerability of the U.S. economy to oil price spikes. Historically, a rise in energy prices increased the trade deficit and costs for firms and house - holds, potentially pushing the U.S. economy into a recession. In fact, a sudden rise in the price of oil preceded 10 of the 11 postwar recessions in the United States (Hamilton 2011). With energy independence, spikes in global energy prices continue to affect U.S. households and businesses, but they now have a more muted effect on gross domestic product (GDP) because they do not inflate the trade deficit as they did when net imports were high. From 2000 to 2010, a $1 increase in oil prices reduced the U.S. trade balance in goods by $0.83 billion; from 2011 to 2019, it reduced it by only $0.17 billion. Higher prices could even increase GDP if they cause a large enough increase in investment by U.S. energy producers. Greater exports and resilience to price shocks have 250-840_text_.pdf 143 2/7/20 3:46 PM140| Chapter 4also improved the country's geopolitical flexibility and influence, as evidenced by concurrent sanctions on two major oil producers. In addition to consumer savings and energy independence benefits, the shale revolution has reduced carbon dioxide and particulate emissions through changes in the composition of electricity generation sources. The CEA estimates that from 2005 to 2018, the shale revolution in particular was responsible for reducing electric power sector carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent. This contributed to a greater decline in carbon dioxide emissions and particulate emissions (relative to the size of the economy) in the United States than in the European Union from 2005 to 2017, the most recent year for data in both areas. The Trump Administration's deregulatory energy policy follows ear - lier Federal deregulatory policies that helped to spur the shale revolution. By limiting unnecessary constraints on private innovation and investment, the Administration's deregulatory policy supports further unleashing of the country's abundant human and energy resources. In contrast, the State of New York has banned shale production and stymied new pipeline construc - tion, leading to falling natural gas production in the State, greater reliance on energy produced elsewhere, and higher energy prices. Similarly, evidence on renewable energy mandates at the State and Federal levels shows their costs and limitations. More broadly, predicting the evolution of energy markets and technologies remains difficult\u2014few anticipated the shale revolution's effect on lower prices for natural gas, electricity, and oil or the current economic chal - lenges in the nuclear power sector. This highlights the value of policies that avoid picking winners and losers and instead provides a broad platform upon which innovation will flourish. Market Pricing, Resource Access, and Freedom to Innovate Growth in the extraction of oil and natural gas from shale and similar geologic formations\u2014often referred to as the shale revolution\u2014is arguably the most consequential energy development in the last half century. Its far-reaching consequences are in part because fossil fuels account for 80 percent of U.S. energy consumption (EIA 2019b). Most oil goes to fuel the planes, trains, and automobiles of the transportation sector, while most natural gas generates electric power or heat for industry and households. Since at least the late 1970s, geologists knew that shale and other low- permeability formations contained prodigious amounts of natural gas. For decades, methods to profitably extract the gas eluded the industry, much of which pursued easier-to-access resources in the United States and abroad.

The shale revolution came after major deregulatory changes in the governance of natural gas pricing and distribution. Three major deregula - tory actions\u2014the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 1985 Open Access Order, and the 1989 Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act\u2014liberalized access to pipelines and increased the role of market forces in determining prices paid to natural gas producers. Earlier price controls discouraged production and exploration, leading to supply shortages. Once freed to move with supply and demand, wellhead prices increased, encourag-ing more innovation, which eventually lowered prices (MacAvoy 2008). Prices, however, would begin to increase again in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Higher wellhead prices justified taking innovative risks on new methods and geologic formations, and private ownership of underground resources made it easy for firms to access these resources and experiment in diverse locations. The United States is unique in that the private sector\u2014homeowners, farmers, and businesses\u2014owns the majority of subsurface mineral rights. This system allows private owners to grant access to energy firms through lease contracts, which can be for one-tenth of an acre or 10,000 acres (Fitzgerald 2014). As a result, energy firms do not need to navigate a cumbersome central government bureaucracy to begin accessing subsurface resources. Although firms must still abide by Federal and State regulations, gaining the right to access resources is straightforward\u2014they just need to adequately compensate the owner of the relevant acreage. The role of the Federal government in unlocking the shale revolution is often overstated. Certainly, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) investment of about $130 million from 1978 to 1992 in Federal funding for research on drill bit technology, directional drilling, modeling for shale basin reservoirs, and microseismic monitoring of multistage hydraulic fracturing treatment helped spur sector innovation. A more detailed analysis shows that primary credit belongs to the private sector. Federally subsidized research to aid the development of shale gas in the East carried limited transferability to the early breakthroughs in Barnett shale formation. Moreover, an early tax credit aimed at stimulating the production of natural gas from unconventional sources expired in 1992, well before important breakthroughs in the early 2000s. 2 Among firms pioneering in shale extraction, the most important is arguably Mitchell Energy. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mitchell Energy, which had long-term contracts to sell its natural gas, experimented with methods to coax natural gas from a Texas geologic formation known as the Barnett Shale. 2 Wang and Krupnick (2015) discuss Federal government policies that may have aided Mitchell Energy as it experimented in the Barnett and generally conclude that subsidies, tax credits, tax-preferred business structure, and research and development played a secondary role. 250-840_text_.pdf 145 2/7/20 3:46 PM142| Chapter 4Consistent commercial success emerged in the early 2000s, when Devon Energy acquired Mitchell Energy. This acquisition accelerated the merger of two complementary technologies. Devon had considerable experience with horizontal drilling, which involves drilling a conventional vertical well, and at the bottom of the vertical leg, transitioning to a horizontal leg, which can extend for several miles. Mitchell Energy had more experience pumping liquids and sand under high pressure into wells to fracture low-permeability formations, thereby releasing gas and/or oil trapped in the rock. This stimula - tion technique is known as hydraulic fracturing (Wang and Krupnick 2015). Promising results from Devon's wells, coupled with rising natural gas prices, spurred a drilling boom in the Barnett Shale. Thus, the number of well permits issued in the Barnett grew from less than 300 in 2000 to more than 4,000 in 2008. The revolution had begun. The shale revolution may not have been sustained if it had not been for continued innovation by scores of engineers, geologists, and entrepreneurs, who refined and adapted methods to draw oil from western North Dakota and southern Texas as well as natural gas from Appalachia in the Eastern United States. Persistent innovation and opportunity for its diffusion has trans - formed energy markets, with considerable implications for consumers and the environment. Important innovations have also occurred elsewhere in the energy sec- tor. Advances in the design of combined-cycle turbines in natural gas plants have allowed the plants to generate more electricity from each unit of heat. From 2008 to 2017, the amount of heat needed to generate a kilowatt-hour of electricity declined by 10 percent. In addition, the cost of turbines, measured in dollars per unit of capacity, has fallen by 11 percent since 2014. Alongside more efficient and less costly natural gas turbines, the cost of wind power projects has also fallen recently, causing wind power prices to fall by more than 50 percent from 2010 to 2017. These gains stem from various factors, including larger turbines and lower manufacturing costs. Solar power generation has made similar gains. Innovations in these sectors proved complementary. Electricity from wind and solar technologies remain variable and present challenges for grid management because generation may not align with the demands of the electric grid in any given hour. Relative to most other sources of electricity, natural-gas-fired generators can quickly ramp up and ramp down generation to assist with grid integration and systems balancing requirements. Gains from innovation, however, have not occurred everywhere. Cellulosic biofuel produc - tion has grown slowly and is well below levels prescribed by a Federal mandate (see box 4-1). 250-840_text_.pdf 146 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |143Box 4-1. The Limits of Energy Mandates to Induce Innovation The directness of government mandates can have great appeal. Commands that the market conform to government targets, however, have limits in what they can achieve, as illustrated by the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard. Even when targets are met, they can come at a much higher cost than projected. To further U.S. energy independence and provide additional revenue sources to U.S. farmers, the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which was set in 2005 and expanded in 2007, mandated increases in the domestic produc - tion and consumption of renewable fuels. The standard mandated the use of different categories of renewable fuels, with type-specific targets increasing over time for most categories. Technology to produce ethanol from corn was well established by the mid-2000s, and corn-based ethanol production and consumption quickly increased and have generally kept in line with the tar - gets set in the 2007 statute. In contrast, technology to convert cellulosic plant material, such as corn fodder, into renewable fuels was not well established when the standard went into effect, and progress has been slow despite the mandate. As a result, the EPA has utilized its waiver authority, authorized in the 2007 statute, when setting targets for cellulosic biofuel ( figure 4-i). The cellulosic mandate has been waived every year since its establishment in 2010, resulting in no significant production of cellulosic biofuel. By 2019, the industry was to have produced 8.5 billion gallons 4The Effects of Innovation on Productivity, Prices, and Production Innovation raises productivity and lowers production costs, allowing firms to offer lower prices. This dynamic corresponds to the textbook case of an out-ward shift in the domestic supply curve, as shown in figure 4-1, for the case of natural gas. The shift means that firms produce more at every price level than they did before innovation, which lowers the market equilibrium price, which is shown on the vertical axis in figure 4-1 as a change in P, while increasing the quantity produced, as shown on the horizontal axis as the change in Qp. The lower price stimulates an increase in consumption, as shown on the horizontal axis as the change in Qc. Because of imports and exports of natural gas, the market price is affected by the global price and does not occur at the intersection of domes - tic supply and domestic demand. Before shale gas development, domestic consumption exceeded domestic production, leading to imports, as shown in figure 4-1 as the difference between domestic production and consumption before shale. After shale, domestic production exceeds domestic consumption, leading to exports. The Impact on Productivity Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing made the development of shale and other low-permeability formations economical. In the last decade, all growth in onshore oil and gas production has come from the development of these formations. One measure of innovation and productivity gains by energy producers is the quantity that new wells are producing relative to the number of rigs in use, which the DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks for all major shale formations. This measure, known as new-well production per drilling rig, is defined as the total production of wells recently brought into production divided by the number of drilling rigs recently in operation. New-well production per rig increased by more than 8-fold between 2007 and 2019 for key shale gas regions and by more than 19-fold for key shale oil regions. Particularly strong growth has occurred in the last five years for both oil and gas ( figure 4-2).3 The recent growth highlights how energy firms have continued to improve upon the earlier breakthroughs of shale pioneers. The productivity gains in production per rig stem from several factors that allow firms to generate more production from each rig per unit time. For example, across regions and over time, the number of days needed to drill a 3 The sharp rise in productivity in 2016 largely reflects firms deciding to operate fewer drilling rigs (because of very low prices) and focus on bringing wells already drilled into production. This can be seen by a sharp decline in drilled but uncompleted wells in 2016. Similarly, a rise in drilled but uncompleted wells in 2017 helps explain the apparent slowdown in productivity in that year. See EIA (2019) for estimates of drilled but uncompleted wells. 250-840_text_.pdf 148 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |145Figure 41.

The improvements come partly from firms drilling wells with longer horizontal portions, and from placing more wells per pad\u2014both of which allow each well and pad to access more oil and gas. Greater productivity reduces the cost of producing each barrel of oil or cubic foot of natural gas. Lower unit costs lead to a lower breakeven price, which is the price needed to cover the costs of drilling and operating an oil or gas well. Figure 4-3 shows an estimated breakeven price based on modeling of production costs in different regions. 4 From 2014 to 2019, the breakeven price for natural gas (averaged across key shale formations) fell by 45 percent; for oil, it fell by 38 percent. The link between productivity\u2014as measured by new-well production per rig in operation\u2014and breakeven prices is direct. Well operators typically lease drilling rigs, paying as much as $26,000 per day, so finishing a well in half the time yields considerable savings. Similarly, higher volumes of initial production return cash more quickly to the firm and can mean greater lifetime production from the well. 4 The breakeven price, calculated by BTU Analytics, is best interpreted as the price needed to justify drilling another well, assuming that the energy firm already holds the necessary acreage. The price for a given period is calculated based on historical production data and projections of future production to model revenue and costs for every well brought into production in the period. This analysis assumes a discount rate of 10 percent and a well life of 240 months. It is not based on energy firm calculations of their own breakeven costs and excludes potential costs that energy firms may incur, such as interest payments on debt and costs to acquire their acreage. \u0007$\"0- \u0001\u0001\b \" Dollars (2018) per thousand cubic feet \u0010$'\u0001 1 - \" ' !/ Independence |147The Impact on Prices and Production In its Annual Energy Outlook, the EIA projects energy-related outcomes for the coming decades. The projections incorporate detailed information and assumptions on resource reserves, emerging technologies, new policies, and numerous other relevant trends. The difference between projected and actual outcomes provides one measure of the surprise and disruption brought by the shale revolution. This difference does not necessarily isolate the shale revolution's contribution because markets may have evolved differently than expected for reasons other than shale. The 2006 Annual Energy Outlook, which made projections for 2005 and later, projected that natural gas production in the lower 48 States would rise gradually and reach 19 trillion cubic feet by 2018. Actual dry gas production for the lower 48 states reached more than 30 trillion cubic feet in 2018, 58 percent higher than projected, and now greatly exceeds that of any other country (figure 4-4). The production growth was not because of higher-than-expected prices. To the contrary, prices in 2018 were 46 percent lower than projected (figure 4-5). \u0002 /0 (right axis) 0369121518 20406080100120140 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017Figure 4-6.

Wholesale electricity prices oscillated around $80 per megawatt-hour from 2005 to 2008, but then dropped mark - edly as the price of natural gas fell. Although natural gas-fired generators have accounted for less than one-third of electricity generating in recent years, they play an outsized role in influencing prices in competitive wholesale electricity markets. This is because such generators are often the marginal generator of electricity, and their operators can adjust output quickly in response to the market with relative ease, making their costs and bid prices an important determinant of the market price of electricity. Figure 4-6 shows the close track - ing of wholesale natural gas and electricity prices, and several studies have documented a strong causal effect of natural gas prices on wholesale electric - ity prices (Linn, Muehlenbachs, and Wang 2014; Borenstein and Bushnell 2015). Turning to oil, the difference between projected and actual oil produc- tion is even starker than the case of natural gas. Actual production in the lower 48 States in 2018 exceeded the production projected by the EIA in 2011 by 85 percent, leading the United States to surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the top global oil producer.

The benefit of oil sector innovation, however, is still evident; since 2015, actual prices have been below projected prices, while production has greatly exceeded projections (figures 4-7 and 4-8). The Impact of the Shale-Induced Decline in Energy Prices A simple supply-and-demand framework permits estimating how much energy prices have fallen because of the shale revolution as opposed to other factors that have changed over time. For natural gas, we draw from Hausman and Kellogg (2015), who look at the market effects of shale gas from 2007 to 2013. Their analysis focuses on estimating the price of natural gas in a world without the shale revolution, noting that the actual change in price before and after the emergence of shale is not necessarily the causal effect of shale because the demand curve could have shifted. As a result, they estimate supply and demand curves for natural gas for 2007 and for 2013. The price of natural gas in the no-shale scenario is then estimated as the price at the intersection of Actual priceProjected price 35455565758595105115 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018Figure 4-8.

Our primary modifications to their price analysis are to use 2018, the most recent year for annual data, as the end year, not 2013; and to use more recent estimates of the supply elasticity of natural gas from Newell, Prest, and Vissing (2019). We also estimate the effect of lower natural gas prices on wholesale electricity prices. Natural gas plays a unique role in the electricity sector. In many parts of the United States that have competitive wholesale electricity markets, natural-gas-fired plants generated the marginal unit of electricity sold. As a result, a decline in their costs lowers the market price of electricity, meaning that all electricity generators, regardless of their fuel source, receive a lower price. Likewise, all buyers, regardless of who provides their electricity, pay a lower price. Linn, Muehlenbachs, and Wang (2014) studied the effect of the shale-driven decline in natural gas prices on electricity prices and found that across wholesale market hubs, a 1 percent decrease in the price of natural gas lowers the price of electricity by 0.72 percent. To estimate the shale-driven change in the wholesale price of electricity, we therefore multiply the shale-driven percentage change in the price of natural gas (described in the prior paragraph) by 0.72. For estimating the effect of shale oil on prices, we consider two surges in shale oil production, with the second surge associated with production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The first wave is defined by Kilian (November 2008-August 2015), and the second we define as January 2017-May 2019. For the first wave, we draw from Kilian (2017), who estimates the monthly Brent crude oil price absent U.S. shale oil development. For the second wave, we take the Killian effect from the end of the first wave and apply it to the change in U.S. shale oil production in the second wave, after taking into account the production cuts among OPEC countries since 2016. Kilian (2017) estimates the first shale oil wave reduced the global oil price by roughly $5.00 per barrel by August 2015. Extending his analysis to the second wave of production growth from shale, we estimate that the additional production further cut $1.29 per barrel by May 2019, resulting in a total price drop of $6.29 per barrel. This represents a 10 percent decline in the 2018 price of oil relative to what it would have been if the shale revolution had never occurred. Turning to natural gas, we estimate that in a no-shale scenario, the price of natural gas would be $7.79 per thousand cubic feet, which is given by the 5 Both prices are estimated by finding the price that solves a similar basic equation: Quantity Supplied (P) + Net Imports ( P) = Residential Demand ( P) + Commercial Demand ( P) + Industrial Demand (P) + Electric Power Demand (P), where P is the price of natural gas. The demand and supply curves are assumed to take the form not because of higher-than-expected prices. To the contrary, prices in 2018 were 46 percent lower than projected (figure 4-5). The unexpected production growth and price decline of natural gas spilled over to electricity markets. Wholesale electricity prices oscillated around $80 per megawatt-hour from 2005 to 2008, but then dropped markedly as the price of natural gas fell. Although natural gas-fired generators have accounted for less than one -third of electricity generating in recent years, they play an outsized role in influencing prices in competitive wholesale electricity markets. This is because such generators are often the marginal generator of electricity, and their operators can adjust output quickly in response to the market with relative ease, making their costs and bid prices an important determinant of the market price of electricity.

With the shale-driven outward shift in the supply curve, the price falls to $2.87 per thousand cubic feet, a 63 percent decrease. Put differently, natural gas prices in 2018 were 63 percent lower than they would have been if the shale revolution had never occurred, and they were far less variable. This is roughly the same percentage change in the Henry Hub price of natural gas over the 2007-18 period. Based on the estimates by Linn, Muehlenbachs, and Wang (2014), the lower price of natural gas implies that shale gas led to a 45 percent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity as of 2018. This estimated decline is also consistent with the wholesale futures price data listed by the EIA from the Intercontinental Exchange. In real terms, the weighted-average wholesale price across market hubs fell by 44 percent from 2007 to 2018. We note that retail electricity prices did not decline during the same period, in part because of State renewable portfolio standards mandating that a certain percentage of a State's electricity must come from renewable sources like wind or solar. At least 29 States have adopted such standards, with the first being Iowa in 1983. The most recent study of these standards finds that even modest renewable electricity targets bring considerable retail price increases (Greenstone and Nath 2019). They find that 12 years after a State adopted a renewable portfolio standard, retail electricity prices increased by an average of 17 percent. Over the same period, the standards raised the proportion of renewable electricity generation by at most 7 percentage points.6 Innovation-Driven Consumer Savings, Energy Independence, and Environmental Benefits This section first explores methods of estimating consumer savings from lower energy prices. Then it examines the salient findings related to these consumer savings. Next, it delineates the United States' path toward energy independence. And finally, it discusses the environmental benefits of the shale revolution. Consumer Savings\u2014Methods Lower energy prices can benefit consumers in diverse ways\u2014through lower bills for heating or lighting, less spending at the gas pump, and lower prices for goods or services that require considerable energy inputs such as airline travel or building materials. The standard approach to estimating the total consumer 6 This assumes that the state started with zero renewable electricity generation, which is why it is a generous estimate of the increase in renewable generation caused by the standard. The 7 percent is based on the finding by Greenstone and Nath (2019) that the gross renewable requirement increased to roughly 11 percent 12 years after adopting a standard and that the actual level of renewable generation was about 4 percentage points below the grow requirement. 250-840_text_.pdf 156 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |153benefit from a price decline is to calculate the savings for those consuming before the price decline, whose value is represented in figure 4-1 above by the rectangle formed by areas A, B, and C, and the savings on additional con - sumption spurred by the price decline, represented by area D.7 We take this approach for oil, multiplying the shale-induced change in the price of oil ($6.29 per barrel) with the pre-shale quantity consumed (about 7.0 billion barrels annually), and adding it to one-half the product of the price change and the price-induced change in consumption (0.1 billion barrels). We modify this approach for natural gas to account for the spillover effects in the electricity market. First, we estimate savings using the standard approach described above and following Hausman and Kellogg (2015), who break total demand into its sectoral components, including the electricity sec - tor. We first estimate savings for the electric power sector in the same manner as Hausman and Kellogg (2015); call this S HK. Their approach assumes that each $1 saved because of cheaper natural gas translates into $1 saved for electricity consumers. This is a reasonable approach for the share of the power sector with cost-of-service regulation, in which case regulators would only reduce compensation to natural-gas-fired generators, not to other generators, and only by as much as such generators had cost reductions. For the share of the sector without cost-of-service regulation, however, we translate the lower natural gas prices into lower wholesale electricity prices, following Linn, Muehlenbachs, and Wang (2014). The price-setting effect of natural-gas-fired electricity generators magnifies the effect of lower natural gas prices because the gas-driven decline in wholesale electricity prices applies to all electricity consumed in deregulated markets, not just the electricity generated by natural gas. We then assume that wholesale market savings pass through to retail savings, dollar for dollar, which is consistent with the research of Borenstein and Bushnell (2015), who find high rates of pass-through in deregulated markets. One-third of the electricity generated in the United States in 2018 was generated in States without cost-of-service regulation of generators.8 Based on this share, we estimate total electric power sector savings to be the sum of the savings in regulated markets (= 0.67 x S HK) and the savings from unregulated markets (= 0.33 x SWholesale). 7 The supply shift and price change will also affect producer surplus (not shown in figure 4-1), which is the difference between revenue and cost across all units produced and all producers. Whether producers benefit from innovation (as measured by producer surplus) depends in large part on how much prices fall and quantities increase. It is likely that there is a net loss in producer surplus for natural gas producers (Hausman and Kellogg 2015) but a gain for oil producers, whose production has increased greatly with only a modest price decline. 8 The EIA provided the CEA with an analysis of data from EIA Form 923, which collects detailed information from the electric power sector. The analysis showed that in 2018, 33 percent of electric power supply occurred in regional transmission organizations in unregulated states. 250-840_text_.pdf 157 2/7/20 3:46 PM154| Chapter 4The approach to estimating natural gas savings, which involves sector- specific consumption amounts and demand curves, permits calculating sav - ings for the residential, commercial, industrial, and electric sectors, which we collapse into two sectors: the nonelectric sector and the electric sector. For oil, we break savings into transportation and nontransportation sector sav - ings, allocating savings to the transportation sector based on its share of total petroleum consumption in the United States (70 percent) as reported by the EIA for 2018. Regarding the pass-through of energy savings to household income groups, we first allocate residential natural gas and residential electricity savings based on each income group's share of spending on natural gas and electricity, as reported in the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We then estimate the oil-related transportation sector sav - ings associated with direct household consumption by multiplying the total oil savings by the share of transportation sector energy use accounted for by light-duty vehicles such as cars and sport utility vehicles. These direct house-hold savings are then distributed to household income groups based on each group's spending on \"gasoline, other fuels, and motor oil,\" as reported in the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey. Finally, we allocate the natural gas, electricity, and oil-related savings that initially occur in the commercial and industrial sectors. We assume that the savings are eventually passed through to households in the form of lower product prices, with savings allocated to each household income group according to its share of total household expenditures, as reported in the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey. This is a common approach in the literature on the incidence of carbon taxes, which increase energy prices (Mathur and Morris 2014). It also has empirical support in important product markets (e.g., Muehlegger and Sweeney 2017). The exporting of some of the industrial sec - tors' output to global markets would suggest that the approach overstates savings to U.S. consumers. The shale revolution, however, has also reduced global energy prices, which would lower the costs of foreign producers, some of whom serve the U.S. market. We assume that these competing effects offset each other. Consumer Savings\u2014Findings By lowering energy prices, the shale revolution is saving U.S. consumers $203 billion annually, or an average of $2,500 for a family of four. Nearly 80 percent of the savings stem from a substantially lower price for natural gas, of which more than half comes through lower electricity prices ( figure 4-9). The large decline in the price of natural gas, and therefore large savings, is because domestic supply has overwhelmed domestic demand, and the capacity to liquefy and export natural gas to global markets has expanded too slowly to absorb the supply growth. Oil, in contrast, is economical to transport and is traded on a 250-840_text_.pdf 158 2/7/20 3:46 2.5 1.9 1.3 0246 Lowest 20 percentSecond 20 percentThird 20 percent Fourth 20 percentHighest 20 percentFigure 4-10.

As a result, oil accounts for the other 20 percent of the savings, most of which are transportation sector savings on fuel. Because lower-income households spend a larger share of their income on energy bills, the savings have greater relative importance for them. Energy savings represent 6.8 percent of income for the lowest fifth of households, compared with 1.3 percent for the highest fifth (figure 4-10). In other words, lower energy prices are like a progressive tax cut that helps the lowest house - holds the most. The variation in savings stems heavily from differences in spending on electricity; according to the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey, the bottom 20 percent of households account for 8.6 percent of expenditures in general but for 14.1 percent of electricity expenditures. We also considered the economic benefits of increased drilling and production on employment, income, and public revenues in differing regions as well (box 4-2).Box 4-2. Economic Effects Linked to Drilling and Production Although much of this chapter focuses on the shale revolution's effect on consumers, growth in drilling and production has also brought employment, income, and public revenues to producing regions and beyond. Relative to the State of New York's border counties, which have not had shale develop - ment, Komarek (2016) found that counties in the Marcellus region that were developed had a 6.6 percent increase in earnings. Across the United States, Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote (2017) estimate that new extraction increased aggregate employment by as much as 640,000 jobs. In addition to creating wage-earning opportunities, expanded drilling in places like North Dakota and Pennsylvania has also brought large payments to landowners holding rights to subsurface resources. Energy firms typically compensate resource owners by paying them a share of the value of production from their land. In 2014, production from major shale formations generated nearly $40 billion in payments to resource owners (Brown, Fitzgerald, and Weber 2016). Drilling and production can also generate revenue for some State and local governments and local school districts. Between 2004 and 2013, State revenues from taxes on oil and gas production in the lower 48 states nearly doubled, reaching $10.3 billion in real terms (Weber, Wang, and Chomas 2016). At the local level, increases in revenues have largely outweighed costs for local governments in most producing states (Newell and Raimi 2018). In certain states, such as Texas, oil and gas wells are also taxed as property and can therefore provide revenues to local school districts. For example, shale development in Texas's oil formations increased the property tax base by over $1 million per student in the average shale district, leading to 20 percent more spending per student (Marchand and Weber 2019). 250-840_text_.pdf 160 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |157Energy Independence Historically, a rise in energy prices increases the trade deficit and costs for firms and households, sometimes pushing the U.S. economy into a recession. For example, a sudden rise in the price of oil preceded 10 of the 11 postwar recessions in the United States (Hamilton 2011). The vulnerability of the U.S. economy to price shocks motivated a long-standing goal of U.S. Presidents: U.S. energy independence. President Richard M. Nixon began the push for energy independence, announcing Project Independence in 1973 when the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries halted oil shipments to the United States. In the ensuing years, Congress and the executive branch directed much attention and resources to pursue energy independence, including the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (1975), the establishment of the Department of Energy (1977), the Energy Policy Act (2005), and the Energy Independence and Security Act (2007). By a common measure of independence\u2014net exports (Greene 2010)\u2014the United States essentially achieved independence in both natural gas and oil at the end of 2019, and net exports are projected to grow in 2020 and beyond. Today's achievement, however, does not stem primarily from these govern - ment efforts but rather from private sector innovation that few expected. The shale-driven growth in domestic production documented earlier in this chapter reduced imports and, most recently, led to a surge in exports of both oil and gas. Fewer imports and more exports caused U.S. net imports of natural gas to fall below zero in 2017, making the United States a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957 (figure 4-11). And, in September 2019, net imports of crude oil and petroleum products fell below zero on a monthly basis ( figure 4-12). The United States is projected to remain a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products for all of 2020 for the first time since at least 1949. Energy independence\u2014as measured by positive net exports, and by increased sectoral diversification of the U.S. economy, especially in places like Texas\u2014means that higher global energy prices have a negligible or perhaps positive effect on the U.S. economy in the aggregate. With a large domestic energy sector, increases in investment by the domestic energy sector offset the effect of higher prices on consumers (Baumeister and Kilian 2016). If, for exam - ple, higher oil prices induce substantial new investment in drilling wells, with its associated demands for steel and equipment, GDP would likely increase as long as the reduced disposable income of consumers has a small effect on their overall spending (see box 4-2 for an in-depth explanation of the economic impact of increased drilling and production). This does not mean that the typical U.S. consumer is unaffected by higher oil prices or benefits from them. Rather, it means that the country's total output may expand as prices rise. 250-840_text_.pdf 161 Innovation and Independence |159In addition, if net imports are near zero, large changes in the global price of oil will have negligible effects on the U.S. trade balance, which directly affects the country's GDP (Cavallo 2006). Figure 4-13 shows that over the 2000-10 period, when the United States imported record amounts of oil and petroleum products, a $1 per barrel increase in the price of oil reduced the trade balance in goods by $0.83 billion. In the 2011-19 period, which saw falling net imports, the same price increase reduced the trade balance by only $0.17 billion. As U.S. net exports increase, higher prices should eventually increase the trade balance, reflecting greater transfers from foreign consumers to domestic producers. Energy independence also brings geopolitical benefits, such as more influence abroad and fewer constraints on foreign policy. The rise of the United States as a net contributor to the global oil market has reduced oil prices (Kilian 2016), and has also reduced the dependence of the global market on particular producers. Currently, the United States has sanctions on two major oil-producing countries, Iran and Venezuela. These sanctions, combined with internal factors in the case of Venezuela, have taken millions of barrels of oil per day off the market. Since the United States announced sanctions in November 2018, Iranian exports have declined by 1.4 million barrels per -30-20-100102030 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30Figure 4-13.

Energy independence increases the feasibility of such sanctions. In addition, it reduces the incentive to expend foreign policy resources on efforts to lower global energy prices. Geopolitical gains also stem from net exports of U.S. natural gas. For example, exports of U.S. LNG to Europe have and will continue to provide a diversified source of competitively priced natural gas to reduce the continent's dependence on Russian gas supplies. The U.S. share of Europe's total natural gas imports increased from 0.1 percent in the first five months of 2018 to 1.3 percent in the first five months of 2019. The potential for greater exports of U.S. natural gas to Europe gives U.S. leaders greater influence when discouraging them from supporting the controversial new Nord Stream 2 pipeline project from Russia to Germany. Poland's and Lithuania's leaders are the most recent heads of state to denounce the project as a threat to energy security that would increase European dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. Environmental Benefits In addition to bringing energy independence and saving the average family of four $2,500, the shale revolution has brought several environmental benefits. The shift to generating more electricity from natural gas and renewable energy sources reduced energy-related carbon dioxide emissions at the national level to a degree that was not predicted before these innovations. In its 2006 Annual Energy Outlook, the EIA projected a 16.5 percent increase in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2018 (figure 4-14). Actual emissions decreased by about 12 percent. Actual energy-related carbon emissions for 2018 were 24 percent lower than projected in 2006. Some of the decline is because projections assumed greater GDP growth and therefore greater electricity demand than what actu - ally occurred, in part because of the Great Recession and slow recovery. An important part of the decline, however, stems from lower natural gas prices reducing reliance on electricity generated from coal. Over the period, the proportion of generation from coal-fired power plants fell from 50 percent to 28 percent, while the share from natural gas increased from 19 percent to 35 percent. Low natural gas prices also aided growth in the generation of wind power, which expanded from less than 1 percent of generation to 7 percent. Although Federal and State policies, such as renewable portfolio standards and tax credits, contributed to the increase in wind power generation, Fell and Kaffine (2018) document the important role of lower natural gas prices in spurring greater market penetration by wind generation. The complementarity stems from the ability of natural gas generators to quickly ramp up or slow down in response to the intermittent wind generation from gusts or lulls in wind. 250-840_text_.pdf 164 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |161We estimate that from 2005 to 2018, the shale revolution lowered annual electric power carbon dioxide emissions by 506 million metric tons, a 21 per - cent decline relative to electric power sector emissions in 2005 ( figure 4-15). For the estimate, we assume that coal emissions in the electricity sector would have otherwise remained constant, and we calculate the observed decline in coal emissions, which is 833 million metric tons. We assume that 92 percent of the decline is from shale-driven decreases in natural gas prices. This percent - age is from Coglianese, Gerarden, and Stock (2019), who estimate the share of the decline in coal use attributable to the decline in the price of natural gas relative to the price of coal apart from other factors such as environmental regulations, which accounted for another 6 percent of the decline. 9 Finally, we subtract the increase in emissions from greater use of natural gas in electricity generation (506 million metric tons = 833 x 0.92 - 260).10 The shale-driven reduction in electric power emissions is larger than what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) projected its 2012 9 Note that the decline in coal use and coal emissions is linked to the decline in the price of natural gas relative to the price of coal, not to the number of coal plants that are replaced with natural gas plants. Natural-gas-driven changes in electricity prices have caused coal plants to close, and the retired generation capacity has been replaced with a mix of natural gas plants and renewable sources. Also, we note that Coglianese, Gerarden, and Stock (2018) look explicitly at coal production, not consumption, but the two are similar. Over most of their study period, more than 90 percent of production was consumed domestically. 10 A more detailed analysis could be done to estimate the net greenhouse gas (GHG) effects from shale gas. For example, the CEA estimate does not include leaks from natural gas wells or pipelines. According the EPA's emissions inventory, total GHG emissions from natural gas systems declined from 2005 to 2017. Alvarez et al. (2018) estimate that emissions are 60 percent greater than what the EPA reports. Even if this were true for the 2005 and 2017 EPA measurements, emissions from natural gas systems would have still declined over the period. If emissions were understated in 2017 but not in 2005, the shale-driven declines in emissions would still be larger than those from the policies mentioned in figure 4-15. In general, innovation in leak detection has lowered leak rates over time (see box 4-3).

The shale reduction is also more than double what the EPA initially projected that the now-rescinded Clean Power Plan would achieve by 2025 (240 million metric tons). The shale-driven decline in emissions allowed the United States to have a greater rate of decline in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the European Union, holding constant the size of the two economies ( figure 4-16). From 2005 to 2019, the European Union has developed and expanded an increasingly stringent cap-and-trade system for GHG emissions across its mem-ber countries. Although it substantially raised electricity prices for consumers (Martin, Muuls, and Wagner 2015), the system helped the European Union achieve a 20 percent decline in GDP-adjusted emissions from 2005 to 2017, the most recent year of data. Over the same period, emissions fell by 28 percent in the United States, which did not implement a national cap-and-trade system, although various States have pursued policies to cap emissions. If policymakers had averted the shale revolution through a ban on hydraulic fracturing or other integral components of shale development, energy sector GHG emissions would most likely be higher today. Absent low natural gas prices, renewable electricity sources are unlikely to have enabled similar emissions reductions. A megawatt-hour of coal-fired electricity gener - ates about 1 metric ton of GHG emissions. Achieving the 506 million metric ton decline in GHG emissions is roughly equivalent to reducing coal-fired electricity generation by about 506 million megawatt-hours and replacing it with renew - able power generation.

This decline would leave wholesale electricity prices about one-third above their 2018 level. This higher price is unlikely to have supported a 150 percent increase in wind and solar generation over their 2018 level (and an even larger percentage increase over their pre-shale level). It implies an elasticity of supply close to 5, roughly twice as large as the empirical estimate by Johnson (2014). Shale-driven declines in emissions have been large as well as economi - cal. Many policies seek to reduce emissions. Most of them, however, impose a cost on the economy. Gillingham and Stock (2018) summarize research on the cost of reducing a ton of carbon emissions by various methods. They report that renewable fuel subsidies cost $100 per ton of carbon abated, Renewable Portfolio Standards cost up to $190 per ton, and vehicle fuel economy stan-dards cost up to $310 per ton. By comparison, shale innovation brings emis - sions savings without requiring greater public spending (e.g. subsidies) or costly regulations or mandates. 11 The year 2046 is estimated using the EIA's 2019 Annual Energy Outlook forecast of wind and solar generation in the electric power sector through 2050 (EIA 2019c). 60708090100 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Figure 4-16.

As with GHG emissions, GDP-adjusted particu - late emissions have declined faster in the United States than in the European Union over the 2005-17 period (figure 4-17). The difference in the rate of reduc - tion is considerable, with U.S. particulate emissions per $1 of GDP declining by 57 percent and EU emissions declining by 41 percent. The decline has brought health benefits. Johnsen, LaRiviere, and Wolff (2019) estimate that, as of 2013, the shale-driven decline in particulate and related emissions had $17 billion in annual health benefits (see box 4-3). The Value of Deregulatory Energy Policy This section explores the value of deregulatory energy policy. First, it shows how deregulation allows innovation to flourish. Then it explains the private sector's part in the critical responsibilities of building and maintaining energy infrastructure.

In the same vein, the Trump Administration has sought to identify and remove regulations that unduly stifle energy development. This is seen in the Presidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth and the Executive Order on Promoting Energy Infrastructure and Economic Growth. It is also seen in actions such as permitting for the Keystone XL Pipeline and the DOE's Box 4-3. Innovation in Pipeline Leak Detection Pipelines are one of the most effective methods of transporting oil and gas, but they require monitoring and maintenance. Traditionally, monitoring has required that people travel along pipelines by foot, automobile, plane, or all-terrain vehicle. Innovation in technologies such as drones and advanced acoustics has allowed the industry to prevent leaks and more quickly find and stop them when they occur. For example, a Shell pilot drone program illus - trates how well-equipped drones can identify pipeline corrosion, abnormal heat signatures, and any effects on wildlife. This helps the company identify leaks, but also reveals areas where preventive maintenance is most needed. With improvements to technology for monitoring pipeline leaks and other improvements across the supply chain, the leak rate for natural gas and petroleum systems fell 31 percent from 2005 to 2017 (figure 4-ii). 1.01.52.02.53.0 300350400450500550600650 1990 1997 2005 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Figure 4-ii.

The laboratory of State policy experiments provides examples of con - trasting policy approaches and their effects. State governments have the pri - mary responsibility to regulate oil and gas development on non-Federal lands, specifying where wells can be drilled, how they must be drilled and monitored, and how they are to be reclaimed at the end of their useful life. Subject to such regulations, most States allow shale development. Maryland, Vermont, and New York, however, have banned hydraulic fracturing, a practice integral to shale development. Of the three States, the New York ban is most consequen - tial because the Marcellus Shale formation, which is the most prolific shale gas formation in the United States, extends into much of Southern New York. Since New York's initial 2010 moratorium on fracking, which morphed into a ban in 2014, energy firms have drilled more than 2,500 wells in Pennsylvania counties adjacent to the New York border (see box 4-4 for further discussion on the risks and benefits of shale development). The difference in energy-related outcomes in the two States is stark. Development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania caused natural gas production to increase 10-fold from 2010 to 2017. Over the same period, New York's production fell by nearly 70 percent. Pennsylvania leads the country in net exports of electricity to other States and produces more than twice the amount of energy it consumes. New York, in contrast, has grown more dependent on electricity generated elsewhere; and in 2017, the State consumed four times as much energy as it produced. Despite the growth in energy production in Pennsylvania, total energy- related carbon dioxide emissions fell 15 percent from 2010 to 2016, the most recent year of data, twice as much as in New York (7 percent). The greater decline in Pennsylvania stems from larger reductions in the electric power sector. Innovation, however, can create challenges for particular sectors. Despite substantial and sustained Federal support, including a mid-2000s expectation of a nuclear renaissance, low wholesale electricity prices have reduced the profitability of the nuclear power sector. As a result, a wave of early retirements from existing nuclear power plants has occurred, with more closures planned in coming years (CRS 2018). Given that changes in the market are impossible to predict, a diversified research-and-development portfolio for new energy technologies will best prepare the economy for tomorrow's market realities. The Critical Role of Energy Infrastructure Pipelines, electric transmission lines, and export facilities allow energy resources to flow from resource-rich places to resource-scarce ones. The growth in oil and gas supply documented above increases demand for pipe - lines. For example, with a dramatic rise in production over the last decade, 250-840_text_.pdf 170 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |167Box 4-4. Shale Development and Local Communities Many academic studies have explored the effects of shale oil and gas develop - ment on nearby communities. Two studies estimate measures of local net benefits across all major shale regions and reach a similar conclusion: on average, local wage and income effects from development exceed increases in living costs or deterioration in local amenities (Bartik et al. 2019; Jacobsen 2019). Jacobsen (2019) finds that wages across all occupations increased in response to the growth in drilling, regardless of whether they had direct links to the oil and gas industry. Similarly, Bartik and others (2019) estimate that shale development generated $2,500 in net benefits to households in surrounding communities. It is also evident that local effects can vary greatly, which is illustrated in the diverse effects of development on housing values. Housing values reflect an area's standard of living, including earnings opportunities and amenities, such as good roads. Shale development affects both, creating jobs but also truck traffic and associated disamenities, particularly during times of drilling (Litovitz et al. 2013; Graham et al. 2015). In addition, development, when poorly managed, can pose a risk to groundwater and health, and improper disposal of wastewater can induce earthquakes when best management prac - tices are not followed (Darrah et and Meckel 2017). Development has had large, positive effects on average housing values over time in many places (Boslett, Guilfoos, and Lang 2016; Weber, Burnett, and Xiarchos 2016; Bartik et al. 2019; Jacobsen 2019). Drilling itself, however, has depressed property values, at least temporarily, for groundwater-dependent homes in Pennsylvania or properties without mineral rights in Colorado (Muehlenbachs, Spiller, and Timmins 2015; Boslett, Guilfoos, and Lang 2016). Welfare effects can also vary across households in shale areas based on the value that households place on greater earning opportunities relative to disamenities, such as noise and congestion. The nuisances and risks that can come with drilling and fracturing wells highlight the value of prudent State and local policies that match local realities, safeguard the environment and human health, and allow private landowners to contract with energy firms to bring valuable energy resources to market. Almost all major producing States have revised oil and gas laws to address hydraulic fracturing and shale development more generally. North Dakota, for example, adopted rules limiting the flaring of natural gas in 2014, a practice that is especially common in the State because oil producers there have limited infrastructure to deliver to market the natural gas that accom - panies oil production. Similarly, as shale development grew in Pennsylvania, the State adopted a policy that effectively ended the treatment of fracking wastewater at publicly owned treatment plants, which were shown to be poorly equipped to properly treat the water. 250-840_text_.pdf 171 2/7/20 3:46 PM168| Chapter 4Pennsylvania has switched from being a major importer of natural gas to being a major exporter. Acquiring regulatory approval and building the necessary pipelines has taken time, progressing to completion in some places but not others. In 2017 and 2018, private firms finished two major pipeline projects, the Rover and Nexus pipelines, to take Appalachian gas into Michigan and beyond, with the projects adding nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline and 3.2 billion cubic feet of gas per day of capacity. The first phase of the Rover pipeline was finished in August 2017 and ran from Southeastern Ohio (near the Pennsylvania border) to Northwestern Ohio (near the Michigan border). The second phase was finished in May 2018 and extended the pipeline through Michigan and into Canada. The Nexus pipeline was also completed in 2018 and follows a similar route, eventu - ally connecting with existing pipelines near Detroit. No new interstate pipelines were built from Pennsylvania into New York (and therefore into New England) over the same period. Total expansions or extensions of existing pipelines that transit New York totaled 21 miles in length and 0.46 billion cubic feet per day in additional capacity. The 125-mile Constitution Pipeline, which would take Pennsylvania gas to New York and beyond, has been repeatedly delayed since the project's inception in 2012, with a major source of delay being the refusal of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation to grant a necessary certification. Natural gas price differences across States and over time illustrate the implications of new investments in pipelines. As natural gas production grew in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, citygate prices in Michigan fell relative to the national average price, plausibly reflecting the benefit of being closer to a place of burgeoning supply growth. (The citygate price measures local whole-sale natural gas prices). From 2016 to 2018, when two main pipeline projects were being completed, the Michigan price relative to the national average price fell 14 percent. The New York price went in the opposite direction, increasing by 16 percent, potentially reflecting the interaction between high demand (from an above-average number of cooling-degree days in 2018) and pipeline constraints (figure 4-18). The 14 percent decline in the Michigan citygate price relative to the national price provides a credible estimate of the price effect of expanded pipeline capacity. It is similar to estimates of the effect of major capacity expansions (Oliver, Mason, and Finnoff 2014) or the price premium associated with insufficient capacity (Avalos, Fitzgerald, and Rucker 2016). A 14 percent decline in the New York and New England citygate price would save consumers in the region an estimated $2.0 billion annually, or $233 for a family of four. Some of the savings would be from residential, com - mercial, and industrial consumers paying less for the natural gas that they consume, but the bulk of savings would be from lower electricity prices. New York and most of New England have deregulated electricity markets, where 250-840_text_.pdf 172 2/7/20 3:46 PMEnergy: Innovation and Independence |169electricity-generating firms sell into competitive markets. Linn, Muehlenbachs, and Wang (2014) find that for New York and New England, a 1 percent decrease in the price of natural gas lowers the price of electricity by 0.8 percent. Applying this gas-driven decline in wholesale prices to the region's consumption of elec - tricity in 2018 provides $1.2 billion of the total $2.0 billion in savings. Other infrastructure investments could provide similar value. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline, for example, would take natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina, where citygate prices have been about 10 percent higher than in West Virginia in 2019. We also note that pipelines are not the only means of trans - porting natural gas domestically. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recently approved a permit request to transport LNG by rail. Just as pipelines allow producers to reach high-price markets in other states, facilities for exporting LNG allow U.S. producerswhose production now exceeds domestic consumptionto reach high-price markets abroad. In response, export volumes have surged, averaging 4.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in the first 10 months of 2019, compared with less than 2 Bcf/d in the first 10 months of 2017. Under the Natural Gas Act, exports of LNG must be approved by the DOE on the basis of whether the exports are consistent with the public interest. Under the Trump Administration, the DOE has doubled the volume of LNG approved for export, increasing capacity from 17 Bcf/d to more than 34 Bcf/d as of PM170| Chapter 4Conclusion The shale revolution provides a striking example of the potential of private sector energy innovation and the resulting implications for consumers and the environment. In less than a decade, productivity in oil and gas extraction has increased several-fold. As a result, production costs have fallen, making energy goods and services more affordable for consumers, especially lower-income households. By several measures, the shale revolution has led to greater envi - ronmental progress in the United States than in the European Union, which exercises more government control and has more stringent emissions policies. The Trump Administration's deregulatory policies aim to support private sector innovation and initiative by reducing excessively prescriptive govern- ment regulation. In doing so, the Administration seeks to further unleash the country's abundant human and energy resources. This policy stance is consis - tent with the approach taken by most States, which have allowed shale pro - duction to flourish as long as companies meet updated State policies that limit risks to human health and the environment. However, some States have taken a more command-and-control approach, which has had predictable effects. In particular, New York State has taken an alternative, unsafe-at-any-speed approach to shale development. As it has done so, its natural gas production has fallen, its imports of electricity have increased, and its rate of GHG emis - sions reduction has been less than that of neighboring Pennsylvania. State and Federal policy questions related to shale will persist in debates about environmental and energy policy. The shale revolution will continue to influence energy prices because the private sector has shown that large amounts of oil and gas can be extracted from shale and similar formations at moderate prices. The knowledge and capability gained from innovation will remain through periods of low energy prices that drive overleveraged firms into bankruptcy. In addition, policies that would severely constrain use of this capability come with large, forgone benefits\u2014in large part the consumer savings and environmental gains documented in this chapter. The Trump Administration's deregulatory energy agenda, in contrast, seeks to overcome government barriers to private sector innovation that lowers energy prices and benefits the environment. 250-840_text_.pdf 174 2/7/20 3:46 PM171 xChapter 5 Free-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition Driven by unparalleled medical innovation, the American healthcare system remains the envy of the world. However, its past success does not mean that healthcare in the United States always delivers the value that it should. Costs for many procedures and medications are too high, access to the healthcare that patients demand is limited, and competition is lacking. But these chal - lenges do not mean that the only solution is increased government interven - tion. These improvements can be accomplished by enhancing healthcare choice and competition in ways that embrace the value of the market while focusing on patients' needs. The Trump Administration has already made major progress in delivering high-quality, lower-cost healthcare by creating more choice in health insurance markets and more competition among healthcare providers. In other words, it is possible to keep what works and fix what is broken. For example, the Administration has sought to make healthcare more affordable by lowering out-of-control prescription drug prices and expanding access to more afford-able healthcare options. Additional policy changes put patients in control of their healthcare by ensuring price transparency and allowing Americans to pick the care that fits their needs. At the same time, accelerating medical innovation has provided new treatment options for patients living with disease. Under the Trump Administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved more generic drugs than ever before in U.S. history and updated its approval process for new, lifesaving drugs. This past year, prescription drug prices experienced the largest year-over-year decline in more than 50 years. Whether 250-840_text_.pdf 175 2/7/20 3:46 PM172| Chapter 5it is through reforms that seek to expand association health plans, promote health reimbursement arrangements, or give terminally-ill patients access to potentially lifesaving drugs, among many other successes, every healthcare reform that lowers costs and increases quality allows American workers to live longer, healthier lives and keep more of their paychecks. The Administration's focus on consumer-centric health policies will make the healthcare marketplace more competitive and protect as well as enable con - sumers to obtain life-enhancing technologies. For example, the Administration's recent policy change to permit insurers to offer policies with additional benefits covered before a deductible is met and allow enrollees to maintain health savings accounts are real changes already helping those with preexisting condi - tions. And with future changes under way to enable patients using the real price for major medical services, the effect of the free market to lower health care costs for all consumers has just begun. Healthcare regulations at all levels of government can increase price, limit choice, and stifle competition\u2014which, in combination, lead U.S. healthcare to fail to provide its full value. These regulations can also harm the broader economy. For example, the Affordable Care Act has impeded economic recov - ery by introducing disincentives to work. The Trump Administration's successes in addressing these policies over the past three years show the value of empow - ering the market to deliver the affordable healthcare options that Americans rightly expect. Further patient-centered reforms will provide Americans with improved healthcare through enhanced choice and competition. The United States' healthcare system relies more on private markets to provide health insurance and medical care than do those of other coun - tries. And the U.S. system is supplemented by public sector programs to finance the care of vulnerable populations, which include low-income and senior populations. Most Americans are in employer-sponsored group health plans and are often satisfied with the insurance coverage and medical care they receive. However, the U.S. system does not always deliver the value it should. Market competition leads to an efficient allocation of resources that should 250-840_text_.pdf 176 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |173lower prices and increase quality. But every market has features that deviate from optimal conditions, and healthcare is no exception. Last year (CEA 2019), we discussed obstacles in healthcare markets and concluded that they are not insurmountable problems that mandate the government's intervention. This chapter identifies government barriers on the Federal and State levels to healthcare market competition that lead to higher prices, reduce innovation, and hinder quality improvements. The chapter proceeds with a review of barriers to competition and choice, and then it provides a summary of the accomplishments and expected effects of Administration health policy in reducing these impediments and creating competitive innovation in the healthcare markets for all Americans. The Administration's reforms aim to fos - ter healthcare markets that create value for consumers through the financing and delivery of high-quality and affordable care. Government mandates can reduce competitive insurance choices and raise premiums. By focusing on choice and competition, the Administration is encour - aging States to provide flexibility to develop policies that accommodate numerous consumer preferences for healthcare financing and delivery. The Administration has addressed these problems through a series of Executive Orders, deregulatory measures, and signed legislation. By 2023, we estimate that 13 million Americans will have new insurance coverage that was previ-ously unavailable due to high prices and overregulation.1 Building a High-Quality Healthcare System A key goal for the healthcare marketplace is to provide effective, high-value care to all Americans. Achieving this goal requires careful consideration and revision of specific Federal and State regulations and policies that inhibit choice and competition. This section identifies two ways to increase choice and competition: creating more choice in health insurance markets, and creat - ing more competition among healthcare providers. Creating More Choice in Health Insurance Markets The majority of Americans obtain health insurance coverage through private sector, employer-sponsored group plans and other private (individual or non - group) plans (see figure 5-1). The public sector Medicaid program provides cov - erage to people with low incomes, while Medicare provides coverage to older Americans. Figure 5-1 shows the percentages of Americans that have various 1 The CEA previously released research on topics covered in this chapter. The text of this chapter builds on the 2019 Economic Report of the President ; the CEA report \"Measuring Prescription Drug Prices: A Primer on the CPI Prescription Drug Index\" (CEA 2019c); the CEA report Mitigating the Impact of Pandemic Influenza through Vaccine Innovation (CEA 2019d); the report \"Reforming America's Healthcare System through Choice and Competition,\" from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS 2018); and policy announcements from the Executive Office of the President. 250-840_text_.pdf 177 2/7/20 3:46 PM174| Chapter 5types of health insurance coverage, but many people have multiple coverage sources; for instance, many older adults on Medicare purchase private supple - mental insurance plans. In 2018, more than 67 percent of all Americans were covered by private health insurance plans, while just over 34 percent were covered by public plans. Among the insured population, 12.2 percent had more than one type for all of 2018 (Census Bureau 2019). Employer-sponsored insur-ance dominates most of the private health insurance market. The individual insurance market accounts for a smaller share of the insured population. In the individual market, consumers buy their insurance through the insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or through ACA-compliant individual policies. Since earlier in the 2000s, when private health insurance premiums grew rapidly, growth rates have moderated, especially since 2017 (Claxton et al. 2019). Figure 5-2 shows the inflation-adjusted growth in the average premium for family coverage through employer-sponsored group plans. The total pre - mium is paid partly through the employer contribution and partly through the employee contribution. We focus on the total premium because health econo - mists agree that, ultimately, employees also pay the employer-contribution in the form of reduced wages. In the individual insurance market, after the Affordable Care Act established health insurance exchanges, the premiums almost doubled in the first few years. From 2018 to 2019, the benchmark ACA premiums dropped by 1.5 percent. From 2019 to 2020, the benchmark ACA premiums dropped by an additional 4 percent (CMS 2018, 2019).8.51.017.917.810.13.355.1 0 10 50 60UninsuredOther publicMedicaidMedicareOther privateMarketplaceEmployment basedFigure 5-1.

Two of the best illustrations of these consumer-focused policies are health saving accounts (HSAs) and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). As described in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) report \"Reforming America's Healthcare System through Choice and Competition,\" the promotion and expansion of these policies, combined with price and quality transparency initiatives, will encourage consumers to make better and more informed care choices to enhance their health (HHS 2018). \"Consumer-directed health plans\" (CDHPs) is an all-encompassing term for HRAs, HSAs, and similar medical accounts that allow patients to have greater control over their health budgets and spending. The growth of CDHPs has been substantial, especially by large employers that offer these high-deductible plans, HRAs, and HSAs in a larger strategy to introduce consumer - ism in employer-sponsored health insurance. HRAs allow employees to shop in the individual market for their preferred plans. Expanding consumer choice in health plans decreases the deadweight loss associated with poor plan matching and leads to gains in consumer surplus (Dafny, Ho, and Varela 2013). HSAs may be especially attractive to consumers because they may be used for nonmedical healthcare expenses and are portable (Greene et al. 2006). In an analysis of firms that completely replaced traditional managed care plans with 024681012 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018Figure 5-2. Annual Change in Average Family Premium Including Employee and Employer Contributions, 2000-2018 Percent change (year-over-year) Sources: Kaiser Family Chapter 5CDHPs for their employees, Parente, Feldman, and Yu (2010) saw significant decreases in total healthcare costs, though they were inconsistent among firms that offered different mixes of HRAs and HSAs. CDHPs may also be beneficial for low-income families and high-risk families, where total health spending signifi - cantly decreased for vulnerable (low-income or high-risk) families with CDHPs (Haviland et al. 2011). Healthcare costs are also lower for employers offering CDHPs, whose costs in the first three years after a CDHP is offered are signifi - cantly lower relative to firms that do not offer a CDHP (Haviland et al. 2016). As seen in figure 5-3, the share of individuals enrolled in high-deductible health plans in the employer-sponsored health insurance market has risen substantially. This has led consumers to have greater incentives to shop for medical services that are not reimbursed before their deductible is met. Although the growth of CDHPs has increased out-of-pocket medical expenses on average, the plans are available with significantly lower pre - miums than other health insurance choices, as seen in figures 5-4 and 5-5. Furthermore, with the Administration's new options to cover predeductible care for the chronically ill with little to no out-of-pocket expense, as discussed later is this chapter, more choices are available for more vulnerable popula - tions than before 2016.

If competition is reduced among providers (e.g., physicians or hospitals), and in addition there is no change in patient demand, then higher prices and fewer choices are likely to result. These can also lower overall healthcare quality and limit the efficient allocation of resources. Government policies can diminish competition by adversely limiting the supply of providers and the scope of services they offer. Choice and competition can be limited by State policies that restrict entry into provider markets. This, in turn, can stifle innovation that could lead to more cost-effective care provision. Higher healthcare prices and fewer incentives for quality improvement by providers can be the results of these market-stifling State policies. In particular, state-specific certificate-of-need laws could reduce provider access and create unnecessary monopoly pricing where there is limited competition. In chapter 6 of this Report, we discuss advocacy efforts by the Trump Administration to limit the harmful effects of certificate-of-need regulation. Since the 1990s, markets for a variety of healthcare services have become more consolidated (NCCI 2018). Some consolidation involves cross-market mergers\u2014as, for example, when hospitals operating in different regions form a system\u2014but there is also evidence of increasing concentration in local markets. As discussed in chapter 6, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division classify markets using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Between 1990 and 2006, the proportion of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with hospital market HHIs classified as \"highly concentrated\" (i.e., with an HHI above 2,500) rose from 65 percent to more than 77 percent (Gaynor, Ho, and Town 2015). Concentration has also risen significantly in health insurance markets. Even when consolidation occurs between close competitors, consumers can benefit from substantial efficiency gains. However, the trends of rising concentration have properly drawn atten - tion to the question of how consumers are affected. A recent but growing body of literature has linked increasing concentration in hospital markets to rising prices, markups, and falling quality. A number of studies have found that mergers between hospitals that are close competitors leads to significantly higher prices without improving quality (Vogt and Town 2006; Gaynor and Town 2012), or in settings with regulated prices, to lower quality (Kessler and McClellan 2000; Cooper et al. 2011). This literature is still young, and more needs to be done, particularly to assess what is driving the consolidations. Fuchs (1997) argued that the rise of health maintenance organizations is a contributing factor, as hospitals seek to offset the bargaining power of large 250-840_text_.pdf 182 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |179insurers by becoming large themselves; but as discussed by Gaynor, Ho, and Town (2015), the empirical evidence for this is mixed. More generally, it is important to understand if rising concentration is associated with factors, such as rising fixed-cost investments or economies of scale, that may benefit consumers. This causality issue is discussed in chapter 6. At a minimum, however, these results suggest that market structure is an important aspect of healthcare markets. Consolidation is also seen in the prescription drug market. The growth in importance of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers and health insurers also increased the size of the largest PBMs, their purchasing power, and their ability to obtain rebates and discounts from manufacturers (Aitken et al. 2016). PBMs are resistant to list drug price increases, as their profits are usually a percentage of drug list prices\u2014thus, there is little incentive to reduce the amount charged to insurers. As discussed later in this chapter, the three largest PBMs hold 85 percent of market share. One way to gauge the uneven competition among healthcare providers is to examine the degree of competition (or lack thereof) in major metropolitan markets. Data made available by the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI 2016) used negotiated provider price data to illustrate the degree of lack of competi - tion present in the market at the national and regional levels. Using data from HCCI, Newman and others (2016) examined variations in the negotiated rates of providers from 242 possible medical services. They calculated the ratio of the average price paid in each State to the average national price for a given medical service by ratio categories for each of the 242 services. Figure 5-6 pres- ents a map depicting variation in cataract surgery prices by state. The map illuminates both regional patterns and variations among State- level average cataract removal prices. For example, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana all have prices between 125 and 150 percent of the national average price. Alternatively, across four States in the Southeast, the ratio of State average price to national average price decreases from 150 through 175 percent in the Carolinas to a ratio of less than 75 percent in Florida. Kansas and New York have prices close to the national average price for cataract surgery, at $3,382 and $3,678, respectively, compared with $3,541 (HCCI 2016). However, the average prices in the neighboring States of Nebraska and Connecticut are $957 and $1,181 more. With respect to knee replacements, New Jersey and Kansas have the lowest average prices; and Washington, Oregon, and South Carolina have the highest average prices. Prices in Connecticut and Iowa are about the same as the national average price of roughly $36,000. The data show that Arizona, Texas, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have the lowest average prices for a pregnancy ultrasound, while Oregon, Wisconsin, and Alaska have some of the highest average prices. 250-840_text_.pdf 183 2/7/20 3:46 PM180| Chapter 5Although the national average price for a knee replacement is more than 100 times larger than a pregnancy ultrasound, there is greater variation in aver - age prices for ultrasounds. For example, in South Carolina, the average knee replacement price is more than 30 percent higher than the national average, while in Wisconsin the average pregnancy ultrasound is more than 220 percent greater than the national average. This suggests that relative to the average price, there are higher high prices and lower low prices among the pregnancy ultrasound prices. Much of this variation could be due to the lack of transpar - ency in shoppable services to create a truly competitive market. There is also variation within regions or States in price trends. HCCI (2016) also calculated the ratio of each State's average price relative to the national average price for each medical service. The percentages of services within eight ranges of ratios were then graphed for each state (Newman et al. 2016). Figure 5-7 provides a visual representation of the distribution of all care medical services and can be compared across States. Figure 5-7 shows the distribution of prices for four States: Florida, Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota. Of the 241 care bundles calculated for Florida, the prices for 95 percent of them were at or below the national averages. Ohio, with 240 care bundles, had higher prices on average than Florida; but roughly 75 percent of all prices were at or below the national averages. Connecticut, with 232 care bundles estimated, on average had higher prices than Florida and Ohio, with 30 percent of its care bundle prices being at least 20 percent Figure 5-6. Ratio of State Average Price to National Average Price of Cataract Removal, 2015 Sources: Newman et al. (2016); Health Care Cost Institute.Insufficient data than PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |181higher than the respective national averages. Minnesota, with 221 estimated care bundles, had the highest prices on average, with more than 45 percent of the care bundles having prices 50 percent or more above the national average. Table 5-1 presents the highest average and lowest average price for a knee replacement reported for a metropolitan statistical areas in 12 States. 2 Sacramento has the highest average price ($57,504)\u2014more than twice as high as Tucson, Miami, Saint Louis, Syracuse, Toledo, Allentown, Knoxville, and Lubbock. California also has the largest within-State difference in average price ($27,243) across any paired set of MSAs in the State. Though the two California markets are 440 miles apart, it is worth noting that a three-hour drive from Palm Bay, Florida, to Miami could potentially save $17,122 on knee replacement surgery\u2014a difference of roughly $100 per mile driven\u2014assuming one's insurance plan design covered the individual in both locations. Absolute dollar differences across MSAs were small in Connecticut, South Carolina, and Virginia for the MSAs for which we had sufficient data to calculate prices. These findings demonstrate that there is wide geographic variation in prices within the privately insured population. Although some of the variation may be a result of the differences in the costs of doing business (e.g., supplies, 2 These are indicative differences because prices could not be calculated for every MSA in a State. There could have been higher or lower prices in an unreported MSA in a State. These reported prices should drive inquiries into why these differences exist and whether any differences are justified by local differences or other evidence. 01020304050607080 6061-80 Distribution of Averag e State Price Relative to Average National Price of Care Bundles in Four States, 2015 Percentage of care bundles Source: Health Care Cost Institute.

A patient-centered healthcare policy's goal would be the least unjusti - fied price difference as possible and a low average price for a service. For example, Arizona has the sixth-largest price difference ($123) in the pregnancy ultrasound prices\u2014a service that should be similar in scope and quality across providers, care settings, cities, and States. The average of the average prices paid in Tucson and Phoenix is the lowest ([$320 + $197] / 2 = $258.5). To address how competition can lower prices more broadly, the Administration's report \"Reforming America's Healthcare System through Choice and Competition\" outlined many other important measures to increase competition for the entire healthcare sector, including hospitals and doctors, which make up the bulk of total spending. For example, a recent Executive Order set the way for increasing price transparency in healthcare, which allows competition to more effectively operate.

Policies have been advanced to provide transparency and choice so patients can choose the care that fits their needs. In addition, pathways have been sought to unleashing American inno-vation that will provide new treatment options for patients living with disease. To increase choice, the Administration has increased insurance options and reduced the regulatory burden. To increase competition, the Administration has focused on three major areas: (1) accelerating innovation, (2) increasing access to valuable therapies, and (3) making the health market stronger with greater transparency. Efforts in each of these areas are discussed in this sec - tion, with the goal of setting out how to keep what works and fix what is broken. Increasing Choice This subsection addresses a number of key aspects of how to increase choice. These include reducing regulatory burdens, stabilizing health insurance exchanges, lowering the individual mandate penalty to zero, encouraging State innovation in insurance design, expanding association health plans and short-term limited-duration insurance, strengthening Medicare, expanding health reimbursement arrangements, and modernizing high-deductible health plans. Reducing regulatory burdens. In our 2019 Report, we estimated the impact of deregulated health insurance markets to provide more plan competition and choice for small businesses and American consumers through expanding association health plans and short-term, limited duration plans. These deregu - lations, in addition to eliminating the individual mandate, were estimated to generate $450 billion in benefits over the next decade. We estimated that the reforms will benefit lower- and middle-income consumers and all taxpayers but will impose costs on some middle- and higher-income consumers, who will pay higher insurance premiums. The benefits of giving a large set of consum - ers more insurance options will far outweigh the projected costs imposed on the smaller set who will pay higher premiums. In 2019, we provided estimates supporting the claim that these reforms do not \"sabotage\" the ACA but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax-funded care for those in need. Stabilizing health insurance exchanges. In April 2017, HHS issued a final rule aimed at stabilizing the exchanges. Among other provisions, this rule made it more difficult for consumers to wait until they needed medical services to enter the exchanges. This limits gaming of the program and the driving up of premiums for those who maintain continuous coverage. 250-840_text_.pdf 187 2/7/20 3:46 PM184| Chapter 5The 2019 HRA rule is expected to cause a significant increase in individual market enrollment in the early 2020s. The rule is projected to do so through additional choice and market competition and without any new government mandates. Younger and healthier employees may be more likely to prefer the typical individual market coverage of relatively high deductibles and more lim - ited provider networks due to their lower premiums, so it is possible that the HRA rule could lead to an improved individual market risk pool (Effros 2009). This would occur if the HRA rule generates greater demand in the individual market and from younger and older workers, given the relative attractiveness of lower premium cost generated by the HRA contribution to the employee when they purchase insurance. Lowering the individual mandate penalty to zero. In December 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which set the ACA's individ - ual mandate penalty to zero. This benefits society by allowing people to choose not to have ACA-compliant health coverage without facing a tax penalty, and by saving taxpayers money if fewer consumers purchase subsidized ACA cover - age. As we discussed last year, the CEA estimates that from 2019 through 2029, setting the mandate penalty to zero will yield $204 billion in net benefits for consumers (CEA 2019). Encouraging State innovation in insurance design. As of 2019, seven States operated State Innovation waivers under Section 1332 of the ACA that utilized a reinsurance component. As a way to lower risk, the State establishes a fund to subsidize insurers for a certain amount of the expenses from people with costly claims. These waivers lead to lower ACA plan premiums and thus lower associ - ated premium tax credit costs. These seven States had a median premium decline of 7.5 percent, compared with an increase in nonwaiver states of 3.0 percent (Badger 2019). Compared with what would have occurred if the States had not passed waivers, the decrease in premiums has likely caused increased enrollment in these States. By the end of 2019, States received back roughly 60 percent of savings of their initial contribution in Federal pass-through funding (Blase 2019a). Expanding association health plans and short-term limited-duration insur - ance. In June 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL) finalized a rule to expand the ability of employers, including sole proprietors, to join together and purchase health coverage through association health plans (AHPs). 3 For many employers, employees, and their families, AHPs offer more affordable premi - ums by reducing the administrative costs of coverage through economies of scale. The AHP rule also gave small businesses more flexibility to offer their employees health coverage that is more tailored to their needs. In August 2018, HHS, the Department of the Treasury, and DOL finalized a rule to expand Americans' ability to purchase short-term, limited-duration 3 The revised definition of an employer for bona fide AHPs established under this rule is being adjudicated. 250-840_text_.pdf 188 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |185insurance (STLDI). STDLI premiums generally cost less than premiums for individual insurance on the ACA exchanges. Because of lower costs, additional choice, and increased competition, millions of Americans, including middle-class families that cannot afford ACA plans, stand to benefit from this reform. Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO 2019) stated that is will count some short-term plans as health coverage, just as it did with pre-ACA plans with benefit exclusions or annual and lifetime limits (Aron-Dine 2019). Though these plans are more limited in coverage than the ACA-compliant insurance plans, they are priced at up to 60 percent less than the unsubsidized premium cost of ACA exchange plans and give consumers more insurance protection than being uninsured. As a result of STDLI and AHP rules, the CBO and the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that over the next decade, roughly 5 million more people are projected to be enrolled in AHPs or short-term plans. Of this increase, almost 80 percent constitute individuals who would otherwise have purchased coverage in the small-group or nongroup markets. The remaining 20 percent (roughly 1 million people) are made up of individuals who are pro - jected to be newly insured as a result of the rules (CBO 2019). Strengthening Medicare. The Administration's reforms to Medicare include payment policies that align with patients' clinical needs rather than the site of care, simplified processes for physicians' documentation of evaluation and management visits, new consumer-transparency measures, and increased flexibility for insurers so that they can offer more options and benefits through Medicare Advantage. In 2019, President Trump signed an Executive Order to improve seniors' healthcare outcomes by providing patients with more plan options, additional time with providers, greater access to telehealth and new therapies, and greater alignment between payment models and efficient healthcare delivery (White House 2019b). In addition, a priority will be streamlining the approval, coverage, and payment of new therapies while reducing obstacles to improved patient care. Finally, the effort improves the fiscal sustainability of Medicare by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. Expanding health reimbursement arrangements. In June 2019, HHS, the Treasury Department, and DOL issued a final rule expanding the flexibility and use of health reimbursement arrangements to employers (84 FR 28888). The rule issued two new types of tax-advantaged HRA plans\u2014excepted benefit HRAs (EBHRAs) and individual coverage HRAs (ICHRAs)\u2014to be offered as early as January 2020. EBHRAs may be offered to employees with traditional group plans to receive an excepted benefit HRA of up to $1,800 a year in 2020 (indexed to inflation afterward) for the purchase of certain qualified medical expenses, such as short-term, limited duration, vision, and dental plans. ICHRAs allow employers to reimburse employees who purchase their own health plans and 250-840_text_.pdf 189 2/7/20 3:46 PM186| Chapter 5equalizes the tax treatment of a traditional employer-sponsored insurance plan and an individual market plan paid by employer contributions. The Treasury Department performed microsimulation modeling to evalu - ate the coverage changes and transfers that are likely to be induced by the final rules. The Treasury's model of health insurance coverage assumes that workers are paid the marginal product of their labor. Employers are assumed to be indifferent between paying wages and payroll taxes and paying compen - sation in the form of benefits. The Treasury model therefore assumes that total compensation paid by a given firm is fixed, and the employer allocates this compensation between wages and benefits based on the aggregated prefer - ences of their employees. As a result, employees bear the full cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (net of the value of any tax exclusion) in the form of reduced wages and the employee share of premiums. The Treasury Department's model assumes that employees' preferences regarding the type of health coverage (or no coverage) are determined by their expected healthcare expenses and the after-tax cost of employer-sponsored insurance, exchange coverage with the premium tax credit (PTC), or exchange or other individual health insurance coverage integrated with an individual coverage HRA, and the quality of different types of coverage (including actu-arial value). When evaluating the choice between an individual coverage HRA and the PTC for exchange coverage, the available coverage is assumed to be the same, but the tax preferences are different. Hence, an employee will prefer the individual coverage HRA if the value of the income and payroll tax exclusion (including both the employee and employer portion of payroll tax) is greater than the value of the PTC. In modeling this decision, the Federal departments assume that premiums paid by the employee are tax-preferred through the reimbursement of premiums from the individual coverage HRA, with any additional premiums (up to the amount that would have been paid under a traditional group health plan) paid through a salary reduction arrangement. In the Treasury Department's model, employees are aggregated into firms, based on tax data. The expected health expenses of employees in the firm determine the cost of employer-sponsored insurance for the firm. Employees effectively vote for their preferred coverage, and each employer's offered benefit is determined by the preferences of the majority of employees. Employees then decide whether to accept any offered coverage, and the resulting enrollment in traditional or individual health insurance coverage determines the risk pools and therefore premiums for both employer coverage and individual health insurance coverage. Based on microsimulation modeling, the Federal departments expect that the final rules will cause some participants (and their dependents) to move from traditional group health plans to individual coverage HRAs. As noted above, the estimates assume that for this group of firms and employees, 250-840_text_.pdf 190 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |187employer contributions to individual coverage HRAs are the same as contribu - tions to traditional group health plans would have been, and the estimates assume that tax-preferred salary reductions for individual health insurance coverage are the same as salary reductions for traditional group health plan coverage. Thus, by modeling construction, there is no change in income or pay - roll tax revenues for this group of firms and employees (other than the changes in the PTC discussed below). Although the tax preference is assumed to be unchanged for this group, after-tax, out-of-pocket costs could increase for some employees (whose pre - miums or cost sharing are higher in the individual market than in a traditional group health plan) and could decrease for others. A small number of employ - ees who are currently offered a traditional group health plan nonetheless obtain individual health insurance coverage and the PTC, because they cannot afford a traditional group health plan or such a plan does not provide minimum value. Some of these employees would no longer be eligible for the PTC for their exchange coverage when the employer switches from a traditional group health plan to an individual coverage HRA because the HRA is determined to be affordable under the final PTC rules. The regulatory impact analysis conducted by the Treasury Department concluded that the benefits of the HRA rule substantially outweigh its costs. The Treasury Department estimated that 800,000 employers are expected to provide HRAs after being fully ramped up. In addition, it is estimated that there will be a reduction in the number of uninsured by 800,000 by 2029. From these employers' HRA contributions, it is expected that firms will cover more than 11 million employees with individual health insurance by 2029. Modernizing high-deductible health plans. A major component of the Trump Administration's health policy has been a focus on consumer-directed health plans, in particular modernizing high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and their accompanying HSAs. As directed by the President, the Treasury released a new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance (Notice 2019-45) on July 17, 2019, that allows high-deductible health plan issuers to permit cover - age of prevention therapies for those with certain chronic conditions, including diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and major depression. The impact could be profound. For example, these plans could now cover all or nearly all the cost of insulin for diabetic patients before the deductible being met. HSA-eligible plans are a growing proportion of the overall HDHP market. In 2018, about 21.8 million Americans were enrolled in HSA-eligible HDHPs, up from an estimated 15.5 million in 2013 (AHIP 2017). In 2018, nearly 29 percent of all firms offered an HDHP with a savings option, such as an HSA (KFF 2018). Among companies studied in 2018 by a survey of the National Business Group on Health, 30 percent offered a full replacement HSA-type plan to employees in 2019 (NBGH 2018). HSA market growth is expected to continue. 250-840_text_.pdf 191 2/7/20 3:46 PM188| Chapter 5According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2019), about 60 percent of Americans have a chronic disease such as heart disease or diabetes. The economic burden of chronic diseases in the United States is estimated to be about $1 trillion per year (Waters and Graf 2018). Decreasing financial barriers to evidence-based care for chronic conditions provides opportunities to enhance clinical outcomes and reduce the long-term growth rate of healthcare spending. Because about 75 percent of total U.S. health spending is due to chronic diseases, appropriate chronic disease management is key to lowering long-term healthcare cost growth (NACDD n.d.). The IRS guidance allows for the creation of an enhanced HSA-eligible plan to provide predeductible coverage for targeted, evidence-based, secondary preventive services that prevent chronic disease progression and related complications. This can improve patient outcomes, enhance HDHP attractiveness, and add efficiency to medical spending. The creation of these new high-deductible health plans plus secondary prevention coverage (HDHP+) will give patients with certain conditions better access. VBID Health (2019) estimated that it could increase tax revenue in a variety of scenarios dependent on the updating of the new plan. Note that VBID Health's analysis was performed before Congress repealed the Cadillac tax in December 2019. The authors of this report (VBID Health 2019) used the ARCOLA micro - simulation model to gauge the Federal tax revenue and insurance take-up impact of an HDHP+ among those under 65 and not in the Medicare market. The model assumes bronze plans in health insurance exchanges migrate into the new HDHP+ design. That said, it is challenging for HSA-eligible plans in the exchanges to meet bronze level actuarial value given their lower out-of-pocket maximum required in statute compared with the out-of-pocket maximum limits for the individual market. Providing more predeductible coverage will make this more challenging. The model also assumes that everyone in the individual market has the option of an out-of-exchange HSA-eligible plan that does not switch to the HDHP+ design. The results are split into four scenarios for firms that offer an HSA-HDHP: all firms additionally offer HDHP+, half of all firms additionally offer HDHP+, all firms replacing current plans with HDHP+, and half of all firms replacing current plans with HDHP+. Differences across employer scenarios illustrate a range of possibilities that may play out. Across all employer scenarios, the initial uptake and forecasted growth of the novel HDHP+ are positive as people switch plan types. What varies by employer scenario, however, are the magnitude and growth of uptake over time. The HDHP+ generally has high initial uptake across employer scenarios. The lowest uptake is in the scenario where half of employers additionally offer the HDHP+ with other HDHP options. Because of the higher HDHP+ premiums, due to selection, this result is expected (figure 5-8). 250-840_text_.pdf 192 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes -21 010 536 18 -6 -3-38-20 -45-30-150153045 Full Half replaceAll PPOs HDHP+ HDHPFigure 5-8.

Different employer decisions regarding plan offerings, as seen in the sce - narios modeled, may lead one scenario to have a larger effect than another one (VBID Health 2019). More than the magnitudes of the different budget effects is the clustering of each scenario around budget neutrality. The one scenario that shows a small net reduction in tax revenue (full replacement) was modeled as an extreme case. The net effects of each scenario are small relative to the net impact of tax subsidy of the entire employer-sponsored insurance market. Thus, the net impact of expanding the secondary prevention safe harbor is likely close to zero, if not modestly positive. Increasing Competition This subsection explores how to increase competition in providing healthcare. The topics it covers include enforcing antitrust laws, accelerating generic drug approvals, creating price and quality transparency, promoting new vaccine manufacturing, and clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Law and the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Enforcing antitrust laws. Chapter 6 discusses the importance of sound antitrust policy, which protects consumers from anticompetitive mergers. As discussed there, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC\u2014collectively, the Agencies\u2014share responsibility for enforcing the Nation's antitrust laws. Although the vast majority of mergers do not raise competitive concerns, the Agencies use their investigative powers to identify those that do by obtaining and analyzing the detailed evidence that is needed to make this distinction. Challenging a merger is often risky, as evidenced by the fact that between 1994 and 2000, the Agencies lost all seven lawsuits that they filed to block hospital mergers (Moriya et al. 2010). In response to this, the FTC engaged in a retrospective study of hospital mergers that advocated against the outdated methodology that the courts had been using to evaluate these mergers. Joseph Simons, the FTC chairman, recently reported to Congress that the FTC has successfully defended in blocking a merger between healthcare providers ( FTC v. Sanford Health). This was the FTC's fifth straight appellate victory involving health provider mergers. The DOJ has worked to stop anticompetitive mergers among health insurers. In 2016, the DOJ successfully blocked two proposed mergers that would have combined four of the largest health insurers (Anthem, Cigna, Aetna, and Humana) into two companies. More recently, the DOJ reached a settlement with CVS in its bid to acquire Aetna. The DOJ raised concerns relat - ing to the sale of individual prescription drug plans (PDPs) under Medicare's Part D program. CVS and Aetna competed head-to-head in U.S. regions cover - ing 9.3 million PDPs, of which 3.5 million had coverage from CVS or Aetna. 250-840_text_.pdf 194 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |191The DOJ alleged that this competition had led to lower premiums and lower out-of-pocket-expenses, and had improved formularies and service in many regional markets. To preserve competition, the DOJ required Aetna to divest its individual prescription drug plan. As discussed in an earlier report (CEA 2018), CVS, Express Scripts, and OptumRx are the three largest pharmacy ben - efit managers in the United States. The American Medical Association (2018) expressed concern to the DOJ that but for the CVS-Aetna merger, Aetna might become a disruptive competitor in PBM markets. At the time, Aetna engaged in some PBM activities while outsourcing other activities to CVS. The DOJ did not raise concerns along these lines. The DOJ also recently reached a settlement in a conduct case against Atrium Health (formerly the Carolinas HealthCare System). The DOJ was con - cerned about provisions in Atrium's contracts with health insurers that were preventing insurers from offering financial incentives to their customers to choose providers that offer better value than Atrium, in terms of lower prices, better service, or both. The restrictions undercut the efforts of health insurers to induce competition between providers by creating health plans that provide incentives for consumers to use providers that qualify for preferred tiers or in-network status. As discussed by Gee, Peters, and Wilder (2019), the DOJ's economic analysis was consistent with academic research suggesting that these plans help to reduce premiums. Accelerating generic drug approvals. HHS has taken a number of actions to empower consumers and promote competition, building on accomplish - ments such as the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) record pace of generic drug approvals (CEA 2018). Initiatives to clarify regulatory expectations for drug developers, coupled with internal review process enhancements, improved the speed and predictability of the generic drug review process at the FDA, resulting in a record number of generic drug approvals in the first three years of the Trump Administration. In fiscal year 2019, the FDA approved a record 1,171 generic drugs, after record approvals from the previous two years (HHS 2019c). These actions contributed to the recent decrease (see box 5-1) in prescription drug prices; in June 2019, these prices saw their largest year-over-year decrease in 51 years (see chapter 2 for more discussion of the Administration's deregulatory actions). Creating price and quality transparency. On June 24, 2019, the President signed an Executive Order to promote price and quality transparency through a set of new initiatives (White House 2019b). A major problem in the healthcare market is that patients often do not know the price or quality of healthcare services. This lack of transparency denies patients the vital information they need to make informed choices and exacerbates increased costs, suppressed competition, and lower quality. As a result, there are wide variations in prices across healthcare markets, even for the same services, as was described earlier in this chapter. Accurate, accessible price and quality information will allow 250-840_text_.pdf 195 2/7/20 3:46 PM192| Chapter 5patients to identify savings by \"shopping\" for healthcare services and make choices that fit their healthcare needs and financial situations. Additionally, transparency in healthcare prices and quality will lead to better value and more innovations by facilitating increased competition among healthcare providers. One of the first results of this initiative is a rule requiring hospitals to publish their negotiated hospital charges (84 FR 61142). The new Executive Order Box 5-1. The Consumer Price Index for Prescription Drugs Despite arguments that prescription drug prices have increased in 2019, drug prices according to the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs (CPI-Rx) have declined (year-over-year) in 9 of the past 11 months, as of the October 2019 release of CPI. The CPI is designed to provide an empirical measure of the impact of price changes on the cost of living. As a component of the gen - eral CPI, the CPI-Rx measures how prices are changing in the prescription drug market by indexing the weighted average of the price changes in a random sample of prescription drugs (see figure 3-5). The CPI-Rx has several strengths (CEA 2019c). First, it includes a ran- dom sample of prescription drugs and provides a summary measure that is representative of the entire market of prescription drugs. Even if prices are increasing for a large number of rarely prescribed drugs, the CPI-Rx can show an average decrease if the prices of the most commonly prescribed drugs are decreasing. A second strength of the CPI-Rx is that it accounts for generic drugs. Lower-cost generic bioequivalents of many prescription drugs are widely available and are often purchased over name brands, and the CPI-Rx captures price decreases from new generic entries. The CPI-Rx also measures transaction prices instead of list prices. The transaction price includes all pay - ments received by the pharmacy, including out-of-pocket payments and pay-ments from insurance companies, and it corresponds to the negotiated price and reflects discounts\u2014though not rebates. The list price does not include discounts and rebates and is less representative of what the customer pays. Though the CPI-Rx is the best measure of overall prescription drug inflation, it is not a perfect measure. One of its main limitations is that it does not account for the improvement in consumer value that occurs with the entry of new goods, particularly when they are of a higher quality than existing goods. This bias is believed to cause the CPI-Rx to overstate the true level of prescription drug inflation and has been estimated to be as high as 2 percentage points a year (Boskin et al. 1996). A comparison between the CPI-Rx and a separately constructed large alternative data set of drug prices from the research firm IQVIA showed larger price increases in the IQVIA index, indicating that the CPI-Rx may not be fully representative of a larger sample (Bosworth et al. 2018). Additionally, even though the CPI-Rx for drug prices indicates reasonable increases or declines, there may be some drug products for which price changes can appear extreme. 250-840_text_.pdf 196 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |193directs providers as well as insurers to reveal negotiated prices on a routine basis to aid consumers in their purchase of competitively priced medical care and treatments. The Executive Order also includes the development of the Health Quality Roadmap (HHS 2019a). The Roadmap will align and improve reporting on data and quality measures across Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Health Insurance Marketplace, the Military Health System, and the Veterans Affairs Health System. To accomplish this goal, the Roadmap will provide a strategy for advancing common quality measures, aligning inpatient and outpatient measures; and eliminating low-value or counterproductive measures. The Executive Order also calls for increased access to de-identified claims data from taxpayer-funded healthcare programs and group health plans. Healthcare researchers, innovators, providers, and entrepreneurs can use these de-identified claims, which will still ensure patient privacy and security, to develop tools that enable patients to access information that helps with decisions about healthcare goods and services. Increased data access can reveal inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement, including perfor - mance patterns for medical procedures that are outside the recommended standards of care. The 2019 Price and Quality Transparency Executive Order seeks to make all healthcare prices negotiated between payers and providers non-opaque and to help those shopping for healthcare to get the best value and lowest price, as they do in other markets outside healthcare. The policy execution of revealing negotiated prices between payers is currently under way, and the impact will be able to be assessed in future analyses. One estimate places the potential savings from common medical procedures to be nearly 40 percent on a nationwide basis (Blase 2019b). Promoting new vaccine manufacturing. In September 2019, the President signed an Executive Order promoting new influenza vaccine manufacturing technologies to reduce production times and increase vaccine effectiveness. Millions of Americans suffer from seasonal influenza every year, and new vac - cines are formulated each year to decrease infections from the most prevalent influenza viruses. Vaccines are incredibly effective against influenza, with one study finding that vaccines prevented over 40,000 influenza-related deaths between 2005 and 2014 (Foppa et al. 2015). Despite their effectiveness, current methods of vaccine production are often very slow and can diminish vaccines' efficacy in protecting against seasonal influenza infection. Production delays could be even more important in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak. The CEA (2019d) found that the cost of delay in vaccine availability in the case of a pandemic is $41 billion per week for the first 12 weeks and $20 billion per week for the next 12 weeks. 250-840_text_.pdf 197 2/7/20 3:46 PM194| Chapter 5The new Executive Order identifies the weaknesses in current methods of vaccine production and promotes new technologies, such as cell-based and recombinant vaccine manufacturing, to speed vaccines' development and improve their efficacy. Additionally, the new initiative establishes a task force to increase Americans' access to vaccines. If sufficient doses of vaccines are delivered at the outset of an influenza pandemic, the CEA (2019c) estimates that $730 billion in economic benefits could be gained by Americans, primarily due to the prevention of loss of life and health. Clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Law and the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Administration proposed two rules in 2019 to provide coordinated care for patients (84 FR 55766) and to ensure that there are safeguards and flex - ibility for healthcare providers in value-based arrangements (84 FR 55694). The first rule proposed by CMS is part of the Administration's efforts to promote value-based care by lifting Federal restrictions on healthcare providers so that they have greater ability to work together on delivering coordinated patient care. The second proposed rule issued by the HHS Office of the Inspector General focuses on the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. This proposal addresses the concern that these laws needlessly limit how healthcare providers can coordinate patient care. Expanding flexibil - ity could, for example, encourage outcome-based payment arrangements that reward improved health outcomes. The changes would also offer specific safe harbors to make it easier for healthcare providers to ensure they are complying with the law (HHS 2019b). Increasing Access to Valuable Therapies This section covers a number of key topics on how to increase access to valu- able therapies. These include ending the HIV epidemic, expanding kidney disease treatment options, combating the opioid crisis, and expanding the right to try clinical trials. Ending the HIV epidemic. For the last four decades, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been one of the most prominent health risks confronting people in our country and around the world. In 2019, President Trump announced a plan to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years. This epi-demic has claimed the lives of about 700,000 Americans since 1981. The new initiative is designed to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the United States by 75 percent over the next five years, and by at least 90 percent over the next decade. Through efforts across HHS, an estimated 250,000 HIV infections could be averted over the next 10 years. The Administration also facilitated a large private donation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication, which will help reduce the risk of HIV infection for up to 200,000 patients per year for up to 11 years to provide critical PrEP medication to uninsured individuals who might otherwise be unable to access or afford it. 250-840_text_.pdf 198 2/7/20 3:46 PMFree-Market Healthcare Promotes Choice and Competition |195Expanding kidney disease treatment options. In July 2019, the President signed an Executive Order to enable better diagnosis, treatment, and preven- tive care for Americans suffering from chronic kidney disease. In line with the Administration's broader deregulatory agenda, a key focus of the Executive Order is an effort to remove regulatory barriers to the supply of kidneys. Currently, the Federal Government bears most of the cost paying for chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease care, which affect more than 37 million Americans (White House 2019d). More than 100,000 Americans begin dialysis each year to treat end-stage renal disease, half of whom die within five years. The Executive Order seeks to modernize and increase patient choice through affordable treatment options that are too expensive and fail to provide a high quality of life. As directed by the Executive Order, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a proposed rule to hold organ procurement organiza - tions more accountable for their performance (84 FR 70628). More than 113,000 Americans are currently on the waiting list for an organ transplants, a number that far exceeds the number of organs available. The rule raises performance standards for organ procurement organizations to reduce discarding viable organs, encourage higher donation rates, and shorten transplant waiting lists (CMS 2019a). Additionally, the Health Resources and Services Administration issued a proposed rule to alleviate financial barriers of organ donations (84 FR 70139). This rule would allow for reimbursement of lost wages and childcare and eldercare expenses for living donors lacking other means of financial sup-port, potentially increasing the number of transplant recipients over a shorter time period. Combating the opioid crisis. The Trump Administration is using Federal resources to fight against the opioid crisis in U.S. communities. Actions are focused on supporting those with substance use disorders and involving the criminal justice system to crack down on illicit opioid suppliers, both foreign and domestic. Over $6 billion in funding was secured in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for preventing drug abuse, treating use disorders, and disrupting the sup - ply of illicit drugs (OMB 2019). Investments include funding for programs sup - porting treatment and recovery, drug diversion, and State and local assistance. Chapter 7 outlines in more detail many of the Administration's accomplish - ments in combating the opioid crisis. Expanding the right to try. The Administration has made increased access to new and critical therapies a priority. One of the new bold programs in 2018 was the passage of \"Right-to-Try\" legislation for patients with terminal illnesses, such as cancer. The National Cancer Institute (n.d.) estimates that 1.76 million new Americans will be diagnosed with cancer and 606,880 will die from cancer in 2019. Currently, only 2 to 3 percent of adult cancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials\u2014an indication of the limited options for patients with life-threatening diseases (Unger et al. 2019).

Conclusion This chapter has identified Federal and State barriers to healthcare that increase prices, reduce innovation, and hinder improvements in quality. It also provided a summary of the accomplishments and expected effects of the Trump Administration's policies to address these barriers and deliver a healthcare system that offers high-quality care at affordable prices. By 2023, we estimate that 13 million Americans will have new insurance coverage that was previously unavailable due to high prices and overregulation. In contrast to the Administration's focus on improving consumer- directed healthcare spending, government mandates often reduce consumer choice. At all levels of government, healthcare regulations that limit choice, stifle competition, and increase prices should be updated so that the U.S. healthcare system can provide greater value. These regulations can also harm the broader economy. For example, the Affordable Care Act has impeded eco - nomic recovery by introducing disincentives to work (Mulligan 2015). Though market competition leads to an efficient allocation of resources that should lower prices and increase quality, every market has features that deviate from optimal conditions, and healthcare is no exception. Although the U.S. healthcare system has challenges, they are not insurmountable problems that mandate greater government intervention. The healthcare policy successes over the past three years show the value of empowering the market to deliver the affordable healthcare options that Americans rightly expect, and further reform will provide Americans with improved healthcare through enhanced choice and competition. 250-840_text_.pdf 200 2/7/20 3:46 PM197x Part II Evaluating and Addressing Threats to 201 2/7/20 3:46 PM250-840_text_.pdf 202 2/7/20 3:46 Evaluating the Risk of Declining Competition America's economic strength has always been driven by private sector com - petition. When large corporations, small businesses, and entrepreneurs all must innovate to compete for market share on a level playing field, American consumers win and the economy grows stronger. Yet even with the economic expansion becoming the longest in U.S. history, wage growth consistently meeting or exceeding 3 percent, unemployment falling to a 50-year low, and small business optimism within the top 20 percent of historical results, there is growing concern that the playing field is no longer level, harming innovation and thus the American economy. The increasing size of many of the Nation's largest companies and the growing importance of economies of scale has led some to hold the mistaken, simplistic view that \"Big Is Bad. \" Though anticompetitive behavior by companies of any size should lead to investigations and specific enforcement actions against offenders, an across-the-board backlash against large companies simply because of their size is unwarranted. Antitrust enforcers should continue to be particularly vigilant where firms have significant market power, given the harm they can cause if they engage in anticompetitive conduct. Moreover, under U.S. antitrust law, conduct that may be procompetitive for a small firm can become problematic if undertaken by a monopolist. However, the focus must be on the conduct and not on size alone. Successful companies benefit the economy and consumers, and they are not necessarily the threat to competition and economic growth that they are sometimes perceived to be. Instead, companies that achieve scale 250-840_text_.pdf 203 2/7/20 3:46 PM200| Chapter 6and large market share by innovating and providing their customers with value are a welcome result of healthy competition. As this chapter explains, the Trump Administration understands the vital role competition plays in growing the economy, promoting new business, and serving consumers. This understanding is underpinned by a deep appreciation of economic evidence, and the best available evidence shows that there is no need to hastily rewrite the Federal Government's antitrust rules. Federal enforcement agencies, which are already empowered with a flexible legal framework, have the tools they need to promote economic dynamism; as ongo - ing investigations and resolved cases show, they are well equipped to handle the competition challenges posed by the changing U.S. economy. This does not mean that the Trump Administration's work promoting competi - tion is finished. In addition to vigorously combating anticompetitive behavior from companies, the Administration is especially focusing on government policies that distort and limit competition. As historic regulatory reform across American industries has shown, cutting government-imposed barriers to innovation leads to increased competition, strong economic growth, and a revitalized private sector. Vigorous competition is essential for well-functioning markets and a dynamic economy. Therefore, the Trump Administration has cham - pioned policies that promote competition, such as reforming the tax code and removing costly and burdensome regulations. The Administration also promotes competition through sound antitrust policy, which protects consumers from anticompetitive mergers and business practices. Effective antitrust enforcement supports the Administration's deregulatory agenda by fostering self-regulating, competitive free markets. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u2014col - lectively, the Agencies\u2014share responsibility for enforcing the Nation's antitrust laws. This chapter evaluates antitrust policy and the Agencies' roles in light of recent trends in the U.S. economy and pressing debates about competition. In recent years, new technologies and business models have revolution- ized the relationships between firms and consumers. Some of these changes, such as rapidly improving information technology, have enabled firms to 250-840_text_.pdf 204 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |201grow, expanding their offerings from local markets to national ones, and from national markets to international ones. These changes have exacerbated concerns about rising concentration. That is, in some parts of the economy, the largest firms appear to account for an increasing share of revenues. An influential Obama-era CEA report, \"Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power\" (CEA 2016), argued that competi-tion may be decreasing. This report is part of a broader debate\u2014currently tak - ing place in government, academia, and policy circles\u2014about the state of com - petition in the economy. Proponents of the view that competition is declining (e.g., Faccio and Zingales 2018; Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2019; Philippon 2019) argue that big businesses face little competition and are earning profits at the expense of consumers and suppliers. Advocates such as Furman (2018) and the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019) have called for changes to com - petition policy that would broaden the scope of antitrust enforcement. Others have cautioned that these proposals are not supported by the economic evi - dence (Syverson 2019), or that current antitrust rules are adequate to address legitimate concerns about anticompetitive behavior (Yun 2019). Calls for changing the goals of the antitrust laws are based on empirical research that misinterprets high concentration as necessarily harmful to con - sumers and reflective of underenforcement. That argument was discredited long ago, when economists such as Demsetz (1973) and Bresnahan (1989) articulated the fundamental reasons why high concentration is not in and of itself an indicator of a lack of competition. The main point is that concentration may result from market features that are benign or even benefit consumers. For example, concentration may be driven by economies of scale and scope that can lower costs for consumers. Also, successful firms tend to grow, and it is important that antitrust enforcement and competition policy not be used to punish firms for their competitive success. Finally, antitrust remedies may not be required, even when firms exercise market power, because monopoly profits create incentives for new competitors to enter the market\u2014unless sub - stantive entry barriers or anticompetitive behavior stand in their way. Moreover, recent empirical arguments that competition is in decline have been based on broad, cross-industry studies. The findings from these studies are both problematic and incomplete, and their implications for competition remain speculative. In contrast, the methods that the Agencies use to analyze competition are rooted in microeconomic, empirical evidence and involve detailed analyses of competitive conditions in specific industries. Any conclu - sions about the state of competition should be made on the basis of this type of careful research. In addition, criticisms about the capabilities of antitrust enforcement to address novel enforcement challenges in dynamic markets fail to account for the flexibility of antitrust rules to accommodate a range of market conditions. Effective antitrust enforcement takes account of the evidence and economics 250-840_text_.pdf 205 2/7/20 3:46 PM202| Chapter 6appropriate to particular markets, and in turn adapts to innovation and devel - opment in the markets over time. In short, we argue that major policy initiatives to completely rewrite anti - trust rules and to create a new regulator for the digital economy are premature. In this chapter, we discuss and critique proposals for such initiatives advanced by proponents in the debate. As we explain, because these proposals are likely to impose significant costs, they should not be undertaken on the basis of cur - rent evidence. Finally, we discuss competition policy beyond antitrust law and the Administration's efforts to combat the negative impact of overly burdensome regulation on competition. We highlight the Trump Administration's successful efforts to streamline the process by which new drugs are brought to market, particularly generic drugs. We also discuss the Agencies' efforts to advocate for the removal of unnecessary occupational licensing requirements that limit entry into professions, certificate-of-need laws that limit entry by new hospi - tals, and automobile franchising laws that limit the ability of car manufacturers to sell cars directly to consumers. Here, we also discuss the Agencies' work at the intersection of intellectual property law and antitrust law. The structure of the chapter is as follows. We first provide an overview of antitrust policy and the economic analyses that the Agencies do to evaluate whether there is a need for the Federal Government to be involved to prevent anticompetitive mergers or other similar conduct. We then discuss the claims of rising concentration and the evidence on which they are based, contrasting this to the type of analysis that the Agencies do. Next, we discuss the propos - als for regulation, with a focus on the digital economy. In the last section, we discuss the Trump Administration's policies to spur competition outside the context of antitrust rules. The Origin and Principles of Antitrust Policy The Agencies follow the guiding principle that the role of antitrust law is to protect the competitive environment and the process of competition. The Agencies use their given authority for robust enforcement of antitrust law to prevent anticompetitive behavior by firms. They also seek to avoid undue interference by the Federal Government in the competitive process. The main antitrust statutes are the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. Together, these laws address three categories of conduct: mergers, monopolization, and anticompetitive agreements. First, under the Clayton Act, both Agencies chal - lenge mergers that have a reasonable likelihood of reducing competition. They also challenge acts of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act or the equivalent provision of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Finally, both Agencies challenge agreements among separate economic actors that place 250-840_text_.pdf 206 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |203unreasonable restraints on trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC 2019d). Certain types of conduct, such as collusion among competitors to fix prices or rig bids, are considered so harmful to competition that they are cate - gorized as criminal violations of the Sherman Act. The DOJ has long prioritized criminal enforcement of the antitrust laws, and violations carry significant financial fines and, for culpable individuals, jail time. For noncriminal conduct, whether for mergers or monopolization, a cen - tral challenge facing the Agencies is determining when conduct is procompeti - tive and when it is anticompetitive. It can be difficult to distinguish between the two, and optimal enforcement is often a balancing act. The Agencies and the Courts want to avoid mistakenly prohibiting conduct that is procompeti - tive, and they also want to avoid allowing conduct that is anticompetitive. To understand these challenges, consider a merger between direct com - petitors (i.e., a horizontal merger). The reduction in competition could encour - age the merged firm\u2014and also, perhaps, its competitors\u2014to raise prices. If higher prices or other competitive types of harm to consumers are the likely outcome of a merger, then the Agencies may file a lawsuit to seek to block the transaction. Conversely, a merger, even one between close competitors, can enhance competition by creating a stronger competitor. Mergers often allow firms to combine complementary assets to realize a variety of efficiencies. For example, they may realize cost reductions, improve the quality of their products, or develop new products. Cost reductions, in particular, create an incentive to reduce prices that can offset or even reverse any incentives to raise prices. As a result, horizontal mergers may in some cases lead to lower prices, not higher ones. As we discuss in the next section, when the Agencies review mergers, they conduct a detailed economic analysis to assess these complex issues. Most mergers do not raise competition issues. For example, the merging firms may not operate in the same or even related markets. Antitrust concerns are usually greatest when the merging parties are direct competitors. In rarer cases, antitrust concerns can arise when the merging firms are vertically related, such as when one firm sells inputs to the other. This was the case in the DOJ's challenge of the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, as is discussed by Gee, Peters, and Wilder (2019). When mergers are large enough, the merging parties must notify the Agencies in advance of merging. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, the Agencies received notice of 2,028 mergers that were potentially subject to review (DOJ and FTC 2019a). Most deals were allowed to proceed after an initial review that takes place within 30 days of the notifica - tion. In 45 matters, the reviewing agency identified competition issues and sought additional discovery from the parties to allow an in-depth investigation, in what is referred to as a \"Second Request.\" As figure 6-1 3:46 PM204| Chapter 6of second requests conducted by the Agencies has remained relatively stable over time. Economic Analysis at the Agencies To aid in distinguishing between procompetitive and anticompetitive conduct, the Agencies employ Ph.D. economists who specialize in the analysis of com - petition. The Agencies also hire outside economic experts to examine evidence in particular cases. Here, we provide an overview of how economic analysis is used in merger enforcement. Similar methods are used in other areas of antitrust enforcement. The central question in any merger review is whether the merger may substantially lessen competition. As explained in the \"Horizontal Merger Guidelines\" (DOJ and FTC 2010), this means that one or more firms affected by the merger are reasonably likely to raise prices, reduce output, decrease quality, reduce consumer choice, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm con-sumers. This is sometimes referred to as a consumer welfare standard, because the focus is on economic harm to consumers. Usually, this means harm to downstream customers of the merging firms, but the Agencies may also evaluate harm to upstream suppliers if there is a concern that the merger will enhance monopsony power, leading to lower prices or other types of economic harm for the suppliers deprived of competition for the sale of their goods or services; see box 6-1. Importantly for the digital age, the consumer welfare 05001,0001,5002,0002,500 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Mergers receiving s econd- stage review Total mergers potentially subject to second-stage reviewFigure 6-1.

The consumer welfare standard is also different from a total welfare standard, which would focus on overall efficiency, or outcomes that maximize the joint surplus of consumers and firms.1 To evaluate the likelihood of consumer harm, the Agencies analyze a variety of evidence. They may seek documents, testimony, and data from the merging parties. They may also seek information from other affected parties including customers, suppliers, and rival firms. An important part of the analysis is to determine the nature of competi - tion. Competition takes a variety of forms, and the effect of a merger depends on how competition works in the affected markets. For example, firms set prices in a variety of ways. They may be posted, as is common in the retail sec - tor, or they may be negotiated, as is common in business-to-business services. In some cases, negotiations between buyers and sellers are structured with a formal auction process. These and other differences shape the nature of com - petition. In some markets, competition is so fierce that two competing firms 1 Wilson (2019) has a discussion of the pros and cons of alternative antitrust standards. Box 6-1. Antitrust and Monopsony: George's Foods and Tyson Foods Although most merger reviews focus on types of harm to downstream consumers, the Agencies may also investigate antitrust concerns relating to monopsony. In 2011, the DOJ challenged George's Foods' acquisition of a chicken-processing complex in Harrisonburg, Virginia, that was owned by Tyson Foods. Both companies provide chicken-processing services for birds that are raised by the surrounding area's farmers. The processors own the birds, provide the chicks and feed, and transport the birds between the farm and processing plants. The farmers (\"growers\") work under contract with the processors, providing chicken houses, equipment, and labor for raising the chickens. Before the merger, George's Foods and Tyson Foods competed directly with each other for purchasing the services of growers in the Shenandoah Valley. The merger reduced the number of competitors from three to two, leaving George's Foods with about 40 percent of local processing capacity. The DOJ raised concerns that the merger would allow George's Foods to decrease prices or degrade contract terms to growers in the region. The other competing processor lacked the capacity to take on significant numbers of growers if George's were to depress prices. To remedy these concerns, George's agreed to invest in improvements in Tyson's chicken processing facilities, giving it an incentive to operate at a greater scale than before the merger. With an increased demand for chickens, George's also had an increased demand for the to drive prices down to the marginal cost. In other markets, many firms can profitably set prices significantly above the marginal cost. The strength of competition between any firms depends on the extent to which consumers view their products as substitutes. Firms often sell differenti - ated products. This means that their products are similar, but not identical, and consumers may have strong (or weak) preferences between them. An important part of the economic analysis is assessing how close the merging firms' products are to each other in the view of consumers. Concerns about a lessening of competition will usually be greatest if many consumers view the firms' products as each other's closest substitutes. For example, some brands of breakfast cereal are so different in flavor, nutrition, and other attributes that few consumers regard them as substitutes, and competition between them is weak. Other brands of breakfast cereal probably compete head-to-head. To assess the closeness of products, economists at the Agencies review evidence such as win/loss reports, discount approval processes, customer switching patterns, and consumer surveys. Based on such evidence, the Agencies identify relevant markets where competition is likely to be harmed. This analysis is based on demand substitu - tion, or how consumers would respond to the increase in the price of a product. For example, if the evidence were to show that few people would switch to eating sugary breakfast cereals if the price of \"heart-healthy\" breakfast cereals were to rise, the Agencies might define a market for \"heart-healthy\" breakfast cereals that excludes the sugary alternatives. How broadly or narrowly to define markets can be a source of contention, as the shares of the merging firms will appear lower in broader markets. If markets are defined too broadly, they will contain products that do not significantly constrain the prices of the merging firms. The lower shares of the merging firms may then wrongly sug - gest that there is more competition than actually exists. The Agencies also identify the relevant geography for a market. Markets may have a limited geography based either on consumers' preferences or on sellers' ability to serve them. For example, for most people, restaurants in Los Angeles and New York are probably not close substitutes. Nor would a flight from Los Angeles to New York be a good substitute for a flight from New York to Washington. In mergers of airlines, the DOJ often defines markets consisting of origin and destination pairs. A relevant market might include nonstop flights from San Francisco to Los Angeles if the merging parties both offer such flights. The Agencies use a methodological tool, known as the hypothetical monopolist test, to delineate relevant markets. The test imagines that a single profit-maximizing firm monopolizes the candidate market and then analyzes whether the monopolist would \"impose at least a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\" (DOJ and FTC 2010, 9). The Agencies usually define markets to be the smallest ones that satisfy the test. When a market is 250-840_text_.pdf 210 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |207defined this way, products in the market significantly constrain each other's prices, but products outside the market do not. After defining a relevant market, the Agencies calculate shares for all firms in the market and assess the level of concentration. Markets are clas - sified as unconcentrated, moderately concentrated, or highly concentrated, based on thresholds of the HHI; see box 6-2. Markets with HHIs above 2,500 are considered highly concentrated. In such markets, the Agencies presume that mergers that increase the HHI by more than 200 points are likely to be anticompetitive. However, the merging parties can rebut this presumption with persuasive evidence. To illustrate the role of market definition, consider the recent merger of the Walt Disney Company and Twentieth-Century Fox. The DOJ was concerned about competition between ESPN, which was owned by Disney, and the Fox Regional Sports networks. A key question was how much competition these cable sports networks faced from the sports programming shown on the major broadcast networks. The DOJ alleged that the licensing of cable sports pro - gramming to multichannel video programming distributors, such as Comcast and FIOS, was a relevant market, and one in which the merging parties had high shares. In excluding broadcast programming from the market, the DOJ alleged that the broadcast networks did not provide sufficiently close compe - tition to prevent competitive harm. As stated in the complaint, multichannel video programming distributors do not typically consider broadcast network programming as a replacement for cable sports programming because broad-cast networks offer limited airtime to sports programming and are focused on marquee events with broad appeal. The DOJ approved the merger only after the parties agreed to divest Fox's interests in its regional sports networks (DOJ 2018a, 2018b). The inquiry into market share is a starting point for economic analysis, but the ultimate goal is to assess whether the merger is likely to have adverse competitive effects. A merger may harm competition because there are fewer competitors competing (unilateral effects), or it could harm competition by encouraging explicit or tacit coordination between rivals (coordinated effects). As noted above, mergers may harm competition in prices, or they may harm competition in nonprice dimensions, such as quality or innovation. To evaluate competitive effects, the Agencies use a variety of evidence. Market shares are one type of evidence, but other evidence is also considered. For example, the Agencies may analyze how a recent merger in the same mar - ket affected competition. Or, if the merging firms compete in some local mar - kets, but not others, the Agencies may compare prices across regions where the firms do and do not compete. In markets with differentiated products, such as breakfast cereal, the Agencies may estimate diversion ratios. A diversion ratio is a measure of how closely two products compete. For a first product sold by one of the merging firms and a second product sold by the other merging 250-840_text_.pdf 211 2/7/20 3:46 PM208| Chapter 6firm, the diversion ratio is the percentage of sales that the first product would lose to the second product, if the price of the first product increases. The higher the diversion ratio, the closer the competition. The Agencies sometimes use diversion ratios in the context of economic models that simulate how firms would change their prices after a merger. The Agencies also consider whether efficiencies or entry are likely to offset or reverse adverse competitive effects. The analysis of competitive effects has become more important over time. As discussed by Shapiro (2010), the Agencies revised the Horizontal Merger Guidelines in 1982 to downplay the emphasis on market shares and to increase the emphasis on competitive effects.2 With this change in empha - sis, antitrust enforcement also became less interventionist. Shapiro (2010) observes that the 1968 Horizontal Merger Guidelines stated that the Agencies \"ordinarily challenge\" mergers between an acquiring firm with at least 15 per - cent market share and an acquired firm with at least 1 percent market share. 2 Shapiro (2010, 51-52). See also Lamoreaux (2019); Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019); and Peltzman (2014). Box 6-2. Measuring Concentration and the HHI Concentration is a measure of the number and size of firms competing in a market. When markets are delineated around competition, concentration can be a useful reflection of competitive conditions. In highly concentrated mar - kets\u2014those markets with a small number of large firms\u2014mergers between large firms are relatively likely to enhance market power, leading the merged firm to raise prices, reduce quality, reduce innovation, or otherwise harm consumers. The Agencies usually measure concentration in terms of a firm's share of market revenues, but concentration can be defined around other measures, such as unit sales. The Agencies use the measure that best reflects the competitive significance of firms in the market. For example, if physical capacity limits the ability of firms to expand their production, market shares may be measured in terms of physical capacity. A firm that is poised to enter a market, but is not yet selling anything, may be assigned a market share based on projected revenues. The Agencies measure concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the individual firms' market shares in a relevant market. In a monopolized market with only one firm, the firm's share is 100 percent, and the HHI is 100^2, or 10,000. In a market with 100 firms each with 1 percent share, the HHI is much lower, at 100. A higher HHI corresponds to a more concentrated market. A merger between two firms combines their shares, so the HHI increases. For example, if a market has four equal-sized firms and two of the firms merge, the HHI increases from 2,500 to 3,750. 250-840_text_.pdf 212 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |209Mergers of this sort would be unlikely to be challenged today, because the analysis of competitive effects is rarely supportive of antitrust enforcement in such cases. However, many people argue that the Agencies intervene too rarely in the modern era. Opponents of this view argue that antitrust overenforcement is more harmful than antitrust underenforcement. This is because if markets become overly concentrated to the point that profits are excessive, new firms are likely to enter to take up the slack. Proponents of more aggressive enforce - ment argue that new firm entry is often not guaranteed. In markets where entry is difficult (i.e., there are high barriers to entry), established firms may reap excessive profits for long periods of time (Baker 2015). In the next section, we turn to this debate. A Renewed Interest in Concentration and the State 0f Competition Some observers of the U.S. economy have raised concerns that it is becom - ing less competitive. As noted above, in 2016, an influential CEA policy brief (CEA 2016) argued that competition may be decreasing in many sectors, and President Obama issued an executive order directing Federal Government agencies to promote competition (White House 2016). Similar diagnoses and calls to regulatory action have been sounded by pundits and economists alike. 3 In this section, we first discuss problems with the evidence presented in the 2016 CEA report, and then we explain how similar issues are manifested in other research on this topic. We explain why drawing inferences about the state of competition or antitrust enforcement from this weak evidence is prob-lematic. Finally, we discuss alternative approaches to assessing if there is in fact a competition problem in the United States. Problems with the CEA's 2016 Report A central argument made in the 2016 CEA report, \"Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power,\" is that the rising market shares of the largest firms in many industries constitute evidence of declining competition. This argument is flawed both in terms of the evidence on market shares and the inference about competition. Table 6-1, which is taken from the 2016 CEA report, examines trends in the revenue share of the 50 largest firms\u2014known as the CR50\u2014in different industry segments. For background, the U.S. Census Bureau classifies firms using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which divides the entire economy into 24 sectors classified with two-digit numerical codes, or 3 Examples include Furman 2/7/20 3:46 PM210| Chapter 6two-digit sectors. These sectors are further divided into three-, four-, five-, and six-digit subsectors. The CEA (2016) and Furman (2018) examine concentration in 13 of the two-digit NAICS sectors. Table 6-1 shows that 10 sectors became concentrated by this measure over the 15-year period from 1997 to 2012. A key problem with table 6-1 is that the two-digit sectors are aggregations of overly broad geographic and product markets that shed little light on the state of competition. For example, retail trade includes all grocery stores, hard - ware stores, and gasoline stations, among many others, across the Nation. But grocery stores in Florida and Wisconsin do not compete for the same custom - ers, and hardware stores and gas stations, even those in the same local area, largely sell products that are unrelated in demand. Concentration measures defined by national segments also miss the dimension of local competition. Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, and Trachter (2019) find that the expansion of national firms into local markets has been a factor both in increasing concentration at the national level and in decreasing concentration at the local level. This approach contrasts with how the Agencies define relevant markets for antitrust analysis. As discussed above, the Agencies, and antitrust econo - mists more generally, analyze data on demand that reveal the extent to which consumers regard products as substitutes. In this way, markets are defined to include products that are in competition with each other in the local product markets where they compete. Even the finest six-digit NAICS sectors are far broader than typical antitrust markets. Werden and Froeb (2018) calculate the volume of commerce of the relevant markets alleged in DOJ merger complaints Transportation and warehousing 307.9 42.1 11.4 Retail trade 1555.8 36.9 11.2 Finance and insurance 1762.7 48.5 9.9 Wholesale trade 2183.1 27.6 7.3 Real estate rental and leasing 121.6 24.9 5.4 Utilities 367.7 69.1 4.6 Educational services 12.1 22.7 3.1 Professional, scientific, and technical services278.2 18.8 2.6 Administrative and support 159.2 23.7 1.6 Accommodation and food services149.8 21.2 0.1 Other services 46.7 10.9 -1.9 Arts, entertainment and recreation39.5 19.6 -2.2 Healthcare and assistance 350.2 17.2 -1.6 Note: Data represent all North American Industry Classification System sectors for which data were available from 1997 to 2012.Source: Census Bureau.Table 6-1.

They find that in most cases, the antitrust markets accounted for less than 0.5 percent of the six-digit NAICS sector. In many cases, this is because the antitrust markets where the DOJ identified a competition problem involved single localities such as a city, State, or region, whereas the NAICS sectors are national. Although studies of broad swaths of the economy, such as the 2016 CEA report, are necessarily limited by the data that are publicly available, the coarseness of the data limits what they can say about competition. A second problem with table 6-1 is the use of the CR50. The Agencies and other economists often find evidence of robust competition in markets with only a few firms engaged in head-to-head competition. Either the HHI (discussed above) or a four-firm concentration ratio (known as the CR4) would be more appropriate for a competition study. Note that in table 6-1, the CR50 are also usually much less than 100, meaning that there are more than 50 firms operating in the segment. Because of the overly broad market definition and the use of the CR50, the data presented in table 6-1 tell us nothing about competition in specific markets, let alone across the entire economy. Carl Shapiro, a former CEA mem - ber and Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economics under the Obama Administration, concluded that table 6-1 \"is not informative regarding overall trends in concentration in well-defined relevant markets that are used by anti - trust economists to assess market power, much less trends in competition in the U.S. economy\" (Shapiro 2018, 722). Problems with Related Research The CEA's 2016 report, \"Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power,\" is part of a larger body of recent research arguing that competition may be in decline. Much of this literature tries to infer the state of competition from correlations between flawed concentration measures, such as those presented in table 6-1, and market outcomes, such as prices, profits, and markups. This methodology rests on a problematic assumption that increases in concentration create conditions of softer competition. That is, if undesirable outcomes\u2014such as higher prices, profits, and markups\u2014are correlated with concentration, then the cause of these outcomes is assumed to be weaker competition. Recent papers in this vein include the 2016 CEA report; and those by Furman (2018); Furman Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019). Problems with this assumption have been understood since at least the 1970s (Demsetz 1973; Bresnahan 1989). 4 The most fundamental problem is that there are alternative explanations for why a market might demon- strate both high concentration and high markups that are consistent with 4 For a recent, in-depth discussion, see Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019); and Syverson (2019). 250-840_text_.pdf 215 2/7/20 3:46 PM212| Chapter 6procompetitive behavior by firms. These include fixed costs, scale economies, and globalization. To see that this is true, consider the issue of fixed costs. In many markets, firms make upfront investments in assets such as physical plant, equipment, research and product development, and information technology. Firms will make these investments only if they anticipate earning sufficient profit mar - gins to recoup them. In terms of basic economics, if a firm has substantial fixed costs, then its average cost may be substantially higher than its marginal cost. A firm may earn a profit close to zero when fixed costs are accounted for, but still maintain a positive margin between price and marginal cost. The Agencies do not regard this as inherently problematic. As the Horizontal Merger Guidelines state, \"High margins commonly arise for products that are significantly differentiated. Products involving substantial fixed costs typically will be developed only if suppliers expect there to be enough differentiation to support margins sufficient to cover those fixed costs. High margins can be consistent with incumbent [established] firms earning competitive returns\" (DOJ and FTC 2010, 4); see box 6-3. Even if high concentration and high markups are not inherently problem - atic, what about rising concentration and rising markups? This depends on why the markups and concentration are rising. Suppose that fixed costs are rising. If they are rising for anticompetitive reasons, such as if new and unnecessary government regulations are raising the cost of entry, then the trend may be associated with higher prices and consumer harm. But fixed costs could also be rising because firms are making increasingly expensive investments to become more competitive. Information technology in particular can involve upfront investments in business systems that help to reduce a firm's marginal cost of production or improve product quality. A firm that makes such investments may outcompete less efficient firms and grow its market share. Through such a process, information technology could transform a market to one with fewer, more efficient firms. Because the surviving firms have lower marginal costs, their prices may fall even as their markups rise. This scenario is procompetitive because consumers derive benefits from the lower prices or improved quality. Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019) review recent research, providing evidence that investments in intangible assets such as software and business processes are becoming more important. Crouzet and Eberly (2019), in particu - lar, find a positive correlation between firms' market shares (in broad industry segments) and their investments in intangible assets. In the view of Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019), the broad category of \"increasing investments in fixed and sunk costs\" may be the most important source of rising global markups. Autor and others (2019) find evidence that increases in concentration reflect a reallocation of output toward large, productive firms. They argue that this could be the result of globalization and technological change, and further observe that their explanation for rising concentration has \"starkly different 250-840_text_.pdf 216 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |213Box 6-3. Concentration, Innovation, and Competition Industries that rely on innovation often provide dramatic examples of high fixed costs. Consistent with this situation, concentration is often high. The relationship between concentration, competition, efficiency, and consumer welfare is complex. Competition can spur firms to innovate, but it can also weaken their incentives to innovate by making it difficult for them to recoup their investments. In research spanning decades, economists have found that different models give different answers about whether higher concentration increases or decreases innovation, and results about the optimal level of con - centration are often sensitive to market conditions (Marshall and Parra 2019). To illustrate, Igami and Uetake (2019) study these trade-offs in the hard disk drive industry. As shown in figures 6-i and 6-ii, the period had waves of entry and exit as the industry matured and consolidated. Innovation was of central importance, as the industry followed Kryder's law, that the storage capacity of hard disk drives doubles roughly every 12 months. After estimating a model of dynamic oligopoly, Igami and Uetake (2019) simulate the effect of alternative merger policies on expected social welfare. They conclude that a policy to block mergers if there are three or fewer firms would have found \"approximately the right balance between pro-competitive effects and value-destruction side effects.\" Although such a policy might not be optimal in 250-840_text_.pdf 217 2/7/20 3:46 PM214| Chapter 6implications\" for welfare than explanations based on weakened competition or antitrust enforcement. That is, if rising concentration and markups are driven by conduct that benefits consumers, such as can be the case for invest-ments in intangible assets, then there may be no competition problem and no antitrust implications. In addition to the fundamental error of equating concentration with a lack of competition, there are also other problems with the recent literature on other industries or for any particular merger, this study helps to illustrate why competition can be robust in markets with relatively few firms. The proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes by Halliburton provides an example of when innovation was central to a merger review (DOJ 2016). Halliburton, Baker-Hughes, and Schlumberger were the three leading firms in the oilfield services industry, providing sophisticated drilling technology and related services for drilling oil wells. Each invested hundreds of millions of dollars annually in research and development; for products where innova - tion was most important, there were few other competitors. The DOJ sued to block Halliburton's proposed acquisition of Baker-Hughes, delineating 23 relevant products and services where the proposed merger would result in markets dominated by the merged firm and Schlumberger. The DOJ was not satisfied that Halliburton's proposed divestitures would remedy the potential harm, and the parties ultimately abandoned their plans (Chugh et al. 2016). 250-840_text_.pdf 218 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |215concentration. Similar to the CEA's 2016 report, these studies' use of Census and other macroeconomic data limits them to examining concentration in NAICS industry segments that are too broad to shed light on competitive con - ditions in properly defined antitrust markets. Many of the studies use data for three-digit or four-digit and discussed above, even the finest six-digit NAICS segments are far broader than antitrust markets. Another problem is that many of the studies explore links between concentration and financial measures, such as markups and profits, that are difficult to measure\u2014especially across broad industry segments. Price-cost markups, in particular, are a basic measure of market power, but firm-level data on markups are rarely available. Accounting data are sometimes infor-mative about the markup of price over average variable cost, but they do not accurately measure the economic profit margins that are relevant to economic analysis. Basu (2019) reviews different approaches to estimating markups used in the recent research discussed above. He discusses problems with the meth - ods, including that most of the estimates of markups are implausibly large. Connecting Concentration and Markups with Antitrust Law The assessment of the competitive health of the economy should be based on studies of properly defined markets, together with conceptual and empiri - cal methods and data that are sufficient to distinguish between alternative explanations for rising concentration and markups. This continues to be the approach of the Agencies. In line with this, Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019, 63) call for a wave of \"industry-level econometric studies . . . to help us understand shifts in markups, the underlying causes, and more broadly how markets in our modern economy are functioning and evolving.\" In their view, regressions of market outcomes on measures of concentration should carry little weight in policy debates because they do not and cannot illuminate causal relationships. Syverson (2019) is more optimistic that economy-wide studies can be helpful to identify patterns of increasing concentration for further research, but he concludes that the evidence does not yet support conclusions that rising aggregate market power exists and is causing problematic trends in the economy. Like Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019), Syverson (2019) calls for more careful research. The airline industry provides an example where detailed, publicly avail- able data have enabled insightful research. Werden and Froeb (2018) review this literature to conclude that since deregulation in the late 1970s, studies have not found systematic increases in concentration at the route level. Berry, Carnall, and Spiller (2006) note that investments in hub-and-spokes networks enabled airlines to earn high markups, but also benefited consumers. Moreover, Berry, Gaynor, and Morton (2019) cite Borenstein (2011) to observe that for many years, the large fixed costs associated with hub-and-spokes 250-840_text_.pdf 219 2/7/20 3:46 PM216| Chapter 6networks were just offset by high markups, leaving the major airlines with near-zero profits. Other useful studies focus on how consummated mergers have affected market outcomes. In these studies, the increase in concentration is explicitly caused by a merging of competitors, so there is no question about why concen - tration has increased. For example, Ashenfelter, Hosken, and Weinberg (2015) study the 2008 joint venture between the beer giants Miller and Coors. The DOJ approved the deal, in part because it was expected to significantly reduce the costs of shipping and distribution (Heyer, Shapiro, and Wilder, 2009). Ashenfelter, Hosken, and Weinberg (2015) find little effect on prices, because the efficiencies created by the merger nearly exactly offset the realized price increases in the average market. However, in an analysis of the same market, Miller and Weinberg (2017) find evidence that the joint venture may have facilitated price coordination between competitors. These conflicting results illustrate some of the important nuances related to competition that broad industry studies cannot assess. At this point, the evidence that the United States has a broad competi - tion problem is inconclusive. However, the CEA's 2016 report and the related literature discussed above have spurred debate in government, academia, and policy circles about ways to strengthen antitrust enforcement to deal with the perceived competition problem. We now turn to this debate. Calls for a Broader Interpretation of Antitrust Policy The 2016 CEA report, \"Benefits of Competition and Indicators of Market Power,\" and the related literature discussed above are part of a broader move - ment that is concerned with the growth of large firms across the U.S. economy. Lamoreaux (2019) provides a useful overview. Some of these observers want to amend or rewrite the antitrust laws to expand the Federal Government's involvement beyond its traditional scope to consider outcomes unrelated to market competition, including the political influence of large corporations, control of advertising and news media, and rising income inequality. For example, Furman and Orszag (2018) raise the question of whether a rising share of firms earning \"supernormal returns on capital\" might increase wage inequality due to workers at these firms sharing in the supernormal returns. Also, as we discuss in the next section, some observers are calling for regula - tions specifically for the digital economy. Other observers are focused on traditional antitrust law, but would like enforcement to be expanded by lowering the threshold for an act to be considered anticompetitive. For example, one Senate bill would change the language of the Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers where the effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition.\" The bill would change the standard of 250-840_text_.pdf 220 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |217\"substantially\" to a standard of \"materially.\" This would mean that the Federal Government could block a merger that has a smaller effect on competition (U.S. Congress 2019a). As we have discussed, the argument that the U.S. economy is suffering from insufficient competition is built on a weak empirical foundation and questionable assumptions. Antitrust law has evolved through careful devel - opment of its case law, based on the legal system's accumulated experience with enforcement actions and the effects of specific types of acts on industries characterized by specific competitive dynamics. Throughout its development, antitrust law has consistently proven flexible to the evolving market condi-tions presented by new industries and business models in the ever-changing American economy. Before making radical changes to the law, the case for such change should be better grounded. Moreover, the antitrust laws are a poor tool for addressing issues that go beyond questions of anticompetitive market conduct. Using antitrust law to regulate markets in the absence of competition problems will exact costs on the economy by preventing efficient market organization. If society wants to pursue goals such as rising income inequality or the political power of large firms, there are better policy tools to deal with these issues (Shapiro 2018). We next turn to the related debate about whether more expansive anti - trust enforcement is needed for the digital economy. Antitrust Enforcement for the Digital Economy In this section, we focus on the rapidly evolving issue of antitrust enforcement and competition in the digital economy. In recent years, digital platforms have come under increasing scrutiny. In the United Kingdom, the government commissioned an expert panel to review competition policy for the digital economy (Digital Competition Expert Panel 2019c). Since the panel made its recommendations, the U.K. has been working to create its Digital Markets Unit. The European Union has also commissioned an expert report (Cr\u00e9mer, Montjoye, and Schweitzer 2019), and has introduced several regulations for digital platforms.5 In the United States, the FTC has conducted hearings to examine whether new technologies and business practices, including those associated with digital platforms, require adjustments to competition policy (FTC 2019b).The House and Senate Judiciary Committees have also held hearings related to competition policy for digital platforms (U.S. House 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; U.S. 5 The U.K. Digital Markets Unit would develop and enforce regulations related to data interoperability, data mobility, and data openness. It would have the authority to designate certain platforms as having \"strategic market status.\" Such platforms would be subject to stronger regulations. In July 2019, the European Union issued new regulations governing how platforms interact with businesses (European Commission 2019). Rules on data portability and privacy, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018. 250-840_text_.pdf 221 2/7/20 3:46 PM218| Chapter 6Senate 2019). Independently, the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago has organized a committee on digital platforms that has developed recom - mendations for stronger antitrust enforcement and a digital regulator (Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms 2019). The Agencies have also opened reviews into market-leading online platforms, focusing on antitrust and related issues (Bloomberg 2019; DOJ 2019). Although this chapter focuses on competition concerns, we note that some of these reviews also consider whether consumer protection regulations are warranted for issues such as data privacy and the moderation of media content. Background Digital platforms are intermediaries that enable interactions between users. They include search engines, online market places, social networks, com - munication and media platforms, and home-sharing and ride-sharing services, among other examples. Many of these platforms have been enormously suc - cessful and have reshaped the economy over the last 20 years. Some concerns about digital platforms rest on the idea that they often operate in markets with economic features that naturally tend toward high concentration. One such feature is network effects, which arise when consum - ers place more value in a platform because many other people use it. For example, the more people one can reach with a messaging service, the more valuable that service is to users. When network effects are important, the larg - est platforms enjoy an advantage over their rivals simply because they have more users, regardless of the quality of their services. In some cases, the advan - tage may be so great that other firms are unable to compete. For example, in the videocassette recording industry, the Betamax technology essentially disappeared after VHS technology pulled ahead (Werden 2001). In markets with network effects or other types of economies of scale, firms may compete for the entire market, rather than for shares in the market. The resulting monopolies may not be permanent. Bourne (2019) gives many examples of firms that achieved dominance through network effects or pro - duction economies of scale, only to eventually lose out to competition from innovative rivals. His examples range from the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company in the 1920s to MySpace and Nokia in the early part of this century. One of the current debates is about the extent to which digital platform industries are characterized by high barriers to entry. A barrier to entry is an obstacle that puts new firms at a disadvantage relative to firms already in the market.6 Network effects can be a barrier to entry, particularly if an entrant must simultaneously attract two groups of users. For example, in the payments 6 The formal definition of a barrier to entry has a long history of debate among economists. For a discussion, see Werden (2001). 250-840_text_.pdf 222 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |219industry, a new payment system might need to sign up thousands of merchants before consumers see it as valuable, and vice versa. However, network effects are not always sufficient to deter entry. If an entrant has an offsetting advan-tage, it may be able to overcome the advantage enjoyed by the established platform. For example, when Microsoft introduced the Xbox platform for video gaming, it was able to overcome the network effects enjoyed by the Sony PlayStation 2 by focusing on a few blockbuster games (Lee 2013). There is also a debate about the extent to which access to data can be a barrier to entry. Mahnke (2015) discusses the issue in the context of the DOJ's 2008 investigation of the merger of the media firms Thomson and Reuters. The DOJ alleged that the merger would lead to higher prices for data sets related to company fundamentals, earnings, and aftermarket research, and that entrants would not be able to replicate the high quality of these data sets. The DOJ approved the merger, but only after the parties agreed to divest copies of the data sets along with supporting assets (DOJ 2008). Data can also be a barrier to entry in the digital economy. Because dominant platforms have more users, they often have access to much more data than new entrants, and this can give them an insurmountable advantage (Rubinfeld and Gal 2017). For example, dominant platforms may be better able to target advertising at their users and so earn more revenues from advertis - ing. However, a lack of access to data does not always deter entry. Lambrecht and Tucker (2015) observe that Airbnb, Uber, and Tinder entered markets where established firms (e.g., Expedia) had better data. They were able to suc - ceed because of their innovative products. Lambrecht and Tucker (2015) also observe that data are nonrivalrous, in the sense that data can be shared and consumed by many users, in contrast to rivalrous goods such as food, which are consumed only once. Because of this, entrants can sometimes buy data as a substitute for collecting them internally from their users. However, this is not always the case, and the role of data as a barrier to entry depends on the facts and context of each market. Finally, another debate asks whether dominant platforms are harming competition by buying too many smaller firms, such as start-ups funded with venture capital. It is common for large platforms to acquire smaller firms. The digital economy relies heavily on innovation, and being acquired by an established firm can be an important exit path for initial investors. Acquisition can also be important for a start-up's success. The acquiring firm may bring marketing, financing, and other business assets that enable the start-up to grow. However, if a start-up is not acquired, it might instead grow into an independent, full-fledged competitor. Some acquisitions may occur precisely to prevent such competition, as Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma (2019) find to 250-840_text_.pdf 223 2/7/20 3:46 PM220| Chapter 6be the case in the pharmaceutical industry. 7 However, as we discuss further below, it can be challenging for the Agencies to assess whether acquisitions of nascent competitors are procompetitive or anticompetitive in light of the benefits associated with them. In summary, many digital platform markets have demand and supply fea - tures, suggesting that high concentration is efficient. The concentration has led to concerns about market dominance, anticompetitive behavior, and a lack of competition. But concentration can also be efficient, and there may be robust competition for the market, even in the face of high concentration. Proposals for Intervention Advocates of stronger regulation for digital platforms recommend a range of measures encompassing both antitrust reform and regulation\u2014see, for exam - ple, the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019); the Digital Competition Expert Panel (2019c); and Cr\u00e9mer, Montjoye, and Schweitzer (2019). Here, we consider proposals related to data portability and interoperability, acquisi - tions of nascent competitors, and the creation of a digital regulatory authority. Data portability and interoperability . Proposals to increase data portabil - ity and interoperability involve new regulations and legislation. Portability regulations would require digital platforms to enable customers to access their data from different platforms on request. Interoperability legislation would require digital platforms to enable their customers to switch their data from one platform to another. For example, a bill recently proposed in the Senate would require large communication platforms that generate income from their users' data to enable data portability and interoperability with other communication platforms. The goal is to reduce entry barriers for competitors to these platforms by making it less costly for customers to switch from one platform to another, and also by allowing customers of dominant platforms to communicate easily with customers of rival platforms (U.S. Congress 2019b). As with any regulation, however, this would impose costs on the regu - lated platforms. Jia, Jin, and Wagman (2019) study the effect of the recent rollout of rules on data privacy and portability in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), on venture capital funding. They find nega - tive effects on European firms relative to their U.S. counterparts in terms of total funding, the number of deals and the amount raised per deal, with more pronounced effects for newer and data-related firms. Acquisitions of nascent competitors. As discussed above, proponents of stronger antitrust enforcement raise concerns that dominant platforms are protecting themselves by acquiring small firms that would otherwise develop 7 In a study of the pharmaceutical industry, Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma (2019) conclude that about 6 percent of acquisitions in their sample were \"killer acquisitions\" that forestalled the development of new drugs that would otherwise have competed with the acquirer's existing products. 250-840_text_.pdf 224 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |221into future competitors. Antitrust law has an existing framework to challenge such mergers under theories of potential competition and disruptive entrants (DOJ and FTC 2010). In 2018, the FTC challenged a merger between CDK Global and Auto/Mate. The acquiring firm, CDK, was a market leader in specialized business software for franchise automotive dealers. Auto/Mate was a much smaller competitor with an innovative business model that was an emergent threat. Although Auto/Mate was already competing, the FTC was largely con - cerned about the competition it would likely provide in the future (FTC 2018b; Ohlhausen 2019). Predicting future competition can be difficult in the digital economy because products and services evolve rapidly. Dominant platforms may acquire start-ups that offer no competing products, but that could compete with them in the future through expansion into adjacent markets. To address this issue, some proposals for revising the antitrust laws would weaken the evi - dentiary standards when a dominant firm seeks to acquire a firm in a separate but adjacent market. For example, the Agencies might meet their initial burden of proof by showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that the target firm would compete with the acquiring firm in the future, even if the target firm has no specific plans to do so (Shapiro 2019). Such policies could have important downsides. More aggressive stan - dards for blocking mergers of nascent competitors would raise the likelihood that procompetitive mergers would be blocked. As discussed above, the digital economy relies heavily on innovation. If dominant platforms were routinely deterred from acquiring start-ups, such a policy could reduce venture capital funding in this segment. During the U.K. panel review, a variety of organizations and individuals raised these concerns (Digital Competition Expert Panel 2019a, 2019b). At a minimum, the potential effect of any new policy on venture capital deserves study. More research, including merger retrospectives focused on acquisitions in the digital economy, would also be helpful. Creation of a digital regulatory authority. The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019) found that \"the strongest indication emerging from the four reports is the importance of having a single powerful regulator capable of overseeing all aspects of [digital platforms].\" In terms of competition goals, the digital regulator would have a mandate to design and enforce regulations aimed to enhance competition, such as standards for data portability and interoperability. The authority would be able to designate dominant platforms as \"bottlenecks\" and subject them to stronger regulations. For example, such platforms might need to obtain approval from the authority for any acquisition, no matter how small, and the digital authority would be able to challenge these acquisitions under a legal standard that imposes a lower burden of proof on the Agencies than does current antitrust law. The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019) also makes recom - mendations that fall outside antitrust and competition policy. A subcommittee 250-840_text_.pdf 225 2/7/20 3:46 PM222| Chapter 6on politics, in particular, recommends that a digital authority have the power to take actions to limit concentration, not due to concerns about economic harm to consumers, but due to concerns about the political power of large platforms. A subcommittee on data privacy and security recommends that a digital authority oversee consumer protection regulation that would develop, among other regulations, rules similar to the GDPR in Europe. Proposals to establish a new digital authority raise a host of issues. A basic concern is that the breadth of the mandate is far from obvious. As noted above, digital platforms provide a wide-ranging set of goods and services, from search engines, to operating systems, to ride-sharing services. The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019) points to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as a model for a digital regulator, but the scope of the FCC's authority is the telecommunications sector. The scope of a digital authority would likely be harder to delineate, and firms in some of the most innovative sectors of the economy would face uncertainty as to whether they fall under its regulations. Perhaps the most serious concern is for the possibility of regulatory cap - ture. In a speech, FCC chair Ajit Pai (2013) relays a cautionary tale of FCC regula - tory capture, describing how AT&T made commitments to the FCC in 1913 that effectively allowed it to divide up territories with independent local telephone companies. These commitments tamed competition that had emerged after the patents of Alexander Graham Bell began to expire. The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms (2019) discusses the need to deter regulatory capture and cites Pai's speech. It also cites the foundational work on regulatory capture by the Nobel laureate economist George Stigler, for whom the Stigler Center is named. Though there is some irony here, the point is that the downsides of new, far-reaching regulation need to be taken seriously. Although today's digital economy warrants further study\u2014and, where necessary, vigilant antitrust enforcement\u2014a cautious approach to regulation is clearly warranted. As we have discussed, there is a fundamental problem in inferring that high concentration is indicative of a lack of competition. The nature of competition also varies across markets, so one-size-fits-all policies may not work well. Instead, fact-specific investigations along the lines of what the Agencies already do are more sensible. Competition Policy to Reduce Entry Barriers In the preceding sections, we have argued for caution in responding to calls for Federal Government intervention to address increasing concentration in the U.S. economy. However, it is true that entry barriers can protect firms from competition. Sometimes, these entry barriers are structural, in that they are associated with the nature of the market itself, such as products that require large investments in research and development. In other cases, entry barriers 250-840_text_.pdf 226 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |223are purposefully constructed by governments in situations where private mar- kets may fail; see box 6-4. However, as discussed in chapter 3 of this Report, Box 6-4. The Effects of Deregulation within the Pharmaceutical Drug Market As noted, some barriers to entry are purposefully constructed. To illus - trate, consider the pharmaceutical drug industry, where the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a crucial role in supplying drugs through the management of drug application reviews. The FDA ultimately determines if and when a drug will be available on the market. Although the stringent evaluations conducted by the FDA are necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs, they are also partly responsible for raising entry barriers for many generic and new drugs. This has led to a higher concentration of brand name drugs in some markets, along with higher prices that reduce consumer welfare. The Trump Administration realizes the significance of improving com- petition in markets for pharmaceutical drugs, and it has implemented a series of deregulatory reforms with the hope of reducing costs for consumers. One of its proposals highlights the need for the transparency of negotiated discount rates with insurers, requiring hospitals to disclose this information to their patients (CEA 2018a). The Administration also signed the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act in 2017, which reauthorized the FDA to collect user fees from generic drug applications and to process applications efficiently for another five years. Since the start of the Trump Administration, aspects of the FDA's drug application process, most prominently that for generic drugs, have been streamlined to encourage quick market entry. In the first 20 months of the Administration, an average of 17 percent more generic drugs were approved each month than were approved during the previous 20-month period (CEA 2018b). In 2018, the FDA expanded its Strategic Policy Roadmap in efforts to not only increase efficiencies in the drug review process but also reduce anti - competitive behavior from brand name drug makers that try to inhibit generic market entry. The FDA is also taking steps to address scientific and regulatory barriers that are obstacles to entry of some complex generic medicines. The FDA's efforts to lower barriers and have a more predictable and efficient development process may enable new and innovative drug makers to enter the market. Consumers would benefit both from the development of new classes of drugs and from new therapies for conditions treated by existing drugs. Such new therapies could discipline the prices of existing drugs. This was the case for drugs such as simvastatin, which held a large portion of the market for lowering cholesterol in the 1990s. However, starting in 1996, after the introduction of the therapy drug atorvastatin, competition flourished, and cholesterol-lowering drugs are now affordable (CEA 2018b). 250-840_text_.pdf 227 2/7/20 3:46 PM224| Chapter 6even if a regulatory action addresses a private market failure, a deregulatory action is still warranted if the costs of the regulation outweigh the regulatory benefits. This section describes the Agencies' efforts to call attention to regula - tions that harm consumers by creating entry barriers that limit competition. It also discusses how the Agencies apply the antitrust laws to intellectual property rights to promote sound competition. Other Government-Created Barriers to Entry As we discuss in chapter 2 of this Report, occupational licensing requirements impose an additional cost on a person entering a given occupation. Some licensing requirements may be justified on public safety grounds; but in many professions, they also function as barriers to entry that artificially inflate wages by protecting those already in the profession from competition. To support the claim that the majority of State occupational licensing requirements are unnecessary to protect public safety, the FTC points out that 1,100 occupations require a license in at least one State but only 60 occupations are licensed by every State. If an occupation poses a substantiated threat to public safety, the argument goes, then that occupation would be universally licensed (FTC 2018a, 2019c). The Agencies have long advocated measures to limit the competitive harm associated with occupational licensing. In 2017, the FTC established a task force on the issues, and in 2018, it released a report outlining options to mitigate the harm. These options include interstate pacts that allow groups of States to recognize a common license, as well as other portability and mutual recognition measures (FTC 2018a). Certificate-of-need (CON) laws were originally designed in the 1970s to discourage overinvestment in healthcare markets (e.g., building too many hospitals) in an attempt to limit costs. A CON law requires a firm to convince a State regulator that there is an unmet need for the new services. Over years of review, the Agencies have found that these laws often harm competition, and they regularly advocate for their removal. In 2019, for example, staff at the Agencies sent letters to legislatures in Alaska and Tennessee in support of their plans to revise these laws (DOJ and FTC 2019b, 2019d). The Agencies' analysis of evidence, accumulated over decades, finds that instead of reducing healthcare costs, CON laws tend to create inefficiencies by suppressing health - care supply to the benefit of established suppliers, preventing investment that would stimulate competition and lower consumer prices. Many States require car manufacturers to distribute vehicles through independent, franchised dealerships. The Agencies have long advocated against such automobile franchising laws. They argue that when manufactur - ers are free to choose their method of distribution, the competitive process aligns their interests with those of consumers, so the products and services are brought to market as efficiently as possible. In 2019, Nebraska took up a bill 250-840_text_.pdf 228 2/7/20 3:46 PMEvaluating the Risk of Declining Competition |225that would remove restrictions on direct vehicle sales to consumers, but only for vehicle manufacturers that had not used independent, franchised dealers in the State before. The Agencies sent a joint letter to the Nebraska Legislature encouraging it to remove the restrictions for all vehicle manufacturers (DOJ and FTC 2019c). Promoting Innovation through Sound Enforcement of Competition Law As we have discussed, consumers often benefit most from dynamic competi - tion, as driven by investment and innovation in new products, inventions, and technologies. Intellectual property rights\u2014such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights\u2014limit competition from infringing products in order to encourage this dynamic competition. However, in certain circumstances, intellectual property rights, like any asset, may be used in a manner that unlawfully limits competition. To prevent this, the Agencies apply the same antitrust principles to conduct involving intellectual property as they do to conduct involving other forms of property (DOJ and FTC 2017). They apply an effects-based economic analysis to conduct involving intellectual property that considers its efficien - cies and weighs procompetitive benefits of the conduct against any competi - tive harm. The Agencies also engage in advocacy for the correct application of antitrust law to intellectual property rights. The DOJ has emphasized the need to avoid rigid presumptions in the intellectual property area that could deter innovation. In particular, it has cautioned against the misapplication of antitrust laws, which carry the specter of treble damages, to commercial disputes involving the exercise of patent rights. In December 2017, the DOJ withdrew its support from its 2013 joint policy statement with the Patent and Trademark Office on remedies associated with standard essential patents, because the statement had been construed to suggest that the antitrust laws should limit patent holders from seeking injunc - tions or exclusionary remedies to defend their intellectual property rights. The DOJ's work in this area ensures that there are strong incentives to invest in developing technologies, and thus fostering dynamic competition. A top priority of the FTC is to oppose \"pay-for-delay\" patent settlements, whereby branded drug manufacturers pay generic drug producers to stay out of the market. In 2013, in FTC v. Actavis, Inc. , the Supreme Court held that, in certain circumstances, the FTC can challenge such settlements under the antitrust law, provided that courts weigh anticompetitive effects against the procompetitive benefits of such conduct. Since that year, the FTC has regularly reported on these settlements. In its most recent report, the FTC found that the number of pay-for-delay payments of the type that are likely to be anticompeti - tive has been decreasing (FTC 2019a). 250-840_text_.pdf 229 2/7/20 3:46 PM226| Chapter 6Conclusion The Trump Administration understands the vital role that competition plays in the economy, promoting new businesses and serving consumers. Timely anti - trust enforcement is an important tool for protecting the competitive process. By contrast, confusion surrounding the effects of rising concentration appears to be driven by questionable evidence and an overly simple narrative that \"Big Is Bad.\" When companies achieve scale and large market share by innovating and providing their customers with value, this is a welcome result of healthy competition. This chapter has explained why recent calls for changing the goals of the antitrust laws and expanding the scope of regulations are based on inconclusive evidence that competition is in decline. These calls also ignore the flexibility of the existing legal system to accommodate changing market circumstances. Research purporting to document a pattern of increasing concentration and increasing markups uses data on segments of the economy that are far too broad to offer any insights about competition, either in specific markets or in the economy at large. Where data do accurately identify issues of concentration or supercompetitive profits, additional analysis is needed to distinguish between alternative explanations, rather than equating these market indicators with harmful market power. Antitrust actions and any major changes to competition policy should be based on sound economic evidence, including evidence on consumer harm. Research based on broad industry studies may be helpful for indicating trends in concentration, but is unable to diagnose the underlying causes or deter - mine whether consumers in relevant antitrust markets have been harmed. Ultimately, today's detailed, evidence-based approach to antitrust remains the most powerful lens available to protect consumers and suppliers by accurately diagnosing and responding to anticompetitive behavior. For these reasons, this chapter argues that the DOJ's Antitrust Division and the FTC are well-equipped to protect consumers from anticompetitive behavior. The Agencies have maintained their focus on illegal or anticom-petitive actions by businesses, while expanding their scope to advocate against government policies that harm competition. Vigorous competition is essential for building upon the economy's record expansion, and the Trump Administration will continue following the economic evidence and using the Federal Government's authority to promote competition in ways that lead to greater consumer benefits. 250-840_text_.pdf 230 2/7/20 3:46 PM227 xChapter 7 Understanding the Opioid Crisis The opioid crisis poses a major threat to the U.S. economy and America's public health. Since 2000, more than 400,000 people have lost their lives because of opioids. This staggering number of deaths has pushed drug overdoses to the top of the list of leading causes of death for Americans under the age of 50 years, and has cut 2.5 months from U.S. life expectancy. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has previously estimated that the annual economic cost of the opioid crisis is substantially higher than previously thought, at over half a trillion dollars in 2015. Using a similar methodology, the CEA estimates that the crisis cost $665 billion in 2018, or 3.2 percent of gross domestic product. There are signs that the opioid crisis is past its peak because the growth in opioid overdose deaths has stopped during the Trump Administration, stop - ping the upward trend that has persisted since at least 1999. From January 2017 through May 2019, the CEA estimates that there were 37,750 fewer opioid overdose deaths\u2014representing an economic cost savings of over $397 billion\u2014relative to the number of deaths expected based on previous trends. Actions taken by the Trump Administration to reduce the supply of opioids, reduce new demand for opioids, and treat those with current opioid use disorder may have contributed to the flattening in overdose deaths involving opioids. The Trump Administration understands that the crisis is ongoing and that there is much more work to do to combat this threat to American lives and the American economy. In order to continue mitigating the cost of the opioid crisis, it is crucial to understand all its underlying factors. We describe and analyze two separate waves of the crisis\u2014the first wave, from 2001 to 2010, which was characterized by growing overdose deaths involving the misuse of prescription 250-840_text_.pdf 231 2/7/20 3:46 PM228| Chapter 7opioids; and the second wave, from 2010 to 2016, which was characterized by growing overdose deaths involving illicitly manufactured opioids (heroin and fentanyl). We find that in the first wave, between 2001 and 2010, out-of-pocket prices for prescription opioids declined by an estimated 81 percent. This dramatic drop in prices was a consequence of the expansion of government healthcare coverage, which increased access to all prescription drugs\u2014including opioids. We argue that these falling out-of-pocket prices effectively reduced the price of opioid use in the primary market and in the secondary (black) market for diverted opioids, from which most people who misuse prescription opioids obtain their drugs. We estimate that the decline in observed out-of-pocket prices is capable of explaining between 31 and 83 percent of the growth in the death rate involving prescription opioids from 2001 to 2010. However, falling out-of-pocket prices could not have led to a major rise in opioid misuse and overdose deaths without the increased availability of prescription opioids resulting from the new specialty of pain management, the creation of pain management practices that encouraged liberalized dispensing practices by doctors, illicit \"pill mills, \" increased marketing and promotion efforts from industry, and inadequate monitoring or controls against drug diversion. The subsidization of opioids is in stark contrast to the taxation of other addictive substances such as tobacco and alcohol. The dilemma this poses is how to make available the appropriate medical use of opioids for pain relief while preventing nonmedical use of subsidized products. We find that the second wave of the opioid crisis likely started in 2010 because of efforts to limit the misuse of prescription OxyContin, enabling a large market for the sale and innovation of illegal opioids. Although these efforts eventually successfully reduced prescription opioid-involved overdose deaths, they had the unintended consequence of raising demand for cheaper substitutes in the illicit market among misusers of prescription drugs. An expansion in foreign-sourced supply was also important for the growth of illicitly manufactured 250-840_text_.pdf 232 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |229opioids, as evidenced by falling quality-adjusted prices, largely due to expanded heroin trafficking from Mexico and relatively inexpensive synthetic opioids from both Mexico and China, specifically fentanyl and its analogues, which can be many times more potent than heroin.1 The Trump Administration has undertaken serious efforts to tackle the ongoing opioid crisis that continues to threaten the American economy and American lives. This is demonstrated by the declaration of the opioid epidemic as a public health emergency, the establishment of the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, the highest expenditures in history directed toward the opioid epidemic, and ongoing efforts throughout the Federal government to address the crisis. The damage resulting from the opioid crisis is dramatic in its proportions compared with other health crises. For example, in 2017, the number of people who died of an opioid-involved drug overdose (47,600) exceeded the number of deaths from the HIV/AIDS epidemic at its peak in 1995 (CDC 2019). 2 Additionally, since 2000, the United States has lost as much of its population to the opioid crisis as it lost to World War II\u2014with both causing more than 400,000 fatalities (DeBruyne 2017). This staggering number of deaths has pushed drug overdoses to the top of the list of leading causes of death for Americans under the age of 50 years, and has cut 2.5 months from U.S. life expectancy (Dowell et al. 2017). To assess the full damage caused by this crisis, the CEA has previously assessed its full economic cost. In 2015 alone, the CEA estimated that the total cost of the opioid crisis was $504 billion, several times larger than previous cost estimates (CEA 2017). The CEA's approach constituted a more complete assess - ment of the costs because it incorporated the full cost of increased morbidity and mortality from the crisis. We also adjusted opioid-involved deaths\u2014which had been underreported\u2014upward and incorporated nonfatal costs. Using similar methods as in the earlier CEA assessment, the annual cost of the opioid crisis has only risen since 2015, amounting to $665 billion in 2018. The annual number of reported opioid-involved overdose deaths increased from 33,091 in 2015 to 47,600 in 2017, a 44 percent increase. According to preliminary data, deaths have since decreased slightly in 2018, an indication of a flattening in 1The CEA previously released research on topics covered in this chapter. The text that follows builds on this research paper produced by the CEA: \"The Role of Opioid Prices in the Evolving Opioid Crisis\" (CEA 2019b).2 We identify overdose deaths throughout the report using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death classification codes: X40-X44 (unintentional), are identified trend of increasing annual deaths that has persisted since 1999 (see figure 7-1).3 When President Trump took office in January 2017, monthly overdose deaths involving opioids had reached an all-time record high, a 41 percent increase from the number of deaths 12 months earlier, in January 2016. Since then, the growth in opioid deaths may have finally stopped. Monthly overdose deaths fell by 9.6 percent between January 2017 and May 2019, the latest month for which provisional data are available (see figure 7-1). If the growth rate in opioid overdose deaths from 1999 through 2016 had continued, 37,750 additional lives would have been lost due to opioid overdoses between January 2017 and May 2019, a 33 percent increase over the actual number of deaths that occurred over this period. The economic cost savings since January 2017 from reduced mortality compared with the preexisting trend was over $397 billion.4 In order to continue mitigating the large costs imposed by the opioid cri- sis through appropriate policy measures, it is crucial to understand the forces that underlie it. We separate our analysis into two sections: The first one ana - lyzes the first wave of the crisis, lasting through 2010, which was characterized by growth in prescription opioid-involved overdose deaths; and the second analyzes the period since 2010, which has been characterized by growth in illicit opioid-involved overdose deaths.5 During the first wave, between 2001 and 2010, the annual population- based rate of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids increased by 182 percent (CDC WONDER n.d.). Throughout this period, opioid manufacturers aggressively promoted the safety and effectiveness of opioids, and guidelines for the treatment of pain were liberalized to encourage physicians to prescribe 3 Official estimates of opioid-involved overdose deaths are extracted from the CDC's WONDER Multiple Cause of Death Database (https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html). As of December 31, 2019, official data were available through December 2017. Preliminary estimates of opioid-involved overdose deaths are extracted from Ahmad et al. (2019). The provisional data include deaths of foreign residents and include approximately 500 additional drug overdose records compared with data from CDC WONDER that is limited to residents of the United States.4 The number of lives saved is calculated from the difference between the projected trend in deaths from January 2017 to May 2019, the most recent month of preliminary data as of December 31, 2019 (see figure 7-1). The calculated number of lives saved is sensitive to the assumption that the projected trend is nonlinear. We use the value of a statistical life to estimate the value of lives saved, adjusting the Department of Transportation's value of a statistical life to about $10.5 million in 2018 dollars (DOT 2016).5 We use \"illicit opioids\" throughout the chapter to refer to illicitly produced opioids such as heroin and fentanyl, which excludes the misuse of prescription opioids such as OxyContin. It is important to note that data on overdose deaths do not distinguish between illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and synthetic prescription opioids, such as prescription fentanyl. This analysis includes this broader category of synthetic opioids other than methadone in the illicit opioid category, given that illicitly manufactured fentanyl is commonly believed to have dominated this category in recent years, and that the category was much less important in the earlier years of the crisis. 250-840_text_.pdf 234 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |231more opioids (Van Zee 2009). Over the same period, we estimate that the out-of-pocket price of prescription opioids fell by 81 percent (see also Zhou, Florence, and Dowell 2016). We argue that the falling out-of-pocket price trans - lated into a lower price of misuse not only for those who obtain prescriptions in the primary market but also for the majority of misusers who obtain prescrip - tion opioids from the secondary (black) market. The decline in out-of-pocket prices between 2001 and 2010 occurred in conjunction with a rising share of generic opioids in the market as well as increased public subsidies. Though we do not attempt to apportion their respective roles, these two factors may have contributed significantly to the out-of-pocket price decline. With regard to a rising generic share in the pre - scription opioid market, we note that supply prices paid to pharmacies fell by 45 percent between 2001 and 2010, fueled by an increase in the cheaper generic opioid share, from 53 percent to 81 percent. In addition, we document a large increase in the share of prescription opioids funded by public programs. As shown in figure 7-2, the share of pre - scribed opioids purchased with public subsidies increased from 17 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010, rising further to 63 percent in 2015. Public programs accounted for three-fourths of the growth in total prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010 (data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, MEPS).

Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths, 1999-2019 Monthly number of deaths Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); CEA calculations. Note: Data from before January 2018 are compiled from the CDC WONDER database, and monthly data beginning in January 2018 are calculated using the provisional reported number of deaths from the CDC. The preinauguration trend is calculated for January 1999 to January 7coincided with a growing share of prescriptions reimbursed by the program, including for many opioids. Additionally, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) enrollment has rapidly increased since the late 1990s (see figure 7-16). More than half of SSDI recipients received drug coverage before the 2006 start of Medicare Part D through Medicaid and other programs. After 2006, SSDI recipients, along with the general Medicare population, were for the most part eligible for prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D. Expansions in insurance coverage that reduce out-of-pocket prices make misused prescription opioids more affordable for patients with prescriptions and users who purchase the drugs on the secondary market. Before gener - ics were as widely available, it was very costly for the average American with opioid use disorder to afford prescription opioids, if not subsidized through insurance. In 2007, Americans could buy 1 gram of OxyContin\u2014one of the most common brand name opioids prescribed\u2014for an average of $144 without health insurance. Some individuals on opioids may require up to a gram or more per day of OxyContin for pain relief (Schneider, Anderson, and Tennant 2009). Without insurance, a person with an opioid use disorder consuming between 0.5 gram and 1 gram of OxyContin every day for a year would have spent between $26,280 and $52,560 in 2007\u2014which could be more than the median household income of about $50,000 in 2007 (in 2007 dollars) (Fontenot, PublicPrivateSelf 020406080100 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-2. Share of Potency-Adjusted Prescription Opioids, by Primary Payer, 2001-15 Share (percent) Sources: Medical Expendtiure Panel Survey; National Drug Code Database; CEA calculations. Note: The primary payer is the third-party payer with the highest payment for a given prescription. In addition to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers, the other possible primary payers include veterans' benefits, workers' compensation, other Federal government insurance, other State or local goverment insurance, or other public insurance. All prescriptions are converted into morphine gram equivalents based on the quantity of pills prescribed and their potency.2015 250-840_text_.pdf 2018).6 To put this in perspective, a person on Medicare would only pay $9.78 per gram, or between $1,785 and $3,570 per year (in 2007 dollars), to support an opioid use disorder in the same year. The subsidization of opioids is in stark contrast to the taxation of other addictive substances such as tobacco and alcohol. The challenge this poses is how to ensure access to opioids for legitimate medical needs, such as for pain relief, when other substances are contraindicated or insufficient, while not subsidizing nonmedical uses. Given the role the government played in subsidizing the purchase of prescription opioids through the expansion of health insurance, we examine the possible roles of specific public programs. We find that the number of potency-adjusted opioids per capita subsidized by Medicare increased by 2,400 percent between 2001 and 2010, the largest increase among all third-party payers. SSDI rolls also expanded over this period. We estimate that SSDI recipients, who are generally eligible for Medicare (including prescription coverage in Part D, starting in 2006), were prescribed a disproportionate share of 26 to 30 percent of total potency-adjusted opioids in 2011 across all payer types (while representing under 3 percent of the U.S. population). Of course, any role of SSDI expansion in the opioid crisis would be attributable to the design of the program rather than program recipients. SSDI recipients gener - ally have debilitating conditions that prevent them from working, and these conditions are often associated with high levels of pain. These conditions are the primary reason SSDI recipients are prescribed a disproportionate share of opioids; indeed, SSDI benefits, in conjunction with Medicare coverage, provide vital protection for these disabled workers. Additionally, the majority of SSDI recipients prescribed opioids use them appropriately and do not contribute to opioid misuse directly or indirectly. As a calibration exercise, we take published estimates of the price elas - ticity of prescription opioid sales to estimate the increase in sales resulting from an 81 percent price decline. This exercise suggests that, without the price decline, per capita opioid sales would have increased by half as much or less than the actual increase between 2001 and 2010. In order to estimate the size of the price decline as a factor in the increase in the number of deaths involving prescription opioids, we assume that (1) secondary market prices are proportional to out-of-pocket prices in the primary market, and (2) the price elasticity of opioid use ranges from the elasticity of prescriptions at the low end to the own-price elasticity of heroin use at the high end. This second calibration 6 Due to heightened risk to patients, the CDC recommends that physicians avoid prescriptions at or above 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day, equivalent to 60 milligrams of oxycodone or 0.06 gram, or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to 90 or more milligram equivalents per day (CDC n.d.). Schneider, Anderson, and Tennant (2009) observe that some chronic pain patients require doses that may range from 1,000 to 2,000 or more milligram equivalents per day. These doses would be equivalent to 667 to 1,333 milligrams (0.7 to 1.3 grams) of oxycodone per day. 250-840_text_.pdf 237 2/7/20 3:46 PM234| Chapter 7exercise suggests that the observed decline in out-of-pocket prices for pre - scription opioids, which makes physicians' prescriptions more affordable for beneficiaries to fill, was a factor in between 31 and 83 percent of the increase in overdose deaths involving prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010. However, falling out-of-pocket prices could not have led to a major rise in opioid misuse and deaths without the increased availability of prescription opioids resulting from changes in pain management practice guidelines that encouraged liberalized dispensing practices by doctors, illicit \"pill mills,\" increased marketing and promotion efforts from industry, and inadequate monitoring or controls against diversion. Without these factors, patients would have been unable to respond to lower prices by obtaining prescription opioids and diverting them to the secondary market. In other words, the change in the environment for obtaining prescription opioids was a precondition for the effect of falling out-of-pocket prices on opioid misuse. In addition, it is impor-tant to emphasize that the falling price of the medical use of opioids\u2014due to expanded insurance coverage and generic entry\u2014benefited patients because they could access needed drugs at a lower out-of-pocket cost. By contrast, the falling price of the nonmedical use of opioids, enabled by a lax prescribing environment in conjunction with lower out-of-pocket prices, may have played an important role in fueling the opioid crisis. More generally, these findings of increased opioid misuse associated with the growth of public programs do not imply that these programs lack social value, but rather show the importance of instituting safeguards to ensure the appropriate prescribing and use of opioids, and measures to reduce the misuse of opioids.7 Government policy for other addictive products, such as cigarettes, deliberately discourages consumption by raising prices through sales taxes and placing restrictions on purchase and sales; most analysts agree that such policies successfully reduced cigarette use and made new addiction cases less likely (HHS 2014). Unlike cigarettes, which are not safe or beneficial for anyone in any quantity, opioids have legitimate medical uses. The challenge of prescription opioids is balancing the goal of subsidizing opioids when they are prescribed for appropriate use with the need to discourage overprescription and misuse. Next, we analyze the second wave of the opioid crisis, which was char - acterized by the growth of illicit, opioid-involved overdose deaths between 2010 and 2016. In this case, demand-side expansions due to efforts to curtail prescription opioid use disorder along with supply-side expansions appear to have been important. Most notably on the demand side, an abuse-deterrent formulation of the widely abused prescription opioid OxyContin was released in 2010, and the original formulation was no longer made available from the manufacturer. Research has found that although the reformulation stemmed 7 See HHS (2016) for further discussion. 250-840_text_.pdf 238 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |235the involving prescription opioids, it led opioid misus - ers to substitute toward cheaper, more available heroin, resulting in increased heroin-involved deaths (Alpert, Powell, and Pacula 2018; Evans, Lieber, and Power 2019). Thus, the buildup of a pool of people with addictions to prescrip - tion opioids during the first wave ultimately facilitated the increase in demand for illicit opioids in the second wave. This large pool of new demand created additional profit opportunities for illegal sellers entering the market. Supply increased as Mexican heroin traffickers increased shipments to the United States in response to shrinking markets for cocaine, and other foreign manu - facturers\u2014especially in China\u2014introduced cheaper and more potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Figure 7-3 illustrates how overdose deaths involving prescription opioids leveled off after 2010, while other opioid deaths (those only involving illicit opioids and possibly nonopioid drugs) escalated rapidly. In an attempt to assess the relative importance of demand and supply expansions in driving the second wave of the opioid crisis, we estimate the price of illicit opioids over time. Though these estimates are subject to a num - ber of highly imperfect assumptions, we find that the price of illicit opioids was roughly constant between 2010 and 2013, before falling by about half by 2016, due to the increased supply of illicit fentanyl (see figure 7-17) starting in about 2013 (increasingly available via shipment from China and from other foreign sources). Given the extreme potency and low cost of fentanyl, it dramatically reduced the \"cost of a high\" for users. It is notable that even though demand for Involved prescription opioids Did not involve prescription opioids 012345678 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-3. Opioid-Involved Overdose Death Rate by the Presence of Prescription Opioids, 2001-16 Deaths (per 100,000) Sources: CDC WONDER; CEA calculations. Note: Prescription opioids Chapter 7illicit increased beginning in 2010, the price of illicit opioids remained constant until about 2013, implying that in these first years of the illicit wave, the heroin supply must have also expanded to keep prices steady; if supply had remained constant, prices would have risen. Falling prices between 2013 and 2016 imply that supply expansions of illicit opioids were more important drivers of the crisis in these later years. Due to constraints on data availability for prices of both prescription and illicit opioids, this analysis focuses on the period ending in 2016. However, provisional mortality data are available through part of 2019. The rest of the chapter proceeds as follows. The next section presents our basic methodology in assessing how demand, supply, and government policies can affect quantities and prices of opioids. The subsequent section analyzes the first wave of the crisis based on prescription opioids, and the section after that analyzes the substantial growth in public subsidies for opioids during this period. The last section turns to the second wave, which spawned the rise of illicit opioids. The Supply-and-Demand Framework Although we cannot quantify the extent to which government-subsidized drugs are diverted and resold for nonmedical use, a simple supply-and-demand framework can provide powerful insights into how changing prices and quanti - ties reflect the underlying forces driving the opioid crisis. Figures 7-4 and 7-5 consider the case of prescription opioids, showing how market dynamics and government subsidies in the primary market ultimately affect market prices and quantities in the secondary market. First, a supply expansion (e.g., due to generic entry) in the primary market for patients obtaining opioids via pre - scription reduces the price of prescription opioids (from P 0 to P1) and increases the quantity prescribed (from Q0 to Q1)\u2014assuming, of course, that prescribers are willing to provide additional pills to patients as their demand rises. This expansion has the effect of reducing the price of prescription opioids in the secondary market because individuals purchasing prescription opioids in the primary market now face a lower acquisition cost if pills are diverted to family members, friends, and others. On top of a supply expansion, the introduction of a government subsidy for prescription opioids in the primary market drives a wedge between the price consumers pay (the demand price, P 2,D) and the price prescription drug suppliers receive (the supply price, P2,S), with the differ - ence made up by the amount of the subsidy. The demand price is lower than the price paid by patients before the introduction of the subsidy (P 1), which further reduces the price of prescription opioids in the secondary market. Thus, both supply expansions and government subsidies in the primary market for prescription opioids decrease the price and increase the quantity of opioid misuse in the secondary market, especially in an environment where there is overprescribing. As noted above, however, whether secondary market prices 250-840_text_.pdf 240 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the P2,DGovernment subsidy Q1Figure 7-4.

Figures 7-6 and 7-7 consider the case of illicit opioids (i.e., heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl), for which a legal market does not exist. Because the quantity of illicit opioid use increased substantially between 2010 and 2016, it stands to reason that demand or supply expanded, or both did. However, whether it was demand or supply that drove the increase in illicit opi-oid misuse has a testable implication. If demand expansions dominate, then the price of illicit opioids must rise, whereas if supply expansions dominate, then the price must fall.8 In fact, we find that illicit opioid prices were relatively stable between 2010 and 2013, suggesting that both demand\u2014itself fueled in part by efforts to curtail the prescription opioid wave of the crisis\u2014and supply expansions were important during this period. Then, between 2013 and 2016, the price of illicit opioids fell markedly with the influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, suggesting that supply expansions were most important during this later period. Our findings suggest that subsidies and supply expansions, in combina - tion with changes in prescribing behavior, can account for much of the rise in opioid overdose deaths. Some have argued that demand-side factors, such as economic stagnation in past years, was an important driver of increasing mor - tality from drug use and other causes (Stiglitz 2015). However, there is direct evidence that demand growth due to worsening economic conditions was not the primary factor driving the growth of the opioid crisis. First, the hypothesis that lower incomes raise demand does not explain the aggregate time series within the United States. If worsening economic conditions increase demand, then one would expect that the Great Recession would have fueled a substantial increase in opioid-involved overdose fatalities. However, figure 7-8 suggests that the growth rate of opioid-involved overdose deaths was unaffected by the Great Recession. The crisis grew at roughly the same pace straight through one of the greatest recessions experienced in the last century, and in fact picked up growth well after the recession ended. More important, two of the four lowest growth rates in opioid deaths occurred between 2008 and 2010, in the midst of the Great Recession. It was not until 2014, 2015, and 2016 that growth rates again rose significantly\u2014but that was in a period of lower unemployment, the opposite prediction of demand growth of opioids being fueled by lower incomes unless effects are lagged by several years. Despite this lack of association between aggregate economic condi - tions and opioid deaths, Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017) do report a positive association between county-level unemployment and opioid-involved overdose deaths\u2014a 1-percentage-point increase in a county's unemployment 8 The relative price elasticities of demand and supply also affect which expansion dominates. 250-840_text_.pdf 242 2/7/20 3:46 quantityQ0P0P1Figure 7-6.

However, this association does not appear quan - titatively large enough to be a primary driver of the massive growth in opioid deaths. It would take a 54-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate between 1999 and 2016 to explain the 10.2-person increase in the rate of opioid-involved overdose deaths during this period. However, the unemploy - ment rate increased by a net 0.7 percentage point (from 4.2 to 4.9 percent) between 1999 and 2016. In addition, Ruhm (2019) formally tests whether a number of demand- side factors that reflect changing economic conditions can explain the growing crisis during this period. He finds that very little of the rise in opioid overdose deaths during this period can be explained by economic conditions. Instead, he points to changes in the drug environment, reflective of supply conditions, as being central. Consistent with Ruhm's findings, Currie, Yin, and Schnell (2018) find no clear evidence of a substantial overall effect of the employment-to-population ratio on the amount of opioids prescribed in a county. The First Wave of the Crisis: Prescription Opioids The opioid crisis unfolded in two waves. The first wave, beginning in about 2001 and lasting until about 2010, was characterized by a rising misuse of Unemployment rate (right axis) Opioid overdose rate (left axis) 024681012 02468101214 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Deaths (per 100,000) Figure 7-8. Opioid Overdose Death and Unemployment Rate, 1999- 2016 Unemployment rate (percent) Sources: CDC WONDER; Bureau |241prescription The second began in about 2010, when, prescrip - tion opioids were made more difficult to abuse and illicit opioids\u2014including heroin and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl\u2014grew in the market. This and the next sections focus on the first wave, and the subsequent section focuses on the second wave. Between 2001 and 2010, the rate of overdose deaths involving prescrip- tion opioids (which we define as natural and semisynthetic opioids and metha- done) increased by 182 percent, while other opioid-involved deaths grew much more slowly (figure 7-3).10 In order to analyze the potential roles of expanded supply of prescription opioids, we first estimate the out-of-pocket price of pre - scription opioids. We then conduct a calibration exercise, in which we assume that secondary market prices for prescription opioids are proportional to out-of-pocket prices, and that prescription opioid misusers respond to these prices of misuse in the same way that heroin users respond to heroin prices. We also assume that prescription opioid deaths are proportional to prescription opioid misuse. If falling prices suggest a large quantity response relative to the magni - tude of the observed increase in prescription opioid-involved overdose deaths, then this would suggest that these price declines, when combined with other factors, may have played a role in the first wave of the opioid crisis. An environment in which opioid prescriptions were promoted and easier to obtain and fill is a necessary precondition for falling out-of-pocket prices to have played a substantial role\u2014otherwise, it is unlikely that secondary market prices could have responded to falling out-of-pocket prices. This environment was created by a campaign to persuade doctors that pain was being under-treated and that opioids were the solution. Pain-alleviation societies, patient advocacy groups, and professional medical organizations urged physicians to treat pain more aggressively (Max et al. 1995). Pain was labeled \"the 5th Vital Sign,\" which should be regularly assessed and treated (VA 2000). Starting in 2001, the Joint Commission, an accrediting body for hospitals and other health facilities, instituted new standards requiring facilities to establish procedures to assess the existence and intensity of pain and to treat it with \"effective pain medicines.\" At the same time, multiple medical organizations promoted opioids as a safe and effective treatment for chronic, noncancer pain (DuPont, Bezaitis, and Ross 2015). This coincided with aggressive marketing efforts by opioid manufacturers starting in the late 1990s to assure physicians that their products were safe with little abuse potential (Van Zee 2009; President's 9 We focus on the 2001-10 period throughout the chapter, due to the unavailability of consistent overdose data before 1999, the unavailability of illicit drug seizure data before 2001 used for estimating the illicit opioid price series, and the substantial volatility in the out-of-pocket price series before 2001.10 Some opioid-involved deaths include both prescription and other opioids. Figure 7 -3 distinguishes between opioid-involved overdose deaths with prescription opioids present versus those without prescription opioids present. Similarly, figure 7-18 distinguishes between opioid- involved overdose deaths with illicit opioids present versus those without illicit present. 250-840_text_.pdf 245 2/7/20 3:46 PM242| Chapter 7Commission 2017). Because of space limitations, this chapter does not provide a comprehensive review of either the change in medical guidance regarding the appropriate use of opioids or the marketing and promotion efforts by opioid manufacturers. We use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to construct a time series of the out-of-pocket price per potency-adjusted unit of prescription opioids. The MEPS asks respondents to report all prescription drugs they obtain and how much they pay out of pocket for each drug. Opioid prescriptions are con - verted into morphine gram equivalents (MGEs), and then prices are estimated by dividing expenditures by the total number of MGEs. We use the terms MGEs and potency-adjusted units interchangeably throughout. Prices are converted into real dollars, and then a real price index is shown. Figure 7-9 shows the real supply and out-of-pocket price index for prescription opioids. The supply price is calculated as the ratio of total expenditures to total MGEs, and the out-of-pocket price is calculated as the ratio of self (out-of-pocket) expenditures to total MGEs. Note that out-of-pocket expenditures include individual payments made for prescriptions without third-party coverage as well as individual copayments made for prescriptions that are only partially covered by third parties. Between 2001 and 2010, the out-of-pocket price fell by 81 percent before stabilizing. One potential factor in this decline, which is analyzed in depth in the next section, was the inception of Medicare Part D in 2006, which intro - duced subsidies for prescription drugs, including opioids, and lowered the out-of-pocket price for enrolled consumers. Another potential factor was the rapid expansion of disability (SSDI) enrollment, which before 2006 provided drug coverage for many enrollees through Medicaid or other programs, and after 2006 provided coverage through Medicare Part D. Finally, between 2001 and 2010, supply prices fell by 45 percent in conjunction with the expansion of generic opioids. A recent analysis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) similarly finds that potency-adjusted opioid acquisition prices for pharmacies fell by about 28 percent during this same period, although it also finds that prices substantially increased during the 1990s before the crisis took off (FDA 2018a). Figure 7-10 shows the decline in the brand market share of potency- adjusted opioids as the generic market share rose from about 55 to 81 percent between 2001 and 2010 (FDA 2018a). The law of demand says that, all else remaining the same, consumers engage in more of an activity when the activity becomes cheaper. However, the law by itself does not tell us the magnitude of the effect of an 81 percent reduction in the potency-adjusted price of prescription opioids on either the quantity of prescriptions or the number of deaths involving prescription opi - oids. Previous econometric studies that have related opioid prescriptions and other prescriptions to out-of-pocket prices suggest a range of likely quantita - tive effects of the price changes shown in figure 7-9 on the number of 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-9.

Predicting the effect on the number of deaths requires addi - tional information because the deaths derive from misuse. Only a fraction of opioid prescriptions is given to people with opioid use disorder, and their price sensitivity of demand may differ from the sensitivity of average consumers. We begin with the effect of reduced prescription opioid prices on the number of opioid prescriptions. A number of studies look at the effects of drug prices and insurance coverage on the sales of all prescription drugs as well as the sales of opioid prescriptions specifically. The more responsive drug users are to prices, the more they consume as prices decline. This price responsive - ness is typically measured by the price elasticity of demand\u2014the percent-age change in quantity demanded when the price increases by 1 percent.11 Because elasticity studies typically make cross-sectional comparisons, they are holding constant physician prescribing norms and marketing efforts by sellers that are changing over time. In other words, the effects of changing prescribing norms and marketing efforts need to be added to the price effects measured by the cross-sectional studies of the price elasticity of demand. Box 7-1 offers an overview of the ongoing opioid settlements between governments and opioid manufacturers over misleading marketing efforts by the manufacturers. Soni (2018) found that the introduction of Medicare Part D increased opioid prescriptions for the population age 65 to 74 (relative to the population age 55 to 64 and not on Medicare) over a four-year period by a factor of 1.5. At the same time and for the same population, Soni (2018) found that the out-of-pocket price was reduced by a factor of 0.44 from the introduction of Part D, which is less than the price change for the entire U.S. population from 2001 to 2010, as shown in figure 7-9. These estimated effects of Part D are economically significant and do not support the hypothesis that the changes shown in figure 7-9 have a minimal effect on the number of prescriptions. Indeed, they show an arc elasticity (calculated with the natural logarithm) of -0.49 which suggests that the price change shown in figure 7-9 would increase potency-adjusted prescriptions per capita by a factor of 2.3 between 2001 and 2010. A factor of 2.3 is close to the actual change as estimated with data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) and shown in figure 7-11 (DOJ n.d.). Insurance plans should have coinsurance rates varying across drugs to the extent that the sensitivity of consumer demand to the out-of-pocket price varies across drugs (Feldstein 1973; Besley 1988). Health insurance plans behave that way in practice (Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova 2018). Coinsurance rates for opioids (43 percent) are higher than for other common therapeutic classes (39 percent). Similarly, coinsurance rates for hydrocodone 11 When sales effects are estimated from small price changes, the result is sometimes called \"point elasticity.\" \"Arc elasticity\" refers to an estimate from large price changes and typically uses midpoints for calculating percentage changes or uses logarithm changes so that the same elasticity can be applied to price increases as to price decreases. 250-840_text_.pdf 248 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |245(50 percent) are higher than for other common nonopioid drugs (40 percent). The observed coinsurance rates thus suggest that opioid prescriptions are not less price sensitive than the average prescription drug over the annual time frame (or longer) that is of interest to the sponsors of insurance plans.12 If 12 The coinsurance rates are inferred from the estimates by Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) and are for Part D participants who have not yet reached the \"donut hole.\"Box 7-1. Opioid Crisis Lawsuits Thousands of municipal governments nationwide and nearly two dozen states have sued the pharmaceutical industry in an effort to hold opioid manufacturers and distributers accountable for the opioid crisis. These lawsuits argue that opioid manufacturers launched misleading marketing campaigns underplaying the risks and exaggerating the benefits of opioids. Additionally, these lawsuits allege that opioid distributors unlawfully allowed the drugs to proliferate. These civil litigation cases have resulted in the conclusion of multiple settlement agreements, at least one large trial, and the promise of more settlements to come. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, as well as its owners, the Sackler family, announced a tentative settlement expected to be worth more than $10 billion in September 2019. Under the proposed agreement, the company will be restructured into a public corporation, with profits from drug sales going toward the plaintiffs. The settlement would be the largest payout from any company involved in the opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma previously agreed to pay a total of $270 million to Oklahoma to settle a lawsuit in March 2019. Purdue's Oklahoma settlement set the stage for subsequent settlements with the State, including Teva Pharmaceutical's $85 million settlement in May 2019. Johnson & Johnson refused to settle, and the landmark trial resulted in an order to pay $572 million to Oklahoma in August 2019. Both the State and Johnson & Johnson are contesting this verdict\u2014alleging, respectively, that the award is too small or too large. The three largest drug distributors\u2014McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen\u2014and the generic opioid manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals reached a settlement worth about $260 million in October 2019. These settlements are the early conclusions to nearly two years of legal battles and may serve as a benchmark for resolution in other opioid cases. The first of a new series of Federal trials began on October 21, 2019, after talks dissolved of a deal worth $48 billion to resolve all opioid lawsuits filed against the three drug distributors, Teva, and Johnson & Johnson. The settlements include a combination of donations to substance use disorder treatment program research, and cash payouts and will likely provide a benchmark for thousands of similar cases brought before the courts in an attempt to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for an opioid crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands and cost trillions. 250-840_text_.pdf 249 2/7/20 3:46 PM246| Chapter one-month arc elasticity of -0.27 for therapeutic drug classes were applied to the price change from 2001 to 2010 shown in figure 7-9, it suggests that opioid prescriptions would have increased by a factor of 1.6 due to price changes alone.13 A factor of 1.6 is economically significant, but is still only a minority of the actual change in opioid prescriptions between 2001 and 2010. The discrepancy between the findings of Soni (2018) and Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) could be that behavior is more sensitive to a price change that lasts more than one month, or that applies to a larger population of people. 14 But this discrepancy may also reflect the imprecision of estimating price effects, which is why our data are consistent with the view that the increase in prescrip - tions cannot be explained by price reductions alone but also reflect changes in physicians' prescribing norms and marketing efforts by opioid sellers. 13 Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) report a point elasticity for a linear demand curve, but their reports of price and quantity changes are sufficient for their readers to calculate the corresponding arc elasticity. We also note that the authors' elasticity is estimated for a selected group of Part D participants who have high drug costs. 14 The demand for habit-forming products responds more to price changes that last longer (Pollak 1970; Becker and Murphy 1988; Gallet 2014), which is why it would be especially problematic to apply the approach of Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) specifically to opioids because it refers to price changes lasting only a month. The estimates by Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) also exclude \"social multiplier\" price effects that may occur when the entire population experiences a price change, rather than a selected few who are at a special spot in their prescription-benefit formula (Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman 2003).0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 2001 OxycodoneFigure 7-11.

In fact, only 25 percent of people who misuse prescription opioids most recently obtained the drugs from a doctor, while the remaining 75 per - cent obtained them from friends or relatives, via theft, from a drug dealer, or from some other source ( figure 7-12). But even when the drugs are obtained on the secondary market, the price is likely positively correlated with the out-of-pocket price. A lower out-of-pocket price decreases the acquisition cost for those selling the drugs in the secondary market. It also should decrease the implicit price for those giving the drugs away with no expected reciprocal gifts, and it should reduce the precautions taken by individuals to safeguard their drugs against theft. 15 Of course, the out-of-pocket price is only one component of the total price of obtaining prescription opioids for misuse. The ease of find - ing a doctor to prescribe the opioids and a pharmacy that receives a supply and is willing to fill the prescription is also important. As a calibration exercise for contextualizing whether falling out-of-pocket prices could have played a role in the first wave of the opioid crisis, we assume that the price of prescription opioid misuse is proportional to the out-of-pocket price. For example, a 10 percent decline in the out-of-pocket price of 15 This does not mean that the amount of theft varies with the price because thieves can be expected to put more effort toward stealing more valuable items. We only assume that thieves experience greater cost of theft for high-priced items, due to owners' precautions.

Proportion of Users Obtaining Misused Prescription Opioids by Most Recent Source, 2013-14 7prescription opioids is assumed to reduce the price of pills in the secondary market (and for misusers obtaining pills in the primary market) by 10 percent. This assumption is clearly reasonable for the 25 percent of prescription opioid misusers who obtain their pills directly from drugs prescribed by medical pro - viders in the primary market because they only face the out-of-pocket price. We may also expect the secondary market price to be proportional to the out-of-pocket price. Consider, first, the misusers who purchase their pills in the secondary market (as opposed to receiving them complimentarily). The sellers of these pills seek to maximize their profits, which are equal to the price of each pill P minus the cost of obtaining each pill in the primary market C (the out-of-pocket price), multiplied by the number of pills sold, Q: We may also expect the secondary market price to be proportional to the out- of-pocket price.

It can be shown that a necessary condition for maximizing profits is =1 1+ where r is the responsiveness, in percentage terms, of the market price to the quantity of pills provided by a particular seller. Thus, an increase in the cost (or the out -of- pocket price) C leads to a proportional increase in the secondary market price P, assuming that r remains constant. Assuming that the share of prescription opioids obtained via various segments of the secondary market with different markups remains constant over time, the average secondary market price across all segments would change proportionally with changes in the out-of-pocket price. It is important to emphasize that this assumption would be plausible only if suppliers to the secondary market face relatively low transaction costs for obtaining prescriptions from doctors and filling prescriptions from pharmacies. For this reason, changes in prescribing guidelines and practices, a greater emphasis on pain management, and the expansion of \"pill mills\" and supplies to pharmacies are preconditions for falling prices to have a potentially significant effect on opioid misuse. Another reason that falling opioid prices can increase opioid deaths at a different rate than they increase opioid prescriptions is that most opioid prescriptions are likely used for medical purposes, and those who misuse opioids may have a different sensitivity to prices. One point of view is that medical users are less price sensitive because they are just following their providers' orders, whereas misusers are necessarily price sensitive to the extent that most of their income is exhausted by purchasing opioids. 16 Another perspective is that those who misuse opioids are less price sensitive because they are less interested in saving money on their drug acquisitions. Unfortunately, we are not aware of studies estimating price elasticities for the misuse of prescription opioids distinctly from price elasticities for the overall number of prescription opioids (regardless of their use). Thus, we use estimates of the price 16 People who misuse opioids\u2014 who, for example, spend all disposable income on opioids \u2014have a price elasticity of - 1 because the quantity purchased is the ratio of disposable income to price.

Unfortunately, we are not aware of studies estimating price elasticities for the misuse of prescription opioids distinctly from price elasticities for the overall number of prescription opioids (regardless of their use). Thus, we use estimates of the price elasticity of heroin, a substitute for prescription opioids, for which a large body of academic literature is available. Olmstead and oth - ers (2015) provide an extensive review of the literature and categorize studies based on the methods used\u2014 table 7-1 summarizes their work. Although the lit - erature contains a broad range of estimates, studies generally find that higher prices reduce demand. For our calibration exercise, we rely on a meta-analysis of the literature on illicit drug price elasticities by Gallet (2014), who synthe - sizes 462 price elasticities from 42 studies, mostly based on U.S. data. He finds that the price elasticity of heroin falls in the range of -0.47 to -0.56, which coin - cides with the arc elasticity of -0.49 calculated from Soni's (2018) results for 16 People who misuse opioids\u2014who, for example, spend all disposable income on opioids\u2014have a price elasticity of -1 because the quantity purchased is the ratio of disposable income to price.

As a low value, we take one interpretation of the short-run findings of Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) for all prescription drugs, namely, that the price elasticity of demand is constant and equal to -0.27. As a middle value, we take the other interpretation of their results: that the demand curve is linear in price. 18 As a high value, we take Gallet's high-end elasticity of -0.56. The corresponding results for predicted deaths are shown in figure 7-13 as \"low constant elasticity,\" \"low linear elasticity,\" respectively.19 For reference, figure 7-13 also shows the actual rate of over - dose deaths involving prescription opioids. Price changes would be capable of explaining between 31 and 83 percent of the growth between 2001 and 2010 in the death rate involving prescription opioids, assuming that the rise in overdose deaths is proportional to the rise in misuse. In other words, without the price changes, the estimates suggest that there would have been between 11,500 and 22,800 fewer deaths involving prescription opioids during those years.20 Figure 7-13 suggests that a greater fraction of the increase in actual over- dose deaths is explained with constant elasticity models (the red and gold lines in the figure) in 2010 than in earlier years, such as 2005. This pattern occurs because our price measure shows proportionally fewer price declines in the early years than in the later ones and likely reflects the substantial influences of nonprice factors (e.g., prescribing norms and marketing efforts) in addition to price factors. However, the linear demand specification shows a time pattern of predicted deaths (as opposed to a total increase) that is closer to actual deaths, 17 Gallet (2014) finds that demand for drugs (1) is more responsive to price at the extensive margin (in decisions about whether to use drugs) than at the intensive margin (how much of the drug to use), and (2) is more responsive in the long run than in the short run. 18 Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018) calculate an elasticity of -0.15 based on percentage changes from the low price to the high price, which is a valid point elasticity only if the demand curve is linear in price, with a point elasticity of -0.15 at the average out-of-pocket price paid by low-cost Medicare Part D recipients between 2007 and 2011. It is a valid arc elasticity only if converted to -0.27 so that it can be applied to price increases as well as decreases. 19 For the constant elasticity predictions, we use a demand function of the form elasticity of heroin, a substitute for prescription opioids, for which a large body of academic literature is available.

He finds that the price elasticity of heroin falls in the range of -0.47 to -0.56, which coincides with the arc elasticity of -0.49 calculated from Soni's (2018) results for prescription opioids but is further from zero than the short -run estimates for all prescription drugs reported by Einav, Finkelstein, and Polyakova (2018). 17 Because previous studies show a range of price elasticities, we can only provide a range of estimates of the role of price changes as a factor in the growth of opioid misuse and the number of deaths involving prescription opioids.

This was facilitated by an environment in which prescribers were encouraged and even required to aggressively treat pain with opioids (President's Commission 2017). 22 As a result, physicians wrote more opioid prescriptions for more patients, lowering the amount of time and effort needed to acquire the drugs. In some places, the rise of pill mills further increased the convenience of acquiring these drugs by combining prescription writing with dispensing. We further note that the death rate involving prescription opioids increased by a factor of 2.8 between 2001 and 2010 ( figure 7-13), at the same time that the per capita quantity of prescription opioids increased by a factor of 2.6 (figure 7-11). This suggests that whatever factor was increasing prescrip - tions over this period was also increasing opioid use, with only somewhat 21 Given that the research of price effects on drug sales finds most of them to be on the \"extensive margin,\" the market demand curve largely reflects the inverse distribution of consumer heterogeneity. Distribution functions can generate convex demand functions like the constant-elasticity function, concave demand functions, or a combination of both, such as with the normal distribution. 22 In technical terms, prescribing norms affect both the number of prescriptions at a given price and the sensitivity of that number to price changes.Actual Low elasticityHigh elasticity 0123456 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-13.

One possible explanation for this result is that the price elasticity of misuse is similar to\u2014but somewhat further from zero than\u2014the price elasticity of medical use, so price declines increase both types of use but proportionally somewhat more for misuse. Public Subsidies for Opioids A potentially relevant factor for the 81 percent decline in out-of-pocket prices for prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010 is the expansion of public health insurance programs that subsidize access to and the purchasing of prescription drugs, including opioids. These subsidies lower out-of-pocket prices in the legal market, thereby lowering prices directly for the 25 percent of prescription opioid misusers who obtain their drugs from a physician and indirectly for the 75 percent of misusers (see figure 7-12) who receive them on the secondary market from friends, family, and dealers who first obtained the drugs in the primary market.23 The share of potency-adjusted prescription opioids funded by govern - ment programs grew from 17 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010 ( figure 7-14). However, this may understate the share of diverted opioids that were obtained with the assistance of funding from public programs. The diversion of opioids to the secondary market is more profitable when out-of-pocket prices are lower, and drugs purchased with government subsidies cost less on average than drugs purchased out of pocket or with private insurance (MEPS). Thus, government subsidies that cut out-of-pocket prices the most may lead to opioids obtained with the assistance of funding from these programs to be the most likely to be diverted. In fact, government programs funded 74 percent of all opioids that were covered at least in part by a third-party payer in 2010 (MEPS). Figure 7-14 shows the shares of potency-adjusted opioids covered by public programs, private insurers, and no third-party payer. Public programs have become much more important sources for funding opioids over time, and Medicare coverage expansions appear to have largely driven this growth. The share of opioids covered by Medicare spiked in 2006, coinciding with the imple - mentation that year of Medicare Part D, which offers prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries.24 It is important to note that the vast majority of Medicare Part D enrollees dispensed opioids do not misuse them. Carey, Jena, 23 See Schnell (2017), who analyzes the linkages between the primary and secondary markets. 24 In a similar calculation, Zhou, Florence, and Dowell (2016) find that the share of expenditures on prescription opioids accounted for by Medicare increased from 3 percent in 2001 to 26 percent in 2012. As shown in figure 7-14, we find that the number of prescriptions for which Medicare was the primary payer increased from 5 percent in 2001 to 29 percent in 2012. The slight differences may be because the Medicare share of expenditures (as reported by Zhou, Florence, and Dowell 2016) does not include out-of-pocket copayments made by Medicare enrollees for prescriptions where Medicare was the primary payer (figure 7-14). 250-840_text_.pdf 256 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |253and Barnett (2018) studied a sample of more than 600,000 Medicare beneficia - ries who had an opioid prescription. Using several different measures, only 0.6 to 8.5 percent of the beneficiaries fulfilled a misuse measure. The implementation of Medicare Part D and the resulting growth in the share of opioids funded by Medicare do not appear to have simply displaced opioids covered by other sources. Figure 7-15 shows the quantity of opioids per capita funded by each source. Though the number of potency-adjusted opioids covered by Medicaid fell between 2005 and 2006, the increase in the number of opioids covered by Medicare was over three times larger than this decline. 25 The number of potency-adjusted opioids covered by private insurance also increased between 2005 and 2006. Furthermore, between 2005 and 2008, the MEPS data suggest that the total quantity of potency-adjusted opioids that 25 An estimated 6.2 million Medicaid beneficiaries became eligible for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage on January 1, 2006 (KFF 2006). These \"full dual eligibles\" included low-income seniors and low-income disabled individuals under age 65. Nonelderly disabled dual eligibles, including both full and partial, made up about one-third of all duals (2.5 million out of almost 7.5 million\u2014per Holahan and Ghosh 2005, 3). Applying this one-third ratio to 6.2 million means that about 2.0 to 2.1 million nonelderly disabled Medicaid participants transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare prescription drug coverage in 2006. For comparison, the SSDI rolls grew from 6.5 million to 6.8 million individuals between 2005 and 2006.0102030405060708090100 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Private Sources: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey; National Drug Code Database; CEA calculations. Note: The primary payer is defined as the third-party payer with the highest payment for a given prescription. In addition to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers, the other possible primary payers include veterans' benefits, workers' compensation, other Federal government insurance, other State or local government insurance, or other public insurance. All prescriptions are converted into morphine gram equivalents based on the quantity of pills prescribed and their potency, using the National Drug Code database.Figure 7- 14. Share of Potency-Adjusted Pr escription Opioids, by Primary Payer, 2001-15 Percent 2/7/20 3:46 PM254| Chapter 7were dispensed increased by 73 percent, with almost three-fourths of this growth coming from opioids paid for by Medicare.26 Between 2001 and 2010, Medicare-covered opioids increased by over 2,400 percent, Medicaid-covered opioids increased by over 360 percent, and total publicly covered opioids increased by over 1,200 percent (MEPS). Given that Medicare covers the elderly and SSDI recipients who tend to have greater needs related to pain relief, it is not surprising that Medicare is the largest payer of prescription drugs as well as the largest public payer of prescription opioids. Previous research has studied the implications of the rise in public funding for opioids fueling the opioid crisis and, in particular, the diversion of pills to the secondary market. Powell, Pacula, and Taylor (2017) found that a Medicare Part D-driven 10 percent increase in opioid prescriptions results in 7.4 percent more opioid-involved overdose deaths among the Medicare-ineligible population. The authors use the fact that Medicare Part D was plausibly more important in driving prescription drug benefits in States with a greater share of the population over age 65 to estimate the impact of drug benefits on opioid-involved overdose deaths. 26 As shown in a comparison of figures 7-11 and 7-15, the MEPS data undercount the total number of prescription opioids. See also Hill, Zuvekas, and Zodet (2011, 242), which looks more systematically at the propensity of MEPS respondents \"to underreport the number of different drugs taken.\" MEPS underreporting presents greater challenges for measuring total quantities rather than average prices, which is why the CEA measures the former from ARCOS and the latter from MEPS.0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015No third-party payer Private Other public Medicaid MedicareFigure 7-15.

Others have exam - ined opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid.27 In a recent report, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (2018) notes numerous examples of Medicaid fraud that fuel abuse of prescription opioids\u2014for example, with drug dealers paying Medicaid recipients to obtain taxpayer-funded pills. Similarly, Eberstadt (2017) suggests that Medicaid has helped finance increasing nonwork by prime-age adults by subsidizing prescription opioids that could be sold on the secondary market. Goodman-Bacon and Sandoe (2017), Venkataramani and Chatterjee (2019), and Cher, Morden and Meara (2019), however, find little evidence for Medicaid expansion fueling the opioid crisis. These findings are not necessarily inconsistent with other evidence that public programs worsened the opioid crisis. It is possible that Medicaid expan-sion did not increase opioid misuse because the expansion population is less likely to be prescribed opioids. Before State expansions, Medicaid already cov - ered all disabled adults receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as well as elderly adults not eligible for Medicare. Medicaid expansion only covered nondisabled, nonelderly adults with low incomes, a population less likely to be prescribed opioids. In fact, figure 7-15 shows that the per capita quantity of opioids covered by Medicaid decreased between 2013 and 2015, despite the fact that Medicaid enrollment grew from 60 million to 70 million people over this same period, as the majority of States expanded Medicaid coverage. In addition, the Medicaid expansions studied by Goodman-Bacon and Sandoe (2017) occurred in 2014, after measures had been taken to reduce the ability of people to misuse prescription opioids (e.g., the reformulation of OxyContin in 2010 and the introduction of other medicines along with the rescheduling of certain opioids to higher schedules with more restrictions). Public subsidies for prescription opioids have also been fueled by the growing number of Americans claiming disability insurance. SSDI is a Federal disability assistance program that offers a maximum possible benefit of $2,687 a month, with an average monthly benefit of $1,173. Only adults who have significant work experience are eligible to receive SSDI, and the amount of 27 In 2017, 15.6 percent of the total U.S. population was age 65 or older, but only 3.6 percent of all opioid-involved overdose deaths were age 65 or older (CDC WONDER). 250-840_text_.pdf 259 2/7/20 3:46 PM256| Chapter 7benefits is higher for those who had higher lifetime earnings before becoming disabled.28 SSDI disabled workers are generally eligible for Medicare after 24 months of enrollment in the program. SSDI rolls have increased dramatically since 1990. The growth in SSDI rolls can be attributed to several factors, including the aging of the population, the increased labor force participation of women, and more lenient disability determinations (Autor 2015). Another disability pro - gram, SSI, provides more modest benefits to Americans without sufficient work experience to qualify for SSDI, and provides automatic eligibility for Medicaid in most States. Figure 7-16 shows the rise in SSDI and SSI rolls per 100,000 people over time. Notably, SSDI rolls and opioid overdose deaths, especially those involving prescription opioids, have risen in tandem. It is also important to note SSDI growth occurred over the same period as increased treatment of pain conditions with opioids. The 8.6 million SSDI disabled workers in 2011 represent less than 3 per - cent of the total U.S. population, and thus are overrepresented as a source of prescription opioids given disabilities (increasingly related to pain) that lead to a greater use of prescription opioids. The CEA estimates the total market share of SSDI recipients in two ways, each suggesting that SSDI recipients make up about 26 to 30 percent of the prescription opioid market. First, we use data from Morden and others (2014), who estimate the average potency-adjusted opioid prescriptions for SSDI recipients across the United States in 2011 (6.9 MGEs per SSDI recipient). We multiply this average rate by the total number of SSDI recipients in 2011 (8.6 million recipients). And finally, we divide the total opioids prescribed to SSDI recipients (59.2 million MGEs) by the total opioids distributed in the United States according to ARCOS data (196.9 million MGEs). The result is that 30 percent of potency-adjusted opioid prescriptions in the U.S. are filled by SSDI recipients, which is over 10 times their proportion of the U.S. population. Second, the CEA uses MEPS data that report opioid prescriptions for a random sample of Americans each year. We identify SSDI recipients as individ-uals between age 18 and 64 who receive Medicare. This may slightly overstate the SSDI population, given that a small number of non-SSDI recipients under age 65 are eligible for Medicare as well, including people with end-stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 29 Nonetheless, dividing the potency- adjusted opioids prescribed to these recipients by the total in the population 28 Qualification for SSDI requires a sufficient number of work credits that were earned recently enough. Up to 4 credits can be earned in one year and are accrued based on sufficient annual earnings. Applicants generally require 40 credits to qualify for SSDI, although standards are different for younger workers.29 There were just under 273,000 Medicare recipients under age 65 with end-stage renal disease in 2013 (HHS 2014). The prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is just 5 per 100,000, implying that in 2013, there were just under 16,000 Americans with the disease (Stanford Medicine n.d.). 250-840_text_.pdf 260 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |257results in an estimated SSDI market share of 26 percent for the period 2010- 12.30 The somewhat lower share estimated using MEPS data may be due to the exclusion of SSDI recipients who have been on the program for less than two years.31 These SSDI recipients would not yet be eligible for Medicare and may instead receive coverage via Medicaid or other programs.32 It is important to emphasize that the disproportionate market share of SSDI recipients receiving prescription opioids is a result of their higher levels of conditions that prevent them from working and that may also cause pain. SSDI benefit payments, in conjunction with Medicare coverage, provide a vital means of support for disabled workers with major healthcare needs. Thus, reforms that seek to reduce nonmedical use of opioids should be careful to preserve access to needed pain relief through the medical use of opioids for SSDI recipients. 30 Based on a five-year average centered on 2011, we similarly estimate a market share of 26 percent. 31 MEPS excludes the institutionalized population, so if SSDI recipients are overrepresented in this population, this could further affect our estimate. 32 We note that Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2018) estimate that SSDI recipients account for about 13 percent of opioid prescriptions. However, they do not appear to analyze potency-adjusted opioids, as we do. Indeed, when we use the MEPS data to estimate the market share of non-potency-adjusted opioid prescriptions for the same 2006-14 period that Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2018) appear to consider, we estimate a similar 15.5 percent market share.Rx opioid overdose (right axis) 02468101214 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016Figure 7-16.

However, the buildup of a pool of people misusing prescription opioids that they could no longer access provided a large pool of new demand and a profit opportunity for sellers entering the illicit opioid market. Because, for people suffering from addiction, legal and illicit opioids can function as substitutes, raising the price (in terms of both money and time) of legal opioids raises the demand for illicit ones. The reformulation of OxyContin in 2010 made it more physically difficult to use. States have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs that require doctors to consult patient prescription histories before prescribing opi-oids (Dowell et al. 2016; Buchmueller and Carey Grecu, and Saffer 2018). Professional societies and accrediting organizations have reconsidered their pain treatment guidelines. These changes have reduced the overall quan - tity of prescription opioids distributed, with potency-adjusted quantities of opioids peaking in 2011 (DOJ n.d.). Unfortunately, recent research has shown that overdose deaths averted from prescription opioid overdoses, at least those resulting from the reformulation of OxyContin, have been replaced by overdose deaths from heroin (Alpert, Powell, and Pacula 2018; Evans, Lieber, and Power 2019). As users have substituted toward heroin, it has increasingly been made even more potent\u2014suppliers and drug dealers now frequently lace heroin with illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent in its analgesic properties than heroin, so even small amounts can vastly increase the potency of the drugs with which it is mixed. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl can also be obtained independently of heroin. Figure 7-17 documents the rise of fentanyl, showing both the rate of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (a category dominated by fentanyl, although whether the product is illicit or by prescription is not determinable), and the rate of fentanyl reports in forensic labs acquired by law enforcement during drug seizures. Figure 7-18 shows the rise in overdose deaths involving heroin and fully synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl), along with opioid deaths not involving her - oin and synthetic opioids. As a reminder, we refer to overdose-related opioid deaths from heroin and fentanyl as \"illicit deaths,\" even though fentanyl can also be prescribed.33 From 2010 through 2016, the rate of illicit opioid deaths has increased by 364 percent, while the rate of opioid deaths not involving illicit opioids has fallen by 17 percent. Importantly, fentanyl also tends to be combined with nonopioids, and deaths in which fentanyl and nonopioids are factors are included in the illicit opioid series shown in figure 7-18. 33 We use ICD-10 codes T40.1 and T40.4 to identify deaths involving 262 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |259Fentanyl reports in forensic labs Deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl) 024681012 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-17.

Accurate data cannot be reliably obtained from dealers or users, who may fear criminal sanctions for truthful reporting. In recent years, the influx from Mexico and China of cheap but highly potent fentanyl, which can vastly increase the potency of drugs with which it is mixed, has complicated matters (U.S. Department of State n.d.). Market quantities of heroin and fentanyl also cannot be directly observed, so the extent to which added fentanyl reduces the price per potency-adjusted unit of opioids is difficult to determine. Subject to these limitations, the CEA has assembled data from several sources to create a time series for the price of illicit opioids. The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) and STARLIMS databases collect heroin price data. Heroin prices in these data sets are obtained by govern - ment agents, who pay informants to purchase heroin on the street. The price is recorded, and the heroin sample is analyzed in a laboratory to determine its potency so that prices can be adjusted for quality. Between 2010 and 2016, the potency-adjusted real price of heroin increased by 10 percent. However, any fentanyl contained within heroin is not considered when determining the price per pure gram of heroin in the DEA data. Thus, the true price per potency-adjusted unit of heroin purchases has likely increased by less than 10 percent or has even declined. In addition, fentanyl can be consumed on its own outside heroin, which, if cheaper on a potency-adjusted basis, would lead overall illicit opioid prices to fall even more. Moreover, increased heroin purity and product modifications have increasingly allowed for heroin use by means other than injection. These changes lower the nonmonetary costs of using heroin, and although nonmonetary costs are not estimated here, these changes would have further reduced the cost of illicit opioid use. The CEA uses data from several sources to estimate the quantity of fentanyl mixed with heroin and available on its own, along with the potency-adjusted price of heroin (including the fentanyl with which it is mixed) and the potency-adjusted price of fentanyl when consumed alone or with other drugs. Quantity data are based on seizures of heroin and fentanyl recorded in the National Seizure System, along with exhibits of each drug recorded in the National Forensic Laboratory Information System. Price data are based on the DEA heroin price series and on DEA reports on the cost of fentanyl relative to heroin, along with the quantity data in order to adjust heroin prices based on fentanyl with which it is mixed. A detailed methodology for estimating illicit opioid prices is provided in the appendix of a previously published CEA report (CEA 2019b). We acknowledge that seizure data are a highly imperfect proxy of the relative presence of heroin and fentanyl. Seized products reflect a combina - tion of market shares and law enforcement priorities rather than market shares 250-840_text_.pdf 264 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |261alone. Still, absent an alternative data source, and without a clear direction for the bias in this proxy for market shares, we use the seizure data as reported. Figure 7-19 shows a real price index for illicit opioids between 2001 and 2016, which, given the data limitations involved, should be used only to draw qualitative conclusions. The price of illicit opioids is relatively stable before fall - ing temporarily in 2006, and then quickly recovering, and then falls by over half (58 percent) between 2013 and 2016. Each of these declines is due to surges in fentanyl that is either mixed with heroin or sold on its own or with other drugs. The 2006 price decline was due to a laboratory in Mexico that dramati - cally increased the supply of fentanyl to the United States but was quickly shut down through cooperative action between the United States and Mexico. The price decline between 2013 and 2016 is attributed to the widely documented influx of fentanyl into the United States, including from China and Mexico (NIDA 2017). The price series shown in figure 7-19 is the outcome of a series of assumptions documented more completely in the appendix of the CEA's previously published report and is necessarily only a highly imperfect estimate of the real price from which only qualitative conclusions should be drawn (CEA 2019b). If data on the illicit opioid market in this period improve, revisions to this series may be possible. It is clear from figure 7-19 that supply expansions were important for driv - ing the growth in overdose deaths involving illicit opioids. Between 2010 and 2013, the price of illicit opioids was relatively stable. This implies that both sup - ply and demand expansions were important during the first three years of the Price per MGE of illicit opioids 0.20.40.60.81.01.2 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Figure 7-19. Real Price Index of Potency-Adjusted Illicit Opioids, 2001-16 Index (2001 = 1) Sources: National Seizure System; National Forensic Laboratory Information System; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; ONDCP 7illicit wave of the opioid crisis. If only demand had expanded, then prices would have increased; and if only supply had expanded, then prices would have decreased. Demand expansions can likely be traced at least in part to efforts to clamp down on abuse that grew during the first wave of the crisis without providing additional access to quality treatment services. Expanded supply is likely due to increased supply from source countries, including Mexico and Colombia, and it may reflect a substitution of drug production from marijuana (which has been legalized or decriminalized in some U.S. States) to heroin (ONDCP 2019). Meanwhile, supply expansions are likely more important than demand expansions for the 2013-16 period, given that the price of illicit opi - oids fell by more than half during these three years. The shift toward fentanyl produced in China and distributed through the mail has increased the potency of drugs without significantly increasing their prices, and may have increased competition in the illicit opioid market, thereby also putting downward pres - sure on the price of heroin. To the extent that monetary price declines have been accompanied by an increased ease of obtaining illicit opioids (given the proliferation of drug dealers in more locations and the increased availability of online markets), supply expansions may have been even more important than the falling illicit price series suggests. For instance, Quinones (2015) notes that Mexican heroin dealers who illegally cross the border have become much more efficient in delivering heroin to users rather than forcing users to find them. These drug dealers communicate with users via cell phones to establish a place to meet, at which point the user enters the dealer's car to receive their heroin. Conclusion The opioid crisis poses a major threat to the U.S. economy and American lives, and many factors have exacerbated this threat. In addition to taking more than 400,000 lives since 2000, the opioid crisis cost $665 billion in 2018, or 3.2 percent of U.S. gros domestic product. In this chapter, the CEA presents evidence that falling prices may have played a role in increasing opioid misuse and opioid-involved overdose deaths. During the first wave of the opioid crisis, which was characterized by growing overdose deaths involving prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010, the out-of-pocket price of prescription opioids fell by 81 percent. This likely reduced the price of prescription opioids in the secondary market, from which most people who misuse prescription opioids obtain their drugs. Using the proportional price assumption and given elasticities from the academic lit-erature, we find that the decline in observed out-of-pocket prices is capable of explaining between 31 and 83 percent of the growth in the number of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010. At the same time that out-of-pocket prices were falling, government subsidies and the 250-840_text_.pdf 266 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |263market share of generic opioids were expanding. We estimate that the share of prescribed opioids funded by government programs increased from 17 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010 (and to 63 percent in 2015). The share of publicly funded opioids diverted to the secondary market may be even higher, given the relatively low acquisition cost for suppliers of diverted opioids. Falling prices could not elicit a change in the quantity of opioids misused and the resulting opioid deaths unless providers were encouraged to prescribe the opioids, health plans were paying for the prescriptions, and pharmacies were filling these prescriptions. We describe the change in the environment resulting from changing pain management guidelines and aggressive market - ing tactics that reduced barriers to obtaining larger quantities of opioids. The CEA finds that the second wave of the opioid crisis\u2014characterized by growing deaths from illicit opioids between 2010 and 2016\u2014was driven by a combination of supply and demand expansions. Efforts to restrict the supply and misuse of prescription opioids led an increased number of users from the first wave to substitute illicit opioids in place of prescription opioids. At the same time, the supply of illicit opioids expanded, and this substitution decreased quality-adjusted prices to reduce the \"cost of a high.\" Despite the importance of demand through a substitution effect in the initial years of the second wave, the CEA finds that the evidence supports the idea that supply expansions have been more important causes of the crisis's growth than demand increases. The Trump Administration has taken significant steps to stem the tide of the opioid crisis. In October 2017, the Administration declared a nationwide Public Health Emergency. President Trump later established his Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand in March 2018 (White House 2018). These and other measures taken by the government include securing more than $6 billion in new funding in 2018 and 2019 to address the opioid crisis by reducing the supply of opioids, reducing new demand for opi - oids, and treating those with opioid use disorder. To restrict the supply of illicitly produced opioids, there have been increased efforts to prevent the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. through ports of entry and international shipments. The President also signed into law the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology (INTERDICT) Act, which funds U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to expand technologies to help inter - dict illicit substances including opioids. The CBP is also training all narcotic detector dogs at ports of entry to detect fentanyl. These efforts have seen success\u2014during fiscal year 2019, the CBP seized almost 2,800 pounds of fen - tanyl and over 6,200 pounds of heroin (CBP 2019). The Administration has also increased enforcement against illicit drug producers and traffickers. In 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted two Chinese nationals accused of manufacturing and shipping fentanyl analogues, synthetic opioids, and 250 250-840_text_.pdf 267 2/7/20 3:46 PM264| Chapter 7other drugs to at least 37 U.S. States and 25 other countries (DOJ 2018). In addi - tion, the Department of the Treasury has levied kingpin designations against fentanyl traffickers that operate in China, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico, and also throughout Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. To stop the flow of this deadly drug before it reaches Americans, the Administration is working with more than 130 nations that signed onto President Trump's Call to Action on this issue. The Federal government is also engaging private sector partners to help secure U.S. supply chains against traf - fickers attempting to exploit those platforms (ONDCP 2019). One example is the promotion of increased private sector self-policing of products entering the U.S. via third-party marketplaces, and other intermediaries to an e-commerce transaction (via the Department of Homeland Security). Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) organization has also increased its efforts targeting transnational criminal organizations (TCO) involved with the opioid epidemic. HSI has increased its partnerships\u2014such as the Border Enforcement Security Taskforce (BEST) platforms\u2014with other Federal, international, tribal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to increase information and resource shar - ing within U.S. communities. BESTs eliminate the barriers between Federal and local investigations (access to both Federal and State prosecutors), close the gap with international partners in multinational criminal investigations, and create an environment that minimizes the vulnerabilities in our operations that TCOs have traditionally capitalized on to exploit the Nation's land and sea borders. To better combat 21st-century crime exploiting ecommerce, HSI has increased its presence at international mail facilities and express consign - ment centers by establishing BESTs at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Los Angeles International Airport, Memphis International Airport, Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Louisville International Airport as part of HSI's comprehensive and multilayered strategy to combat TCOs and their smuggling activities. This strategy facilitates the immediate application of investigative techniques on seized parcels, which aid in establishing probable cause needed to effect enforcement actions on indi - viduals associated with narcotics laden parcels. Consequently, these seizures and arrests disrupt the movement of narcotics transiting through the mail and express consignment shipments, and aid in the dismantling of distribution networks. BEST partners with the CBP, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and DEA at these facilities. As of September 2019, BESTs are located at 69 locations throughout the nation, including Puerto Rico. Along with reducing the supply of opioids, Federal and State govern - ments are also playing a key role in curtailing the demand for prescription and illicit opioids. Prescription drug monitoring programs that track controlled substance prescriptions are operational in 49 states, the District of Columbia, 250-840_text_.pdf 268 2/7/20 3:46 PMUnderstanding the Opioid Crisis |265and Guam, and they can provide timely information about prescribing and patient behaviors that exacerbate the crisis and enable response (CRS 2018). In 2017, the number of high-dose opioid prescriptions dispensed monthly declined by over 16 percent, and the prescribing rate of opioids fell to its lowest rate in more than 10 years. The Administration has also invested over $1 billion in innovative research to develop effective nonopioid options for pain manage - ment. In addition to reducing opioid prescriptions to decrease new initiates to opioid misuse, the Administration has launched information campaigns to create awareness and inform the public about opioid use disorder to prevent new drug users. In June 2018, the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Ad Council, and the Truth Initiative announced a public education campaign over digital platforms, social media, and television targeting youth and young adults. Importantly, nearly 60 percent fewer young adults between the age of 18 and 25 began using heroin in 2018 than in 2016. Improved guidelines are also being established to target the vulnerable veteran population, who are twice as likely as the average American to die from an opioid drug overdose (Wilkie 2018). The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense updated their Opioid Safety Initiative in 2017 to provide prescribers with a framework to evaluate, treat, and man - age patients with chronic pain, including ways to better aggregate electronic medical records and track opioid prescriptions. In the first six years of the program, from 2012 to 2018, the number of veteran patients receiving opioids was reduced by 45 percent. Over the same period, the number of veterans on long-term opioid therapies declined by 51 percent and the number of veterans on high-dose opioid therapies declined by 66 percent (Wilkie 2018). Finally, the Administration is also focusing on treating and saving the lives of those currently struggling with opioid addictions by expanding access to the life-saving drug naloxone and other evidence-based interventions, such as medication-assisted treatment and other recovery support services. Prevention of drug use is important, but in addition, the Trump Administration has invested in increased treatment and recovery support for people who suffer from opioid use disorder. The Surgeon General has promoted access and carrying naloxone, the lifesaving reversal agent of an opioid overdose. In October 2018, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan Substance Use Disorder Prevention That Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, which includes provisions to improve substance use disorder treatments for Medicaid patients and to expand Medicare coverage of opioid use disorder treatment services. In fiscal years 2018 and 2019, a total of $3 billion was appropriated for State grants to fund opioid use disorder prevention and treatment. Many States\u2014including West Virginia, Indiana, Wyoming, Tennessee, Florida, and Virginia\u2014have imple - mented legislation to expand the availability of naloxone, and inpatient and outpatient use of the life-saving 2018). 250-840_text_.pdf 269 2/7/20 3:46 PM266| Chapter 7Many of the measures taken by the Trump Administration to cut the supply of opioids, prevent new demand, and save the lives of those currently struggling with opioid use disorders may have contributed to the flattening growth of overdose deaths involving opioids. Between January 2017 and May 2019, monthly overdose deaths fell by 9.6 percent. If the growth rate in opioid overdose deaths from January 1999 through December 2016 had continued, the CEA estimates that 37,750 additional lives would have been lost due to opioid overdoses between January 2017 and May 2019. The CEA estimates the economic cost savings since January 2017 from reduced mortality compared with the preexisting trend was over $397 billion. The opioid crisis remains at an emergency level, but its dramatic growth has been halted. Despite successful efforts to curb the opioid crisis and stop the increase in overdose deaths, there has been an increase in psychostimulant-related overdose deaths, primarily driven by methamphetamine use, that is a cause of concern. Psychostimulant-related deaths now outnumber fentanyl deaths in 12 States (Wilner 2019). The economic and human costs of drug misuse continue to pose a threat to the United States. The Trump Administration is working to determine the underlying causes of the opioid crisis so that it can implement effective solu - tions. Lower drug prices clearly played a role in the opioid crisis's growth, and understanding this dynamic will help policymakers successfully respond to this threat and avoid mistakes that could lead to another costly, deadly crisis. 250-840_text_.pdf 270 2/7/20 3:46 PM267 xChapter 8 Expanding Affordable Housing Incomes in the United States are rising, but home prices are rising much faster in some highly regulated markets. While overall homeownership rates have increased since 2016, some disadvantaged groups lag behind. As households turn to the rental market, moderate-income households are dedicating a large share of their incomes to rent. The housing affordability problem shows no signs of subsiding in certain markets, as housing construction fails to keep up with demand, putting upward pressure on home prices and rents. Fortunately, the majority of areas in the United States have relatively well- functioning housing markets in which regulations do not significantly drive up prices. Indeed, smart regulations that balance the need to build enough housing to meet growing demand while reflecting the reasonable concerns of neighborhood residents are achieved by many growing areas in the country. While areas with relatively moderate home prices may still suffer from some issues, such as delays for building permits, regulations do not necessarily make homes substantially less affordable. However, research has shown that there are 11 metropolitan areas where the inability to build enough housing to meet demand has driven home prices far higher than the cost to produce a home. These 11 metropolitan areas include San Francisco, Honolulu, Oxnard, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington, Boston, Denver, New York City, Seattle, and Baltimore. Housing is particularly difficult to build in these 11 metropolitan areas due to excessive regulatory barriers imposed by State and local governments. Such overly restrictive regulations include zoning and growth management controls, rent controls, building and rehabilitation codes, energy and water efficiency 250-840_text_.pdf 271 2/7/20 3:46 PM268| Chapter 8mandates, maximum-density allowances, historic preservation requirements, wetland or environmental regulations, manufactured-housing regulations and restrictions, parking requirements, permitting and review procedures, investment or reinvestment tax policies, labor requirements, and impact or developer fees. Research has linked higher home prices and lower housing supply to many of these regulations. Resulting higher housing prices in these 11 metropolitan areas make homeown - ership less attainable for otherwise-qualified borrowers, thereby constraining their ability to achieve sustainable homeownership and putting additional pressure on rental markets for lower- and middle-income households. The lowest-income households are especially burdened. Among these 11 metro - politan areas, homelessness would fall by an estimated 31 percent on average if overly burdensome regulations were relaxed. Higher rents resulting from these regulations also deprive families of Federal rental housing assistance, because higher government expenditures on households in high-rent areas, through higher Fair Market Rents, reduce the amount of funds available to serve other needy families. For example, housing a family in a three-bedroom apartment can cost the Federal Government more than $4,000 per month in San Francisco County, California, compared with about $1,500 per month in Harris County, Texas. Excessive regulatory barriers to building more housing in these specific areas also have broader negative effects beyond those imposed on lower-income Americans. State and local housing regulations reduce labor mobility by pricing workers out of several of the Nation's most productive cities, which stunts aggregate economic growth and increases inequality across regions and workers. Excessive regulatory barriers also reduce parents' ability to access neighborhoods that best advance their children's economic opportunity. And by incentivizing families to venture further from their places of work to find affordable housing, overregulation can increase commuting times to work, 250-840_text_.pdf 272 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |269thus harming the environment, straining local budgets, and decreasing worker productivity. Removing government-imposed barriers to more affordable housing is a prior - ity for the Trump Administration. Beyond establishing the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is encouraging State and local governments to focus on increasing housing supply in areas where supply is constrained. Increasing housing choice for all Americans requires taking on regulatory barriers that place housing in large swaths of specific areas out of reach for lower-income families. Since 2000, real median (posttax/posttransfer) household income has grown by 20 percent, while real home prices have grown by almost 50 percent, according to the Standard & Poor's / Case-Shiller Index (CBO 2019). With rising home prices outpacing income gains in some areas, house-holds are spending larger portions of their incomes on housing, and fewer people can afford to purchase their own homes. Although the overall homeownership rate has increased since 2016, some groups lag behind. Based on the four-quarter moving average, the black home - ownership rate remains 31.5 percentage points below that of non-Hispanic white households (see figure 8-1). The Hispanic homeownership rate remains 26.2 percentage points lower than that of non-Hispanic white households, despite increasing by 1.3 percentage points since the fourth quarter of 2016, when President Trump was elected. Differences in homeownership between races exacerbate the wealth gap. In 2016, white families had a median wealth of $171,000, while black families had a median wealth of $17,600, resulting in part from their lower homeownership rate (Dettling et al. 2017). Many American households, particularly low-income households, spend a large portion of their income on rent. According to the American Community Survey, out of 43 million renter households in the United States in 2017, 46 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, 31 percent paid more than 40 percent, and 23 percent paid more than 50 percent. Among renters with incomes of less than $20,000 in 2017, about 74 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income in rent. For those renters with income between $20,000 and $50,000, about 61 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income in rent. Meanwhile, a significant number of Americans go without housing altogether, sleeping instead on the streets or in homeless shelters. Just over 250-840_text_.pdf 273 2/7/20 3:46 PM270| Chapter 8half a million people were homeless on a single night in January 2018, with 35 percent of those found in unsheltered locations not intended for human habitation, such as sidewalks and public parks (HUD 2018). Research has linked higher rents to higher rates of homelessness (e.g., Quigley, Raphael, and Smolensky 2001; Corinth 2017; Hanratty 2017; Nisar et al. 2019). The housing affordability problem shows no signs of subsiding, given that home construction fails to keep up with demand in some places, putting upward pressure on home prices and rents. Indeed, from 2010 to 2016, housing construction failed to keep pace with household formation, according to the Census Bureau. Home construction per capita has declined every decade since the 1970s. While an average of 8.2 homes were built for every 1,000 residents between 1970 and 1979, annual average construction fell to 3.0 homes per 1,000 residents between 2010 and 2018. Across States, there is large varia - tion in housing construction, according to State-level data from the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. For example, from 2010 to 2018, Texas built 5.3 homes and Florida built 4.3 homes per 1,000 residents, on average. Meanwhile, over the same period, California built 2.0 homes and New York built 1.7 homes per 1,000 residents. A key driver of the housing affordability problem is excessive regulatory barriers to building (single and multifamily) housing in a selected number of areas in the United States. In a competitive market, developers will build homes until (economic) profits fall to zero or, in other words, until the price the developer receives for the home equals the cost to produce the home.

Homeownership Rate s by Race and Ethnicity, 2000-2019 Homeownership rate (percent) Sources: Census Bureau; CEA calculations. 274 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |271However, overly burdensome regulations in some areas restrict housing supply and drive the price of a home above its minimum profitable production cost: the cost of construction plus the price of land to build on in a free market and a normal profit margin. In terms of the standard model of supply and demand, regulations make supply less elastic, causing prices to increase and quantity to decrease. In this way, Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) note that regulation that drives home prices above production costs acts as a \"regulatory tax\" on hous - ing. Regulations that can potentially drive up home prices include, for example, overly burdensome permitting and review procedures, overly restrictive zoning and growth management controls, unreasonable maximum-density allow - ances, historic preservation requirements, overly burdensome environmental regulations, and undue parking requirements. It is important to emphasize that an adequate amount of smart regula- tion is important to address market failures and reflect the reasonable con-cerns of current neighborhood residents regarding new housing development. In chapter 1 of this Report, we review evidence that gains in housing wealth contributed to the growth of total household wealth from 2016 through 2019. Many growing areas are highly successful in balancing neighborhood concerns with the need to expand housing supply to meet growing demand. In fact, housing prices are near or below the cost to produce a home in most areas of the United States, suggesting that low income levels (despite incomes rising in recent years) rather than high home prices are the reason some households struggle to cover housing costs in those areas. However, research has shown that as a result of excessive local regulatory barriers to building housing, there are 11 metropolitan areas where the inability to build enough housing to meet demand has driven home prices far higher than the cost to produce a home (Glaeser and Gyourko 2018). These 11 metropolitan areas include San Francisco, Honolulu, Oxnard, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington, Boston, Denver, New York City, Seattle, and Baltimore. Even in these areas, it is not necessary to build high-rise apartments throughout neighborhoods currently zoned for single-family homes or to eliminate all regulations. Rather, steps to remove excessive regulatory barriers must be taken so that housing supply can expand to meet demand and alleviate extreme housing cost burdens placed on low- and middle-income families. The excessive regulatory barriers placed on building housing in these 11 metropolitan areas cause economic distress to their current and potential residents. In addition to restricting the ability of property owners to use their property in reasonable ways, these regulations increase costs for both renters and those trying to buy a home. Based on estimates from Glaeser and Gyourko (2018), excessive regulatory barriers (defined as regulations that drive up home prices at least 25 percent above home production costs) drive up home prices by between 36 and 184 percent in each of these 11 metropolitan areas, which 250-840_text_.pdf 275 2/7/20 3:46 PM272| Chapter 8also leads to higher rents. These cost burdens are especially problematic for low-income Americans, who pay the largest share of their income on housing. By increasing rents, overly burdensome regulatory barriers to building housing increase homelessness. As estimated by the CEA (2019), relaxing excessive regulatory barriers in these 11 metropolitan areas where housing supply is significantly constrained would reduce homelessness by an aver-age of 31 percent in these areas. For example, homelessness would fall by 54 percent in San Francisco, 40 percent in Los Angeles, and 23 percent in New York. Because these areas contain 42 percent of the U.S. homeless population, homelessness would fall by 13 percent in the United States overall if each area adequately addressed its regulatory barriers. Overregulation of these selected housing markets also reduces the efficiency of government housing assistance because fewer American fami - lies receive assistance for a given budget outlay. In 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was provided $42 billion for its largest rental housing assistance programs: Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers ($23 billion), Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance ($12 billion), and Public Housing ($7 billion). Because HUD rental assistance is tied to market rents in an area, regulations that drive up rents also increase the costs of serving a fixed number of families. Deregulation that reduces rents in supply-constrained areas could produce savings for HUD that could be used to serve more families. For example, Federal taxpayers can pay more than $4,000 per month in rental assistance toward a three-bedroom unit in San Francisco County, California, compared with about $1,500 per month in Harris County, Texas. In addition to specific harmful effects on low-income Americans, exces- sive regulatory barriers in selected markets have other negative consequences for all Americans. First, they reduce labor mobility across areas, which stunts aggregate economic growth and increases inequality across regions and work - ers. When it is more expensive for workers to live in areas where they are most productive, they are less likely to do so and their productivity falls. Hsieh and Moretti (2019), for example, estimate that gross domestic product would have been 3.7 percent higher by 2009 if housing supply restrictions in the New York, San Jose, and San Francisco areas were relaxed beginning in 1964. Second, excessive regulatory barriers to building housing in selected markets reduces parents' ability to access neighborhoods that advance their children's economic opportunity. A series of papers by Raj Chetty and his col - leagues have identified neighborhoods that are most likely to improve long-term outcomes of children (Chetty et al. 2018). High home prices are a common characteristic of such neighborhoods, suggesting that excessive regulation that artificially increases home prices may reduce in-migration and dimin - ish opportunity for children. A report from the U.S. Senate Joint Economic Committee similarly found that the average U.S. zip code with the highest-quality public elementary schools has a median home price that is four times 250-840_text_.pdf 276 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |273as high as those zip codes with the lowest-quality public schools (JEC 2019). This is partly due to the willingness of some parents to pay more for homes located in high-quality school districts. Many of these areas have excessive regulatory barriers, however. Third, excessive regulatory barriers to building housing increase com - muting times because housing cannot be built near where people work, increasing driving time and traffic congestion, which harm the environment. The average commuter spent 54 hours in traffic congestion in 2017, up from 20 hours in 1982 (Schrank, Eisele, and Lomax 2019). The aggregate travel delay increased from 1.8 billion hours to 8.8 billion hours over this period, and the total cost associated with congestion rose from $15 billion to $179 billion. As a result of this rise in average commuting times, an extra 3.3 billion gallons of fuel were consumed. Fortunately, growing evidence of the importance of addressing excessive regulatory barriers to building housing has led to increased bipartisan focus on the issue. The CEA under the previous Administration released a \"Housing Development Toolkit\" in 2016 for State and local regulators. While some of the proposed reforms could be problematic, the toolkit called for a number of productive steps to reduce local government barriers to housing development. These reforms include establishing by-right development to streamline the process for approving projects, permitting multifamily zoning to boost urban density, and shortening the process for obtaining building permits (CEA 2016). Some counterproductive reforms were also suggested, including requirements that developers build certain types of units with regulated rents in exchange for building more market-rate units, a policy that can potentially hinder overall supply expansions and increase prices in some areas (Schuetz, Meltzer, and Been 2011). The CEA (2016) connected regulatory barriers to a number of prob - lems, including stunted economic growth, increased inequality, harm to the environment, and increased homelessness. To more successfully address the overregulation of housing markets, President Trump signed an Executive Order on June 25, 2019, establishing the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. Recognizing the harmful impact of these regulations on economic growth, opportunities for children, homelessness, and the cost of government programs, the council is tasked with identifying the most burdensome Federal, State, and local regulatory barriers to housing supply as well as actions that can best counter them. The Executive Order requires the council to determine how each Federal agency can curtail impediments to housing development, including in ways that \"align, support, and encourage\" State and local authori - ties to address local regulatory barriers. HUD has also taken action under the Trump Administration to counter regulatory barriers to building affordable housing. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which was finalized during the previous Administration, 250-840_text_.pdf 277 2/7/20 3:46 PM274| Chapter 8is being revised to focus more clearly on increasing housing supply in areas where supply is constrained, rather than encouraging localities to subsidize housing in more affluent areas. This rule recognizes that increasing housing choice for disadvantaged groups requires taking on regulatory barriers that place housing in large swaths of specific areas out of reach for lower-income families. This chapter proceeds by first documenting the housing affordability problem in the United States. It then identifies the key role that excessive regu - latory barriers play in the problem in a selected number of metropolitan areas. Next, it provides evidence of the many harmful consequences of these barriers, especially harm to low-income Americans. Finally, it concludes by discussing actions the Administration has taken to encourage the relaxation of excessive regulatory barriers in local housing markets.1 The Housing Affordability Problem When home prices rise faster than incomes, fewer households can afford to purchase a home. Those still able to qualify for a loan and purchase a home may do so in neighborhoods or regions with fewer opportunities, and they may commit larger shares of their income to mortgage payments and savings to a down payment. Renter households may pay a greater portion of their income in rent, leaving less income available for other needs. The burden is especially severe for lower-income households. By these definitions, the \"housing afford - ability\" problem in America is worsening, a result of home prices that have outpaced income gains and home construction that has not kept up with demand in certain areas. Based on a four-quarter moving average, as of the third quarter of 2019, 64.5 percent of households owned their own homes ( figure 8-1). This represents an increase of 1.1 percentage points since reaching its low point in 2016:Q3. However, the current homeownership rate is still 4.6 percentage points below its 69.1 percent peak in 2005:Q1. Some groups have particularly low homeownership rates. The black homeownership rate was 41.8 percent in 2019:Q3, 31.5 percentage points below the non-Hispanic white homeownership rate ( figure 8-1). While the Hispanic homeownership rate increased by 1.3 percentage points since 2016:Q4, when President Trump was elected, it was still at 47.2 percent in 2019:Q3, 26.2 percentage points lower than that of non-Hispanic white house - holds (figure 8-1). For those who are homeowners, owned homes are an important source of wealth. Thus, gaps in homeownership rates have direct implications for 1The CEA previously released research on topics covered in this chapter. The text that follows builds on the research paper produced by the CEA titled \"The State of Homelessness in America\" (CEA 2019). 250-840_text_.pdf 278 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |275wealth gaps. According to the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016, white families had a median wealth of $171,000, while black families had a median wealth of $17,600 and Hispanic families had a median wealth of $20,700, partly as a result of their much lower homeownership rates (Dettling et al. 2017). Among those who own a home, mortgages can take up a large share of income, especially for lower-income families. In 2017, housing costs rep-resented 67.5 percent of household income for homeowners with less than $20,000 in annual income, and 40.6 percent of income for homeowners with between $20,000 and $50,000 in annual income (Dumont 2019). Thus, housing affordability can be a problem even for those able to purchase their own home. In chapter 1 of this Report, we discuss how current low mortgage rates on the whole should support the housing market. However, other factors, such as high mortgage underwriting costs, hurt mortgage affordability. As homeownership rates have fallen, the number of renter households has grown. The Federal Reserve Board estimates that of the 6.2 million households formed between 2009 and 2017, 5.7 million (92 percent) were new renter households (Dumont 2019). Renter households pay large shares of their income on rent\u2014without building equity\u2014which can make it difficult for low- and moderate-income households to address other needs. From 1970 to 2010, the share of renter households spending more than half of their income on housing increased from 16 percent to 28 percent; over the same period, the share spending at least 30 percent on housing increased from 31 percent to 52 percent (Albouy, Ehrlich, and Liu 2016). According to the 2017 American Community Survey, out of 43 million renter households in the United States, 46 percent pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing, 31 percent pay more than 40 percent, and 23 percent pay more than 50 percent. As shown in table 8-1, among renters with incomes of less than $20,000 in 2017, about 74 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income in rent, a smaller share than in 2009. For those renters with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000, 61 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income in rent, rising from about 50 percent in 2009. Meanwhile, a significant number of Americans go without housing altogether, sleeping instead on the streets or in homeless shelters. Just over half a million people were homeless on a given night in January 2018, with 35 percent of those found in unsheltered locations not intended for human habitation, such as sidewalks and public parks (HUD 2018). Research has linked higher rents to higher rates of homelessness (e.g., Quigley 2001; Corinth 2017; Hanratty 2017; Nisar et al. 2019). The growing housing affordability problem is not driven by falling incomes (with the exception of the Great Recession, which led to severe hous - ing problems, including widespread foreclosures; see Steffen et al. 2013). Since 2000, real median (posttax, posttransfer) household income increased by 20 250-840_text_.pdf 279 2/7/20 3:46 PM276| Chapter 8percent (CBO 2019). Real income gains were even larger for the bottom fifth of households (CBO 2019). The driver of growing unaffordability is rising home prices. According to the Standard & Poor's / Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, real home prices have increased by 49 percent since 2000, outpac - ing real median income gains. Home prices have increased the fastest for entry-level homes\u2014according to the American Enterprise Institute National Home Price Appreciation Index, home prices in the lowest price tier have increased more than 50 percent more than home prices in the highest price tier since 2012 (Pinto and Peter 2019). As shown in box 8-1, the housing affordability problem is concentrated in a selected number of areas in the United States, where the people who build houses are unable to afford them. Although home prices are rising, home construction has been slow to respond, implying that supply is not keeping up with the demand for homes in certain places. Home construction per capita has declined every decade since the 1970s, according to the Census Bureau. While an average of 8.2 homes were built for every 1,000 residents between 1970 and 1979, annual average con - struction fell to 3.0 homes per 1,000 residents between 2010 and 2018. Across States, there is large variation in housing construction. For example, from 2010 to 2018, Texas built 5.2 homes and Florida built 4.3 homes per 1,000 residents, on average. Meanwhile, over the same period, California built 2.0 homes and New York built 1.7 homes per 1,000 residents. This represents a large decline for California, which built more than 7.0 homes per 1,000 residents in the 1970s and 1980s before falling to less than 4.0 per 1,000 residents in every decade since then. Meanwhile, New York is one of only two States in the country (along 2009 2017 (percent) (percent) Less than $75,000 to $99,999 6.8 10.3 3.5 51.3 $100,000 or 61.8 All renter households47.7 46.0 -1.7 -3.6Table 8-1.

Measuring the Housing Affordability Problem with the Carpenter Index One way to assess the affordability of housing is to ask whether the people who build homes can afford to buy them. The American Enterprise Institute's Carpenter Index compares the average income of households headed by carpenters to home prices in a given area. If the price of a home is less than three times the carpenter's household income, then that home is deemed \"affordable.\" For each metropolitan area, the index calculates the share of entry-level homes that are affordable to the carpenter. Figure 8-i shows the share of the entry-level housing stock that is affordable for the 100 largest CBSAs, with the darker shades illustrating areas where housing is less affordable to the average carpenter. The aver - age carpenter can afford only 6.5 percent of entry-level homes built in the San Diego-Carlsbad, California, CBSA; 8.2 percent in the Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, California, CBSA; 10.3 percent in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, California, CBSA; 10.7 percent in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California, CBSA; and 11.8 percent in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California, CBSA\u2014the five least affordable areas in the country. By contrast, the average carpenter can afford 100 percent of entry-level homes in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin, CBSA; the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, CBSA; the Saint Louis, Missouri-Illinois, CBSA; Figure 8-i. The Carpenter Index by CBSA, 2018 Sou rce: American Enterprise Institute. Note: 281 2/7/20 3:46 PM278| Chapter 8with West Virginia) that has never built more than 3.0 homes per 1,000 resi - dents in an average year across every decade since the 1970s. The Role of Overregulation in the Housing Affordability Problem When the housing affordability problem is defined as housing expenditures that constitute a sufficiently large share of income, there are three potential causes: (1) rising home prices, (2) falling household incomes, and (3) choices among households to consume higher-quality homes (with either high physical quality or in closer proximity to desirable amenities). As reported in the previ - ous section, real home prices have risen 49 percent since 2000. Meanwhile, household incomes are rising rather than falling, and consumer decisions to choose higher-quality homes should not be considered an affordability prob - lem. Thus, the fundamental problem with housing affordability in the United States today is excessively high home prices in certain areas. Overly stringent housing regulations play a key role in driving up home prices in the face of growing demand. Figure 8-2 shows how excessive regula- tory barriers to building housing in some areas constrain supply and thus increase home prices. In a market unconstrained by excessive regulation, developers can build new homes at a constant cost when demand shifts out - ward (for example, because higher wages increase the desirability of living in an area), and thus, price remains constant at P 1 while quantity increases to Q2. By contrast, new home construction cannot keep up with growing demand in a market constrained by excessive regulations, such as lengthy permitting pro-cesses and unreasonable land use regulations. Excessive regulations lead to an upward sloping, relatively more inelastic housing supply curve, which drives home prices above the cost to produce a home in a market without excessive regulatory barriers. Prices rise to P 2 and quantity falls to Q1. In this way, Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) note that excessive regulation that drives home prices above production costs acts as a \"regulatory tax\" on housing. This regulatory tax is represented in figure 8-2 as the gap between P 1 and P2. Some regulations add additional costs to the development process, driv - ing up the total cost of housing development and reducing supply. For example, environmental reviews can delay construction, imposing additional costs on developers. An unintended consequence of these regulations is that housing is and a number of other areas in the Midwest. The index signals that the most expensive metropolitan areas are located in California and to a lesser extent the rest of the West Coast and the Northeast, while most of the affordable metropolitan areas are located in the Midwest. 250-840_text_.pdf 282 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |279instead built in less central areas where regulations do less to drive up home prices, which can increase commuting times and ultimately cause even greater environmental harm. More generally, approval processes for new develop - ment can be lengthy and uncertain, thus increasing the price and reducing the supply of housing by, for example, forcing developers to carry high-cost construction loans for a longer period of time, or having to spend additional money on extending options to purchase land. Gyourko, Hartley, and Krimmel (2019) formulate an Approval Delay Index and find that the review time for housing construction projects is more than twice as long in highly regulated areas compared with relatively lightly regulated areas, with an average review time of 8.4 months. Environmental reviews alone can add substantial costs to a housing project. For example, the California Environmental Quality Act, which requires certain construction in California to undergo an environmental impact assessment, can add an estimated $1 million in costs to completing a housing development (Jackson 2018). Other regulations that can potentially constrain supply are focused explicitly on reducing density. Building permit caps, population caps, and density restrictions limit the amount of new housing that can be built in an area. Similarly, urban growth boundaries prevent urban expansion beyond designated areas. Other kinds of regulations reduce density by regulating the type and size of housing that can be constructed in a locality. Minimum lot size Figure 8-2. The Effect of Regulation on Supply and Demand for Housing Q0 Q1 Q2 Supply (deregulated) Demand (new) Demand (old) Supply (regulated) Price Quantity P2 P1 Sources: Glaeser prevent homebuilders from subdividing a lot in order to build more homes. Height restrictions prevent taller buildings with more floors and more housing units. Maximum floor area ratios (which are calculated by divid - ing floor area by lot area) limit the amount of living space, potentially across multiple units, that can be built on a given lot. Zoning regulations also may prevent certain types of housing, such as multifamily buildings, from being constructed. Of course, when these types of regulations are not excessive, they can be beneficial\u2014for example, by maintaining standards that promote safety, or by providing information about housing characteristics\u2014without significantly constraining supply. In addition, certain types of land use may generate pol-lution or congestion externalities, and some amount of regulation, such as impact fees, can help developers internalize these costs of construction. Local citizens may also wish to preserve certain land for public use or conservation purposes, such as parks. However, in a selected number of places, excessive regulations prevent supply from expanding to meet housing demand, substan - tially driving up home prices. It is generally believed among economists that the overall effect of excessive regulatory barriers that constrain housing supply is to reduce overall well-being. For example, Albouy and Ehrlich (2018, 117) not only find that stringent housing regulation increases home prices, but also that any benefits of these regulations for improving quality of life are outweighed by their cost. They note: \"On net, the typical land-use regulation in the United States reduces well-being by making housing production less efficient and housing consump - tion less affordable.\" Glaeser and Gyourko (2018, 14) summarize the literature and state: \"Empirical investigations of the local costs and benefits of restricting building generally conclude that the negative externalities are not nearly large enough to justify the costs of regulation.\" The stringency of housing regulations and their impact on housing sup - ply vary across the country. One way to measure the stringency of regulations is to analyze the regulations themselves. One measure that is heavily relied upon is the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index. Gyourko, Saiz, and Summers (2008) constructed the index from a national survey of municipalities regarding their regulatory process and land use regulations. The resulting index is shown by metropolitan statistical area in figure 8-3, with a darker shade of blue indicating cities that have more stringent land use regulations. The South and the Midwest have the least restrictive regulations, while California and the Northeast have the most. Areas with higher regulatory burdens tend to have higher home prices. Figure 8-4 shows metropolitan areas by the ratio of their median home prices to the cost to produce a home, as constructed by Glaeser and Gyourko (2018). Where regulations are lax, the ratio of home prices to production costs should be near or below 1. Where regulations are more stringent and demand is strong, 250-840_text_.pdf 284 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |281Figure 8-3. Wharton Land Use Index by Metropolitan Statistical Area, 2008 Source: Gyourko, Saiz, and Summers (2008). Figure 8-4. Ratio of Home Prices to Production Costs by CBSA, 2013 Sources: Glaeser a 2/7/20 3:46 PM282| Chapter 8ratios may exceed 1. It is important to note that production costs include not only the construction cost of the home but also a normal profit margin and a small cost of land on which to build the home that would be achieved in a market without overly stringent regulations. It is certainly the case that, even in an unconstrained market, land prices for a fixed size plot (i.e., an acre) of land will be higher in more desirable loca - tions. Davis and others (2019) document large variation in land prices per acre across the United States\u2014much of this variation would remain even if all areas relaxed overly stringent housing regulations. However, the price of a parcel of land used for each housing unit may be similar across areas absent excessive regulation. In dense areas, each housing unit would require a smaller plot of land, and so, though the price of an acre of land is likely to be higher in denser areas, the cost of the smaller piece of land used for each two-bedroom hous - ing unit may be similar to the cost of the larger piece of land used for a two-bedroom unit in less dense areas. Of course, this will only roughly be true, and other factors, such as differences in property taxes, may drive some remaining differences. Partly for this reason, Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) focus on areas where home prices significantly exceed production costs. Figure 8-4 shows that the places where ratios of home price to produc - tion cost significantly exceed 1 (i.e., where home prices are at least 25 percent higher than home production costs) are largely the same places with high regulatory indices. Though correlational, this provides suggestive evidence that housing regulations help determine home prices. Figure 8-4 also indicates that excessive regulation is currently a major problem in a selected number of places, indicated by the darker shade of blue. As noted earlier in this chapter, these 11 metropolitan areas include San Francisco, Honolulu, Oxnard, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington, Boston, Denver, New York City, Seattle, and Baltimore. Examples of overly burdensome regulations abound in these 11 CBSAs. Four of the 11 are located in California, where multifamily homes may be built on less than a quarter of the land in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Anaheim, and San Diego and less than half of the land in San Francisco and Oakland (Mawhorter and Reid 2018). In the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego, two parking spaces are required for every typical two-bedroom apartment, one and a half parking spaces are required for every typical one-bedroom apartment, and one parking space is required for every studio apartment, increasing costs for multifamily housing developers and, ultimately, renters (San Francisco eliminated its park - ing requirements in early 2019). Across Hawaii, only 4 percent of land may be developed due to its network of local and State zoning regulations. Although overly burdensome permitting processes and other barriers may still be a problem and put some degree of upward pressure on home prices in the rest of the country, the major problem with excessive regulation is currently limited to these 11 areas. Nonetheless, future demand growth in 250-840_text_.pdf 286 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |283additional areas with excessive regulatory barriers could increase the number of areas with artificially inflated home prices. Consistent with figures 8-3 and 8-4, a number of academic studies find that stringent regulation increases housing prices. In a review of much of the earlier literature, Ihlanfeldt (2004) concludes that growth controls and mini-mum lot size restrictions reduce the supply of housing and increase its price. Quigley and Raphael (2005) find that cities in California with more stringent regulations have higher levels and growth in home prices and rents, and that housing supply is much less responsive to price increases in more regulated areas. Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) argue that land-use restrictions explain why prices for high-rise apartments in Manhattan far exceed the cost to construct them. Ihlanfeldt (2007) finds that more stringent land-use regula - tion increases home prices in Florida. Glaeser and Ward (2009) find that more stringent regulations, especially minimum lot sizes, are associated with higher home prices and less construction in Massachusetts. Saiz (2010) finds that land-use regulations, in addition to geographical constraints, are important determinants of the responsiveness of housing supply to price increases. Summarizing the literature, Glaeser and Gyourko (2018, 8) state: \"The general conclusion of existing research is that local land use regulation reduces the elasticity of housing supply, and that this results in a smaller stock of housing, higher house prices, greater volatility of house prices, and less volatility of new construction.\" Some might argue that there are reasons other than regulation that might be driving higher home prices. One reason could be that construction costs are rising. However, Gyourko and Molloy (2015) find that real construction costs (including the cost of labor and materials) remained relatively constant from 1980 to 2013. Another potential cause is geographical constraints on build - ing. For example, Saiz (2010) argues that many areas with supply constraints have steep-sloped terrain that prevents the development of new housing. Nonetheless, even in areas that appear to have land constraints, developers could build more densely and with fewer permitting delays, which would exert downward pressure on housing prices. Finally, though we focus on supply, housing regulations may also increase prices through increased demand for housing if land use restrictions increase the appeal of living in a certain com-munity. Empirically, however, Albouy and Ehrlich (2018) find that supply effects dominate demand effects. Consequences of Overregulation of Housing The overregulation of housing markets in selected metropolitan areas has several negative consequences. By increasing home prices well above home production costs, it increases the cost of attaining homeownership and increases the rent for renter households. It hurts low-income Americans in 250-840_text_.pdf 287 2/7/20 3:46 PM284| Chapter 8particular by increasing homelessness and by reducing the number of people government housing assistance programs can serve. More generally, it reduces labor mobility across areas and thus weakens economic growth, reduces the ability of children to access high-opportunity neighborhoods, and harms the environment. The Increased Cost of Attaining Homeownership and Higher Rents In most areas in the United States, reasonable regulations do not substantially drive up home prices. But in a selected number of metropolitan areas, exces - sive regulatory barriers to building housing substantially increase the price of purchasing a home above the cost to produce it. Figure 8-5 shows the extent to which excessive regulations drive up home prices in these 11 metropolitan areas, according to data published by Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) and shown above in figure 8-4. Home prices are more than 150 percent higher in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California, CBSA, and the Urban Honolulu, Hawaii, CBSA; are about 100 percent higher in the Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, California, CBSA; the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, California, CBSA; and the San Diego-Carlsbad, California, CBSA\u2014and are 36 percent higher in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Maryland, CBSA, the smallest price premium of the 11 supply-constrained metropolitan areas. The higher home prices resulting from excessive regulations make it more difficult for households to purchase their own homes and build wealth. As HUD Secretary Ben Carson recently stated, \"As a result [of the shortage in the housing supply], Americans have fewer housing opportunities, including the opportunity to achieve sustainable homeownership, which is the No. 1 builder of wealth for most U.S. families\" (Carson 2019). Excessive regulation also increases rents in these 11 metropolitan areas, because higher home prices increase the amount property owners need to receive in revenue each year to maintain a normal profit margin. Higher rents are especially burdensome for lower- and moderate-income Americans\u2014and, for some, may make it prohibi - tively expensive to live in these excessively regulated areas. Increased Homelessness Another harmful effect of overregulation of housing markets is its impact on homelessness. Several studies that rely on data on homelessness over time in various communities find that a 1 percent increase in rent is associated with about a 1 percent increase in homelessness. Because housing regula - tions generally drive up rents, they should thus be expected to also increase homelessness. The CEA (2019) estimates the extent to which removing excessive regula - tory barriers that reduced home prices to their production costs would reduce 250-840_text_.pdf 288 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing Regulation Percent Sources: Glaeser and Gyourko Homelessness by CBSA from Deregulating Housing Markets Reduction in homelessness (percent) Sources: Departme nt of Housing and Urban Development, Point-in-Time Co unts, 2 018; Census core-based statistical area. Each continuum of care is merged into the metropolitan area where the majority of its overall population lives. Th is simulation assumes that deregulation reduces the ratio of home value to production cost to 1 for all metropolitan areas with a ratio of at least 1.25; see the text for further deta ils about the simulation. 250-840_text_.pdf 289 2/7/20 3:46 PM286| Chapter 8homelessness. The results are summarized in figure 8-6. Homelessness would fall by 54 percent in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, California, CBSA; by 50 percent in the Urban Honolulu, Hawaii, CBSA; by 40 percent in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, California, CBSA; by 38 percent in the San Diego-Carlsbad, California, CBSA; by 36 percent in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Virginia-Maryland-West Virginia, CBSA; and by between 19 and 26 percent in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire, CBSA; the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Washington, CBSA; and the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Maryland, CBSA. The aggregate reduction in homelessness in these 11 metropolitan areas, which contain 42 percent of the U.S. homeless population, would have important effects for the United States as a whole, with total U.S. homeless - ness falling by just under 72,000 people, or 13 percent. These findings are also broadly consistent with results from Raphael (2010), who uses a different methodology to assess how housing market regulation drives up homelessness rates. Using an index of housing market regulation by metropolitan area, he finds that deregulation could reduce overall United States homelessness by 7 to 22 percent. He does not show how homelessness reductions would vary across specific areas. It is important to note that the housing supply responses resulting from deregulation would take many years to translate into the types of price reductions, and thus homelessness reductions, shown here. Still, these results suggest that the severe homelessness problems in a selected number of metropolitan areas are substantially driven by city-created regulations on housing. Fewer People Are Served by Housing Assistance Programs By driving up rents, overly stringent housing regulations in selected met - ropolitan areas increase the government's cost of providing rental housing assistance, resulting in fewer assisted families. The Federal Government provides rental housing assistance across a number of programs that are administered by different agencies. Three major programs are administered by HUD\u2014these include (1) Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, (2) Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, and (3) public housing. The largest of these three HUD programs is the Housing Choice Voucher program, which served 2.3 million families at a cost of $23 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2019 (42 percent of the overall HUD budget). Under the voucher program, qualified tenants receive Federal subsidies that cover a portion of their rent in private rental apartments of their choosing. The second-largest HUD program is Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, which served 1.2 million families at a cost of $12 billion in FY 2019. Under Project-Based Rental Assistance, apartment owners receive government subsidies to lease units to low-income families. The third-largest 250-840_text_.pdf 290 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |287HUD program is public housing, which served 1.0 million families in FY 2019, at a Federal operating cost of $7 billion (excluding the opportunity cost of holding the property). Public housing is built and managed by government authori - ties. Unlike with Housing Choice Vouchers, tenants living in units covered by Project-Based Rental Assistance and in public housing do not maintain their subsidy if they move. Eligibility for these programs is based on a family's income relative to median income in their area. However, only about one in four eligible families actually receives assistance, because housing costs are too high to serve every family that meets the income requirements for the programs, especially in high-cost areas. For example, the maximum payment standard for a three-bed - room unit is more than $4,500 per month in San Francisco County, California, compared with about $1,500 per month in Harris County, Texas. Many areas have waiting lists for assistance that extend multiple years, and in some cases, waiting lists are not reopened for long periods of time. Housing deregulation that removes excessive barriers and reduces mar - ket rents could extend assistance to many eligible families not currently being served in expensive markets. Under each of the three major HUD programs, the government generally covers the difference between 30 percent of a house - hold's adjusted income and the allowable rent or operating cost for housing units. For the voucher program, if market rents decrease, Public Housing Authorities would pay less for contract rent, assuming the tenants' payments remain mostly constant at 30 percent of adjusted income. HUD would also need to pay private property owners less to house people under Project-Based Rental Assistance. These savings from deregulation could be used to serve additional families under current funding amounts. Removing excessive regulatory barriers could also improve the effective - ness of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), a program that subsi-dizes the developers of affordable housing units. The Federal Government is estimated to spend about $9 billion per year on LIHTC (JCT 2017). Given the budgetary restrictions on how much can be spent on this program, excessive housing regulation increases the costs of building subsidized housing and reduces the amount of it that can built. Weakened Labor Mobility and Economic Growth Aside from its specific harm to low-income Americans, excessive regulation in selected housing markets also has negative consequences for the general pop - ulation. One important example is the reduction in labor mobility across areas because higher home prices in certain areas reduce the incentive to move to places where wages may be higher. This reduces the productivity of workers and shrinks aggregate economic output. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) estimate that reducing housing regulations in New York City, San Jose, and San Francisco to that of the median U.S. city would have substantially increased growth from 250-840_text_.pdf 291 2/7/20 3:46 PM288| Chapter 81964 to 2009, leading to 3.7 percent higher gross domestic product in 2009. Hsieh and Moretti argue that this missing growth is the result of spatial misal - location of workers, as high-productivity cities construct barriers to increasing housing supply to meet demand from workers. Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) find that restrictive land use regulations reduce national output by a smaller but still important 2 percent. Herkenhoff and others (2018) similarly find significant economic growth effects from relaxing land use restrictions. Reducing labor mobility has important regional effects in addition to aggregate ones. When home prices are higher due to overregulation, workers are less able to migrate to areas with higher wages. This results in a persistent gap in wages between high-productivity and low-productivity areas that can - not be reduced through migration that would expand the supply of workers in high-wage areas. Zabel (2012) finds that housing prices increase more in response to an increase in labor demand in cities with an inelastic housing supply than in those with a more elastic housing supply, thus reducing the incentive for in-migration to areas with an inelastic housing supply. Saks (2008) similarly finds that more heavily regulated housing markets are less responsive to changes in demand for housing, lowering employment growth in areas with relatively more extensive land use regulations. Saks estimated that the employment response to an increase in labor demand in an area in the 75th percentile of her State regulatory index is 11 percentage points smaller than the response in an area in the 25th percentile. Ganong and Shoag (2017) find that higher home prices resulting from stringent land use regulation can help explain why disparities between eco-nomic regions have grown since 1980, breaking from the previous pattern of regional economic convergence. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and B\u00f6ckerman (2004) examine migration in Finland and come to a similar conclusion as Ganong and Shoag: high housing prices discourage in-migration. Even within cities, high levels of land use regulations can increase socio - economic segregation. Owens (2019) examines segregation between neighbor - hoods, between places (municipalities, cities, and towns), and between cities and their suburbs and finds that most housing segregation occurs between neighborhoods, rather than between places or between cities and their sub-urbs, which suggests that zoning regulations could play an important role. Rothwell and Massey (2010) find that restrictive zoning laws lead to greater socioeconomic segregation and reduce interaction between the poor and the affluent. Lens and Monkkonen (2016) find that land-use regulation and income segregation are positively related, with density restrictions leading to a con - centration of more affluent households, although not necessarily a concentra - tion of poor households. 250-840_text_.pdf 292 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |289Reduced Opportunity for Children Overregulation of housing markets can also potentially reduce the ability of children to access neighborhoods that advance opportunity. A series of papers by Raj Chetty and his colleagues have identified neighborhoods that are most likely to improve long-term outcomes of children. A child that moves from a neighborhood at the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of the opportunity index increases his or her lifetime earnings by $206,000. Chetty and others (2018) calculate the \"cost of opportunity,\" and find that an additional $1,000 in children's future annual income costs $190 each year for rent for every year of childhood. The cost of opportunity varies considerably across the United States, however, and much of the variance is due to differences in land use regulatory regimes. An additional $1,000 in future annual income for a child costs only $47 in Wichita but $260 in Boston or Baltimore. Thus, relaxing exces - sive regulatory barriers to building housing could reduce the cost for families of accessing higher-opportunity neighborhoods for their children and potentially improve their long-term prospects. Similarly, a report from the U.S. Senate Joint Economic Committee finds that U.S. zip codes with the highest-quality public elementary schools have a median home price that is four times as large as those zip codes with the lowest-quality public schools (JEC 2019). Many of these areas have highly restrictive zoning. Although expanded school choice weakens the association between home prices and the quality of public schools, housing deregulation could potentially promote greater access to high-quality schools for students (JEC 2019). Increased Traffic Congestion and Harm to the Environment Finally, excessive regulatory barriers to building housing in certain areas increases commuting times and traffic congestion because sufficient housing cannot be built near where people work. The average commuter spent 54 hours sitting in traffic in 2017, up from 20 hours in 1982 (Schrank, Eisele, and Lomax 2019). The aggregate travel delay increased from 1.8 billion hours to 8.8 billion hours during this period, and the total cost associated with congestion rose from $15 billion to $179 billion. As a result of this rise in average commuting times, an extra 3.3 billion gallons of fuel were consumed, increasing carbon emissions and harming the environment. Moreover, as Glaeser notes, \"when environmentalists resist new construction in their dense but environmentally friendly cities, they inadver - tently ensure that it will take place somewhere else\u2014somewhere with higher carbon emissions\" (Glaeser 2009). Indeed, Glaeser (2009) finds that households in urban areas emit less carbon than those in the suburbs, even after adjusting for differences in climate and environmental regulation across these areas. Factors contributing to fewer emissions in cities include smaller housing units and that people are less likely to drive or would drive shorter distances than 250-840_text_.pdf 293 2/7/20 3:46 PM290| Chapter 8Box 8-2. Poor Substitutes for Regulatory Reform Policymakers have proposed a litany of policies aside from regulatory reform to lower rents or incentivize affordable housing construction in high-cost areas. However, these proposals alone\u2014such as rent control, increases in rental housing assistance, and so-called inclusionary zoning\u2014are unlikely to have their intended effects on rents or construction, and in some cases may be counterproductive. Rent controls, or policies that limit rent increases for certain rental units, are sometimes offered as a means of addressing high housing costs. Though existing tenants in rent-controlled units may benefit from smaller rent increases, supply is reduced for new potential tenants and the incentive for developers to build more units is diminished. There are few issues where economists are in as much as agreement as they are regarding the outcomes of rent control. In a 2012 University of Chicago Booth poll of economists across the political spectrum, 95 percent disagreed that rent control ordi - nances, such as those imposed in New York and San Francisco, had boosted affordable housing or improved the quality of rental units (IGM 2012). The economists' consensus is supported not only by economic theory but also by the empirical literature. In a recent paper examining the effect of a 1994 rent control law on housing supply and prices in San Francisco, Diamond, McQuade, and Qian (2019) find that the law had the opposite of its intended effect on rents. While those living in rent-controlled units benefit from lower rents, and remain in these units longer than they would without rent control, those who do not have access to these units are substantially harmed in the long run. Landlords responded to the law by converting exist - ing buildings into condominiums and by taking other steps to avoid being subject to rent control laws. This lowered the supply of rental housing by 15 percent and incentivized the creation of housing that served the preferences of high-income households. As a result, this rent control law likely raised rents in the long run rather than lowering them. Moreover, even existing tenants who benefit from rent control may suffer from unintended consequences. Jiang (2019) finds that rent control increases unemployment among ten-ants in New York City, potentially because they can sustain longer bouts of joblessness given their lower housing costs, or because tenants are tied to a particular housing unit and restrict their job search to opportunities nearby. Expansions of government housing programs to combat rising rents are also unlikely to provide much relief to the general population of residents in supply-constrained areas. When the supply of housing is inelastic, expanding demand by increasing government subsidies increases prices rather than quantities. As a result, government rental subsidies to low income-renters will likely increase rents in markets with overly restrictive housing regulations. Eriksen and Ross (2015) find that housing vouchers increased rents for hous-ing within 20 percent of the Fair Market Rent threshold in supply-constrained communities. They estimate that a 10 percent increase in the number of 250-840_text_.pdf 294 2/7/20 3:46 PMExpanding Affordable Housing |291they would if they lived in the suburbs. As discussed in box 8-2, regulatory reform\u2014rather than rent control, expansion of government programs, or inclu- sionary zoning\u2014offers the most effective solution to the problems posed by high housing costs and overregulation. Conclusion How to increase housing affordability through regulatory reform is an issue that has garnered bipartisan attention in recent years. In this chapter, we have focused on excessive regulations that substantially drive up home prices in a selected number of metropolitan areas. Relaxing these regulations would greatly benefit Americans, especially those with lower incomes, by reducing the cost of attaining homeownership and reducing rents in supply-constrained areas. Falling rents resulting from relaxing excessive regulations would reduce homelessness by 31 percent on average in these areas, and more families could be served by Federal rental housing assistance programs. Broader ben - efits would include increased economic growth, reduced regional disparities, expanded opportunities for children, and a cleaner environment. We have also emphasized that addressing the problem of overregulation with more regulation would be counterproductive. Rent control can increase housing prices by reducing the incentive for developers to build new housing. Similarly, expanded government subsidies for housing do not solve the prob - lem of overregulation. When housing supply is constrained, housing subsidies for tenants may increase market rents without increasing the quantity of hous - ing, counteracting the goals of these programs.vouchers increased rents by 0.39 percent for these units. LIHTC, a program that subsidizes developers of below market-rate rental housing units, may also be ineffective at addressing the underlying supply problem according to some evidence. Eriksen and Rosenthal (2010) find that new LIHTC develop - ment largely crowds out private development, leaving total housing supply unchanged. Glaeser and Gyourko (2008) note that the credit tends to increase the profits of subsidized builders, while pushing unsubsidized builders out of the housing market. Regulations that require a certain share of housing units to be set aside for low-income residents, often referred to as \"inclusionary zoning,\" also fail to solve the affordable housing problem. For example, Schuetz, Meltzer, and Been (2011) find that inclusionary zoning can increase home prices and in some cases reduce housing development. Hamilton (2019), in a study of Washington and Baltimore, similarly finds that inclusionary zoning increases prices. 250-840_text_.pdf 295 2/7/20 3:46 PM292| Chapter 8The Trump Administration has taken steps to address onerous housing regulations. President Trump issued an Executive Order in 2019 to establish the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, which is tasked with reviewing housing regulations at all levels of government and submitting a report to the President in 2020 with recommendations on how to ameliorate these excessive regulatory burdens. HUD has also taken action under the Trump Administration to counter regulatory barriers to building affordable housing. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, which was finalized during the previous Administration, is being revised to focus more clearly on increasing housing supply in areas where supply is constrained. This rule recognizes that increasing housing choice for disadvantaged groups requires taking on regulatory barriers that place housing in large swaths of specific areas out of reach for lower-income families. 250-840_text_.pdf 296 2/7/20 The Outlook for a Continued Expansion As this Report has shown, under the Trump Administration, economic growth and the labor market gains it enables have exceeded pre-2017 expectations. The U.S. economy's performance has withstood strong headwinds from a weak global economy and several idiosyncratic domestic shocks, as pro-growth poli - cies have kept the U.S. economy resilient. By increasing competition, productivity, and wages, and reducing the prices of consumer goods and services, the Administration's approach to regulation is raising real incomes while maintaining regulatory protections for workers, public health, safety, and the environment. Specifically, the Administration's approach to eliminating excessive regulation of energy markets supports further unleashing of the country's abundant human and energy resources. Furthermore, the Administration's healthcare reforms are building a system that delivers high-quality care at affordable prices through greater choice and competition. Across the board, this pro-growth agenda has disproportionately benefited those previously left behind during the current expansion. To further expand the economy and extend the longest expansion in U.S. his - tory, additional policy issues may need to be addressed. This challenge is why the Trump Administration remains focused on promoting competitive markets, combating the opioid crisis, promoting affordable housing, enacting a compre - hensive infrastructure plan, rendering the individual provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, updating the U.S. immigration system, continu - ing deregulatory actions, improving trade agreements and international trade 250-840_text_.pdf 299 2/7/20 3:46 PM296| Chapter 9practices, and incentivizing higher labor force participation through additional labor market reforms. Overall, assuming full implementation of the Trump Administration's economic policy agenda, we project real U.S. economic output to grow at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent over the budget window from 2019 to 2030. During that time, inflation is expected to settle at a 2.0 percent fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter rate, and the unemployment rate is expected to remain at or below an annual average rate of 4.0 percent. Relative to the current-law baseline projection, we estimate that full policy implementation of the Administration's economic agenda would cumulatively raise output by 4.3 percent over this budget window. The first three years of the Trump Administration show that long-lamented structural trends that were constraining potential growth in the United States are not policy-invariant. The right pro-growth policies attract greater invest - ment, encourage more people to enter the labor market, and lead to higher wages from businesses investing in and competing for workers. Even with recent success, there is ample room for the U.S. economy to expand, especially if the Administration's approach to international trade produces results that are greater than expected. Since 1975, the Council of Economic Advisers, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, has published a long-run forecast for the U.S. economy that assumes full enactment and implementation of the Administration's eco-nomic policy agenda. This reflects the Council's mandate, as stipulated in the Employment Act of 1946, to set forth in the Economic Report of the President \"current and foreseeable trends in the levels of employment, production, and purchasing power,\" and a program for carrying out the objective of \"creat - ing and maintaining . . . conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities, including self-employment, for those able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\" Since 1996, execution of this mandate has involved provid - ing an 11-year, policy-inclusive economic forecast. 250-840_text_.pdf 300 2/7/20 3:46 PMThe Outlook for a Continued Expansion |297Because of this charge, the Administration's forecast is historically unique from other long-run economic forecasts, both official and private. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, publishes a current-law forecast, which assumes no change in economic policy (CBO 2019). The Blue Chip panel of professional private sector forecasters often reveals substantial het-erogeneity in expectations, reflecting both different estimates of economic potential under current law, as well as objective and subjective estimations of the probability of policy implementation. Although the assumptions underly - ing projections of the Federal Open Market Committee are ambiguous, those forecasts presumably also reflect committee members' differing views both on potential growth under current law, as well as potential growth under possible future law. To better distinguish the estimated effects of the Administration's eco - nomic policy objectives\u2014the results of which may be contingent on legislative support and other factors\u2014from current-law projections, beginning with the 2018 Economic Report of the President and continuing through this Report, we have decomposed this forecast into a current-law baseline and intermediate and top lines that reflect estimated growth effects discussed in this Report, as well as in the 2018 and 2019 Reports and the President's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget. We then build up to our top-line, policy-inclusive forecast by suc - cessively adding to the current-law baseline the estimated effects of future deregulatory actions, immigration reform, additional labor market reforms to incentivize higher labor force participation, rendering the individual provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent, additional fiscal policy propos - als, including the Administration's infrastructure plan, and improved trade deals with international trading partners. The top-line forecast constitutes the Administration's official \"Troika\" forecast of the Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Treasury. For com - parison, we also report a pre-policy baseline consisting of the Congressional Budget Office's 2019-27 projection made in August 2016, extended by its August 2019 current-law projection. GDP Growth during the Next Three Years As illustrated in figure 9-1 and reported in the third column (\"real GDP\") of table 9-1, the Administration anticipates economic growth to rise in 2020 from its projected 2019 pace of 2.5 percent, and to remain at or above 3.0 percent through 2022, assuming full implementation of the economic agenda detailed in this Report, its two predecessors, and the President's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget. We expect near-term growth to be supported by the continuing effects of the TCJA, as well as new measures to promote increased labor force par - ticipation, deregulatory actions, immigration reform, reciprocal trade deals, 250-840_text_.pdf 301 2/7/20 3:46 PM298| Chapter 9and an infrastructure program, which we assume will commence in 2020 with observable effects on output beginning in 2021. The Administration also expects the labor market to continue to exhibit strength in the near term, with the civilian unemployment rate remaining below 4.0 percent through 2022, as reported in the sixth column, \"unemploy - ment rate,\" of table 9-1. Despite low unemployment, inflation is expected to remain low and close to the Federal Reserve Board's 2.0 percent target for the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index. The Administration expects broad inflation beyond 2019 to remain stable at 2.0 percent through 2022, as shown in the fourth column (\"GDP price index\") of table 9-1. GDP Growth over the Longer Term As discussed in the 2018 and 2019 volumes of the Economic Report of the President, over the longer term, the Administration's current-law baseline forecast is for output growth to moderate as the capital-to-output ratio asymp-totically approaches a higher steady state level in response to corporate tax reform, and as the near-term effects of the TCJA's individual provisions on the rate of growth dissipate into a permanent level effect. As reflected by our inter-mediate forecast, we expect the latter moderation would be partially offset in \u00020\".\u0001\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0010\u0001f*- a Continued Expansion |2992026 and 2027 if the individual provisions of the TCJA\u2014currently legislated to expire on December 31, 2025\u2014were instead made permanent. The Administration's full policy-inclusive forecast is reported as the green line in figure 9-1. In addition to successful implementation of the President's infrastructure plan and extension of the individual provisions of the TCJA, this forecast assumes full achievement of the Administration's agenda with respect to deregulation, immigration, improved trade agreements, fiscal consolida-tion, and labor market policies designed to incentivize higher labor force par - ticipation. The latter includes expanding work requirements for nondisabled, working-age welfare recipients in noncash welfare programs; increasing child - care assistance for low-income families; and enhancing assistance for reskilling programs through the National Council for the American Worker. Though we anticipate growth moderating toward the end of the budget window, to 2.8 percent on average between 2019 and 2030, the policy-inclusive forecast is for output to grow at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent. Relative to the current-law baseline, we estimate that full policy implementation would cumulatively raise the level of output by 4.3 percent over the budget window. Reflecting moderating growth in the latter half of the budget window, the Administration expects unemployment to converge to 4.0 percent, \u0001 $''.\u0001+ Market Committee's December 2019 \"Summary of Economic Projections,\" which reports a range of participant estimates from 3.9 to 4.3 percent (Federal Reserve 2019). The unemployment rate rising to 4.0 percent is also expected to maintain a rate of inflation of 2.0 percent, as measured by the GDP chained price index (see the fourth column of table 9-1). As shown in table 9-2, the Administration anticipates that the primary contributor to increased growth through 2029 will be higher output per hour worked. During much of the current expansion, U.S. labor productivity growth was disappointing by historical standards, partly due to low contributions of capital deepening. By substantially raising the capital stock and consequent flows of capital services, attracting increased net capital inflows\u2014including investment both by foreign firms and overseas affiliates of U.S. multinational enterprises\u2014and facilitating efficient capital reallocation from mature firms to more dynamic enterprises, we expect enactment of corporate tax reform to considerably increase capital per worker, and thus labor productivity. Already, during the first seven quarters since the TCJA was enacted, labor productiv - ity growth in the nonfarm business sector rose substantially relative to Continued Expansion |301pre-TCJA, postrecession average, as reported in chapter 1 of this Report. If fully implemented, we also expect the Administration's labor market reforms to partially offset the effects of demographic-related trends in labor force partici - pation, as reflected in line 2 of table 9-2. Upside and Downside Forecast Risks Since the Administration's forecast is a policy-inclusive one, a key downside risk is the political contingency of full implementation of the President's economic agenda, particularly in light of the inherent unpredictability of the legislative process. In addition, by definition the policy-inclusive fore-cast assumes that the Administration's policies will be implemented and remain in place throughout the forecast window. In scenarios where future Administrations or Congress partially or fully reverse the TCJA, otherwise raise taxes, or significantly expand the Federal regulatory state, economic growth would be lower or even negative. For example, the 2019 Economic Report of the President estimated that \"Medicare for All\" bills then discussed in Congress would reduce real GDP by about 9 percent in the long run if financed by taxes on labor income, while recent proposals to introduce a top marginal income tax rate of 70 percent on personal income over $10 million would lower the long-run level of GDP by 0.2 percent. As observed in the 2019 Report and discussed in chapter 1 of this Report, a sharp slowdown in the global economy also poses a significant downside risk to the outlook, through both direct and indirect channels. In particular, continued or worsening weakness in other advanced economies\u2014particularly Germany and Italy, but also Europe more broadly, in the event of Brexit-related disruptions\u2014would have an adverse impact on U.S. growth through both a direct export channel and indirect exchange rate, financial market, and sup - ply chain channels. A significant growth slowdown in the People's Republic of China, similar to that observed in the years 2015-16, would also introduce substantial risks to the outlooks for advanced economies, including the United States. High public debt levels in several advanced and emerging economies may generate economic headwinds, while high corporate debt levels in the United States could act as an accelerant to potential adverse financial shocks. Idiosyncratic shocks also pose risks to the outlook. In 2019, these included but were not limited to production cuts at Boeing\u2014whose produc - tion accounts for 0.23 percent of U.S. GDP\u2014a partial government shutdown in the first quarter, and industrial action at General Motors. As this Report was being finalized, Boeing announced plans to halt production of the 737 MAX, a development that could subtract 0.5 percent from annualized real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020. Perhaps the single biggest upside risk to the outlook is that the Administration's more robust approach to international trade achieves 250-840_text_.pdf 305 2/7/20 3:46 PM302| Chapter 9greater-than-expected success in its pursuit of freer, fairer trade, with zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, and zero subsidies. Recent research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Cadot, Gourdon, and van Tongeren 2018; Lamprecht and Miroudot 2018; OECD 2018) finds that lowering international tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as reducing international restrictiveness on trade in services, would substantially raise U.S. and global trade and output. With investment in intellectual property products now accounting for about one-third of U.S. private nonresidential fixed invest - ment, trade agreements that enhance international protection of intellectual property\u2014such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and Phase I of U.S.-China negotiations\u2014could also elevate the level of innovation and productivity growth. Additional upside risks to the forecast include, first, higher net capital inflows due to international capital mobility exceeding estimates, which would attenuate the potential crowding out of private fixed investment in response to individual tax reform and public infrastructure investment. Second, academic studies demonstrating that individual marginal income tax rates may have differential effects across the age distribution suggest that estimated trends in labor force participation may overstate the growth-detracting effect of demography. Third, insofar as the growth estimates presented in this Report and its predecessor have been derived from standard neoclassical growth models, they may omit the positive externalities and spillover effects captured by endogenous growth models, such as that of Ehrlich, Li, and Liu (2017). Tax reform that incentivizes investment in human capital, regulatory reform that eliminates prohibitive barriers to entry for more innovative and entrepre - neurial firms, and health investments and labor market policies that facilitate human capital accumulation may, therefore, yield higher-growth dividends than those estimated here. 250-840_text_.pdf 306 2/7/20 3:46 PM303x References Chapter Redding, and D.

Governed by a Chairman, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate, the Council has two additional Members who are also appointed by the President. The Chairman of the Council On June 28, 2019, Kevin A. Hassett resigned as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. In accordance with the Employment Act of 1946, the duties and responsibilities of the Chairman have been subsequently executed by Tomas J. Philipson, who has served as a Member of the Council since 2017 and was appointed Vice Chairman on July 24, 2019. The Members of the Council Tomas J. Philipson is the Vice Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and in this capacity serves as acting Chairman. He is on leave from the University of Chicago, and has been a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers since his appointment in 2017. Previously, he served in the George W. Bush Administration, among other public sector positions. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has been a visiting faculty member at Yale University and a visiting senior fellow at the World Bank. He previously served as a fellow, board member, or associate with a number of other organizations, including the University of Chicago, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the American Enterprise Institute, the Manhattan Institute, the Heartland Institute, the Milken Institute, the RAND Corporation, and the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics. Tyler Beck Goodspeed is a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers, having previously served as Chief Economist for Macroeconomic Policy and Senior Economist for Macroeconomics. Before joining the CEA, he was a member of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Oxford and was a 250-840_text_.pdf 353 2/7/20 3:46 PM350| Appendix Alecturer in economics at King's College London.

His research has appeared in three full-length monographs from academic publishers, as well as numerous articles in peer-reviewed and edited journals. He received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University; and he received his M.Phil from the University of Cambridge, where he was a Gates Scholar. He is a current member of the American Economic Association, and was previously a member of the Economic History Association, Economic History Society, and Royal Economic Society, as well as an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. Areas of Activity Macroeconomic Policies Throughout 2019, fulfilling its mandate from the Employment Act of 1946, the Council continued \"to gather timely and authoritative information concerning economic developments and economic trends, both current and prospec - tive. \" The Council appraises the President and the White House staff of new economic data and their significance on an ongoing basis. As core products of the Council, these regular appraisals include written memoranda. The Council also prepares in-depth briefings on certain topics, as well as public reports that address macroeconomic issues. One of the Council's public reports this year addressed the economic effects of Federal deregulation. According to the report, this historic reduction in costly Federal regulation will raise real household incomes by a large enough magnitude to have macroeconomic implications. On employment and the labor market, the Council actively disseminated analyses to the public. One report addressed the effectiveness of public job-training programs in improving participants' labor market outcomes. Another report showed that economic growth is more effective in lifting Americans out of poverty than expanded government assistance programs. The Council also released a report on how lower market costs for childcare could affect parents' labor force participation. Reports on employment policies complement the Council's regular blog posts on new releases of labor market data. The Council also released a report that shows U.S. energy innovation, epitomized by the shale revolution in oil and natural gas production, increases household incomes by lowering consumers' energy costs. Furthermore, the report highlighted how the shale revolution led the United States to experience a greater decline in energy-related emissions than European Union countries. Working alongside the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget, the Council participates in the \"troika\" process that 250-840_text_.pdf 354 2/7/20 3:46 PMActivities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2019 |351generates the macroeconomic forecasts that underlie the Administration's budget proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the acting Chairman and the Members, continued to initiate and lead this forecasting process. The acting Chairman and Members maintained the Council's tradition of meeting regularly with the Chairman and Members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to exchange views on the economy. Microeconomic Policies The Council participated in discussions, internal to the Federal Government as well as external, on a range of issues in microeconomic policy. Publication topics included healthcare deregulation, vaccines, prescription drug pricing, the opioid crisis, and homelessness. On healthcare, the Council published a paper on the Trump Administration's policies to expand healthcare choice and competition. This paper finds that these policy changes\u2014including reducing the individual mandate penalty; permitting more association health plans; and expanding short-term, limited-duration insurance plans\u2014will keep costs down for consumers and taxpayers. The Council also released a report that estimates the potentially large health and economic losses associated with influenza pandemics and discusses policy options to increase vaccine innovation and moderate pandemics' risk. Additionally, the Council published a paper that shows average prescrip - tion drug prices are falling because of improved Food and Drug Administration policies that, if continued, will benefit patients by further lowering drug prices. The Council also released a report on how lower prices and easier access to opioids exacerbated the crisis's growth, which finally shows signs of leveling off. Another Council report documents the state of homelessness in America. This report finds that the Administration's actions to reduce regulatory barriers in the housing market, combat the drug crisis, expand mental illness treat - ment, improve the chances of people leaving prison, promote self-sufficiency, support effective policing, and increase incomes for people at the bottom of the distribution will address the root causes of homelessness. International Economics The Council participated in the analysis of numerous issues in the area of international economics. The Council engages with a number of international organizations. The Council is a leading participant in the activities of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a forum for facili - tating economic coordination and cooperation among the world's high-income countries. Council Members and Council staff have also engaged with the orga - nization's working-party meetings on a range of issues and shaped its agenda. 250-840_text_.pdf 355 2/7/20 3:46 PM352| Appendix AIn addition, the Council analyzed a number of proposals and scenarios in the area of international trade and investment. These included generating estimates of the benefits, as well as any trade-offs, of prospective trade agree - ments as well as revisions to existing agreements. The Council continues to actively monitor the U.S. international trade and investment position and to engage with emerging issues in international economics, such as malicious cyber activity. The Council looks forward to continuing to analyze the United States' international economic position. 250-840_text_.pdf 356 2/7/20 3:46 PMActivities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2019 |353The Staff of the Council of Economic Advisers Executive to the Council and Chief Energy Economist Anna W.

Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP), the chained (2012) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate. The Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar estimates prior to 2002, except for selected series. Because of the method used for seasonal adjustment, the sum or average of seasonally adjusted monthly values generally will not equal annual totals based on unadjusted values. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars. Symbols used: p Preliminary. ... Not available (also, not applicable). NSA Not seasonally adjusted.
