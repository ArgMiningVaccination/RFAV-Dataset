CAM refers to treatments that can be used in addition to or as an alternative to western medical care conducted by physicians, doctors of osteopathy, and allied health professionals. Wounded, ill, or injured service members may elect to explore CAM options as research shows various methods may provide relief from pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia, reduction in nausea and vomiting, and improved mood and quality of life through function and fitness.1-3 CAM should always be discussed and coordinated with your health care provider prior to use. Health care providers should also regularly ask their patients about the use of CAM to improve health and healing. We have dedicated this section of the website to the top CAM methods and others that may be of special interest for our wounded, ill, or injured service members.
