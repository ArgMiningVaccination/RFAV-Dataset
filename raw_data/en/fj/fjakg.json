It is not intended to be a textbook or research publication. Rather, it is a general-interest book about public health that shouldappeal to students in any health-related field, as well aspublic health professionals and others with a keen interestin this field. At the same time, I hope, in a very personalway,that this book will engage those with little knowledge of the field to learn more about it. I know that a book canchange a life's direction, as I myself entered public healthafter a book awakened my curiosity about the preventionand control of infectious diseases. Readers will note that we have listed all sources by chapter at the end of the book rather than annotating each fact asit appears in the body of the text.This conscious decisionon our part should make the book more readable whileallowing those who would like to pursue particular topicsto find useful references. Milestones in Public Health is the third in a series of books published by Pfizer Inc's Public Health Group.These booksare a part of our ongoing commitment to public awarenessand understanding of the field of public health. As with our previous publications - Advancing Healthy Populations: The Pfizer Guide to Careers in Public Health andThe Faces of Public Health -this book represents the collective efforts of many individuals who have dedicated countless hours to its development and production.

References 238Milestones .Prologue Prologue Public health is the art and science of protecting and improving the health of a community through an organ-ized and systematic effort that includes education, assuranceof the provision of health services and protection of thepublic from exposures that will cause harm. In other words,public health is what we as a society do collectively toassure the conditions in which people can be healthy. Inorder to effectively address challenges to people's health,public health practice requires an organized and sustainedpopulation-based approach. Milestones in Public Health portrays public health as the vital, critical field it is today in the United States. Eachchapter in the book celebrates an acknowledged milestoneof public health, exploring first its historical developments,followed by an in-depth case study of the milestone and avignette that illustrates another facet of the milestone, andconcluding with a look ahead.The \"Looking Ahead\" sec-tion predicts advances yet to come in each of the broadareas of public health where milestones occurred, andacknowledges the paramount issue of preparedness nowfacing the public health community.The \"Looking Ahead\" sections may also explore issues of particular concern tothe public health community - such as asthma or obesityin young people - that have yet to be fully resolved oreradicated. What are these milestones? In keeping with the list of ten acknowledged milestones in public health that have beenidentified by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, they are advances in addiction, automotive safety, can-cer, cardiovascular disease, environmental and occupationalhealth, food safety, infectious disease control, maternal and child health, oral health, and vaccines.T o bring it alltogether, the concluding chapter explores how the devel-opment of the public health infrastructure in the UnitedStates has contributed greatly to advances in public health,serving as a model for the world. The milestones identified in this book signify the most significant achievements in public health from the last 12 Milestones .Prologue century. As you read the chapters, the long, rich history of public health should come to life.Through the historicaldevelopments, case studies and vignettes, your insights intothe many successes of public health and the challenges thatwere overcome should deepen.T oo often we fail to appre- ciate the way public health, so basic to the overall health of Americans, improves our daily lives. Public health worksbest when its successes are hidden, forestalling crises beforethe public grows alarmed.This book seeks to shed light onthe underappreciated achievements of public health and to lay claim, in the open, to its vital work. It is time to celebrate public health. Milestones in Public Health also seeks to reinforce a core trait of public health, namely that success redefines thechallenge.Whether with cancer, infectious diseases, oralhealth, vaccines, or a host of other areas, advances yet tocome owe their possibility to the hard, focused work ofpublic health professionals today and in preceding decades.For example, in the chapter on vaccines, we learn that global eradication of smallpox finally succeeded in 1977only after an intense, years-long effort led by the WorldHealth Organization in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.Currently, public health professionals are overseeing anintense worldwide effort to eradicate polio. Once they succeed, other debilitating diseases will become targets, andthe hard work of global eradication will continue.Witheach succeeding battle, refinements in the particular skillsand techniques of public health will allow millions more of the world's people to benefit from advances that havebenefited the people of the United States. Another example of how success redefines the challenge comes from the chapter on oral health. Each community in the United States that has fluoridated its water supplydemonstrates a reduction in the rate of dental caries in itsyoung population.Y et, despite compelling evidence, the process of fluoridating the nation's water supply is far fromcomplete. Even as public health experts gather and sharestatistics that demonstrate the good of a particular mile-stone, the challenge never dissipates. Each case study and vignette in this book examines in depth the complexities of public health, highlighting howeach milestone contributed so remarkably to the health of the American public. Furthermore, the lessons learnedfrom these contributions promise to benefit the world'spopulation. For example, in the chapter on infectious disease control, the public health response to the AIDSpandemic, which was first identified in 1981, demonstratestruly astounding progress against a disease that was at firstalways fatal and is now often a treatable, chronic condition.Despite this progress, however, the public health communi-ty still confronts the threat of a continuing AIDS pandem-ic, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and the cold truths ofno vaccine, no cure, and no inexpensive treatment thera-pies. As with the global eradication of smallpox, progress in fighting an epidemic - whether it is AIDS, dental caries,or polio, in one country or in one county - redefines thechallenge. Always, new aspects of epidemics and new popu-lations around the world await the vital work of the publichealth community. David Satcher, MD, PhD ,former U.S.Surgeon General and current Interim President of the MorehouseSchool of Medicine in Atlanta,observes,\"It is certainly true thatpublic health always faces new chal-lenges. However, embedded withinthese challenges are also new oppor-tunities. It is clear that the focus ofHealthy People 2010 on the quality of life and on the targeting of disparities in health amongdifferent racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, repre-sents both new challenges and new opportunities for public health. Public health is challenged to improve com-munication and to become more visible while developing new partnerships with and in the communities.Throughthese partnerships, the opportunity to better impact the all-important social determinants of health is real andtremendous.\" The fact that public health is often invisible to the society it serves does not mean that its successes need to be hid-den.Milestones in Public Health seeks to highlight how pub- lic health is at the core of our nation's progress and devel-opment and, at the same time, at the center of every family 34 and community. Milestones in Public Health celebrates inno- vative solutions to public health challenges and the people and institutions that have implemented them.We hope thisbook will inspire new generations to become public healthprofessionals and to hold in their hands the privilege andresponsibility of building new milestones in public health.5 Ring around the rosy / A pocket full of posies / Ashes, ashes / We all fall down!\" Who isn't familiar with this childhood song? Many people might be surprised that this verse from the 1600s refers toan outbreak of the plague that devastated much of westernEurope. Humans are still vulnerable to infectious diseasesthat through history have run rampant and killed vast numbers of people.The plague and smallpox did just that through much of the Dark and Middle Ages. New virusessuch as HIV and SARS threaten humans in this century.The development of vaccines, therefore, is one of man's greatest achievements.Vaccines protect people from fatal diseases, increase life expectancy and spare countless millions from pain and suffering. The word vaccine comes from \"vaca,\" Latin for cow. In 1796 in Gloucestershire, England, Dr. Edward Jenner Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines.Looking Back Chapter 1 Vaccines and the Eradication of Smallpox Looking Back Dr. Edward Jenner inoculating a childwith vaccinia virustaken from a cow. 5 the first vaccine for smallpox. Jenner used mate- rial from a skin pustule which contained live vaccinia virus ,a virus believed to be spread by cows to milkmaids, causingcowpox. Milkmaids who contracted cowpox, a mild diseasein humans, seemed to be immune to smallpox, a virulentdisease in humans. Jenner inoculated 24 children with thevaccinia virus and, like the milkmaids, they became immune to smallpox. Despite its success, the smallpox vaccine neverbecame widespread enough to fully control the diseaseuntil late in the 20th century. It was especially problematicin the tropics, where suspensions could not be kept coolenough to be effective. In 1895, Louis Pasteur developed the second vaccine, this one for rabies, a groundbreaking achievement. As the firstexample of a pathogen being altered for a therapeutic purpose, Pasteur's success opened the door to the field of immunobiology.That same year, Emil von Behring ofMarburg University in Germany introduced the diphtheriavaccine.Three other vaccines - for typhoid, cholera and plague - were also developed late in the 19th century, buttheir use was not widespread at the beginning of the 20thcentury.T oo many impoverished countries had no publichealth infrastructure, and the costs of vaccine distributionwere prohibitive. Although smallpox was still widely prevalent in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, it was by nomeans the only infectious disease to affect the Americanpopulation. In 1920, for example, 469,924 cases of measlesresulted in 7,575 deaths.That same year, nearly 148,000 diphtheria cases resulted in more than 13,000 deaths and107,473 pertussis cases resulted in more than 5,000 deaths. The development of the polio vaccine in 1955 had a radical impact on the use of vaccines in the United States.Parents were eager to protect their children from the \"iron lung\" disease, and Congress appropriated funds to inoculate school children with the polio vaccine.The U.S. government then began a major push to promote the use of vaccines. Today, most Americans don't think twice about vaccination. Children routinely undergo a series of vaccinations from birth through early childhood.These include vaccinationsagainst diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles,mumps, rubella, chicken pox and Haemophilus influenzaeMilestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Looking Back 6 Louis Pasteur 1955 polio vaccination.type b (Hib). Some of these vaccines - measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), for example - have been combinedand can be administered in one dose. What exactly is a vaccine, and how is it made? A vaccine is formally defined as \"a preparation of killed,weakened, or fully infectious microbes that is given to produce or increase immunity to a particular disease.\"It can be given as an injection or in a form that can be swallowed (such as the polio vaccine).Vaccine researchers are inventing other means of safely and effectively delivering vaccines, such as nasal sprays. Vaccines fall into three broad categories: /rhombus6Live (Attenuated) Vaccine.This type of vaccine uses a live, although weakened, version of the virus; it usuallyprovides lifelong immunity to the recipient. Measles,mumps and rubella vaccines are examples of the live vaccine type. /rhombus6Killed (Inactivated) Vaccine.This vaccine uses a pathogen exposed to Formalin, a chemical that kills its genetic material, leaving just its shell.This form of vaccination usually requires several injections.The typhoid and Hib vaccines are examples.7 Child being inoculated today. Child with the red blotchy pattern of measles. Child with mumps before vaccine wasintroduced in 1967./rhombus6Toxoid Vaccine.This type of vaccine uses protein toxins that have been secreted by pathogenic bacteria but areinactivated.These vaccines also require several injec-tions; diphtheria and tetanus vaccines are examples. Since 1900, vaccines have been developed and licensed against 21 other diseases, with ten limited to selected populations at high risk according to residence, age,medical condition or risk behaviors. At the start of the 21st century, the vaccine-delivery system in the UnitedStates has evolved into a collaboration of all levels of government (federal, state, local) and public and privatehealth care providers.The system continues to harness the latest technological advances.Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Looking Back 8SmallpoxThe story of vaccines begins with smallpox. Over thousands of years, hundreds of millions of people contracted the disease.The mummified body of PharaohRamesses V of Egypt, who died in 1157 BC, shows a pustular rash, the earliest physical evidence of smallpox.During the next thousand years, traders carried the dis-ease from Egypt to India, and from there it swept intoChina. It reached Japan by the 6th century and Europe by the 11th century, spread by returning crusaders. In the 20th century alone, an estimated 300 million people arebelieved to have died from it.Although smallpox wasdeclared eradicated in 1980, the threat that it might bedistributed by a terrorist has created fear. Smallpox was particularly contagious and deadly in populations exposed for the first time to explorers fromEurope. It paved the way for Spanish conquests in LatinAmerica. Historians say that smallpox made theSpanish conquest of Mexico possible when Cort\u00e9s and his conquistadors unintentionally introduced it to the Aztec population in T echotitlan in 1520. Smallpox ravaged theAztecs, who had no natural immunity. Cort\u00e9s and his menthen proceeded to conquer a vastly weakened Aztecempire. During the French and Indian War, Lord JeffreyAmherst deliberately infected blankets with smallpox anddistributed them to Indians outside Fort Ticonderoga, thefirst known example of germ warfare. Smallpox affects only humans.Transmission occurs when the variola virus (an orthopoxvirus ) is inhaled in droplets or aerosols from the respiratory tract.Transmission alsooccurs through contact with skin lesions of infectedpatients or their bedding or clothing.The incubationperiod lasts seven to 17 days, with an average of 12 days.The disease presents first with fever for two to four days,followed by a rash lasting for weeks.The rash evolvesslowly from papules to vesicles, then pustules and finallyscabs, all at the same stage in any one area.TransmissionMilestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Case Study Case Study Eradication of Smallpox Historians say that smallpoxmade the Spanishconquest 1520.9Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines.Case Study occurs mainly during the rash phase and diminishes as the lesions scab. Historically, about 50 percent of unvaccinatedfamily members became infected.The mortality rate was 20 percent to 30 percent in unvaccinated populations, butmany survivors were left with severe scarring and somewith blindness. Noting that survivors enjoyed lifelong immunity from any recurrence of the disease, physicians in China and India in the 10th century began to experiment with inoculation.In a process called variolation ,these physicians introduced pus from smallpox pustules on infected people into non-infected people. Usually, the person who was inoculatedwould develop only a few pustules and a fever. However, in up to two percent of the cases, a virulent or aggressiveform of the disease developed, causing death. Nonetheless,the odds were great that an inoculated person would sur-vive and, thereafter, enjoy lifelong immunity.The idea ofvariolation spread to Europe. In a famous case in 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a smallpox survivorleft with unsightly pockmarks, learned of variolation while her husband was posted to Constantinople as the Britishambassador. She inoculated her children and persuadedthe Princess of Wales to do the same. In fact, EdwardJenner, the discoverer of the smallpox vaccine, had been so inoculated. In 1796, Dr. Jenner vaccinated 24 children with pus he had extracted from a milkmaid's cowpox pustule. First,he experimented with James Phipps, an eight-year-oldboy, by introducing the cowpox strain through a cut inthe arm.After purposely exposing the young boy tosmallpox, Jenner followed the boy's status closely and concluded that the introduced vaccinia virus conferred immunity from smallpox. Next, Jenner inoculated his own 11-month-old son with the same result.The cowpox vaccine proved effective with all 24 children, conferring lifelong immu nity from smallpox. By today's standards, Jenner's experiments on human subjects would not be considered ethical. Fortunately, the fact that his cowpox vaccine worked is not in dispute, and his discovery would protect millions of lives in Wales to do the same.10Smallpox continued to appear in outbreaks throughout the world into the 20th century. In fact, a deadly smallpoxoutbreak in the United States between 1900 and 1904caused an average of 48,164 cases in each of those years and resulted in an average of 1,528 deaths annually. Due to improved tracking and containment, outbreaks of thesevere form of the disease (variola major) ended abruptly in 1929 in the U.S.; outbreaks of variola minor ,the milder form, declined in the 1940s with the last U.S. case report-ed in 1949. One scare in New Y ork City in 1947 resulted in the city vaccinating more than six million residents.AMexican businessman who traveled by bus to the city,unaware that he was incubating smallpox, spread the disease to 12 people, two of whom died, including him. Fearing the worst in the densely populated city, health authorities took no chances and ordered the mass vacci-nation, which took place within one month at hundredsof stations in hospitals, police stations and firehouses. A resolution proposed by a delegate from the former USSR at the 11th World Health Assembly in 1958 and New Yorkers line up for inoculation in 1947.11Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines.Case Study passed by the assembly in 1959 paved the way for a worldwide effort to eradicate smallpox. In 1966 at the 19th World Health Assembly, the World HealthOrganization (WHO) called upon all the world's govern- ments to support and give financial backing to a newlycreated Global Smallpox Eradication Campaign. Why did smallpox, of all diseases, become a candidate for worldwide eradication? An important reason was that it remained a powerful killer throughout the world. In the year prior to the start of the WHO eradication program, an estimated 15 million people contracted the disease andan estimated two million people died from it. Smallpoxlent itself to the possibility of complete eradication forother reasons as well. /rhombus6Only humans are hosts; no animal reservoir exists, so smallpox cannot jump from animals to humans. /rhombus6A prompt antibody response allows exposed people to be protected. /rhombus6The vaccine is very inexpensive, easy to administer, does not require refrigeration, and provides long-term protection. /rhombus6Smallpox has no subclinical infection, or hidden carrier state, to contend with.The disease is alwaysovert and can, therefore, be traced and contained. The Global Smallpox Eradication Campaign became a worldwide public health program like no other.The WHO chose Donald Ainslie (D.A.) Henderson to headthe campaign. He moved to Geneva, Switzerland, fromAtlanta, where he had headed the CDC's InfectiousDiseases Surveillance Unit. D.A. Henderson was born in 1928 in Ohio, attended Oberlin College, and graduated from the University ofRochester's medical school. Immediately after, he joinedthe Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) at CDC and con-tinued his career there. His work in containing variousinfectious diseases in the United States and in hot spotsthroughout the world had earned him internationalacclaim. He pioneered improved methods for disease control that emphasized better reporting of infectious World Health Organization inGeneva. D.A. Henderson12diseases so that control measures could begin sooner to control the diseases.This became the most importantstrategy in smallpox eradication - surveillance to detectcases as early as possible and vaccination of all contacts of patients by specialized teams so that the outbreakwould not spread. In 1967, the campaign got under way using D.A. Henderson's methods.The WHO worked with healthworkers in all the infected countries to form surveillance teams ready to track down smallpox outbreaks and armedwith \"recognition cards\" that explained the disease simply.As the number of smallpox cases decreased, the teamsoffered rewards to encourage reporting.The earliest successes came in western and central Africa. Smallpoxturned out to spread less readily than had previously beenthought, and the world began to understand thatprompt detection and containment could lead to theeradication of the disease.Although the western Africancountries reporting endemic cases at the beginning of thecampaign were among the poorest in the world and hadheavy infection rates, all but one of them became free ofsmallpox within three years. Brazil recorded the last casein the Western Hemisphere in April 1971.Well-executederadication programs eliminated smallpox transmission inEast Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1970 and in Indonesiaand Afghanistan in 1972. In eastern and southern Africa,smallpox had been eliminated in all but three countries by the end of 1971. The introduction of potent, freeze-dried vaccine and the bifurcated needle had remarkable effects on smallpoxprevalence, even in countries where eradication programsstalled.The freeze-dried version solved the problem of the vaccine losing potency in the heat of the tropics.Thebifurcated needle, which was easy to transport, simplifiedadministering the vaccine. Unfortunately, setbacks did occur. In 1972, refugees returning to Bangladesh after its war for independence reintroduced the disease. In Botswana, introduction of the disease from South Africa created an epidemic, and The bifurcated needle, which simplified admin-istration of the vaccine.13 ...and the worldbegan to under-stand that andcontainmentcould lead to theeradication of thedisease.Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines.Case Study in Iran, Iraq and Syria, cases were imported, and epidemics occurred. However, by late 1973 outbreaks had been contained except in Bangladesh.That year, intensifiedcampaigns began in the five countries with remainingendemic cases - Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan andEthiopia. India alone reported 64 percent of the casesworldwide. By 1976, only Ethiopia remained with smallpox, and all attention turned to it.The milder strain, variola minor ,spread tenaciously across a vast, sparsely settled region made destitute by civil war.The last outbreak was finally contained in the Ogaden Desert in August 1976. However, an affected nomad population had already migrated into Somalia, and it was there that the lastknown outbreak occurred on October 26, 1977. In 1980, the WHO declared smallpox eradicated.The steps taken to get to that point illustrated how the surveil-lance and containment programs could be adapted toindividual countries to allow teams to succeed in very different populations.The combination of a persistent,coordinated international effort, spearheaded by theWHO, and innovative approaches at local levels led tosuccess. Lessons learned from the eradication campaign are relevant in the 21st century as the threat of weapon-ized smallpox forces the public health community to confront a scourge it hoped had been conquered. However, an affected nomadpopulation hadalready migratedinto Somalia, andit was there thatthe last knownoutbreak occurredon October 26,1977.14Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Vignette Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The story of the Hib vaccine demonstrates how the painstaking work of research scientists in their laboratories can have immediate andprofound impact on serious bacterial diseases in very young children.For years, serious infection with the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) had led to complications in infants and young childrenunder the age of five. Invasive Hib disease was the leading cause ofepiglotitis and bacterial meningitis in very young children. About fivepercent of children who developed Hib meningitis died; and in 35percent of the children who survived, serious complications occurred.These included neurological problems, such as seizures, deafness andmental retardation. A special vaccine would be needed to produceantibodies in very young, vulnerable children under the age of five,thereby immunizing them against the disease. An estimated 20,000cases of Hib disease occurred annually in the United States before the vaccine appeared. The Hib vaccine emerged from groundbreaking research in the 1960s by Porter Anderson, David Smith and Richard Insel at StrongMemorial Hospital of the University of Rochester.The first studytook place in Finland in 1975 with more than 100,000 infants andchildren vaccinated with a polysaccharide product, with mixedresults.While the trial vaccine worked in older children, it did not work in infants, whose immune systems failed to produce protective antibodies. In 1985, after further trial and error, the vaccine was made available as a polysaccharide-protein conjugate product for use in childrenaged 18-24 months. In 1987 after further development, the vaccinewas licensed for children aged 18 months, and in 1990 was finally licensed for children aged two months. By 1993, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention reported a remarkable 95 percentreduction in invasive Hib disease in the United States. In 1997, Merck & Co. introduced a combination vaccine - Hib and HepatitisB - that reduces the number of injections required in the first 18months of life from 15 to as few as 11. In 1998, only 125 cases ofHib disease among children less than five years of age were reported.In less than a decade, the Hib vaccine had nearly eliminated invasiveHib disease among very young children.Vignette Hib Vaccine15Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The need for new vaccines and new vaccine technologies has never been greater in light of the events of September11, 2001.Vaccines are likely to be the only practical meansof protection in the event that biological weapons of massdestruction are unleashed on an unsuspecting population.Weapons that use diseases to kill large numbers of people, that can be readily transmitted person to person - anthrax,smallpox, and plague being the foremost threats - call fornew types of second-generation vaccines to be developedand stockpiled. Currently, only small amounts of anthrax vaccine are pro- duced in the United States with use limited to those in themilitary. Planning is in progress, however, to produce largequantities of a more modern vaccine that could be used inthe general population in case of a serious threat or attack. In August 2003, D.A. Henderson, who now serves as a senior adviser at the Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Dean Emeritus at theBloomberg School of Public Health at Johns HopkinsUniversity, addressed the issue of preparedness to deal witha possible smallpox release.\"Preparedness is much betterthan it was at 9/11,\" he said.\"We have ample vaccine andneedles, a better-educated public health and medical com-munity, most hospitals have negative pressure examination rooms and some areas are prepared for large-scale vaccina- tion should that be necessary. In all, 700,000 in the militaryand some 40,000 civilian health workers have now beenvaccinated, far fewer in the civilian sector than we believe desirable.Work remains to done, but progress in movingtoward a full preparedness has been gratifying.\" In the United States, an estimated 11,000 births each day place stress on the vaccine-delivery system. Eachnewborn currently requires a series of between 15 and 19vaccine doses in the first 18 months of life. New combina- tion vaccines may reduce that number to 11, but as addi-tional vaccines are developed, the number of doses maywell rise again.

Adverse results, although rare, still occur, however, and surveillance to detect these events must continue, alongwith research into possible risk factors and their manage-ment. For each new vaccine program, an accompanyingpublic-information campaign is essential. Professional andadvocacy groups must be kept informed every step of theway,as must legislators, educators and the media. In 1998, an article in The Lancet suggested that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine might be linkedto increases in autism. As D.A. Henderson points out, how-ever,\"I, for one, am fully persuaded by several studies that demonstrate conclusively there is no relationship betweenMMR and autism.The problem: poor science in the firstplace and a press eager to publicize the spectacular.Regrettable.\" After the Lancet article, some parents refused the MMR vaccine for their children, and this eventuallyresulted in measles outbreaks that would have been pre- vented. Concerns over adverse events must be balanced with the knowledge that vaccines avert misery. Many agrandparent owes a long life not just to clean water, but also to remarkable advances in vaccines. Vaccineshave saved more lives than any surgical technique or anymedication, including antibiotics. Despite the success of smallpox eradication, many diseases that vaccines prevent still persist, especially in developingcountries. Polio, measles and rubella are still threats to millions of children and adults worldwide. According to the WHO, infectious diseases were the leading causes of death worldwide in 1996, with 17 million deaths annu-ally compared to ten million from heart disease and seven million from cancer. Even in the United States and otherindustrialized countries, infectious diseases caused 18 percent of deaths. The world has seen infectious diseases both old and new continue to emerge rather than decline as it enters the 21st century. Malaria has risen dramatically, thanks in part to resistant strains, as has gonorrhea, tuberculosis andtyphoid - diseases that had been previously controlled with standard antimicrobial therapy. Devastating diseasessuch as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS,Lyme, monkeypox, SARS and West Nile virus, have appeared suddenly. Until there are effective vaccines,these Vaccines have saved more livesthan any surgicaltechnique or any medication,including antibiotics.17unexpected diseases will continue to affect various populations around the world. Vaccines now in development to fight infectious diseases include vaccines against additional serotypes of pneumo-coccal and meningococcal infections, influenza, parain-fluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Anotherexciting area of research is therapeutic vaccines againstnoninfectious diseases, such as cancer. Experimental vac-cines to fight cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus and other cancers are currently being researched inclinical trials. Other promising vaccines in developmentinclude those to fight autoimmune diseases, gastric ulcers,and rheumatic heart disease as a result of Group A strepto-coccal infection.Trials are also under way for vaccines toprevent HIV infection, the cause of acquired immunodefi-ciency syndrome (AIDS). Hopeful developments maysoon make trials possible for vaccines to fight Alzheimer'sand breast cancer, two devastating diseases that affect largenumbers of people. The recent declaration by the WHO to eradicate polio globally by 2005 promises relief for a large part of theworld's population.While polio was eliminated from the Western Hemisphere through vaccination in 1991,the disease is still endemic in three countries of Asia andfour others in Africa, but all have mounted vaccinationcampaigns to stop the disease. By 2010, vaccines againstseveral types of meningitis, pneumonia, as well as rotavirus-caused diarrhea and human papilloma virus (the cause ofcervical cancer) should be introduced. In the future, vac-cines against AIDS, malaria and pulmonary tuberculosismay begin saving lives, and measles should be controlledthroughout the globe as well.Thanks to advances in vac-cine technology, infants may well be protected throughouttheir lives against many of the pathogens that threaten theirhealth today. Developments under way promise one day toprovide immunologic protection against conditions such as asthma, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. In the last quarter of the 20th century alone, new vaccine- delivery technology made rapid strides. Modern biotechnol-ogy gave rise to conjugate vaccines, live vector vaccines, new Hopeful develop- ments may soonmake trials possi-ble for vaccines breast cancer,two devastatingdiseases that affectlarge numbers ofpeople.Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Looking Ahead 18adjuvants, genome-based proteomic vaccines, DNA vaccines and recombinant strains. New delivery approaches haveincluded transgenic plants and transcutaneous immunization. As vaccines prevent diseases, it follows that the more people are vaccinated against preventable diseases, the more healthsystems can marshal resources to fight diseases that are notpreventable.This is why the invention of new vaccines and new technologies for vaccine deli very are so vital. Not only will health care systems be mor e successful at fighting dis- ease, the world's population will enjoy marked improve-ments in overall health.

Despite this looming threat, improvements in automotive safety have occurred throughout the 20th century and intothe 21st century. In 1901, Oldsmobile introduced the firstspeedometer, and in 1908, General Motors introduced thefirst electric headlamp. In 1924, GM opened the automo-bile industry's first proving-ground facility in Milford,Michigan and, over the years, improved dummies in crashtesting that helped narrow injury tolerances for humans.Chapter 2 Automotive Safety Looking BackMilestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Back 21 The first gasoline-powered automobile,built by Karl Benz in 1885. A 1924 pileup.In 1928, shatterproof glass on all vehicle windows was introduced; and two years later, tinted windshields to helpeliminate nighttime glare from oncoming headlamps wentinto volume production. Rear-turn signals became standardequipment on GM cars in 1939. Over the decades,these improvements and many more - such as seat beltsand air bags - have saved countless lives. In 1966, Congress passed the Highway Safety Act and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, authorizingthe federal government to set and regulate standards formotor vehicles and highways. Under the leadership of Dr.William Haddon, Jr., the first administrator of theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),these landmark acts introduced many changes in both vehicle and highway design. Car manufacturers were required to incorporate new safety features - headrests, energy-absorbing steering columns, shatter-resistant wind-shields and safety belts - and highway construction stan-dards were improved. Highways began to be built with better alerts to curves (reflectors and line stripes in thecenter and at the edge), improved lighting, barriers separat-ing oncoming traffic lanes and guardrails.The design oftraffic signs also improved, with break away features added to roadside signs and utility poles, especially on interstatehighways. By 1970, deaths caused by motor vehicles beganto decline both by the public health measure (deaths per100,000 population) and the traffic safety indicator (deathsper vehicle mile traveled, or VMT). Since the 1960s, NHTSA and the Federal Highway Administration within the U.S. Department of Trans-portation have provided national leadership to the auto-motive safety movement. Dr. Jeffrey Runge, an emergencyroom physician, currently heads NHTSA. A month before he took his post, Runge witnessed the aftereffects of a horrific car crash involving teenagers. Sarah Longstreet,known in her high school for her friendliness and churchactivities, had been belted in when a sport utility vehicle(or SUV) veered across the centerline and plowed over thehood of her smaller car. Although her air bag inflated justas it was meant to, the incompatibility in the design of thetwo cars caused her to die instantly, an unnecessary fatality.Sarah's death became a motivator for Runge in his new jobas he seeks ways to improve the design of SUVs and pickupMilestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Back Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking back22 Dr. Jeffrey Runge, NHTSA administratorfrom 2001 to 2005.Over the decades, these improve-ments and manymore - such asseat belts and airbags - have savedcountless lives.Breath analyzer ...nearly 43,000 people still dieannually on U.S.highways.23 trucks to eliminate design incompatibilities as a cause for traffic accidents. Since 1986, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has funded university-based centers for injury control which have pursued research on injurybiomechanics, epidemiology, prevention, acute care andrehabilitation. In 1992, CDC established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) tocontribute a public health direction to automotive safety as well as other injury areas. NCIPC targets the high-riskpopulations of alcohol-impaired drivers, young drivers, andpassengers and pedestrians in an effort to reduce fatalitiesin motor vehicle accidents. NCIPC advocates the use ofoccupant-protection systems including safety belts, child-safety seats and booster seats. NCIPC recognizes the role state and local governments play in enacting and enforcing laws that affect motor vehicle and highway safety, driver licensing and testing, vehicle inspections and traffic regulations. Nonetheless, federal guidelines influence these state and local decisions.The awarding of federal highway construction funds, forexample, allows the federal government to exert some control over the way localities enforce rules that are meant to improve highway safety. Although automotive safety in the United States is light-years ahead of the developing world, nearly 43,000people still die annually on U.S. highways. Since the early1990s, this number has gradually increased as the popula-tion has increased - i.e., the death rate has changed verylittle. Factors contributing to the toll include poor designof secondary roads, high speeds, drunken drivers, and toofew drivers and passengers wearing seat belts.The highestrates of traffic deaths are at ages 16-24 and 75 and older.Deaths linked to drinking have increased steadily since1999 despite social marketing campaigns and tougherenforcement designed to curb drinking and driving.Furthermore, some 19,000 individuals killed in crashes in 2002 were not wearing seat belts, with young menbetween the ages of 18 and 34 most at risk. The number of deaths from rollovers, which are caused in part by design flaws in SUVs, is an increasing concern. Infact, 59 percent of the overall increase in fatalities of motor-vehicle occupants came among passengers in pickups, vans and SUVs. Other risks for motor vehicle crashes are driv-ing while drowsy, especially among college students and theelderly, and excessive speed. Much more attention is nowbeing paid to the dangers of sleep-deprived drivers on thenation's roadways.T wo examples are the increased efforts to educate drivers about the need to stop and rest, oftenthrough roadside billboards, and the placement of \"wake-up\" bumps along road shoulders to minimize crashes. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), an advocacy organization formed in 1980 that now has 600 chapters,seeks to stop drunk driving by advocating for tough lawsand appropriate sentences. MADD seeks especially to edu-cate young people about the dangers and consequences ofunderage drinking, alcohol-related traffic crashes, alcohol poisoning, and other harms resulting from illegal drinking under the age of 21. MADD's message for teens is not to use alcohol. In addition to stopping drunk driving and underage drinking, MADD supports the victims of the violent crime of drunk driving. A group of out-raged women in California formed the organization after a repeat-offender drunk driver killed a teenage girl. Thanks, in part, to the efforts of MADD since its founding, more than 2,300 drunk-driving laws have beenenacted by state legislatures.These laws range from permis-sible levels of alcohol in drivers to sanctions against tavernowners who serve drivers who then cause traffic accidents. In 2004, more than 16,500 people died in alcohol-relatedtraffic crashes. In 2002, approximately 1.45 million driverswere arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.The blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08percent, more stringent than before and now in effect in Milestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Back 24 Thanks, in part, to the efforts ofMADD...morethan 2,300drunk-drivinglaws have beenenacted....all 50 states and Washington, D.C., accounts for some of this increase. In addition to the need to prevent drunk driving, another focus of automotive safety is immigrants who learn to theirsurprise that every state requires infants to be placed inchild seats. Often, they choose to do without seats becausethey think they are unaffordable, although a good safety seatcosts as little as $40 and some organizations have car seatloaner programs. A 1998 study done by the Johns HopkinsSchool of Public Health and the Insurance Institute forHighway Safety showed that Hispanic children between theages of five and 12 are 72 percent more likely to die in atraffic accident than non-Hispanic whites of the same age. In 2000, CDC found that the leading cause of death for Hispanics between the ages of one and 44 was motorvehicle accidents.The number of Hispanic children from newborn to age 19 killed in vehicle accidents in 2000jumped nearly 11 percent from the year before, to 1,115.Meanwhile, deaths among non-Hispanic white childrenactually fell by one percent during the same year. An important trend in recent years comes from the enactment of Graduated Driver Licensure (GDL) pro-grams to help reduce novice drivers' extremely high crash rates. GDL allows new drivers to face increasing challenges as they become more experienced. Between1996 and 2004, 40 states and Washington, D.C., enactedthree-stage GDL programs.The initial stage, requiringsupervision by an older driver, is followed by an inter-mediate stage that permits some unsupervised drivingwhile continuing to restrict nighttime driving and carry-ing passengers.The third stage is full licensure.These programs, especially those with more stringent require-ments, have been associated with significant reductions in crashes of teenage drivers. Among the many advances in traffic enforcement that have improved motor vehicle safety are radar detectors,speed cameras, red-light cameras and aerial surveillance.Traditional patrol car enforcement has its limits. About a third of motor vehicle deaths involve a single vehicle leaving the roadway and hitting a fixed object such as atree or utility pole. Primarily a rural problem, an increasingnumber of deaths are caused by roadside hazards.25 In 2000, CDC found that theleading cause of death forHispanicsbetween the agesof 1 and 44 wasmotor vehicleaccidents. A red-light camera photograph of a violator.Related to improvements in traffic enforcement are traffic courts. In 1943, when the United States lost more soldiersin traffic accidents than in combat, James Economos beganthe ABA Traffic Court Program. He established the firstcontinuing education program for judges and the firstapplication of computers to court administration. He alsoproposed the first anti-drunk driving law based on percent-ages of alcohol in the driver's blood and popularized theModel Rules Governing Procedure in Traffic Cases, whichhelped eliminate ticket-fixing. Ongoing improvements in automobile design also con- tribute to driver and passenger safety. Engines in some vehicles are mounted to drop down immediately upon impact, saving front seat passengers from having an enginedriven directly into them.Tires have been designed withinterior walls that absorb the worst effects of blowouts andallow a car to be pulled over safely to the side of the road.Daytime running lights, long required in Scandinavia withits limited daylight during winter months, have becomemore prevalent in the U.S. and have been shown to helpreduce traffic accidents, specifically when visibility is impaired by fog or smoke. Highway construction improvements have also been key to improving automotive safety. Evidence-based traffic engineering measures are designed to reduce pedestrianinjury and death by managing vehicle speed, separatingpedestrians from vehicles and increasing pedestrian visi-bility. Pedestrian deaths are primarily an urban problem andsignificant among the elderly; even with improving num-bers - pedestrian deaths per 100,000 decreased 51 percentMilestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Back A demonstration of automotive crumple zones in a crash test.26 Highway constructionimprovementshave also beenkey to improving automotive safety.27 Much progress in further reducingrisks remains to be realized,however.between 1975 and 2002 - they still account for 11 percent of motor vehicle deaths. Among the construction improve-ments that have led to safer highways are rumble strips that alert drowsy drivers they are leaving the roadway andreflective road markers that enhance visibility. Increased use of roundabouts in local road design has proved to reducetraffic accidents, as has the installation of more prominenttraffic signals and a greater number of streetlights. In summary, the strides made in automotive safety in the United States during the last century and the early years of the current century have significantly reduced deathsfrom traffic accidents. Much progress in furtherreducing risks remains to be realized, however.The challenge for car manufacturers, traffic safety engineers,ergonomists and legislators is to work together to developand implement new improvements that will help the U.S.break through the current plateau in the number of trafficfatalities.Case Study Development of Seat BeltsMilestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Case Study Volvo, a Swedish car manufacturer recognized by the industry for its innovations in automotive safety, led the way in the development of seat belts. Based on the wartime experience of airplane pilots,Volvo installed seat belts in cars it manufactured in Sweden starting in 1956, first just as an accessory but soon as a required feature because theevidence proved that seat belts saved lives. Car manufacturers in the United States, impressed by the evidence, soon followed Volvo and offered seat belts as an option. After several decades during which physicians urged car manufacturers to provide lap belts in new cars, the ColoradoState Medical Society led the way in 1953 by publishing apolicy supporting installation of lap belts in all automobiles.In 1954, the Sports Car Club of America required compet-ing drivers to wear lap belts, and the American MedicalAssociation House of Delegates voted to support their installation in all automobiles. In 1955, the California VehicleCode was amended to require state approval of seat beltsbefore their sale or use, and the Society of AutomotiveEngineers (SAE) appointed a Motor Vehicle Seat BeltCommittee. In addition, the National Safety Council,American College of Surgeons and the InternationalAssociation of Chiefs of Police all voted to support installation of seat belts in all automobiles. In 1956,Volvo introduced the two-point, cross-chest diagonal belt as an accessory, while Ford began a two-yearcampaign emphasizing safety with a heavy focus on seatbelts. Ford and Chrysler offered lap belts in front as anoption on some models. In 1957, the U.S. House ofRepresentatives Special Subcommittee on Traffic Safetyopened hearings on the effectiveness of seat belts in auto-mobiles, while Volvo refined its belt by providing anchors in front for their two-point diagonal belts. In 1958, Nils Bohlin of Volvo patented a three-point safety belt, replacing the single lap belt that risked injury toabdominal organs in high-speed crashes.Volvo also providedanchors for two-point diagonal belts in the rear. Bohlin,who died in 2002, may have saved as many as one millionlives with his invention. Before joining Volvo in 1958,28 An earlyY-type seat belt design. Nils BohlinBohlin designed ejection seats and pilot rescue systems for the Saab Aircraft Company. His three-point solution forautomobiles allowed occupants to buckle up with one hand,using one strap across the chest and another across the lap,with the buckle placed next to the hip. In 1959,Volvo introduced three-point belts in front as a standard in Sweden.The New Y ork State legislature consid-ered, but rejected, legislation requiring seat belts, as it didagain the next year. In 1961, however, New Y ork finallyenacted a law requiring that seat belt anchors be placed inthe front outboard seat positions, effective January 1, 1962.In the same year, the SAE issued standards for U.S. seat belts and Wisconsin also required seat belt anchors. In 1962,Virginia Trailways became the first U.S. bus company to install passenger safety belts. U.S. automobilemanufacturers began to provide seat belt anchors in the front outboard positions as standard equipment, and the ripple effect of U.S. states requiring them began, with six states enacting legislation. Meanwhile, the Association forAid to Crippled Children and the Consumers Union spon-sored a landmark conference on \"Passenger Car Design andHighway Safety\" with occupant protection the sole theme. In vehicles sold in the U.S. in 1963,Volvo introduced its three-point belt in front as standard.As well, several U.S. carmanufacturers began to provide lap belts in front outboardpositions. Meanwhile, 23 states now required seat belts infront, most enacting their laws to become effective onJanuary 1, 1964. Recognizing this trend toward seat belts, the U.S.Congress passed a law to encourage the Commerce Department to issue mandatory standards for seat belts soldin interstate commerce, which the Department accomplishedin 1965. Some U.S. manufacturers began to provide auto-matic-locking retractors (ALRs) in front seat belts. In 1966, the Sports Car Club of America required drivers in competitions to wear a shoulder harness as well as a lap belt.Meanwhile, in an effort to improve the safety features of seatbelts, Swedish regulators prohibited two-point cross-chestdiagonal seat belts at seats next to a door and the Y -type ofthree-point belt altogether. Laws requiring drivers and passengers to wear seat belts, first enacted in Victoria,Australia, in 1971, were not enacted in29Milestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Case Study the United States until 1984, when New Y ork became the first state with a seat belt use law.As Susan P . Baker, MPH,professor and head of the Center for Injury Research andPolicy at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, points out,\"Resistance to the use of seat belts endured for severaldecades, often based upon such misconceptions as 'beingthrown clear is better' (not realizing this could mean clear to eternity) and fear of being trapped by fire (even thoughbeing trapped by one's injuries was a far greater risk). Inaddition, as seat belt laws were considered, issues of personalfreedom inevitably entered the debate.\" Since 1984, however,all states except New Hampshire have passed such laws. In 1987, New Y ork State once again led the way in requiring large school buses to install two-point seat belts, althoughcompliance was left to individual school districts. Since then,most new seat belt laws in state legislatures concern restraintuse in school buses. In 1998 and 1999, NHTSA conducted a research project to develop the next generation of occu-pant protection systems for school buses.At present, mostschool bus seats are padded to reduce crash forces and donot have lap belts, which can contribute to head injuries if a lap belt restrains the pelvis while the head impacts the seatin front. According to a 2003 NHTSA survey, compliance in wearing seat belts has reached 79 percent, the highest level in thenation's history. In most states the laws cover front-seatoccupants only, but the laws in 18 states also cover passen-gers in rear seats. In some jurisdictions, however, occupantsin some vehicle classifications, usually pickups, are exemptfrom the law. Of the 49 states, only 21 allow law enforce-ment officers to stop drivers for failure to comply with themandatory seat belt laws; this \"primary enforcement\" hasbeen associated with greater seat belt use.The other statesrequire that officers first stop a vehicle for another reason before citing noncompliance with the mandatory seat beltlaw. However, all 50 states and the District of Columbia havechild restraint laws.These laws require that children travel inapproved child restraint devices, either car seats for youngchildren or booster seats or seat belts for older children. Ifseat belt use continues at 79 percent or higher, it is estimatedthat at least 15,000 lives will be saved in each future year.30 One of several seat belt promotion logos published by the NHTSA. NHTSA- recommendedchild safety seat.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic Seat belts by themselves are active restraint systems, meaning that motor vehicle occupants must consciously belt themselves in. Beltstherefore can save lives only when drivers and passengers use them.Air bags, on the other hand, are passive restraint systems, requiring no conscious decision on the part of a motor vehicle occupant.Assuming universal implementation of effective passive restraint sys-tems, air bags could save even more lives than active restraint systems. The first patent on air bag restraint systems was issued to John W . Hetrick in 1952, covering designs for safety cushions that wouldinflate automatically when a vehicle suddenly slowed. In 1964, CarlC.Clark reported on his work at the Martin Company on experi- ments that verified various air bag restraint designs and described their advantages and limitations. Some of the experiments involvedhim as the subject. Using pre-inflated designs, Clark's research was the first to demonstrate the potential benefits of air bag restraints. To actually inflate air bags prior to a crash requires a sensing device. Allen K. Breed founded Breed Corp. in 1961 and secured a contract with the U.S. military to developsafety and arming devices. Seven years later,in 1968, he and his brother David inventedan electromechanical sensor (a movingweight triggering a switch after the accel- eration threshold is reached).The Breed sensor was a simple design, with reproducibleresults, and was widely used as air bags began to be produced commercially. The key to the success of air bags is a reliable crash sensor so that an air bag will inflate the instant a serious crash occurs. Since the 1999model year, the federal government has required automobile manu-facturers to install driver and passenger air bags for frontal impact protection in all cars, light trucks and vans. It became apparent that air bags inflating instantly with great force must vent some air to prevent trauma to the head and upper torso. Aside from routine injuries caused when air bags inflated with toomuch force - usually minor abrasions to people's hands, arms andMilestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Vignette 31 Vignette Air Bags Allen K. Breedfaces - air bags caused fatal head injuries in young children.The force of the air bag smashing either directly into young children or intorear-facing child safety seats, sometimes when vehicles collided at relatively low speeds, caused these head injuries.The fear of air bags, plus information about the importance of keeping children out of the front seat, has led parents to banish children to the rear seats ofcars, vans and SUVs, a step that has helped reduce the number ofchild traffic fatalities. Automobile manufacturers also allow the passenger-side air bag to be disabled for adults and children. GM tested air bags on the 1973 model Chevrolet sold only for government use. In 1975 and 1976, GM offered buyers of full-sizedOldsmobiles and Buicks driver-side air bags, and both driver and passenger-side air bags to buyers of Cadillacs during those same years.Today, dual front air bags are standard in all automobiles sold in the United States. In addition, side air bags are options offered by manymanufacturers and are standard in many models. In second-generationair bags, the force used to inflate the air bag has been further reduced,an important modification that helps cut down on the number ofinjuries to the head and upper torso caused by air bags during motorvehicle crashes. As of late 2003, NHTSA estimates that more than 13,000 lives have been saved by air bags, mostly drivers but with asignificant number of front-right passengers.Milestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Vignette drivers making life-threatening mis-takes, automobilemanufacturershave begun toprovide linkedsystems of safetyfeatures....The next frontier in automotive safety is saving bad drivers from mistakes that contribute to most crashes. T oprevent drivers from making life-threatening mistakes, auto-mobile manufacturers have begun to provide linked systemsof safety features that they are either improving or designingfrom scratch. The anti-lock brake system is the foundation of these linked safety systems. Anti-lock brakes, controlled by a computer,pump themselves automatically to avoid locking the wheelsand sending the vehicle into a skid.This same basic hardwarealso applies braking force when sensors detect a vehicle skid-ding sideways or rocking violently side to side.When they doso, the anti-lock brakes become an electronic stability controlsystem. Since every vehicle has a mechanical suspension system, with shock absorbers and (preferably) stabilizer bars that aredesigned to control the vehicle's side-to-side motion, engi-neers can make these suspensions smarter using electronicsand software. For instance, one manufacturer has devised asystem called Active Stabilizer Bar in which the electronicspush back against the forces that cause the vehicle to swayfrom side to side and go out of control in a violent turn.Another system uses shock absorbers filled with a magneticfluid. Sensors read the road and send an electric currentthrough the magnetic fluid, and depending on conditions,the shock absorbers will get either stiffer or softer to keepthe car level even on rough roads. These advances in safety systems, employing software and electronic control technology, could mean that showroomswill soon feature cars that weave a safety net around drivers.The safety net will integrate skid controls, stability sensors,steering, brakes and the throttle in a system that rectifiesdriver error automatically the instant it occurs.The challengefor automotive technology manufacturers is to persuade car manufacturers to spend the extra money to make theiradvances more widely available and bring automotive safetyto the next level.The challenge for car manufacturers is Milestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Advances in Automobile Manufacturing33Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic to persuade car buyers that these technologies are worth paying for. In late September 2004, NHTSA released a preliminary study that showed SUVs equipped with stability-control systems had 63 percent fewer fatal crashes. Cars equippedwith stability controls had 30 percent fewer fatal crashes.However, the sample size was small - only 7.4 percent oflight vehicles sold in 2003 had some kind of electronic stability control. Meanwhile, as pickups and SUVs with highcenters of gravity grow increasingly popular with consumers,the problem of rollovers persists. Rollovers represent twopercent of all crashes, but 33 percent of fatal crashes. Studiesshow that an SUV that skids into a curb at speeds as low as nine to 13 miles per hour is at high risk of flipping over.Cars will also flip over if they trip on a curb, but not untilthey attain speeds of 11-18 miles per hour. If electronic stability control (ESC) is to catch hold, the makers mustadvertise the benefits of their systems and stage demonstra-tions for the automotive press who, in turn, would spreadword to consumers. The challenge for automotive safety in the 21st century is to sustain and improve manufacturing and highway safetyinnovations.The role of public health in future successes, asmeasured by decreasing traffic fatalities and injuries, willcome through the following approaches: /rhombus6Continue efforts to reduce alcohol-impaired driving and related fatalities and injuries.Milestones .Chapter 2 .Automotive Safety .Looking Ahead 34 Toyota's new Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) enhances handling and traction control systems, thus, improving preventive safety. ...an SUV that skids into a curb at nine to13 miles per hour is athigh risk of flippingover.Vehicle path presumed by driver VDIM Vehicle stability control onlyBy far the greatest challenge for public health is extendingto users./rhombus6Promote strategies such as graduated licensing that discourage teenage drinking and speeding. /rhombus6Enhance pedestrian safety, especially for children and the elderly, through engineering solutions that reduceexposure to traffic and permit crossing streets safely andby encouraging safer pedestrian behaviors. /rhombus6Accommodate the mobility needs of persons aged 65 years and older - a population estimated to double to 65 million by 2030 - through a combination of alternativemodes of transport. /rhombus6Encourage routine seat belt use by drivers and passengers. /rhombus6Encourage proper use of child safety seats. /rhombus6Conduct biomechanics research to better understand the causes of nonfatal disabling injuries, particularly brainand spinal cord injuries. By far the greatest challenge for public health is extend- ing to developing countries the knowledge and technologythat have enabled the United States to better protect its roadusers.This will require surmounting economic and culturalbarriers. Susan Baker of Johns Hopkins School of PublicHealth says,\"Advances in automotive safety in this countrycan point the way to improved safety in the developingworld. Hopefully, those countries and that vast population will not have to learn from hard experience, as we did, thatgovernment regulations, wisely implemented, are the bestway to protect public health.\"35 Susan Baker, Bloomberg School ofPublic Health, JohnsHopkins University.Photo credits Page 21: First gas car, \u00a9 HIP/The Works.

Several months later, Congresspassed significant amendments to the Clean Air Act of1967, imposing statutory deadlines for states to complywith federal emission standards.The previous approach,allowing regions to set their own air quality standards, hadproduced little headway against air pollution. Earth Dayprovided the impetus to enact the amendments.Theseamendments were strengthened further in 1977, andCongress has continued to keep environmental protectionat the forefront of its concerns.The year 1970 also saw thecreation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),consolidating under one roof a host of federal bureaus andMilestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Back Chapter 3 Environmental Health Looking Back The Environmental Protection Agency Previous Cabinet Department National Air Pollution Control Admin.

Previously, these bureaus and agencies had beenhoused in different cabinet departments, only loosely coordinated. The creation of EPA gave the public health community regulatory power to fight manufacturing and industry pol- lution. Prior to EPA, the public health community hadplayed David to the Goliath of industry, the source of mostenvironmental pollution.The public health focus on envi-ronmental health became much sharper once EPA began to systematically address the effects that air, water and soilpollution have on the environment and on people's health. EPA's mission is to protect human health and to safeguard the natural environment - air, water and land - upon whichlife depends. EPA accomplishes this mission by establishingand enforcing environmental protection standards consis-tent with national environmental goals. At the same time,EPA conducts research on the adverse effects of pollution. Because legislation to address pollution was urgently needed, the field of environmental health law rose toprominence with the creation of EPA. Knowing that businesses would be reluctant to transform their operations in a vacuum, EPA held all competitors tothe same strict standards, and this helped prompt industryto act. International trade complicates the level playingfield, however, sometimes leading multinational corpora-tions into a \"race to the bottom.\" If multinational corpora-tions can freely transfer a polluting industry to anothercountry with more lenient pollution standards, nations mayresist restricting their own industry through legislation. To a greater extent than perhaps any other area of public health, environmental health must regulate the global mar-ketplace. Environmental health officials, key sources of information on pollution, have become catalysts for policychange to protect the environment and advocate for envi-ronmental health precautions across national boundaries. How pervasive was environmental pollution in the United States before EPA stepped in to regulate the worst offend-ers? Rachel Carson's Silent Spring ,published in 1962, became a landmark work in the environmental movement.Through the lens of Carson's fervent appeal to regulate the pesticide DDT, the benevolent environment mostAmericans perceived became menacing.The chemicalMilestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Back 38 ...legislation to address pollutionwas urgently needed, the fieldof environmentalhealth law rose toprominence withthe creation ofEPA.industry, led by Monsanto, characterized Carson's findings as one-sided for failing to point out how pesticides hadeliminated malaria, typhus and other human scourges. Inmounting a public relations campaign to alleviate the public anxiety caused by Silent Spring ,however,the chemi- cal industry suffered a backlash when the public implicitlyrecognized Carson's solid research and the interconnected- ness of the natural environment. Rachel Carson, a trained marine biologist, worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service writing educationalbrochures. She earned a reputation as a meticulousresearcher and evocative writer able to make science seem poetic. In the 1950s, she wrote two popular nature books,The Sea Around Us and The Edge of the Sea ,which sold well enough to give her financial independence.The books alsointroduced her readers to ecology. Carson next turned herattention to the effects DDT had on the environment. Amiracle insecticide that saved American servicemen frommalaria in the Pacific islands during World War II, DDTfound immediate and widespread use in agriculture in theyears following the war. Unlike other insecticides that were narrow in their targets, DDT killed hundreds ofspecies at once. Carson observed the effects of DDT onwildlife, specifically how it thinned the eggshells of raptors- eagles, falcons and hawks - leading to a decline in theirpopulations, which, in turn, threw the ecosystem out ofbalance.

Unlike other insecticides thatwere narrow in their targets,DDT killed hundreds ofspecies at once.39 DDT becomes increasingly concentrated as animals prey on those lower in the food chain.Tertiary consumers Secondary consumers Primary consumers Producers 0.04 ppm0.23 ppm2.07 ppm13.8 ppmFigures in parts per million.\"For each of us, as for the robin in Michigan, or the salmon in the Miramichi, this is a problem of ecology, of interrelation-ships, of interdependence.We poison the caddis flies in the streamand the salmon runs dwindle and dwindle.We spray our elms and following springs are silent of robin song, not because wesprayed the robins directly but because the poison traveled, step by step, through the now familiar elm leaf-earthworm-robin cycle. These are matters of record, observable, part of the visible worldaround us. They reflect the web of life-or-death that scientists know as ecology.\" The publication of Silent Spring led to public clamor for a ban of DDT.The government's initial response, at the behest of the Kennedy administration, was to increaseoversight of DDT's use. Not until 1972, however, did EPA implement a total ban. Banning DDT was the first majorvictory of the environmental movement.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Back 40 \"They reflect the web of life-or-deaththat scientists knowas ecology.\"\"The history of child lead poisoning in the past century in this country is a good example of how powerful economic interests can prevent the implementation of a 'useful Truth.'\" -Benjamin Franklin In 1786, Benjamin Franklin listed in a letter to a friend every profession for which lead posed a health hazard. He then predicted that years would pass before the truth of a public health tragedy would be confronted. In fact,long after the lead and lead-paint industries became awareof the hazards posed by lead, particularly in young children,they continued to market their products aggressively.Theylobbied legislatures to forestall regulation, suppressedresearch findings and advertised falsely and, in doing so, created a public health problem that grew to major propor-tions over decades. Benjamin Franklin's prediction provedcorrect. Lead-poisoning, one of the most common environmental health problems affecting young children, is a preventabledisease. Normal hand-to-mouth behavior makes childrenunder six particularly at risk for ingesting lead from theenvironment. Exposure to even small amounts of lead canadversely affect children's growth and development. Lead-poisoning symptoms include severe stomach cramps, joint and muscle pain, extreme weakness in the ankles andthe wrists, blindness, convulsions, coma and death.Thesesymptoms have all been well-documented in lead-poisonedchildren. Although lead poisoning affects virtually everysystem in the body, it can occur without distinctive symp-toms. If lead poisoning goes unnoticed, it can damage a child's central nervous system, kidneys and reproductivesystem. It can also result in lower intelligence, hyperactivity,impaired hearing, decreased stature and growth, learningdifficulties and behavioral problems that may persist intoadulthood. Exposure to lead has been a known risk factor to the public's health and well-being for the past two centuries.As Benjamin Franklin pointed out in his letter, he couldMilestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Case Study Case Study Lead Poisoning 41 Benjamin Franklin Removing lead paint.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Case Study list every profession for which lead posed a hazard and every health condition caused by exposure to lead. Still, as Franklin predicted, the remedies were years in the future - nearly 200 years, in fact. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, public health took a back seat to the belief that health care should focus on theindividual. Charles Chapin, the health commissioner ofProvidence, Rhode Island, expressed this viewpoint in thelate 1920s as follows: \"With minor exception, municipal cleanliness does little to prevent infection or decrease the death rate. Municipal cleanlinessis no panacea. It will make no demonstrable difference in a city'smortality whether its streets are clean or not, whether the garbageis removed promptly or allowed to accumulate, or whether it has a plumbing law.\" As shocking as this statement seems today, it reflects the prevailing view of health care professionals of the time.Thepublic health community's lack of success in addressing apopulation-based tragedy can readily be seen. In addition,doctors often failed to diagnose childhood lead poisoning,compounding the problem. The tragic case of the gasoline additive tetraethyl lead (TEL), closely related to white lead, illustrates how indus-try controlled the terms of debate and determined the outcome of a controversy.General Motors, under the sub-stantial control of DuPont, joined with Standard Oil of New Jersey (now known as Exxon Mobil) to form theEthyl Corporation.The company's main focus was to pro-duce TEL to reduce engine \"knock\" while boosting enginepower. Ethanol, produced from corn, could have reducedengine knock equally, but royalties from such a commonproduct would not have been as lucrative to the corpora-tions.When several TEL production workers died and NewYork City subsequently banned the lead additive, the Ethyl Corporation sought ways to calm the public. With the full knowledge of GM, DuPont and Standard Oil, the Ethyl Corporation engineered a fraudulent researchagenda that produced the desired result - proof that TELwas a safe product. In 1924, with the public increasingly worried by worker deaths, Ethyl contracted with the U.S. Bureau of Mines to conduct animal studies of TEL. Ethylcontrolled both the content and the release of results, andPic.4 Pic.5Still, as Franklin predicted, theremedies were years in the future - nearly200 years, infact.42not surprisingly, the animal studies gave Ethyl a clean bill of health.Workers continued to die, however, and inthe face of public panic, the U.S. Public Health Serviceheld public hearings. Predictably, industry representatives dominated these hearings and no actions were taken.Workerdeaths did not abate, however, and the public became increasingly agitated.T o put the controversy torest, the Surgeon General appointed an advisory committee to conduct a definitive study and make recommendationsregarding the production and sale of tetraethyl (TEL) lead. The study lasted several months, not long enough to prop-erly gauge the effects of TEL on workers. In the end,TELwas approved for unrestricted use. Almost 50 years later, in the 1970s, a study by Dr. Herbert Needleman at Harvard Medical School provided the firstclear evidence that lead, even at very low levels, couldaffect a child's IQ. In a series of follow-up studies, hedetermined that lead poisoning affected a child's atten-tiveness, behavior and school success with long-term implications.The lead industry attacked Dr. Needleman'sfindings, accusing him of scientific fraud and misconduct.He fought back successfully, however, winning exonerationand the right for all scientists accused in this way to havean open hearing with legal representation. Dr. Needleman'sfindings prompted CDC to issue guidelines for the diag-nosis and management of lead poisoning in children.EPA took note, and Dr. Needleman's studies became thebasis for the mandate to remove lead from gasoline.TheConsumer Product Safety Commission also took note and called for a ban on lead in interior paints, while theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)began to remove lead from thousands of housing unitsacross the country. By 1976, auto and fuel manufacturers had made the changes necessary to begin to eliminate lead from gasoline.The U.S. phaseout of lead began that year when the firstcatalytic converters in automobiles were introduced to themarket. In 1986, a complete ban finally took effect, and all gasoline was unleaded.This phaseout was strikingly successful in r educing child blood lead levels. Before the ban was implemented, 88 percent of children in the United States had blood lead levels (BLL) higher than 10 \u00b5g/dL. After-wards, only nine percent had elevated blood lead levels.43 Dr. Herbert NeedlemanPic.6 ....approximately 24 million hous-ing units in Statesstill have leadedpaint and ele-vated levels of lead-contaminat- ed house dust.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Case Study The blood lead levels of all Americans declined 78 percent between 1978 and 1991, falling in exact proportion to thedeclining levels of lead in the overall gasoline supply. As a result of EPA's regulatory efforts to remove lead fromgasoline, between 1980 and 1999 emissions of lead fromthe transportation sector declined by 95 percent, and levelsof lead in the air decreased by 94 percent. Following years of heated debate, Congress banned lead- based paints for use in housing in 1978. By the time theban went into effect, the industry no longer opposed the ban, reeling from negative publicity and a precipitousdecline in sales of lead-based paint. However,approximately 24 million housing units in the UnitedStates still have deteriorated leaded paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust.Y oung children live in more than four million of these homes. Roughlytwo-thirds of homes built before 1940 and one-half ofhomes built from 1940 to 1960 contain lead-based paint.Responding to this continuing threat, Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act,known as Title X, in 1992.The law requires that home sellers and landlords provide known information on lead-based paint hazards during sales and rentals of housing built before 1978. In 2001, the U.S. government settled cases against land- lords in Chicago, Los Angeles and New Y ork that resultedin 16,000 apartments across the country being made lead- safe.The Department of Justice (DOJ), HUD and EPA collaborated in pressing the cases, basing them on Title X and the obligation of landlords to divulge hazardous conditions. Also in 2001, HUD and DOJ brought the first-ever criminal case based on Title X. A landlord in the Washington, D.C., area who had failed to notify tenantsof lead-based paint hazards pleaded guilty to obstructing a HUD investigation and falsifying documents.The land-lord agreed to serve two years in prison and pay more than one million dollars in fines for six felony counts. Prior to the 1950s, only Baltimore, Maryland, had a pro- gram to reduce blood lead levels in children. In the 1940s, a half-hearted effort by the federal government through the Children's Bureau to alert the public to the dangers of lead paint dissipated in the face of industry opposition.Although medical journals addressed the issue periodically,44 Inspectors check for lead in paint in a Manhattan apartment.the record shows that public health journals virtually ignored the subject.The American Public HealthAssociation did not take a public stand on childhood lead poisoning until 1969. Today,Rhode Island leads the way in reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning, pushed to do sobecause a disproportionate number of the state's familiesstill live in older homes. Rhode Island owes its success, inlarge part, to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project,founded in 1992, which serves as a catalyst for lead poison-ing prevention.The project provides leadership to the Get-the-Lead-Out Coalition, a statewide network of environ-mental, housing, health, social service and church groups,and other advocates promoting public policy changes. Community-based approaches to prevent childhood lead poisoning, as in Rhode Island, have proven highly effective.In 1995 in North Carolina, Edgecombe and Nash countiesand the city of Rocky Mount initiated a comprehensive,communitywide program to prevent childhood lead poi-soning. In a population of 143,000 in the combined coun-ties at that time, 17 percent of families lived in poverty, androughly 90 percent of children with lead poisoning lived in Rocky Mount.This community-based approach provides a model that can be emulated anywhere children are at riskof lead poisoning. 1.Create a broad-based community coalition or advisory group. A task force of 50 members meets quarterly to mobi- lize the entire community to eliminate the environ-mental sources that cause lead poisoning in children. 2.Involve community members most at risk in all stages of the program. In a 16-block area in the center of Rocky Mount, education and cleanup activities became watchwords,spearheaded by a local chapter of United ParentsAgainst Lead (UPAL). 3.Secure diverse and dedicated sources of funding. Funding came from county and state health depart- ments, the city of Rocky Mount, HUD and, indirectly,CDC through the North Carolina Division ofEnvironmental Health. Most importantly, a regional45 ...Rhode Island leads the way in reducing the inci- dence of child-hood lead poison-ing, pushed to doso because a dis-proportionatenumber of the state's families still live in olderhomes.Smart Start Agency, the Down East Partnership for Children, allowed for program planning and the hiring of a community development specialist. 4.Designate outreach and education staff. The leader of the Edgecombe and Nash counties program has a background in environmental healthand has also worked in real estate. She educates land-lords and mortgage officers, an important constituency. 5.Develop culturally appropriate educational materials and dissemination strategies. Communitywide education in libraries, schools and businesses, as well as through the local media, targets the problem of childhood lead poisoning. 6.Coordinate among local social service agencies. A million-dollar grant awarded by HUD helped align local health providers, local and state environmentalspecialists, a community development specialist and a state nursing consultant to provide early screening,medical management, and nutritional and educationalcounseling for children with elevated blood lead andthose who are at high risk of lead exposure. 7.Implement a variety of cleanup and repair strategies. Education, interim control counseling, abatement enforcement and contractor consultation have become routine activities. 8.Conduct a targeted screening program. Screening has seen steady increases, conducted by health departments, doctor's offices, and at local festivals, fairs and expositions. A Mobile Area HealthClinic (MAHC) screens in high-risk neighborhoods,helping elevate awareness and finding actual cases tomediate. 9.Implement policy changes. Lead-based paint hazards in homes, the leading cause of lead poisoning in children, have been addressedthrough a proposed local ordinance that, if adoptedand enforced, should reduce cases by 80 percent.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Case Study 46In 1997, the Edgecombe and Nash counties project received the GlaxoWellcome Child Health Recognition Award, a well-deserved recognition for an exemplary com- munity-based program to reduce childhood lead poisoning. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and national childhood blood lead sur-veillance data from 19 states indicates that average blood lead levels in young children decreased during the late1990s (see table below).This dramatic decline, owing muchto community-based approaches to eliminate childhoodlead poisoning, should encourage more communities acrossthe country to implement similar strategies. Meanwhile,HUD has distributed federal funds to 250 localities identi-fied as still being at risk, a key factor in helping communi-ties reduce BLLs in children. In 2003, HUD released $6.5million through Operation LEAP (Lead Elimination ActionProgram) to seven organizations across the country to helpprevent childhood lead poisoning in the home. *National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. 1 A measure of central tendency that differs from an arithmetic mean because it uses multiplication rather than addition to summarize the data values. 2This confidence interval (CI) means that there is a 95% probability that the true number is within that range. 3The number of children with BLLs 10 \u00b5g/dL over the whole population at a given point in time. 4The CDC has determined a BLL of 10 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dL) to be a level of concern. 5This estimate differs slightly from values published previously due to updates in coding and weighting of the survey data. 6This estimate differs slightly from values published previously due to weighting of the survey data.NHANES*Blood Lead Level (BLL) Measurements for Children Aged 1-5 Y ears47 Estimated disorder caused by the ingestion of lead compounds) and death from lead poison-ing have been virtually eliminated in the United Statesover the past 20 years. A combination of preventive approaches - screening high-risk children, medically treat-ing children with elevated blood lead levels and interveningto reduce environmental lead exposure - contributed tothis success story. Most important, the removal of lead fromgasoline and paint manufactured for residential use has dramatically reduced childhood lead exposure. At the startof a new century, public health should continue building a winning coalition - government, community-basedorganizations, city planners, developers and private medi-cine - to prevent disease and deaths caused by unnecessarylead exposure.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Case Study 48 A combination of preventiveapproaches con-tributed to thissuccess story -screening andintervening toreduce environ- mental leadexposure.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Vignette Asbestos can be found in nearly every commercial and residential structure built in the United States from the early to mid-1900s.Prized for its insulating and fire-retardant characteristics, asbestos wasadded to concrete blocks, wallboard, insulation, gaskets and flooringmaterials, to name only a few building materials. Not until the 1960sdid asbestos become a public health concern, too late for thousandsof people who had either died or suffered from lung disease andother fatal illnesses caused by asbestos exposure. In 1964, an authori-tative report presented by Dr. Irving J. Selikoff at the New Y orkAcademy of Medicine underscored what had become commonknowledge - with asbestos, the magical properties to retard fire and insulate from heat came with a grave human cost. Asbestos is a generic name for six naturally occurring minerals that have been mined since before recorded history. Ordinary silica boul-ders break apart first into rocks, then into stones, pebbles, grit andfinally dust, always with a harmless quality of roundness. Asbestos,on the other hand, yields fibers when pulverized.These fibers, eachcomposed of thousands of even smaller fibers woven tightly together,in turn, yield fibrils that are invisible to the human eye even underpowerful microscopes. Asbestos causes harm only when it crumblesand releases submicroscopic fibrils into the air as a cloud of dust thatis then breathed in or swallowed. Lung disease can begin by chance when a single fibril embeds in a lung cell, something akin to a javelin thrown from one end of a foot-ball field landing in the exact center of a mattress at the other end.Since a single fibril can kill, there is no known safe level of exposureto asbestos. Unfortunately, asbestos is found everywhere in indoorenvironments, from acoustic ceiling tiles to ductwork insulation totaping compounds to vinyl floor tiles. Its use in exterior shingles andsiding and in road-building materials is also pervasive. In the UnitedStates, laws did not curtail the use of asbestos as a fire-retardant andheat insulator in building materials until the late 1970s. Althoughasbestos remains harmless if left intact and undisturbed, once dis-turbed, its safe removal becomes a costly and laborious undertaking.Untold billions of dollars would need to be spent before all asbestoscould be safely removed. Meanwhile, the toll of fatal illnesses caused by submicroscopic asbestos fibrils continues to mount. Foremost in concern is mesothe-lioma, a rare form of lung cancer. Other debilitating lung illnessesVignette Asbestos49caused by asbestos include asbestosis (a scarring of the lungs with fibrous tissue), pleural plaques, pleural thickening, asbestos pleurisyand lung cancer. Also, ingested fibrils can cause gastric tumors. Mesothelioma causes particular pain to its victims and their families. Nearly always fatal unless it is discovered early, usually by chance,and treated aggressively, the usual course of the disease after diagnosisis an exceptionally painful two-year decline in lung function.Thesymptoms typically appear 20 to 30 years after the first exposure.Beyond construction workers, miners and shipyard workers who areknown to be at risk, most people do not know whether they havebeen exposed. Consequently, the disease often takes people by sur-prise. Long-ago exposure to any material containing asbestos thatcrumbled or became a powder from sawing, scraping or sanding creates the condition for the disease. While incidence of the disease in the United States remains relatively low, with 14 cases per million people per year, a threefold increase inmesothelioma in males between 1970 and 1984 caused alarm in pub-lic health circles. Health officials traced the increased incidence toworkplace conditions, especially in shipyards, and the legal communi- ty responded by filing class action lawsuits against manufacturers andmine owners. Currently, asbestos litigation wends its way throughcourts across the country. In the case of Johns Manville, the world'slargest asbestos company, bankruptcy proceedings further complicatepending legal remedies. Tests in 2000 determined that even crayons contained unsafe levels of asbestos, a result of several leading crayon manufacturers using talcmined from one site in upstate New Y ork.The mine's owner, backedby powerful members of Congress, had fought government regulators to a standstill for years. Meanwhile, workers in the crayon manufac-turing plants continued to be exposed to fibrils made airborne in thetalc. As public health authorities accumulated evidence of the healthrisks from crayon manufacturing and from crayons themselves, a battle with the mining industry and its powerful congressional supportersloomed. Only when evidence of the health risks became overwhelm-ing were enforceable regulations enacted. Public health balances riskand precaution in addressing environmental public health issues, andthe crayon issue illustrates how health threats often need to escalatebefore action is taken.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Vignette 50An estimated 31 million Americans have asthma today, more than triple the number in 1980, according to the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Characterized by a chronic inflammation and swelling ofthe airways that restrict breathing, asthma threatens thelives of people who have it and creates uncertainty in their daily lives. During a serious asthma attack, breathingbecomes so constricted that the feeling is similar to drown-ing. At this stage, an emergency room visit for life-savingtreatment becomes essential. Asthma is debilitating and costly to the health care system. Although anyone can have asthma, regardless of age,income or ethnicity, the disease is particularly prevalentamong low-income children in the inner cities. The New York Times reported in 2003 that one in four children in New Y ork City's Harlem section has asthma, double therate expected by researchers and one of the highest rates in the nation. In the early 1970s, because few people diedfrom asthma attacks, they were not even reported. Now,just 30 years later, the disease causes 5,000 deaths a yearand disproportionately affects African-Americans.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Asthma ...one in four children in NewYork City's Harlem sectionhas asthma....51 Why does the United States face this frightening public health epidemic, and what should be done to address it?Asthma can be characterized as a disease of industrializa-tion. Epidemiologists, physicians, social workers and med-ical researchers have been hard at work trying to uncoverthe environmental causes and aggravators of asthma. InHarlem, the surprisingly high incidence of the diseaseamong children may stem from chronic pollution caused by truck and automobile traffic, second-hand tobacco smoke, unhygienic living conditions or a combination of these factors.The research is not yet conclusive. Otherasthma triggers include industrial air pollution, dust mites,cockroach and mouse droppings in tightly insulated homes,and severe allergic reactions to common substances, such as animal dander and pollen. The exact causes of asthma in any particular person are still subject to speculation. Heredity is thought to be a factor,as children of asthmatics are more likely to develop the disease. Atopy is a proven factor - people susceptible toallergies are more likely to suffer from asthma. Race and ethnicity also appear to play a roll - African-Americans suffer from the disease at an increased rate (5.8 percentcompared with 5.1 percent in whites) and are more likelythan whites to be hospitalized and die from asthma attacks.In fact, the death rate from asthma in African-Americanchildren is more than four times the rate in white children.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Ahead 52 In September 2002, more than 400 children were screened for asthma at Public School 242 in Manhattan.Parents and caregivers must be exceptionallyattentive to thetriggers that causeasthma in thechildren in theircare. Girl using bronchial inhaler.Epidemiological studies have yet to pinpoint the causes forthis discrepancy, although for inner-city children, access tohealth care and the quality of residential environments arelikely leading causes. All asthma sufferers react in predictable fashion when they breathe airborne allergens, first with severe constriction of the trachea (windpipe), then with production of mucusthat constricts the trachea further. Fortunately, asthma is a manageable disease. Patient and caregiver education is akey component of controlling asthma.The severity of the disease can be controlled by carefully monitoring exposures in the environment. For example, asthma sufferers shouldavoid tobacco smoke, stay away from pets, and abstain from foods that cause allergic reactions. Parents and care-givers must be exceptionally attentive to the triggers that cause asthma in the children in their care. Given the enormous costs of asthma to society, significant medical research is dedicated to discovering new therapeu-tic approaches. Aside from the standard treatment ofinhalers (anti-inflammatory drugs that prevent swelling in small airways branching off the trachea), some promisingnew approaches include antileukotrienes and bronchodila-tors. Leukotrienes are chemicals produced by cells thatcause smooth muscles to constrict and fluid from bloodvessels to collect in the lungs. Oral antileukotriene drugs developed by scientists prevent inflammation andconstriction and show promise in treatment of asthma.Bronchodilators are medications that open constricted airways in the bronchial tubes and are available in tablet,capsule, liquid, inhaler or injectable forms. New approachescalled tandem therapies combine approaches (i.e., bron-chodilators work jointly with anti-inflammatory medica-tions to control and prevent asthma symptoms). Recently,the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute conductedresearch that shows that a long-acting beta-agonist (LAB), a bronchodilator, when taken with inhaled corticosteroids,helps improve asthma control. Other promising therapeutic approaches include mono- clonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Anti-IgEtherapy is based on a \"short circuit\" approach to the aller-gic response, using the antibody to treat the first steps of the allergic response and thereby avoid symptoms caused5354 Many asthma researchers believe it is only a matter of timebefore advancesin DNA technol-ogy and theroots of asthma.by allergen exposure. Another new therapeutic approach, determining how to control lung acid levels in asthmapatients, also promises to reduce symptoms. During anattack, asthma sufferers experience levels of lung acid up to 1,000 times higher than people without asthma.Researchers have discovered specific reasons for this imbalance and will soon make available therapeutics to prevent it and thus reduce symptoms. Another promising avenue for therapeutics is genetic research. Although a single \"asthma gene\" has yet to be discovered, genetic studies have yielded significant advancesin pinpointing the many genes thought to be involved inallergies and asthma. Understanding how these genes areinherited in families will enable researchers and physiciansto better predict who is at risk for the disease and initiatetherapies to control the symptoms. Many asthmaresearchers believe it is only a matter of time before advances in DNA technology and knowledge of the human genome will uncover the roots of asthma.Effective new treatment options will surely follow. The public health community views asthma and related breathing disorders as a key challenge in the new century.Moreover, asthma is a complex disease that requires a co-ordinated and multifaceted response from many organiza-tions including those involved with transportation, urbanplanning, the environment, health care, and public health.The public health response to asthma involves a number ofactions, all equally important. First, surveillance reveals thedistribution and occurrence of asthma. Second, educationhelps ameliorate the severity of asthma attacks.Third, coali-tions that foster collaborative approaches to strategic direc-tions, structure and process in asthma treatment reduce barriers and make goals achievable. Fourth, advocacyaddresses the suspected causes of asthma in communities.Finally, interventions - medical, environmental and school-based - create healthier environments and can lead to adecline in the prevalence of asthma.When public healthrallies educators, government, industry, and the public toadopt these five steps, asthma begins to be addressed inways that lead to long-term solutions. From an environmental standpoint, anyone with asthma - or someone living with a person with asthma - should takeMilestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Ahead 54preventive measures to control their indoor environment. People with asthma should live with as little dust as possi- ble and should avoid contact with pets that shed hair and dander.The indoor environment should be free fromsmoke, cockroach and mouse droppings, and mold andmildew. Precautions taken to remove allergens from theindoor environment can reduce the incidence of asthmaattacks and can foster other positive personal and publichealth effects as well. The public health system can help people create and main- tain healthy home and work environments. Looking ahead,outdoor environmental controls that reduce the need fordriving offer hope for relieving asthma symptoms. Ideally,the outdoor environment would feature communitiesfriendly to walking and biking with better urban planning and increased access to convenient public transportation.Ideally, highways would be full of automobiles powered by electricity. During the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, restricted traffic in downtown Atlanta improved air quality and reduced emergency room visits for asthma by 42 per-cent.

Answers to environmental health problems cannot all be known today.Time can be a best friend or a worst enemywhen measuring environmental effects. For example, levelsof carbon monoxide can be measured in one month andeffective countermeasures taken immediately. On the otherhand, pesticides in the food chain might take years tomeasure and can cause great harm before countermeasuresare even considered.The effect of climate change onhumans, which will take generations to measure, poses a particular challenge for environmental health specialists and other scientists who care about healthy environments.They must convince workers who depend for employmenton skeptical industries, and the industries themselves, toaccept countermeasures on faith. How will global change affect future generations? Must environmental problems reach crisis levels before we act?Can we avoid repeating past mistakes? The environmentalpicture, still murky, is one of threats and advances coexist-ing. One million people worldwide die of air pollutioneach year, 90 percent of whom are in developing nations.Industrialization and technology create wealth in the developing world, measured by growth in urban areas and international travel and trade, but at the same timegreenhouse gases cause climate change, ecosystems are stressed, chemical hazards multiply, biodiversity is lost and emerging infectious diseases jump continents.Unfortunately, rapidly developing countries contribute to environmental depredation, compounding the problemscreated by advanced industrial nations. Coral reefs continueto die off, schools of dolphins continue to dwindle, ozoneholes continue to widen. Government's duty is to prioritize the environmental health agenda. Citizens share a responsibility to become literate about environmental health to help advance thefield. Many advances - designated smoking areas, recycling,bicycle paths, greenways - are made possible because thepublic engages in advocacy, a driver of government change.Milestones .Chapter 3 .Environmental Health .Looking Ahead 56 Ozone hole in the Earth's atmosphere.Dr. Richard J.

One challenge is to betterunderstand the broad impact of our built environment onhealth and then to build future communities that promotephysical and mental health. Public health has traditionallyaddressed the built environment to tackle specific healthissues such as sanitation, lead paint, workplace safety, firecodes and access for people with disabilities.We now real-ize that how we design the built environment may holdtremendous potential for addressing many of the nation'sgreatest current public health concerns, including obesity, asthma, injury, depression, violence and social inequities.\" Perhaps Jackson best expresses a vision for the future of healthier environments:\"Many aspects of the built environment will resist rapid change, even when researchhas adequately revealed key aspects of healthy communities.Efforts to improve pedestrian facilities, preserve green spaceand upgrade public transportation are under way in manycommunities.Whereas our generation may reap some ben-efits from the new field of the built environment andhealth, with a little vision and a lot of good science andhard work, our children and grandchildren will be able to walk or bicycle home from their workplaces throughattractive communities designed to promote the physicaland mental health of all people.\" Miami Springs, Florida, site plan - an example of a community planned with plentiful greenery and pedestrian walkways.57 Dr. Richard J.

Somemedical researchers grew to believe that an infectious agent only needed to be identified before effectivecountermeasures could be identified and implemented. A rude awakening lay ahead, however.The early years of the 21st century have already seen widespread outbreaksof SARS, avian flu, and Ebola virus, debilitating and often fatal emerging infectious diseases.Tuberculosis has re-emerged as a threat to the public's health, the number of HIV infections continues to mount, and growing antibioticresistance threatens hospitals and communities throughout the United States. Who would have thought in the1950s, as the Salk vaccine effectively eliminated the threatof polio, that so many other infectious diseases wouldemerge just 50 years later? In an age of rapid global traveland a revolution in the development of therapeutics andpublic education, we have reached an uneasy standoffbetween microbes and man's best efforts to create a worldfree of infectious diseases. Real advances in infectious disease control began in the second half of the 19th century, but medical care did notbecome truly transformed until antibiotics were discoveredin the 1940s, ushering in dramatic reductions in illness anddeath from infectious diseases. For example, in 1850 theinfant mortality rate in Massachusetts was 130 deaths per1,000 live-born infants, with many of these deaths due tointra- and postpartum sepsis. By 2003, the infant mortalityrate in Massachusetts had dropped to 4.8 deaths per 1,000live births.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Back 59 Chapter 4 Infectious Disease Control Looking Back Who would have thought in the1950s, as the Salkvaccine effectively eliminated thethreat of polio,that so many other infectiousdiseases wouldemerge just 50years later?Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Back 60 For a time in the mid-19th century, sanitary reforms helped control diseases. A hygienic movement arose fromthe squalor of urban slums, trying to eliminate dirt andsewer stenches.While the effort had some effect, it failed to counter diseases spread by fleas and mosquitoes or bypersonal contact, and it often failed to separate drinkingwater supplies from sewage. Fortunately, the breakthroughs of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch and the germ theory ofdisease were soon to come. In 1346, the world's most famous scourge, bubonic plague, spread by rats to fleas to humans at first in Asia, migrated to the population centers of Europewith devastating effect. It is thoughtthat as much as half of Europe's popula-tion succumbed to the disease in theensuing years.The disease - a highlycontagious, virulent bacteria - causedhigh fever and attacked the lungs, turn-ing the body black before death. Oncethe \"black death\" epidemic died out ofits own accord, the relieved but dimin-ished population of Europe moved onto the Renaissance, one of the greatages in human history. In 1530, the Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro wrote a poem to express his ideas about the origin of syphilis,positing that this sexually transmitted disease was spreadthrough intimate contact by \"seeds.\" He expanded thisearly theory of contagion in later writings to include indirect contact, through clothing and even through the air. In giving voice to his ideas, Fracastoro anticipated by350 years the pioneering work of Louis Pasteur, RobertKoch and their contemporaries in the late 1870s.Their big breakthrough came with the germ theory of disease. In 1627, Jesuit missionaries in malaria-ridden Peru began carrying the bark of the Cinchona tree back to Europe.They had observed that native Indians used the bark tofight malaria, not yet realizing that the active ingredient,quinine, had anti-malarial properties.When the bark provedto lessen malarial fevers in Europe, quinine gained a spoton the rare list of pharmaceuticals - opium, digitalis,willow bark, and little else - that provided patients somerelief prior to the modern era. The plague of Florence in the 14th century. Girolamo FracastoroIn 1683 in the Netherlands, with one of his new micro- scopes in hand, Anton van Leeuwenhoek visualized bacteriaamong the animalcules - microscopic animals that cannot be seen by the naked eye - he harvested from his own teeth.He was the first to see and describe bacteria, yeast plants,the teeming life in a drop of water and the circulation ofblood corpuscles in capillaries.The invention of the micro- scope opened the way to visualize some of the microbialagents causing contagious diseases, but not until the inven-tion of the electron microscope in the 1930s did themolecular structure of microbes - nucleoids, ribosomes,cell walls and membranes, flagella - become discernible.The electron microscope gave rise to a flourishing era formolecular biology. In 1796, in Hertfordshire, England, Edward Jenner devel- oped the first vaccine after observing that milkmaidsexposed to cowpox were somehow immune to smallpox.Jenner concluded that exposure to a form of the animal infection protects a person from contracting a full-blown -and much more devastating - form of the human disease,and his empirical observation and successful experimentsbecame the basis for vaccines that followed. The germ theory of disease arose from research by a French chemist, Louis Pasteur, and a German bacteriolo-gist, Robert Koch, which established the sanitary condi- tions necessary for isolating and studying bacteria. In the61 Anton van Leeuwenhoek Dr. Koch's treatment for consumption (tuberculosis).Too small to be with conventionalmicroscopes,these agents werenamed \"viruses.\"late 1870s, Pasteur invented pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill dangerous microorganisms, and invent-ed vaccines against anthrax and rabies. Koch's contributionswere procedural and have been handed down as \"Koch's Postulates,\" criteria necessary for a particular organism to be proven to cause a particular disease. In 1882, Koch iden-tified the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, and a yearlater, he did the same for cholera. Koch's discoveries begana golden age of microbiology marked by headlong compe-tition among medical researchers to isolate and identify themicroorganisms that cause diseases. This germ theory led to advances in treating infectious diseases in western Europe and the United States. By the turn of the century, typhus had virtually disappeared,tuberculosis had started a long decline, and life expectancybegan to increase. Nonetheless, annual mortality in theadvanced industrial nations remained at two percent,much of it caused by infection. Diseases such as diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, puerperal fever,tuberculosis and infectious diarrhea remained major killers.In some cases, notably mortality from childhood infectiousdiseases, such as scarlet fever, little would change until theadvent of antibacterial agents in the mid-20th century. In the 1890s, the Russian microbiologist Dmitri Ivanowski and the Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck independentlydiscovered tiny infectious agents that could pass throughbacteria-stopping filters. T oo small to be seen withconventional microscopes, these agents were named \"viruses.\" Unlike bacteria, which replicate independently, avirus invades an existing cell and replicates using that cell'sgenetic code. Research in viruses, thought to cause at leasthalf of human infections, has unleashed a new sphere ofcompetition among microbe hunters. In the 20th century, great advances in fighting infectious diseases were made possible by the discovery of sulfon-amides, penicillin and anti-tuberculosis agents.Vaccinedevelopment and smallpox eradication were also greatachievements during the century. However, the great infectious disease challenges of the century - influenza pandemics, the HIV pandemic, and failure to controlmalaria, tuberculosis and worldwide infant mortality - still haunt us at the start of the 21st century.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Back 62 Louis Pasteur works on an experiment.While antimicrobial agents play an important role in reducing deaths caused by infection, much of this reduced mortality comes from continued improvements in nutri-tion, housing and environmental hygiene.Vaccination, cul-minating in the global eradication of smallpox in 1977, alsohas had a profound impact in reducing the global burdenof diseases such as polio, measles, diphtheria and tetanus.Early in the 21st century, polio and guinea worm are veryclose to eradication, while onchocerciasis and lymphaticfilariasis are also targets for elimination. Approximately 25 percent of physician visits in the United States today are to identify and treat infectious diseases, including HIV infection and related illnesses, withboth direct and indirect costs estimated to be $120 billionannually. An estimated 600,000 cases of pneumonia occureach year in the United States and cause as many as 50,000deaths. In other parts of the world, infectious diseasesremain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Each year, malaria claims the lives ofmore than one million children in sub-Saharan Africa.Worldwide, each year 35million to 60 million people contractdengue, and approximately 200 millionpeople have schistosomiasis (also calledbilharzia or snail fever, a tropical disease made widespread through the use ofcontaminated water, characterized byinfection and gradual destruction of thetissues in the kidneys, liver and otherorgans). In Russia, more than 10,000 cases of diphtheria have occurred since 1993 due to a fall-off in immunization levels. In 1998, the World HealthOrganization estimated that infectious diseases causedalmost a quarter of the 54 million deaths worldwide - over13 million deaths.Three diseases that had been common inthe developed world at the beginning of the 20th century- pneumonia, diarrheal disease, and tuberculosis - account-ed for nearly half of these deaths. Still, since the advent ofmicrobiology in the late 19th century, progress againstinfectious diseases has been remarkable. The emergence of infectious diseases in this century, despite man's best efforts to eradicate them, comes in partfrom demographic factors. As people live longer, they are63 Medical-screening campaign for \"sleeping sickness\" in Chad.more apt to be hospitalized in old age and become suscep- tible to bacterial pathogens lurking on wards. Hospital per-sonnel can spread these pathogens from one patient toanother, causing what are known as \"nosocomial infections.\" Ironically, in the developed world, old people are most at risk of infectious diseases; while in the developingworld, infants and young children remain most at risk. Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Laureate in medicine, observes, \"As infectious diseases have assumed lower rankings inmortality statistics, other killers - mostly diseases of oldage, affluence and civilization - have moved up the ladder.Heart disease and cancer, for example, have loomed as larger threats over the past few decades. Healthier lifestyles,including less smoking, sparer diets, more exercise and better hygiene, have been important countermeasures.Prophylactic medications, such as aspirin, as well as medicaland surgical interventions, have also kept people alivelonger.\"Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Back 64 Ironically, in the developed world,old people aremost at risk ofinfectious and youngchildren remainmost at risk.The mysterious constellation of symptoms that began to appear in gay men in the late 1970s and early 1980s baffledthe medical world at first, but not for long.The symptomsconsisted of opportunistic infections or cancers - candidia-sis in the mouth, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in thelungs, toxoplasmosis in the brain, Kaposi's sarcoma lesionson the skin and elsewhere, to name a few - that hinted atcompromised immune systems as the underlying cause. The medical community set to work to identify the culprit. Fortunately, each individual infection presenting in gay men had been identified in the early years of the 20th centuryand by the 1970s, for different reasons, had been linked to an underlying defect of the immune system. Doctors,therefore, understood the complexity and implications ofwhat they now confronted. In New Y ork City and LosAngeles, where the first cases of the new \"gay plague\" orgay-related immunodeficiency (GRID) were treated, doc-tors astutely noted that a defect in the immune system wasthe underlying reason why this constellation of infectiousdiseases and cancers was occurring.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Case Study 65 Case Study HIV/AIDS Human immunodeficiency virus.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Case Study In 1981, CDC began to formally track cases.The next year, public health officials in the United States began to use theterm \"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\" (AIDS) toidentify the new occurrences of opportunistic infections,cancers and other conditions. In 1983, Drs. Francois-BarreSinoussi, Luc Montaigner, and colleagues at the InstitutPasteur in Paris isolated and identified the cause of AIDS, a virus they named \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\"(LAV). Additionally, discoveries by Dr. Robert Gallo andhis colleagues at the National Institutes of Health that sameyear provided conclusive evidence that this virus indeed caused AIDS. A few years later, the virus was renamed\"human immunodeficiency virus\" (HIV). Although the public health community speculated over the years that the source of HIV must be connected to primates in Africa, the origin of the virus in humans wasnot settled until 1999.That year, a team of researchersreported they had discovered HIV-1 in chimpanzees in west equatorial Africa. HIV-1, the predominant strain of HIV in the developed world, has a cousin, HIV-2, which is a slower-acting strain that occurs primarily in westernAfrica.The researchers identified a particular subspecies of chimpanzees as the likely original source of HIV-1 andconcluded that the virus must have passed to humans fromthis source. The properties of HIV are unique. A retrovirus, HIV repli- cates by binding to the outer surface of the CD4+ T cell(also known as a helper T lymphocyte, a white blood cellthat fights infections and is critical to a healthy immunesystem). After binding to this cell, HIV enters the cell andremains hidden and protected from other immune system cells. Once inside, HIV copies its RNA, creating a newviral DNA that is integrated into the host cell's DNA.Empowered by the host cell, HIV replicates new virions(single viruses).The new virions leave the host cell toinfect others, and the host CD4+ T cell dies.While thebody produces about 10 billion new virions daily, theimmune system kills and removes most of them, leavingabout 100 million virions that are infectious. Although thebody creates CD4+ T cells every day, virions kill othersoff, leading to a struggle for balance of power betweenHIV and CD4+ T cells.66 An AIDS researcher drawing blood froma chimpanzee.HIV is transmitted in the following ways: /rhombus6Sexual contact with an infected partner, including vaginal, anal and oral intercourse; HIV enters the body through the lining of the female and male genitalia, therectum, and through the mouth (men having sex with men remain the population at highest risk, althoughthe growth rate of HIV infection in women in theU.S.has in some years outstripped that in gay and bisexual men). /rhombus6Sharing needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood (the number of cases in injected drug users is second only to gay and bisexual men in the U.S.). /rhombus6From infected woman to fetus during pregnancy or to newborn during birth. /rhombus6Breast-feeding by infected mothers to newborns. /rhombus6Transfusion of infected blood or blood products. Based on available evidence, HIV is not transmitted through saliva, sweat, tears, urine or feces. No transmission has beenattributed to biting insects, and only rarely through mucosalor casual contact with blood or body fluids. Casual contactdoes not include sitting next to someone, shaking hands,hugging, eating in the same restaurant, swimming in thesame pool, using the same shower or tub, and using thesame toilet seat. How do people infected with HIV know if they have AIDS? When monitoring a person with HIV ,two blood tests should be done periodically, a CD4+ T cell count and a viral load count. If the CD4 count dropsbelow 200 cells/mm3, or an AIDS-defining conditiondevelops, the person has AIDS. AIDS-defining conditions,listed below, would be very unusual in someone not infected with HIV . /rhombus6Candidiasis (known as thrush, a fungus in the mouth) /rhombus6Invasive cervical cancer a viralload Disease Control .Case Study /rhombus6Histoplasmosis /rhombus6Isosporiasis /rhombus6Kaposi's sarcoma (a rare skin lesion caused by type of herpes virus) /rhombus6Lymphoma (certain of the brain /rhombus6Tuberculosis /rhombus6Wasting syndrome The immediate concern for someone infected with HIV , even before he or she develops AIDS, is treatment.T oday, people with HIV should be followed clinically with labtests to assess their need for antiretroviral therapy and tomonitor their progress.The viral load count becomes animportant measure in determining when and how to pro-ceed. Generally, anti-HIV medications are called for if theviral load is 100,000 copies/mL or more or if the CD4+ Tcell count declines rapidly. Systemic factors also play a role. Treatment of HIV in the early 1980s consisted mainly of palliative care, since the origins and course of the diseasewere still a mystery and drugs to fight it effectively had yet to be developed. Until 1987, when the medicationAZT was licensed for use, death usually occurred within 18months of diagnosis, often from pneumonia after a periodof alarming weight loss. Patients often had more than oneopportunistic infection or cancer at a time - such as can-didiasis, diarrheal disease, Kaposi's sarcoma and, in the end,pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Not all people with HIVdevelop symptoms rapidly, however.The median time lagfor developing symptoms is estimated to be ten years, butsome people infected with HIV develop symptoms veryquickly while others stay free of symptoms for many years.Dr. James Curran, dean of Rollins School of Public Healthat Emory University and former head of the HIV/AIDS68 Until 1987, whenthe medicationAZT was licensedfor monthsof diagnosis....unit at CDC, observes, \"Unfortunately, most people in the world with HIV still get no treatment.\" The public health response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in its early days included education, testing and partner notifi-cation. So little was known about the disease that the pub-lic clamored for information. Could kissing transmit HIV?Who was most at risk? As CDC began collecting data onevery reported case before the discovery of HIV and the availability of testing, new populations surfaced as being potentially at special risk - Haitians, injecting drug usersand hemophiliacs. Almost from the start of the epidemic,some hospitals began to separate at-risk populations andAIDS cases and recommended that staff be fully gowned,masked and gloved when treating patients. Since theexchange of blood through needles was known to transmitAIDS, special precautions became necessary for drawingblood. Some of the more controversial public health measures to address the emerging epidemic included anonymous andvoluntary HIV testing, partner notification and blinded seroprevalence surveys. Early on, the public health commu-nity encouraged individuals who were at risk of infectionto learn about their HIV status through anonymous testingsites that were established at local and state health depart-ments. Individuals who tested positive were encouraged tonotify their partner(s). For those who tested positive andwere reluctant to notify their partner(s), state and local health departments set up systems for notifying partners,collecting the names and notifying them while shieldingthe name of the index case. Finally, CDC developed aseries of validated or blinded seroprevalence surveys - inpregnant women, in newborns, in STD clinic patients - inorder to better understand the epidemic and how it waschanging. Controversy developed when states began to feelpressure to identify the positive cases in order to notifythem of their HIV status and the need for therapy. In somestates, such as New Y ork, the newborn seroprevalence sur-vey has been \"unblinded\" so that the names of the babies are made known to pediatricians and mothers who arereferred for therapy. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. Public Health Services has recommended that all pregnant womenin the U.S. receive voluntary HIV testing during pregnancy.69 \"Unfortunately,most people inthe world withHIV still get notreatment.\"Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Case Study Today, after concentrated research and development by pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved more than 20 anti-HIVmedications for adults and adolescents.The U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) providesHIV-treatment guidelines to physicians and patients andupdates them as the FDA approves new treatment protocols.The guidelines recommend that three or more medicationsbe taken together in a reg imen called Highly Active Anti- retroviral Therapy (HAART) .Because the choices of com- binations of drugs are now numerous, each case requires careful, methodical analysis and per iodic adjustment by a physician. Four classes of antiretroviral medications now exist: /rhombus6Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors: NRTIs, faulty versions of building blocks needed by HIV to replicate, lure HIV away from normal b uilding blocks and stall reproduction of the virus (first FDA approval:March 1987). /rhombus6Protease Inhibitors: PIs disable protease, another protein needed by HIV to replicate (first FDAapproval: December 1995). /rhombus6Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors: NNRTIs bind to reverse transcriptase and disable this protein needed by HIV to replicate (first FDAapproval: June 1996). /rhombus6Fusion Inhibitors: FIs prevent HIV from entering cells (first FDA approval: March 2003). For treatment to be effective, patients must adhere to a strict regimen.They must observe an unwavering dailytimetable for ingesting pills and be careful about what they eat and drink. For patients who adhere to the strictregimen, remarkable successes are becoming the norm in keeping HIV and symptoms in check. In fact, AIDS is often now a chronic, treatable disease rather than one thatcarries an automatic death sentence. However, even now in the United States, over 15,000 deaths from AIDS occureach year, and there is still no cure. In addition to their focus on providing new antiretroviral medications, pharmaceutical companies have focused on anHIV vaccine since the discovery of the virus. Until a70 ...the U.S.Food and Drug Administrationhas approvedmore than 20anti-HIV medica-tions for adultsand adolescents.proven vaccine clears the hurdles of clinical trials, however, the only sure method to fight AIDS continues to be pre-vention.The view of AIDS as a chronic, treatable disease, paired with a current epidemic of methamphetamine use inthe gay community, has led many young and middle-agedgay men to resume unprotected sex, a grave concern to thepublic health community. Public health experts note thatmessages need to resonate in the teen and young adultpopulation stating that the only sure way to prevent AIDSis abstinence and avoidance of needle-sharing. Althoughmore than two dozen clinical trials of experimental AIDSvaccines are being conducted worldwide, only one has made it to Phase 3 clinical trials. A viable AIDS vaccine is not yet in sight. The up and down mood swings felt by the scientific and public health communities and by the public as the AIDSpandemic unfolds - from pessimism and depression to optimism and euphoria and now back to a new realism -accurately capture the repeated cycles of questions that areunique to AIDS. Unlike many other infections, AIDS dealswith taboos and denials and a greater amount of fear anduncertainty. Even so, many middle and high schools todayopenly teach HIV prevention, integrating the latest infor-mation about the epidemic into their health and wellnesscurricula. Sobering statistics account for the fear and uncertainty. More than 600,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in the United States since 1981. An estimated 850,000 to 950,000 Americans are currently infected with HIV ,with African-Americans affected disproportionately. Included in this estimate are 180,000 to 250,000 people who don't know they are infected. From 1985 to 1996, AIDS cases in women increased threefold.Citing1999 as the low point in incidence of AIDS, CDC reported in July 2003 that AIDS in gay and bisexual men had increased nearly 18 percent since then.While the rateof HIV infections in the U.S. continues to increase, thenumber of AIDS cases has fallen dramatically since 1996. In that year, HAART came into common use and thedeath rate from AIDS in the U.S. began to level off. The rest of the world is another matter, however. AIDS is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and71 A viable AIDSvaccine is not yet in sight. Included in thisestimate are180,000 to250,000 peoplewho don't knowthey are infected.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Case Study the No.1 cause of death due to infectious disease. AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading killer in Africa. In2003, 38 million people were thought to be living withHIV/AIDS and an estimated five million people acquiredHIV that year, more than in any prior year. More thanthree million people were killed by AIDS in 2003, bring-ing the total number of people who have died from AIDS,since the first cases of AIDS were identified in 1981, tomore than 20 million. Yes, these statistics are sobering. On the other hand, remarkable progress has been made against a disease that emerged from nowhere in 1981.The behavior of gay menin the developed world changed quickly; HIV itself wasisolated and identified almost immediately, and new med-ications and other therapies were discovered and used.Theaccumulated knowledge of the complex mechanisms ofAIDS enabled ever more effective countermeasures to bedeveloped that extend and enrich lives previously viewed as imperiled. In the developed world, AIDS has become anoften chronic, treatable condition rather than a rapid deathsentence.This progress must be celebrated as a signalachievement of the scientific and public health communi-ties. But as Dr. Curran points out,\"We still have a long way to go in the world.There is still neither a cure nor a vaccine. Science and public health cannot rest.\"72 Child receives an aromatherapy massageat an orphanage forchildren with AIDS. Dr. James Curran, Dean of the RollinsSchool of Public Health,Emory University.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic Sir Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin by accident at St. Mary's Hospital in London in September 1928.The story of how he stumbled on an extraordinary advance in public health illustrates the role serendipity can play in the often painfully slowprocess that accompanies great advances in scientific history. As he was about to discard a culture plate while cleaning up his laboratory in the Inoculation Department of the hospital, the young Scottish physician noticed something funny. He remembered streaking the plate some weeks before with staphylococci and now noticed a contaminant mold growing near one edge of the plate.Around the mold, the colonies of staphylococci were translucent and smaller; while further away on the plate, the colonies continuedto grow in their normal way, robust and snowy white. Dr. Flemingrealized that something in the mold was destroying the disease- causing bacteria. What was this mold? With the help of the mycology lab one floor below, Alexander Fleming identified it as Penicillium, and the sub- stance in it, as penicillin. He began toexperiment with penicillin and discov-ered that its properties also destroyedother disease-causing bacteria. Flemingrealized that penicillin would be an effective treatment against infectiousdiseases, yet other scientists shunnedhis presentations at scientific meetingsand his journal articles. Rather thanfight to overcome the skepticism ofthe scientific community, Flemingturned his attention to other areas ofresearch. He owed much in his work to Sir Almroth Wright, who estab-lished the Inoculation Department in1907 to produce and sell vaccines.Thediminutive, reticent Fleming was no match for the brilliant and abundanteccentricities of Wright, but afterFleming earned his degree in surgery,it was Wright who gamely keptMilestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Vignette 73 Vignette Development of Penicillin Sir Alexander Fleming receiving the 1945 Nobel Prize for scientific achievement from King Gustav V of Sweden. Fleming on staff and encouraged the ingenuity that became a hall- mark of Fleming's experimental techniques. Twelve years elapsed before Howard Florey and Ernst Chain at Oxford University resuscitated Fleming's findings and vindicated hisclaims for penicillin. Ironically, it was Alexander Fleming who gained fame after penicillinbegan to be producedcommercially in the early1940s, saving countlesswounded on the battle- fields of Europe and Asiawith its disease-destroyingproperties. Fleming had, infact, become an expert on treating war wounds withantiseptics during his World War I service at Boulogne, France. In 1945, AlexanderFleming was awarded a Nobel Prize in medicine, and by staying at St. Mary's Hospital forthe remainder of his career, he gained fame for the hospital as thesite of his discovery. Under constant threat of German air raids and a possible invasion, the Oxford group sought help in the United States for continuedresearch and production of penicillin. In the fall of 1942 in Brooklyn, the Charles Pfizer Company dedicated its citric acid production facilities to penicillin. Military demand was paramount,and Pfizer's production eased supply shortages, helping to makepenicillin the miracle drug it became on World War II battlefields. Meanwhile, at Brooklyn's Jewish Hospital, Dr. Leo Loewe and his associates were participating in a clinical trial of penicillin for thetreatment of streptococcal subacute bacterial endocarditis, an infec-tion of heart valves damaged by rheumatic fever.The mortality ofthis disease was 97 percent, and the results for penicillin were notencouraging. Of 17 patients treated, four died, 10 showed noimprovement, and two of the three who showed improvement hadrelapses as soon as treatment stopped. Dr. Loewe now confronted a 34-year-old man for whom his team had tried everything for sixmonths - huge doses of sulfa drugs, artificial fever therapy, heparin,and moderate doses of penicillin. Desperate, they tried a larger doseof penicillin - 200,000 units per day instead of the standard 40,000Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Vignette 74 In WW II, a wounded soldier is injected with penicillin.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic units (miniscule by today's standards) - by intravenous drip.The alpha-hemolytic streptococcus disappeared from the patient's blood,reappeared after treatment stopped and disappeared for good after a second several-week course of treatment. Dr. Loewe had proved thatendocarditis could be cured with aggressive treatment with peni-cillin, but he and his associates now faced a shortage of availablepenicillin, all of it earmarked for the military. Fortunately, the seniorexecutive of nearby Pfizer, John L. Smith, contributed a supply fromhis research allotment, and another seven patients were treated andcured. Smith visited each of the seven personally and, thereafter,continued to supply Dr. Loewe with penicillin from Pfizer's researchallotment, despite the risk of being found in violation of the WarDepartment's requirement that all manufactured penicillin be dedi-cated to military use. Fleming's discovery of penicillin was also not without controversy. Others trying to duplicate his experiment failed, and not until 1940,under a microscope at Oxford, was it determined that penicillinworked against microorganisms only when they were actively in the stage of division.What's more, it was later determined that Fleming'sserendipitous strain of Penicillium happened to be one of the three most effective in its disease-destroying properties. Recent recon-structions of Fleming's discovery have also determined that theweather conditions in September 1928 were ideal - a cold snap followed by warm temperatures - for the phenomena observed byFleming to occur.Without those ideal conditions, he may neverhave discovered penicillin.75In fact, virtually every important bacterial infectionin the UnitedStates andthroughout theworld is now becoming resist-ant, to one degreeor another, toantibiotics.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic Antibiotics, which are also known as antimicrobial drugs, fight infections caused by bacteria. In the decades sincetheir discovery in the 1940s, the antibiotics that normallycontrol bacteria have become less effective as the bacteriahave become increasingly resistant. Penicillin - the miracledrug that saved countless wounded on World War II battle-fields - today faces the fiercest strain of resistant bacteria. In fact, virtually every important bacterial infection in the United States and throughout the world is nowbecoming resistant, to one degree or another, to antibiotics.For this reason, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers antibiotic resistance one of its top con-cerns, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)seeks ways to streamline the approval process for new anti-biotics to replace those that have been compromised byresistant bacteria. Bacteria develop resistance through genetic mutation. No one antibiotic kills every last targeted bacteria.The bacteriathat survive, already displaying resistance, pass their genes to a new and more numerous generation, rendering theantibiotic even less effective for the patient the next time it is used. Sometimes, resistant bacteria even exchange theirgenetic code with unrelated bacteria, causing unforeseenresistance to other antibiotics. How did this problem develop? The reasons are multi- factorial and include the overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics. Parents often request antibiotics to treat theirchildren's colds or ear infections before allowing these con-ditions to clear up on their own. Against their own betterjudgment, physicians often acquiesce to a patient's demandfor antibiotic treatment. Eager for quick results, physicianssometimes prescribe antibiotics to treat conditions forwhich they are not appropriate. Both patients and physiciansmust be educated about the appropriate use of antibiotics. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) formed a task force among federal agen-cies to tackle the problem of antimicrobial resistance. CDC,Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Antibiotic Resistance76FDA and National Institutes of Health co-chaired the task force, which in 2001 issued a plan of action. Known as the Public Health Action Plan to Combat AntimicrobialResistance, the plan's success depends on the cooperationof state and local health agencies, universities, professionalsocieties, pharmaceutical companies, health care profes-sionals, agricultural producers and the public. Theplan's primary focus is to facilitate the development of newantimicrobial therapies while preserving the usefulness ofcurrent and new drugs. CDC developed its own Campaign to Prevent Anti- microbial Resistance, which aims to prevent antimicrobialresistance in health care settings.The campaign has four main strategies: prevent infection, diagnose and treat infec-tion, use antimicrobials wisely and prevent transmission.The campaign is developing multiple 12-step programs that target specialty clinicians who treat specific patientpopulations, including hospitalized children and adults,dialysis and surgical patients and long-term care patients.The campaign is developing educational tools and materialsfor each patient population. The American College of Physicians has issued guidelines for patients, physicians and other health care providers. Guidelines for Preventing Antimicrobial Resistance From the American College of Physicians For patients: /rhombus6Insist that antibiotics be prescribed (for yourself or your children) only when they can be useful; know the risks as well as the benefits. /rhombus6Remember that antibiotics work only against bacteria. Most colds, coughs, sore throats (except strep throat)and runny noses are caused by viruses and cannot becured by antibiotics. /rhombus6Don't use antibiotics left over from an old prescription without a doctor's permission, and never share antibi-otics with family members or friends.77 The theusefulness of current and newdrugs./rhombus6Wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water, and teach your children to do the same. Antibacterial soapis not necessary - ordinary soap will eliminate resistantbacteria and help prevent illnesses. /rhombus6Make sure immunizations are up to date. People older than 65 and people with chronic illnesses should bevaccinated against pneumonia and influenza. /rhombus6Finish a prescribed antibiotic even if you feel better. By stopping treatment before the full course, somepartly resistant bacteria will remain and multiply, mak-ing the antibiotic less effective the next time. /rhombus6Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, and avoid raw eggs and undercooked meats, especially ground meats. For physicians: /rhombus6Don't overprescribe antibiotics. /rhombus6Choose narrow- over broad-spectrum antibiotics, using the most specific, narrowly targeted (\"narrow-spectrum\") antibiotics possible if you know the causal agent. Save the newer, broad-spectrum drugs for infections that resist the older drugs. /rhombus6Wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water between each patient visit. /rhombus6Educate patients about the risks of antibiotic resistance. /rhombus6Make sure that all patients have the appropriate immunizations. For hospitals: /rhombus6Improve infection control. /rhombus6Use ultraviolet lights, insist on consistent hand-washing by staff, and improve sanitation. /rhombus6Quickly identify and isolate patients with drug-resist- ant infections. For health systems and health departments: /rhombus6Encourage and facilitate appropriate immunizations for children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. /rhombus6Monitor overall use of antibiotics to spot possible overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Ahead 78For the federal government: /rhombus6Require that product labels on antibiotic drugs contain the most current surveillance information on antibioticresistance as well as prudent use information. /rhombus6Adequately fund national surveillance programs. Develop a system of electronic laboratory reporting by hospitals and laboratories. Establish a communica- tion link to public health and medical communities to provide timely updates on aggregate data and theirinterpretation. /rhombus6Adequately fund immunization programs. /rhombus6Strengthen the public health infrastructure to facilitate rapid identification of and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Enhance laboratory capabilities andfund training programs for laboratory, epidemiologyand infection control personnel. /rhombus6Fund research programs to develop new vaccines and antibiotics to prevent or treat diseases resulting fromviral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. /rhombus6Fund research programs to study microbial patho- genesis and molecular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance. /rhombus6Sponsor public health messages to the medical community and the public about the scope of the resistance problem and the prudent use of antimicrobial drugs. /rhombus6Monitor antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals in order to protect human health. For state governments: /rhombus6Adequately fund state surveillance efforts to study antibiotic resistant and other diseases. /rhombus6Include in state surveillance programs diseases that are notified nationally, and report collected information toCDC. For researchers: /rhombus6Continue to develop and search for new antibiotics or antibiotics that work in new ways.79/rhombus6Develop new vaccines against common microbial diseases to prevent infection in the first place. For pharmaceutical manufacturers : /rhombus6On product labels, include messages about antibiotic resistance and information on prudent use of antimicrobial drugs. Discourage unnecessary and inappropriate use of products. /rhombus6Continue efforts to develop new vaccines and drugs to prevent or treat infectious diseases. For agriculture: /rhombus6Reduce widespread use of antibiotics in animal feeds and food production. For world health: /rhombus6Develop a global strategy for infectious diseases, and massively increase resources to protect, diagnose andtreat people around the world. /rhombus6Facilitate the development of surveillance in addition to prevention and control measures. /rhombus6Improve sewage systems and water purity in develop- ing nations. The FDA is working on a variety of approaches to encour- age the development of new antibiotics and new classes ofantibiotics and other antimicrobials. One approach is exclu-sivity rights to protect a manufacturer's drug from generic-drug competition for a specific length of time.The FDAhopes exclusivity will help stimulate new antimicrobialdrug development, even while it discourages overuse ofantibiotics. The FDA also has a variety of existingregulatory tools to help developers of antimicrobial drugs. One of these is an accelerated approval process for drugsthat treat severely debilitating or life-threatening diseases;another is for drugs that show meaningful benefit overexisting prescription drugs to cure diseases. The FDA is investigating other approaches for speeding the antimicrobial approval process as well. One approach isto expand the number of clinical trials while reducing thenumber of participants in each clinical trial program. InMilestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control .Looking Ahead 80 The FDA also has a variety ofexisting regula-tory tools to help developers of antimicrobialdrugs.this way, the FDA hopes to streamline the review process without compromising safety and effectiveness. Scientists and health professionals generally agree that a way to decrease antibiotic resistance is to use antibiotic drugs more cautiously and to monitor outbreaks of drug-resistant infections. Research is critical to understanding the various mechanisms that pathogens use to evade drugs.Once these mechanisms are understood, new drugs can bedesigned that are more effective. To that end, the FDA's National Center for T oxicological Research (NCTR) has been studying the mechanisms ofresistance to antibiotic agents among bacteria from the human gastrointestinal tract.These bacteria are known tocause serious infections.The NCTR has also tabulated theamount of antibiotic residues that people consume in foodfrom food-producing animals and has studied whetherthese residues affect human intestinal bacteria.The FDA is also reviewing drugs for food animals with an eye onassessing the safety of antibiotic drug residues in people.An important mission of CDC is to promote the guidelinesnoted above to the public and health care provider com-munity. Fortunately, a growing number of public health organizations have joined the chorus in alerting the publicto the proper use of antibiotics and basic infection controlpractices. Much of the knowledge about antibiotic resistance flows from NIH, the FDA and CDC, the federal agencies thatconduct research, develop solutions and educate the publicabout this emerging problem. As well, these agencies com-municate to all levels of the public health infrastructure. The public health work force is committed to educating the public and health care providers about how to reducetransmission of infectious agents and how to use antibioticsappropriately. The ability to counteract resistance,however, starts at the individual level.T o strengthen thechances for antibiotics to defeat infectious diseases the waythey are meant to, each person must use antibiotics wiselyand only when they are necessary, practice good personalhygiene and stay current with immunizations. Antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon that's here to stay, can be made more manageable if each person does his or her part.81 Our ability tocounteract resist-ance, however,starts at the indi-vidual level.Milestones .Chapter 4 .Infectious Disease Control 82 Photo credits Page 59: Ebola virus, \u00a9 CORBIS.

Ideas about the causes ofcancer originated in Greece, with some ofthe earliest writings ascribed to Hippocrates.Hippocrates was the first to introduce theterm \"carcinoma\"derived from karkinos (crab). He proposed that cancer was a diseasecaused by an excess of black bile ( atrabilis ), and classified tumors as malignant ulcers and deep-seated or occult tumors. In the second century, thefamous Roman doctor Galen codified the Hippocratic theory, proposing that an excess of a body \"humor\" causedcancer. Galen was the first to use the term \"sarcoma\" forfleshy tumors and contended that inflammation occurredwhen the \"humor\" flowed to any part of the body. It wasn't until 1800 that the Frenchman Marie Francois Xavier Bichat proposed that cancer, rather than swollen and inflamed tissue, was instead an overgrowth of cellulartissue. In 1830, after the invention of the microscope, cellswere identified as the fundamental unit in tumor tissue. In 1858, Rudolf Virchow, the German pathologist andfounder of cellular pathology, first expressed the theory that every cell originates from another cell, a maxim that became the foundation for the modern cellular approach to cancer. Early in the 20th century, health care advocates began to recognize cancer as a significant problem for society.The American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC) was formed in 1913, prompted by the American Medical Association and the American College of Surgeons. Its goalMilestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Back Chapter 5 Cancer Looking Back The Smith papyrus approx. 1600 BC. Marie Francois Xavier Bichat83 was to educate the American public about cancer and help de-stigmatize the disease. In 1937, Congress established theNational Cancer Institute, and in 1945, the ASCC becameknown as the American Cancer Society. Until the 20th century, few cancer patients had any chance for long-term survival. By the 1930s, about one in four patients lived five years post-diagnosis. During the 1940s,cancer claimed 75,000 lives a year in the United States; andby 1970, cancer had become the nation's second-leading cause of death. Fears that cancer was contagious discour-aged public discussion, as did the idea that cancer might be inherited. A major step in changing public perceptionsabout cancer occurred in 1971 when President RichardNixon signed the National Cancer Act, which has been referred to as the \"War on Cancer.\" This legislation mobilized the country's resources to fight cancer by accelerating basic research and its translation totreatment. According to Dr.Vincent T. DeVita, one of thecountry's leading cancer authorities and later the directorof the National Cancer Institute,\"The National Cancer ActMilestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Back Pic.2 Announcement of the National Cancer Institute on August 6,1937. First NCI director Dr. Carl Voegtlin(1938-1943).84of 1971 was a turning point in the long bitter struggle to defeat the disease.\"The mandate that was stated in the actitself was \"to support basic research and applications of theresults of basic research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity from cancer.\" The National Cancer Act resulted from the intense lobbying of the late philanthropist Mary Lasker, who lived in New Y ork City, and the unflagging support ofTexas Senator Ralph W .Yarborough, who spearheaded the legislative effort in Congress. Mrs. Lasker was a patron andadvocate of medical research on cancer, heart disease andblindness. As a volunteer leader of the American Cancer Society in the 1940s, she personally raised the first milliondollars the society invested in cancer research. Mrs. Lasker'spassionate interest in medicine was fueled in part by theillnesses of people around her and by her concern for herown health; she had painful ear infections repeatedly dur- ing her childhood. At the same time, Senator Yarboroughsought to make the conquest of cancer a national priority.He led a group of medical experts, cancer advocates andbusiness leaders who explored the issue; the group became commonly known as the \"Yarborough Commission.\"TheYarborough Report became the blueprint for the National Cancer Act. Lasker and Yarborough argued that government was spend- ing $410 per person per year on defense compared withjust 89 cents per person for cancer research, yet the diseasehad killed 330,000 Americans in 1970 alone.T ogether,they fought to increase government expenditures in cancerresearch and treatment, an unprecedented lobbying effort that became remarkably successful.The resulting NationalCancer Act of 1971 established as a national priority thegoal of conquering cancer and strengthened the NationalCancer Institute's ability to lead the national cancer program. In his May 11 remarks about the 1971 Act, President Nixon explained his rationale for granting special presi-dential interest to the cancer-cure program:\"I have asked Congress to establish a cancer-cure program within theNational Institutes of Health, where it can take the fullestadvantage of other wide-ranging research. At the sametime, it is important that this program be identified as Mary Lasker85one of our highest priorities and that its potential for relieving human suffering not be compromised by the familiar dangers of bureaucracy and red tape. For this reason, I am asking Congress to give the cancer-cure program independent budgetary status and to make its director responsible directly to the president.This effortneeds the full weight and support of the presidency to see to it that it moves toward its goal as expeditiously as possible.\" The government directed its actions in the fight against cancer through the National Cancer Institute. After theNational Cancer Act passed, the National Cancer Institutebecame part of the Public Health Service with special independent authority within the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH). Once housed at NIH, the National CancerInstitute greatly expanded its authorities and resources. Since 1971, research funds have grown from less than $1 million annually to nearly $5 billion.The resultingmobilization of resources granted under the 1971 NationalCancer Act laid the foundation for building the unparal-leled research infrastructure and enterprise that exists today, including a national network of cancer centers thatconduct cutting-edge research and deliver state-of-the-artclinical care.The centers support a strong core of cancerresearch, community-based cancer-prevention programs, and training and continuing education programs for health care professionals.The centers also support clinical trials that offer patients access to new therapies. Cancer: From Fatal to Treatable Early in the 20th century, the only curable cancers weresmall and localized enough to be completely removed by surgery. In 1896, a German physics professor,Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, presented a remarkable lecture titled,\"Concerning a New Kind of Ray.\" He called it the \"X-ray,\" with \"X\" being the algebraic symbol for an unknownquantity.Worldwide excitement about Roentgen's discov-ery arose immediately.Within months, systems were beingdevised to use X-rays for diagnosis; and within three years,radiation began to be used in the treatment of cancer.Radiation was also used after surgery to control small tumor growths that were not surgically removed. In 1901,Roentgen received the first Nobel Prize awarded in physics.Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Back Professor Wilhelm C. Roentgen86 Since 1971, research funds have grown from less than $1 million annually to nearly $5 billion.It wasn't until 1956 that the cure of metastatic cancer became possible, when Dr. Min Chiu Li, who worked atNIH, discovered a cure for choriocarcinoma, a cancer thatoriginates in trophoblastic cells of the placenta (afterbirth).Along with other major research advances, Li demonstratedthat systemic chemotherapy could result in the cure of awidely metastatic malignant disease. By the mid-20th century, scientists began to acquire the resources needed to begin exhaustive research on chemical and biological problems presented by cancer. One of theseresources was the discovery of the exact chemical structure of DNA by Drs. James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 Patient receiving an X-ray in a Roentgen ray apparatus, 1920. Dr. Min Chiu Li, first to cure a formof metastatic cancer.87 An early photograph of Drs. JamesWatson and Francis Crick.in Cambridge, England.This discovery made it possible for scientists to understand how genes worked and how theycould be damaged by mutations. As the understanding ofDNA and genes increased, scientists determined that it was the damage to DNA by chemicals and radiation or the introduction of new DNA sequences by viruses thatoften led to the development of cancer. Scientists also dis-covered that defective genes might be inherited. Offeringconsiderable promise for early screening, these findings onDNA mutation and defective-gene heredity made possiblethe identification of people who had a higher probability ofdeveloping cancer. Although a cure for cancer has yet to be found, 33 years after the U.S. government declared war on cancer, advancesin cancer biology, cancer treatment and prevention havedramatically improved treatment, survival and quality of life for people with cancer.The development and use ofchemotherapy drugs have resulted in the successful treat-ment of many people with cancer. Advances in technologymake it possible to aim radiation more precisely than in the past. New surgical procedures allow for more complete removal of many tumors. And a better understanding of the role of environment and lifestyle on cancer development (chemicals, nutrition, physical activity, smoking, sun and exposure) has led to more effective education about pre-vention. As the former director of the National Cancer Institute, Richard Klausner, MD, said in an interview withTime magazine, \"We may not know how to cure cancer yet, but we do know what we need to do to getthere. And that's very exciting.\" Cancer incidence rates dropped 0.5 percent per year in the last decade of the 20th century (1991-2001), whiledeath rates from all cancers combined dropped 1.1 percentper year from 1993 to 2001 according to the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2001. * This report indicates that death rates for 11 of the top 15 cancers in men decreased 1.5 percent per year from 1993-2001, while death rates for eight of the top 15 cancers inwomen decreased by 0.8 percent per year from 1992-2001. In addition, for men large gains in cancer survival rates(more than 10 percent) were seen in cancers of the pros-tate, colon and kidney and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,melanoma and leukemia. At the same time, childhood Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Back \"We may not know how tocure cancer yet,but we do know what we need todo to get there.And that's veryexciting.\"88cancers showed some of the largest improvements in cancer survival during the past 20 years, with an absolute survivalrate increase of 20 percent in boys and 13 percent in girls.In fact, the current five-year survival rate of over 75 percentconfirms the substantial progress made since the early1970s, when childhood cancers were nearly always fatal.This has been a remarkable accomplishment. Observes John Seffrin, PhD, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society:\"Advances in our understandingof cancer biology have taught us that cancer is not a singledisease that will be conquered with a single 'magic bullet'cure as was believed 30 years ago. T oday, we knowthat cancer is far more complex, representing hundreds ofdiseases, each requiring specialized approaches to treatment.Since its inception, the national cancer program has reapedremarkable returns, revolutionizing the way we prevent, diagnose and treat cancer.We have seen a decline in deathrates for many cancers, and more people are surviving thanever before.We have also dramatically improved quality of life for people with cancer.\" *Cancer-incidence rates and cancer-death rates are measured as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 people per year and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standardpopulation.When a cancer affects only one gender - for example, prostate cancer - then the number is per 100,000 persons of that gender.89 \"T oday, we know that cancer is farmore of diseases, each requiring special- ized approachesto treatment.\"Case Study Screening Tools for Cancer DetectionMilestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Case Study Identifying cancer in its earliest stage, it is widely accepted, leads to improved diagnosis, less radical treat-ment, decreased mortality and lower health care costs.Today, the health care community is fortunate to have a variety of screening tools available to identify cancersin their initial stage.While these screening methods arenot perfect, their use has made early detection, treat-ment and even prevention possible, especially in four of the most common cancers: cervical, breast, prostateand colon. Screening for Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer occurs in the uterine cervix of females.It is often preceded by cervical dysplasia, a precancerouscondition caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and is characterized by a change of cervical cells thatcan be detected by a Papanicolaou smear and confirmedby biopsy. The Papanicolaou smear is a microscopic examination of cells taken from the cervix.This test wasfirst proposed in 1923 by Dr. George Papanicolaou todiagnose uterine cancer. His proposal was not well re-ceived by his colleagues, who argued that the diagnosticmethod was useless. Undeterred, in 1928 Papanicolaoudelivered a lecture called \"New Cancer Diagnosis\"at the Race Betterment Conference in Battle Creek,Michigan, describing more fully the technique thatcame to be known as the \"Pap smear.\"The medical profession still paid no attention to his work. His paper,\"The Diagnostic Value of Vaginal Smears in Carcinomaof the Uterus,\" did not appear in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology until 1941. In 1942, he pub- lished the technique for staining, which he had devel-oped in his Cornell laboratory; it came to be known asthe Papanicolaou stain. In 1954, Papanicolaou publishedhis Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology, and this time his peers immediately accepted the monumental work, nearly 90 Dr. George Papanicolaou first proposed the \"Papsmear\" in 1923. Pap smear technique of taking cells from thecervix.30 years after his first lecture on the topic. In 1957 the American Cancer Society urged women to demand thatPap tests be included in their annual physicals and, further, earmarked 25 percent of its annual budget fortraining Pap test technicians and funding Papanicolaou'scontinued research.Y et it was not until 1988 that theAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology rec-ommended an annual Pap smear to all women who are sexually active or have reached 18 years of age. The incidence of cervical cancer, once a major cause of death in U.S. women, has markedly decreaseddue almost entirely to the advent of the Papanicolaousmear. In fact, between 1955 and 1992 the number ofcervical cancer deaths in the United States dropped by74 percent.The death rate from cervical cancer contin-ues to decline by about two percent a year. Detecting cervical cancer in its early stages is lifesaving, as survival of cancer of the cervix depends heavily on stage at diagnosis. Unfortunately, elderly,African-American and low-income women are less likely tohave regular Pap tests. Similarly, cervical cancer deathsare higher in populations around the world where The incidence ofcervical cancer...has markedly decreased due almost entirely tothe advent of thePapanicolaou smear.91 TestAmerican Cancer Society Cervical Cancer Detection Guidelines Yearly with conventional Pap test or every 2 years with liquid-based Pap test. *Doctors may suggest a woman be screened more often if she has certain risk factors, such as HIV infection or a weak immune system. Women with a history of cervical cancer, DES exposure, or who have a weak immune system should continue screening as long as they are in reasonably good health.Age Frequency After 3 normal results in a row, screening can be every 2 - 3 years.An alternative is a Pap test plus HPV DNA testing and conventional or liquid-based cytology every 3 years.* After 3 normal Pap smears in a row within the past 10 years, women may choose to stop screening. Discuss with health care provider.Pap test Pelvic examStart 3 years after first vaginal intercourse but no later than 21 Over 30 Over 70 Not specifiedMilestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Case Study women do not have routine Pap tests. In fact, cervical cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths in women 92 in many developing countries.These cases are usuallydiagnosed at an invasive late stage, rather than as pre-cancers or early cancers. Recognizing the impressive value of the Pap smear as a screening tool for early detection of cervical cancer,Congress passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mor-tality Prevention Act of 1990.This act authorized cervi-cal cancer screening services for underserved women,including older women, women with low incomes andwomen of racial and ethnic minority groups. In short, when cervical cancer is found early and treated, it hasproved to be highly curable. Most deaths from cervicalcancer could be avoided, therefore, if women have regu-lar checkups with the Pap test. Screening for Breast Cancer Breast cancer is any type of cancerous growth in thebreast tissue. It is frequently diagnosed, second only toskin cancer diagnosis in women, and is the second lead-ing cause of cancer death among women in the UnitedStates. In 2001, about 192,200 new cases of invasivebreast cancer were diagnosed and 40,200 women died ofthe disease.The incidence of breast cancer has increasedin recent years, and much of the increase can be attrib-uted to the detection of smaller, earlier-stage cancers inasymptomatic women using mammography screening. Incontrast to the increased detection of breast cancer, deathrates decreased annually between 1990 and 2001 by 2.3percent per year.This decline in breast cancer mortalityhas been attributed to mammography screening and toimprovements in breast cancer treatment. Mammography is one of several screening tools for detecting early breast cancer. Screening mammogramsare simply X-rays of each breast.The breast is placedbetween two imaging plates for a few seconds while theX-rays are taken. In addition to mammograms, otherscreening tests used to detect breast cancer are clinical MRI of cancerous breast tissue.breast exams and breast self-exams.A clinical breast ex- am is an exam done by a health professional to feel forlumps and look for changes in the size or shape of thebreasts.A breast self-exam is an exam done by a womanherself. Physicians recommend that women dobreast self-exams once a month starting in their 20s,about a week after their periods end. In the same way,between the ages of 20 and 39, every woman shouldhave a clinical breast exam every three years, and afterage 40 every woman should have a clinical breast exameach year.Although about 15 percent of tumors felt byclinical breast exam cannot be seen by regular mammo-graphic screening, mammograms often detect tumors before they can be felt in clinical breast exams or breastself-exams; they can also identify tiny specks of calcium(microcalcifications) that could be an early sign of cancer.Therefore, a high-quality mammogram with aclinical breast exam is the most effective way to detectbreast cancer early. Several large studies conducted around the world show that breast cancer screening with mammograms reducesthe number of deaths from breast cancer for women aged 40 to 69, especially those over age 50. Havingannual mammograms provides a 20 percent to 30 per-cent reduction in the breast cancer mortality rate forwomen 50 years old and older. However, mammography is not without controversy. Cost-effectiveness estimatesof mammography screening - based on methodology,population and interval - vary widely; it is estimatedthat breast cancer screening costs $3,400 to more than$83,000 per life-year saved. However, many experts andhealth care advocates believe that mammography offersthe potential for significant benefits in addition to mor-tality reduction, including early diagnosis, less aggressivetherapy and improved cosmetic results. Some of the most important contributions toward awareness of breast cancer screening in the United States came in 1974.At that time, three women in the public eye were battling cancer at the same time: Having annualmammogramsprovides a 20percent to for women50 years old andolder.93 Physicians recommend that every woman do a breast self-exam once a month, about a week after herperiod ends.Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Case Study Betty Ford, Susan G. Komen and Rose Kushner.When Betty Ford was first diagnosed, breast cancer was rarelydiscussed in public and little was known about the dis-ease.The first lady was the first high-profile Americanwoman to publicly discuss her breast cancer, and she gained legions of admirers for the candor with whichshe faced her disease, as well as for her support of breastcancer awareness, screening and research. Susan G. Komen, also battling breast cancer, asked her sister Nancy before she died to promise that she woulddo whatever she could to help other women facingbreast cancer. In 1982, Nancy Brinker established theSusan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation based onthat promise. Since then, the Komen Foundation hasbeen instrumental in changing the way people thinkabout breast cancer by inspiring a nationwide move-ment and rallying millions to the cause. Since its incep-tion, the Komen Foundation has raised $450 million for breast cancer research and community outreach programs; a majority of these proceeds come from the popular Komen Race for the Cure Series, which draws 1.4 million people each year. Journalist Rose Kushner's discovery in June 1974 of a breast lump that proved to be cancerous changed herlife. Finding that there was little information availablefor the general public, she researched the topic in med-ical and technical publications and kept notes as she underwent lumpectomy and reconstructive surgery.Anarticle based on her experience appeared in The Wash- ington Post and was syndicated in hundreds of newspa- pers. Her book Breast Cancer: A Personal History and Investigative Report (1975) was revised and reprinted twice, as were Why Me? (1977) and Alternatives (1984). For her books and numerous articles about breast can- cer, Rose Kushner received the Medal of Honor (1987)and the Courage Award (1988) from the American Cancer Society. She founded the Breast Cancer Adviso-ry Center in 1975 to provide information and support for breast cancer patients and has frequently testified before Congress on health and cancer topics.94 Former first lady Betty Ford in 1974. Rose Kushner in 1986.95 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by lung cancer. It accountsfor 29 percent of all male cancers and 11 percent ofmale cancer-related deaths. Modern methods of detec-tion and treatment mean that prostate cancers are nowdetected earlier and treated more effectively, leading to decreases in death rates in recent years.The mostcommon screening methods are testing the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood and a digital rectal examination (DRE). Prostate cancer screening was first implemented in the 1970s with the use of the DRE. However, DRE often detects disease in patients whose prostate cancerhas already spread to other organs.The developmentand application of PSA for early detection and screen-ing has led many patients to be diagnosed at an earlierstage than with DRE screening alone. PSA was firstused experimentally in 1979 to monitor patients afterprostate cancer treatment as a measure of disease recur-rence and/or progression. Beginning in 1989, some evi- dence of its value in detecting early prostate cancer inmen with no symptoms or signs of prostate disease wasTestAmerican Cancer Society Breast Cancer Detection Guidelines Optional.Women should be told about benefits and limitations of BSE.They should know how their breasts feel normally andreport any differences to their health care professional. *Women at increased risk (family history, genetic tendency, past breast cancer) should talk with their doctors about the benefits and limitations of starting mammography screening earlier, having additional tests (such as breast ultrasound,MRI) or having more frequent exams.Age Frequency Part of a periodic health exam, preferably every 3 years.

Moreover, the principal strengths of the PSA test are its superior sensitivity, reasonable cost and highpatient acceptance. Since the use of early-detection tests for prostate cancer became relatively common in 1990, the prostate cancerdeath rate has dropped. It has been suggested that de-clines in mortality rates in certain communities reflectthe benefit of PSA screening. Over the past 20years, the survival rate for prostate cancer has increased from 67 percent to 97 percent.Among men diagnosedwith prostate cancer, 98 percent survive at least 5 years,84 percent survive at least 10 years, and 56 percent survive at least 15 years. Of the men whose prostatecancers have already spread to distant parts of the bodyat the time of diagnosis, 34 percent will survive at least5 years. In 1992, the American Cancer Society published a recommendation that men over 50 years of age be tested annually by DRE and PSA; later, it was modified to recommend that men discuss PSA testingwith their physicians and make an informed decisionabout whether to be tested. In recent years, however,the PSA test has met with controversy. In September2004, Dr.Thomas Stamey, a professor of urology atStanford University who championed the test in 1987 as a tool for prostate cancer detection, published a scientific paper stating flatly that \"the PSA era is over.\"96 Test *Defined as African-American men or those with a strong family history (one or more affected first-degree relatives, such as fathers or brothers, diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age). Men at even higher risk, due to multiplefirst-degree relatives affected at an early age, could begin testing at age 40. Depending on the results of the initial test,no further testing might be needed until age 45.Age Frequency Over 50 (average risk)American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Detection Guidelines Digital rectal exam(DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)blood testShould be offered yearly (along with information on benefits and limitations) to men with at least a 10-year life expectancy. Over 50 (high risk *)Yearly (along with information on potential risks and limitations).Over the past 20 years, the survival rate forprostate cancerhas increasedfrom 67 percentto 97 percent.97 Essentially, Stamey wrote that he realized over the years that high PSA levels are merely indicators of prostateenlargement, not prostate cancer. Since then, many doctors and scientists have weighed in, with some taking Stamey's side and others questioning his findings.However, the American Cancer Society continues torecommend that men 50 years and older who have at least 10 years life expectancy with average risk be testedannually with PSA and DRE.Although PSA testingmay lead to needless biopsies that remove part of theprostate tissue to make the diagnosis, all men should be made aware of the limitations and benefits of early detection of prostate cancer. Screening for Colon Cancer Colon cancer, a disease in which cancerous cells form in the tissues of the colon, is the third mostcommon cancer in the United States and the secondleading cause of cancer death. It is generally acceptedthat most colon cancers develop from polyps, non-cancerous growths in the colon, which can progress tocancer. Screening reduces colon cancer morbidity andmortality by both diagnosing the disease at a more favorable stage and preventing disease by removing precancerous lesions.There are four common screeningtests for colorectal cancer that may be used alone or detect blood in the stool, which may come from either a cancer or, more commonly,large polyps (greater than two centimeters).A positiveFOBT is the trigger for a diagnostic work-up of theentire colon with DCBE or colonoscopy to identify thesource of bleeding.A sigmoidoscopy allows for directvisualization by the physician of the distal bowel (bowelat the farthest distance), and it is more sensitive and specific for adenocarcinomas and polyps than theFOBT. DCBE is a series of X-rays of the colon and Colon cancer...is the third mostcommon cancerin the UnitedStates and thesecond leadingcause of cancerdeath.Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Case Study rectum taken after the patient is given an enema, followed by an injection of air.The barium outlines the intestines on the X-rays, allowing many abnormalgrowths to be visible. The most successful screening tool for detecting colon cancer, the colonoscopy, has the added benefit of totalbowel visualization plus the ability to remove adenomas.A study published in 2000 in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Lindsay Frazier, MD of Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, found that therewould be significantly fewer deaths from colorectal cancer if a single colonoscopy was performed during a person's lifetime.The findings were contained in acost-effectiveness analysis of 22 screening methods forcolon cancer. Unfortunately, findings from the National Health Interview Survey, administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), indicate that in2000 only 45 percent of men and 41 percent of womenaged 50 years or older had undergone a sigmoidoscopyor colonoscopy within the previous 10 years or hadused an FOBT home test kit within the preceding year.Due to the low use of these screening tools, only 38percent of colon cancers are found in an early stage. There is a clear need to increase awareness and promote the use of colorectal cancer screening examinations atregular intervals. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with colon cancer, and the surrounding publicity raised awareness of screening. Since the death from colon cancer in 1998 of Katie Couric's 42-year-old husband, Jay Monahan, the popular televi-sion \"T oday Show\" co-host has devoted much of herprofessional and personal life to raising awareness of the disease. Research completed by the University ofMichigan found that awareness efforts had increasedcolonoscopy rates by 20 percent due to what the researchers called \"The Couric Effect.\"98 ...there would be significantly fewer deathsfrom colorectalcancer if a singlecolonoscopy wasperformed dur-ing a person'slifetime.Currently, CDC and partner organizations are seeking to increase the use of screening tests for colon cancer.For example, CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have created and implemented\"Screen for Life,\" a multimedia campaign promotingcolorectal cancer screening. CDC has also developed a training program for health care providers, titled A Call to Action ,designed to increase their awareness of and knowledge about prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer.The American Cancer Society haslaunched an ambitious public awareness campaign tohelp consumers understand their colon cancer risk andencourage them to discuss testing options with theirdoctors.99 TestAmerican Cancer Society Colorectal Cancer Detection Guidelines Yearly *Combined testing is preferred over either FOBT or FIT, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, alone.

In the past, the public did not perceive exposure to the sun, whetherthrough purposeful sun tanning or through work outdoors, as danger-ous. However, more than one million cases of basal cell or squamous cell cancer are diagnosed annually. Skin cancer is a largely preventable disease if sun protective practices are used consistently. Interestingly, it was only in 1978 that sun expo-sure was first linked to skin cancer through research. In 1986, a studypresented by Dr. Robert Stern, Chief of Dermatology at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, found that using sun protection factor SPF 15 sunscreen regularly during the first 18 years of life - when 80 percent of lifetime sun exposure occurs - might reduce by 78 percent a person's lifetime risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. SPF measures a sunscreen's ability to absorb UVB rays andgenerally indicates how much longer an individual can stay in the sun before burning. After the release of this study, a young child'ssunburned shoulders and face, once seen as cute, were viewed as dangerous, and promoting the use of sunscreen became an integralpart of skin cancer prevention programs. Who invented sunscreen is not exactly clear, but this much is known. In the early 1930s, a young chemist in South Australia,H.A. Milton Blake, experimented in a kitchen with some friends to produce a sunburn cream.The University of Adelaide tested theproduct, gave it a thumbs up, and Hamilton Laboratories was born.In 1936, a French scientist named Eugene Schueller, the founder of L'Oreal, invented the first sunscreen, according to his company'sWeb site. During World War II, airman and future pharmacist Ben- jamin Green developed a sun-protective formula for soldiers. Later,in 1944, Green invented a suntan cream called \"Coppertone SuntanCream\" in his Miami Beach kitchen. In 1945, he added \"CoppertoneSuntan Oil\" to the line, promoted by the slogan \"Don't be a paleface.\" In 1972, the Coppertone brand introduced the SPF system in the U.S.,but the FDA did not revise its sunscreen regulations until 1993 to state that sunscreens with a high SPF were effective in stoppingUVB penetration that might cause skin cancer. In addition to usingsunscreen products, sun-safety awareness campaigns have reinforcedother preventive measures, such as avoiding the sun between 11 a.m.and 3 p.m. and wearing sun-protective clothing.In 1990, the United States Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health founded the Human GenomeProject, an international collaborative research program. Itsgoal was the complete mapping and sequencing of all thegenes of human beings, and remarkably this goal was ful-filled only a decade later in June 2000. In April 2003, witha high-quality,\"finished\" sequence completed, the findingson human genomes were made available to researchers andthe public. Since then, the medical industry has continuedto build upon the Human Genome Project's findings tofurther understanding of genetic contributions to humanhealth. Specifically, medical professionals from all specialtiesare turning their attention to investigating the role thatgenes play in health and disease. Knowledge of the human genome is being used to prevent and control cancer. Utilizing new genetic informa-tion, scientists have found the mutations in genes or groupsof genes that cause many cancers. Scientists have foundthat diseases such as breast cancer and colon cancer alsohave hereditary forms.This knowledge enables health careand public health professionals to help people they identifyas at risk for developing a cancer, first by studying theirgenes and then by developing customized prevention ortreatment programs that use pharmaceutical or therapeuticapproaches. Cancer Gene Identification Cancer genetics seeks to discover how genomic informa- tion can be used to identify cancer-predisposing genes.Identification of cancer-susceptibility genes is importantbecause it will help physicians to make more informedmedical decisions in order to restore normal life expectan-cy of people at a genetically increased risk for cancer. Inaddition, understanding the mechanisms of cancer growthin inherited cancers will offer insights into common cancerdevelopment. As genes that might cause cancer are identified, it becomes possible to screen for cancer genes through genetic tests.Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Genomic Research and Medicine101 Utilizing new genetic informa-tion, scientistshave found themutations in genes or groupsof genes thatcause many cancers.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that genetic testing be offered under the following condi-tions. /rhombus6The individual has a personal or family history of a genetic cancer risk. /rhombus6Results will help diagnose the cancer or influence the medical care of a patient or family member. In genetic testing, an affected family member should be tested first for the presence or absence of a specific muta-tion. If no mutation is found, unaffected family membersneed not be offered genetic testing. On the other hand,if a mutation is detected in an affected individual, then immediate family members should be tested for the pres-ence or absence of the same mutation. If the mutation isnot found, the genes carried by the affected relative do not increase the risk in the unaffected relative. However,these unaffected relatives can still develop cancer later inlife, although the risk is usually much less than the risk for the mutation carriers. The opportunity of identifying individuals in a preclinical state through genetic tests and initiating preventive therapypromises to avert disease treatment costs and suffering. Inaddition, advances in laboratory technology and in theidentification of cancer-susceptibility genes such as BR-CA1, BRCA2 and MSH2 will soon make it possible to test large segments of the population for cancer risk. However,the expansion of genetic testing poses other kinds of risks- medical, personal, psychosocial and economic. Publichealth professionals and medical ethicists will debate howto balance this potentially useful genetic information withthe dangers of privacy invasion, insurance denials and employment issues. Pharmacogenomics Genomic-sequence information can be used to design highly targeted pharmaceutical therapies. Pharmaceuticalgenomics or \"pharmacogenomics\" has evolved as the studyof how an individual's genetic inheritance affects the body'sresponse to drugs.This area of study holds the promise that drugs might one day be tailored for individuals and adaptedto each person's own genetic makeup. Understanding anindividual's genetic makeup is thought to be the key toMilestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Ahead 102creating personalized drugs that work safely and with greater efficacy, although environment, diet, age, lifestyle and state of health also greatly influence a person's responseto medicines. Pharmacogenomics might also help to improve the side- effect profiles of cancer-drug therapy. Although chemother-apy is an effective and established treatment, its toxicity issignificant. Infections, nausea, vomiting, nerve pain, andhair loss are common and can be an obstacle to complet-ing a patient's recommended course of therapy, reducing its effectiveness. As a result, scientists have begun using the human genome sequence to design specific drugs thatmaximize therapeutic effects, inhibit malignant-cell growthand decrease damage to nearby healthy cells. Gene Therapy Gene therapy is an approach to treating disease that either modifies the expressions of an individual's genes or corrects abnormal genes.The concept of gene therapywas introduced in the late 1970s after the development of recombinant DNA technology. In 1990, Drs.WilliamFrench Anderson, Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver,researchers at the National Institutes of Health, performed the first successful gene therapy in humans.The team successfully treated a then four-year-old, Ashanthi DeSilva,for adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, a rare geneticdisease in which children are born with severe immuno-Pic.9103 From left to right: Drs.

With the complete sequencing of the human genome, scientists have more resources to further develop gene therapy. In particular, gene therapy represents a new field of medicine that can potentially cure some forms of cancer.All cancers have a genetic structure, triggered by alteredgenes in cancer cells, and a different gene or set of genesalso controls the progression of a cell from normal to malignant to invasive. Currently, researchers are studyingseveral approaches to treating cancer using gene therapy.Some approaches target healthy cells to enhance their ability to fight cancer, while others target cancer cells todestroy them or prevent their growth. The Future of Genomics in Medicine The genomic era is now a reality. Experts have begun to understand the role of genetic factors in health and diseaseand to use this knowledge in prevention, diagnosis andtreatment.The completion of the human genome sequenceis impacting public health. In furthering society's interest in good public health, advances in medical applications ofgenomic research improve the conditions that ensure thatpeople can be healthy. Researchers hope that in the next10 years, genetic tests for many common conditions willhelp alleviate inherited risk and that by the year 2020gene-based designer drugs will be available for many con-ditions. Perhaps the most exciting prediction is thatcancer treatment will precisely target the molecular finger-prints of particular tumors, and genetic information will be used routinely to give patients more appropriate drugtherapy, avoiding unnecessary side effects and increasingchances of cure. Nevertheless, the ultimate use and inter-pretation of genetic information raises ethical, social,psychological and political issues. Consequently, publichealth and governmental authorities need to improve theinfrastructure capabilities that will be needed to widely implement genomics' medical applications. Public healthand government will also need to create regulatory policyto control the negative implications of genetic information,confronting such issues as privacy, labor and insurance discrimination, ethics and psychological consequences for affected families, among others.Milestones .Chapter 5 .Cancer .Looking Ahead ...the most excit- ing prediction isthat treatmentwill precisely target the molec-ular fingerprintsof particular tumors, will be usedto give patientsmore appropriatedrug therapy.104As Dr. Seffrin of the American Cancer Society points out, \"The public, private and nonprofit sectors must diligentlywork together to advance groundbreaking cancer research. Prior investments in cancer research have laid the founda-tion for a period of unparalleled success.\" However, current funding constraints allow the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to fund only one in five eligible research projects, forcing the NCI to pass over many excit- ing cancer research opportunities.With authorities grantedunder the 1971 National Cancer Act, the NCI director develops a strategic plan for cancer research each year thatreflects the best thinking of cancer researchers, patients, clinicians and other constituency groups. As Seffrin explains,\"The goal for the nation must be to provide adequate funding to explore the most promising opportu-nities in cancer research as outlined in this plan. Remark-able achievements such as the mapping of the humangenome make new and better cancer treatments inevitableif we invest more of our health expenditures on researchand development. Landmark discoveries such as cancer vaccines, targeted therapies and chemoprevention are lead- ing to a paradigm shift in how cancer is treated and tothousands of lives being saved every year.\" Seffrin also believes it is critically important to bridge the gap between science and practical application. In arenaswhere public health has united to drive delivery at thecommunity level, there have been impressive results.\"Withstate-of-the-art cancer care, 67 percent to 80 percent ofcurrent cancer patients will survive long-term,\" explainsSeffrin. \"Tragically, however, nowhere near 100 percent of cancer patients today will receive state-of-the-art cancer care. In fact, only about 60 percent will receiveso-called 'standard care.' A cardinal principle of publichealth states that 'access to the means for the attainmentand preservation of health is a basic human right.' In truth, however, full access to our health care system and to the best in cancer care is sometimes available only to a privileged few.\" To implement a comprehensive cancer control program, according to Seffrin, disparate public health organizationsshould unite to deliver understandable and actionable cancer prevention and treatment information that increases105 \"Tragically, how-ever, nowhere near 100 percentof cancer patientstoday will receivestate-of-the-artcancer care.\" John Seffrin, PhD, chief executive of the American Cancer Society.patients' health literacy. At the same time, medical schools should improve education to enhance delivery of cancerprevention, and early-detection services, hospitals and treatment centers should improve health records systems to help coordinate prevention and screening efforts.Finally, policymakers should require that all insurers cover and reimburse for evidence-based prevention and early-detection services.

However, cardiovas-cular disease (CVD) remains the leadingkiller for both men and women amongall racial and ethnic groups in theUnited States. Indeed, cardiovasculardisease was the greatest epidemic of the 20th century, outstripping infec-tious diseases such as polio and AIDS.The epidemic peaked around 1968 inthe United States, with an impressive2.6 percent decline in CVD mortalityper year from 1968 to 1990.Thesedeclines have been recognized as one of the greatest health achievements inthe 20th century. Despite these declines, one person dies every 30 seconds from CVD, more than 2,600 people every day. Almost onemillion Americans die of CVD each year, representing 42percent of all deaths. Of these, 160,000 are individualsbetween the ages of 35 and 64 years, an indication of howwidespread CVD is in the population, not just among olderAmericans. Heart disease and stroke account for nearly sixmillion hospitalizations each year and cause disability foralmost 10 million Americans aged 65 years and older.Thecosts of treatment approach $329 billion each year whenlost productivity from disability is factored in, encompass-ing physicians, professionals, hospital and nursing homeservices, medications and home health care.There is evi-dence that, despite the declines in death rates, the rate ofnew cases of CVD has not declined. A large proportion of CVD patients are living with their disease. By 2050, anestimated 25 million Americans will carry the diagnosis of coronary heart disease.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease 107 Chapter 6 Cardiovascular Disease The human heart.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Looking Back Looking Back A Brief History of Cardiology108 One of the earliest physicians, Imhotep (circa 2725 BC), was regarded in ancient Egypt as the god of medicine. He is said to have been the first to connect the pulse rate withthe resulting action of the heart. It was not until the time ofHippocrates (460-377 BC), in ancient Greece, that the heartwas mentioned again in medical rather than spiritual or mysterious terms. Hippocrates believed that the heart was a strong muscle and understood enough of its structure thathe provided theories on the function of the heart's valves. Roughly another 500 years passed before Claudius Galen (AD 130-201), considered the father of cardiology, studiedthe heart in detail. An authority on anatomy in ancientRome, Galen was not allowed to dissect human bodies.Rather, his knowledge of the heart came from dissectingBarbary apes. It was no surprise, therefore, that much ofGalen's work proved later to be incorrect. Nonetheless, hisinterest in the anatomy of the heart laid the foundation ofcardiac study in future centuries. In the 16th century, more progress in understanding the true function of the heart was made.The work of MiguelServetus (1511-1553), a Spaniard, preceded the discoveriesof William Harvey on blood circulation. Unfortunately, hiswork went unrecognized as he linked his medical views with theological writings that were deemed heretical.Fortunately, Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), a graduate of Padua University in Italy, enjoyed greater intellectualfreedom, leading to the publication in the mid-1500s of his studies on the heart. Another graduate of Padua University was William Harvey, an Englishman. Harvey was fascinated by the way bloodflowed through the human body. In 1628, he published An Anatomical Study of the Motion of the Heart and of the Blood inAnimals ,which explained how blood is pumped from the heart throughout the body, then returning to the heart andrecirculated. Harvey's views, controversial at the time, con- tradicted the belief of many people that the liver and notthe heart caused blood to flow. Harvey's work became thebasis for modern research on the heart and blood vessels. William Harvey explained how the heartpumps and recirculatesblood. Imhotep (circa 2725 BC).It is likely that both Vesalius and Harvey were greatly influenced by the anatomi- cal drawings of Leonardo da Vinci(1452-1519) showing the structure ofthe heart. After injecting a human hearttaken from a corpse with liquid wax,da Vinci more clearly illustrated the different components of the organ.Nearly two centuries later, the inven-tion of the microscope by Anton vanLeeuwenhock (1632-1723) opened new doors to an understanding of capillaries, small veins and arteries. In 1714, the English physiologist, chemist and inventor Stephen Hales(1677-1761) conducted the first experi-ments with blood pressure when heopened an artery of a horse, inserted abrass tube, determined the existence ofsomething called blood pressure anddevised a mechanism for measuring it. Hales published his experimental findings under the titleHaemastaticks .He also discovered that blood pressure varied between veins and arteries and between the contractionsand dilations of the heart. Safer methods for measuringblood pressure appeared more than a century later with Marey's wrist sphygmograph, designed in 1857, followed by Dudgeon's, designed in 1882. Both were great steps forward in the search for convenient, simplified ways tomeasure blood pressure. At the time, Dudgeon's device was so successful that it became standard equipment for the U. S. Navy. R.T.H. La\u00ebnnec, a French physician, first began using a hollow wooden cylinder in the early 1800s, the earliestversion of a stethoscope. By the end of the 19th century, flexible, binaural stethoscopes were common. Althoughsome physicians felt the invention of the stethoscope weak-ened the physician's own powers of diagnosis, the stetho-scope offered an immediate diagnosis at a minimal cost. The invention of the electrocardiograph by Willem Einthoven of the Netherlands enabled physicians tobecome differentiated as specialists in heart disease.109 Drawing of the human heart and blood vesselsby Leonardo da Vinci.

Cardiovascular disease usually presents as three distinct types: coronary artery disease (CAD), strokeand peripheral arterial disease. Atypical presentations alsoabound. Risk factors include nonmodifiable risks -age, gender, race and family history - and behaviorallymodifiable risks, such as obesity, high-fat and high-cholesterol diet, a sedentary lifestyle and smoking. CVD isalso caused by physiologic risk factors, such as hyperten-sion, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2),which often require pharmacologic treatments in additionto lifestyle modifications. Various tests used to screen for CVD provide a hopeful path to uncovering and treating early cardiovascular diseasebefore it develops into a more serious condition. Physicianscan use simple, noninvasive tests, such as risk-factor assess-ments before moving to more complicated - and usuallymore expensive and invasive - tests later. Risk factors forheart disease to be assessed in patients over age 20 include: /rhombus6Family history of CVD /rhombus6Smoking status /rhombus6Diet, cholesterol and physical activity /rhombus6Blood pressure /rhombus6Body weight and body mass index /rhombus6Waist circumference /rhombus6Fasting blood lipid profile /rhombus6Fasting blood glucose These risk factors can be used to calculate a global risk score in people 40 years and older, providing an estimate of the 10-year risk of heart attacks and death from cardiacdisease.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Case Study Case Study Risk Assessment111 Risk factors include non-modifiable risks -age, gender, raceand obesity,high-fat andhigh-cholesteroldiet, a sedentarylifestyle andsmoking.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Case Study Advances in the tests currently available for heart disease continue to evolve.

As a screeningtool, blood levels of inflammatory markers may one daybecome as familiar as cholesterol and blood pressure numbers, but tests with greater specificity need to be developed.

Most cholesterol is carried in the blood in two forms, high-densitylipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with onlyHDL considered advantageous for fighting the accumulation ofplaque in the blood vessels that leads to CVD. A high LDL level, onthe other hand, usually signifies that a patient is at risk for CVD. Federal guidelines on cholesterol have changed in the last ten years, with stronger recommendations for lowering total cholesterol whilemaintaining appropriate HDL levels.The current guidelines are: /rhombus6Patients should consume no more than seven percent of calories from saturated fat (the previous recommendation was ten percent). /rhombus6Adults are advised to consume no more than 35 percent of calories from total fat (the previous recommendation had been30 percent), provided that the main source is unsaturated fats,which do not raise cholesterol levels. /rhombus6Ideal body weight should be attained and maintained. /rhombus6The new target for dietary cholesterol is less than 200 mg per day (the previous target had been under 300 mg per day). /rhombus6An optimal LDL-C level is 100mg/dL or less per day for all adults. The recommendations can be difficult for the average healthy con- sumer to follow, and ideal LDL-cholesterol levels may be especiallydifficult for some CVD patients to achieve through diet alone.Thedevelopment of the class of drugs known as statins has changed theway many physicians manage patients with high cholesterol. Clinical knowledge of how to counteract elevated blood cholesterol dates back only three decades. Research into inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, part of the body's metabolic pathway for the synthesisof cholesterol, began in T okyo, Japan, in 1971 in the laboratory of Drs. Endo and Kuroda.This team reasoned that certain microorgan-isms may produce inhibitors of this particular enzyme to defendthemselves against other organisms.The first agent to be isolated wasmevastatin, a molecule produced by Penicillium citrinum .The pharma- ceutical company Merck showed an interest in the research in 1976and isolated lovastatin from the mold Aspergillus terreus .Lovastatin would become the first statin to be commercially marketed and would have a dramatic effect on the way high cholesterol is treated.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Vignette 114 Vignette StatinsMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic As of 2005, six statin drugs are on the market in the United States. Studies using statins have reported 20 percent to 60 percent lowerLDL-cholesterol levels in patients on these drugs. Statins also reduce elevated triglyceride levels and produce a modest increase in HDL-cholesterol.While most patients tolerate statins well, side effects can include muscle aches and abnormal liver function tests. Some have questioned the safety of statins, especially given their widespread use in the U.S. When a statin is given at a high dose,the risk for developing abnormalities in liver tests is one to two percent per year. These abnormalities can be reversed, however, bysimply reducing the dose or by stopping the drug. Another commonside effect, occurring in somewhere between one to two percent ofpatients, is muscle aches or, more rarely, inflammation of the muscles,called myopathy, in which an enzyme from the muscle leaks into theblood. Which patients are considered candidates for statin therapy? The list is lengthy. /rhombus6Those who have had heart attacks or chest pain or those who have undergone bypass surgery or angioplasty, with an LDL-cholesterol greater than 100 mg/dL. /rhombus6Those with diabetes and those with multiple other risk factors for heart disease with an LDL-cholesterol greater than 100 mg/dL. /rhombus6Those with evidence of blockage in the arteries carrying blood to the brain (carotid artery disease) or the legs (peripheral vascu-lar disease). /rhombus6Those with LDL-cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL and two other risk factors after a therapeutic lifestyle change or thosewith LDL-cholesterol greater than 190 mg/dL with either one or no risk factors. As research progresses, however, new lipid targets may be recognized. Statin treatment gained unintended public attention with the emer- gency heart bypass operation of former president William Clinton in2004. Some years earlier, an elevated cholesterol count led the formerpresident's doctor to prescribe a statin to counter what was feared tobe incipient heart disease.When the count returned to safe levels rel-atively quickly, President Clinton chose to discontinue use rather thanfollow medical advice and continue to take the statin. As the worlddiscovered, that choice may have been a factor in the former presi-dent's development of coronary disease, underscoring the rule thatonce a patient begins a regimen of statins, he should continue thatregimen for the rest of his life.115Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The growing epidemic of obesity in young people offers the public health community a challenge and an opportu-nity to prevent disease and instill healthy lifestyles. How to prevent obesity is no secret - a combination of physicalactivity and wise choices in nutrition can have an immedi-ate impact on weight and foster long-lasting healthy behav-ior. Reduced weight helps prevent diabetes and cardiovas-cular disease, among other health threats caused by beingoverweight. Success in this endeavor does not happen overnight and requires a long-term commitment. An investment made today by the public health and medicalcommunities, along with schools and governments, will pay dividends in future healthy adult populations. The American Heart Association estimates that the preva- lence of obesity has increased by 75 percent since 1991.Metabolic syndrome, perhaps the earliest warning sign ofdeveloping health problems, occurs predominantly in peo-ple who are overweight. As many as 55 million Americansmay meet the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. In 1988, Dr. Gerald M. Reavan, an endocrinologist at Stanford University, first described something he calledSyndrome X, noting that patients who presented with acluster of low-level risk factors had a substantially increasedrisk for heart disease. In 1991, the National Cholesterol Education Program at the National Institutes of Healthissued a report that renamed Syndrome X as metabolicsyndrome.The report emphasized obesity as a central component of metabolic syndrome and recommendedother screening tests that would be easy for primary caredoctors to use. Physicians suspect metabolic syndrome when people pres- ent with at least three of the following five criteria: havingan increased girth around the abdomen, having moderatelyhigh blood pressure, having high blood levels of fats calledtriglycerides, having low levels of HDL (\"good\") choles-terol and having above-average blood sugar. It has beenestimated that one million U.S. teenagers have been diag-nosed with the syndrome, representing four percent ofAmerican adolescents.These youths are believed to be atMilestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Obesity in Young Populations116One-third to one-half of the populationwith metabolicsyndrome subse-quently developsdiabetes.sharply increased risk for developing diabetes when they are still in their 20s, if not before, and heart disease as earlyas their 40s. The American Heart Association Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Y oung recommends early detection of bloodpressure elevation. Management for primary hypertensionincludes dietary counseling and physical activity prescrip-tions. Pharmaceuticals are reserved only for children whoseblood pressure is consistently very high. Moderation in the use of salt is also recommended, since the diet of the aver-age American child contains much more sodium than isrequired. Michael Weitzman and Steve Cook of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Center for Child Health Researchand the Department of Pediatrics at the University ofRochester analyzed data on 2,430 adolescents aged 12 to 19 between 1988 and 1994 for the National Health andNutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representativeongoing federal survey of the U.S. population.The studyshowed that 4.2 percent of adolescents, or 910,000 teens,met the criteria for metabolic syndrome.The syndrome wasfound in at least 6.1 percent of males and 2.1 percent offemales.The researchers found that nearly 30 percent ofthose who are either overweight or obese have the syn-drome. Fortunately, if this population loses weight, the riskof diabetes and heart disease drops sharply. One-third to one-half of the population with meta- bolic syndrome subsequently develops diabetes. Even beforethe onset of diabetes, high blood lipids and other risk fac-tors can cause cardiovascular disease.The earlier mean ageof onset for type 2 diabetes of adolescents is startling and disturbing, because CVD development that takes place overmany years in adults starts much earlier, potentially leadingto onset of CVD in early and mid adulthood. Being over-weight is nearly always the trigger for type 2 diabetes (ver- sus type 1 diabetes, which is triggered by abnormalities ininsulin production and usually diagnosed in childhood).The onset of diabetes carries with it the distressing proba-bility of cardiovascular disease within two decades, greatlyincreasing the chances for premature death. Black andHispanic Americans have nearly twice the incidence oftype 2 diabetes as whites and many Native American tribesare experiencing epidemic rates.117The number of the agesof six and 19.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The number of overweight children tripled between 1970 and 2000, reaching 15 percent of those between theages of six and 19.The highest growth rates have been inAfrican-American and Hispanic youth who live mainly in inner cities, where access to opportunities for physicalactivity is often limited. In addition, research has shownthat adolescents who exhibit high levels of hostility aremore prone to becoming obese and developing insulinresistance, two markers of metabolic syndrome that make these youth more likely to develop cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Current research also links sleep disorderswith metabolic syndrome. To counter these disturbing trends, the public health com- munity is seeking new ways to communicate the benefits of weight control, healthier eating and physical activity toreinforce even more effectively that improved lifestyle is a key to good health for young adults and children.Training children to live healthy lifestyles can improve cardiovascularhealth in adult life and is a strategy that must becomewidespread in schools, especially inner-city schools thatserve a high proportion of minority populations. The health benefits associated with a physically active lifestyle in children include weight control, lower bloodpressure, improved psychological well-being and a predis-position to increased physical activity in adulthood.Increased physical activity has been associated with anincreased life expectancy and decreased risk of cardiovascu-lar disease. Researchers have also shown that people whoeat breakfast every day, especially whole-grain cereal, are far less likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease. A healthy level of physical activity requires regular partici- pation in activities that generate energy expenditures sig-nificantly above the resting level and ideally greater thanhalf of maximum exertion.These activities may be accom-plished through both recreational pastimes and organizedsports. Physical activity in American children, however, hasdiminished for a variety of reasons. Children rely more onthe automobile for transportation, as opposed to walking or bicycling. Growing numbers of children also engage insedentary entertainment, including television, video gamesand computers. Unfortunately, participation in organizedathletics diminishes greatly after middle school, a specialproblem for girls.Milestones .Chapter 6 .Cardiovascular Disease .Looking Ahead 118Although these trends of diminished physical activity are nationwide, socioeconomic factors place certain sub-populations of children at greater risk. In large cities,a lack of safe outdoor play areas limits children's ability to participate in active physical play or recreational sports.With tightening school budgets and changes in curriculum, regular physical education in schools has been de-emphasized. The number of families with two working parents or a single parent has increased, with the result that many moreparents are limited in their ability to encourage partic ipation. Federal, state and local health departments are working together to counter these alarming trends. CDC, aftermuch analysis and collaboration, published the following health promotion and disease-prevention strategies aimed at obesity: /rhombus6Ensure daily quality physical education for all school grades. /rhombus6Ensure that more food options that are low in fat and calories, as well as fruits, vegetables, whole grains andlow-fat or nonfat dairy products, are available onschool campuses and at school events. /rhombus6Make community facilities available for physical activity for all people, including on weekends. /rhombus6Create more opportunities for physical activity at work sites. /rhombus6Reduce time spent watching television and in other sedentary behaviors. In 1999, 43 percent of highschool students reported watching two hours of TV or more a day. /rhombus6Educate all expectant parents about the benefits of breast-feeding. Studies indicate that breast-fed infantsmay be less likely to become overweight as they growolder. /rhombus6Change the perception of obesity so that health becomes the chief concern, not personal appearance. /rhombus6Increase research on the behavioral and biological causes of overweight and obesity. Direct researchtoward prevention and treatment and towardethnic/racial health disparities.119 In large cities, a lack of safe outdoor play areaslimits children'sability to partici-pate in activephysical play orrecreational sports.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic /rhombus6Educate health care providers and health profession students on the prevention and treatment of over-weight and obesity across the lifespan. Although it is widely accepted that healthy diets and daily physical activity together help control weight and preventthe onset of CVD, the American population nonethelesssuffers from an epidemic of overweight and obesity.Currently 122 million adults are overweight and at risk forhypertension and related conditions that can lead to CVD. The well-known benefits of physical activity and a healthy diet have not forestalled the epidemic of overweight andobesity in the United States nor the resulting epidemic of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Unless significantchanges are made, today's overweight and obese childrenwill be tomorrow's unhealthy adults. Not only will thisaffect the health of the U.S. population but it will alsobecome an economic drain on an already overburdenedhealth care system. All of the diagnostic and treatmentadvances in CVD should mean that this disease is abating. Unfortunately, the incidence of CVD is not declining, and the public health community - in partnership withmedical, educational and legislative entities - must findinnovative solutions to this challenge. Thomas A. Pearson, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University of Rochester, suggests, \"The spectacular reductionsin cardiovascular disease mortality seen in the 1970s and1980s are in great danger due to the obesity epidemic. Forthe first time in U.S. history, experts are warning that thelife expectancy of our children may be less than our own.These dire predictions arise from the epidemic of obesityin our children and the return of the CVD epidemic asthey become adults.

AnAmerican shopping in any supermarket today can chooseto ignore fresh produce, fresh meats and fresh baked goodsand still purchase foods rich in nutrients.These foods areprepackaged, usually by the manufacturer, and labeled fortheir nutritional value.These required labels intend toguide consumers toward healthy choices, reassuring themthat foods are safe. Foods are not without risk in this coun-try, however, despite the best efforts of the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), its Food SafetyInspection Service (FSIS), the United States Food andDrug Administration (FDA), the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) and state and local healthdepartments. Much of the fresh produce for sale at certaintimes of year comes across our borders from Mexico, Chile,Brazil and other countries, where safety standards arebeyond our control. In 1970, each American ate approxi-mately 175 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables a year.By 1995, that number rose to 220 pounds per person.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Back Chapter 7 Safer and Healthier Foods Looking Back123 An early American store, circa 1910. Trucks waiting to enter the U.S. at the Mexicanborder.It is estimated that from one inthree to one infour people willsuffer a food-borne illness eachyear.Americans also choose to eat out much more frequently than in the past. Between 1970 and 2004, the percentage offood dollars spent away from home increased from 34 per- cent to 47 percent. In addition, the very young in day-carecenters and the very old in nursing homes are populationsat particular risk for foodborne illness, and these popula-tions are growing. Since foodborne illnesses arise mostoften from fresh produce and from restaurants or otherfood-service purveyors, growing numbers of Americans areclearly at greater risk for illness.Within the public healthcommunity, improvements in systems that protect foodsafety are still needed. It is estimated that there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States per year, resulting in patient-related costs in the billions of dollars. Each year, foodborne diseases cause more than 300,000 hospitalizations and anestimated 5,000 deaths. In fact, one of every 100 hospital-izations and one of every 500 deaths in the United Statesare thought to result from contaminated food. It isestimated that from one in three to one in four people willsuffer a foodborne illness each year.The full burden maynever be known, however, since large-scale studies have yetto be conducted and record-keeping is unreliable.Theactual number of illnesses may be much higher becausefoodborne illness is underreported and often misdiagnosed.Many people with mild cases do not seek medical help.Because symptoms are often nonspecific - nausea, vomitingand diarrhea - food poisoning can be mistaken for the fluor some other common ailment. Even when a victim seeksthe help of a physician, many health facilities lack the labo-ratory technology necessary to identify specific pathogens. Looking back in history, from the time of Hippocrates 2,000 years ago to the dawn of modern medicine, little distinction was made between food and drugs. Around 460 BC, Hippocrates recognized the essential relationshipbetween food and health. He urged others to study closelythe daily dietary regimen he associated with good health.Theophrasus, who lived from 370-285 BC, wrote Enquiry Into Plants ,the first great botanical treatise that identified plants as sources of food and medicine. But adulteration of food with fillers was noted even in these ancient times.Cato, who lived from 234-149 BC, wrote On Agriculture ,i nMilestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Back 124 Lunch at a day-care center.which he recommended \"the addition to wine of boiled- down must, salt, marble dust and resin\" and included amethod to determine whether wine \"has been watered.\"Pliny the Elder, the author of Natural History ,l i ved from AD 23-79. Not surprisingly, after Cato, he found wide-spread adulteration in the food supply, describing bread as being full of \"chalk, vegetable meals and even cattle fodder.\" He also found that pepper was often adulteratedwith juniper berries. Galen, the renowned Roman physician who lived from AD 131-201, followed the philosophical tradition of theschool of Hippocrates. He warned about the commonadulteration of food products, but more important, headvocated moderation as the principal rule for a sounddiet. Despite all the advances in medical science and nutri-tion in the intervening centuries, no one has improved onGalen's fundamental rule of sound nutrition. In Europe during the Middle Ages, the trade guilds regu- lated food products.The guilds, which dated back to thetime of the Norman Conquest, covered every importantfood category, including bakers, butchers, cooks, grocers,fruiters, poulters and salters.They had the power to searchpremises and seize unwholesome products, regulating themarketing of food to the public. By the beginning of the 19th century, advances in chemical analysis provided qualitative methods to detect many com-mon food adulterants. In 1820, a German-born chemist,Frederick Accum, working in England, published his land-mark treatise Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons .The book was an immediate success, gaining widespread public-ity in newspapers and capturing the attention of the public.Accum may be the first expert in food safety to achievehoped-for public education by using the vehicles of masscommunication that were then at his disposal. In 1906, the Pure Food and Drugs Act ushered in the modern era of food safety in the United States. Enactedduring the Theodore Roosevelt administration, the act cre-ated a Bureau of Chemistry, the agency now known as theFood and Drug Administration, to enforce food and drug laws meant to protect the American people.This act hadfirst been proposed in 1879 by Peter Collier, chief chemist125 Galen, a Roman physician, advocated moderation for a sound diet.The public became soaroused by Foodand Drugs Act.at the Department of Agriculture, and finally came into being only after concerted pressure by organized medicine,women's groups, the press and state public health officials. They were helped in their advocacy by Upton Sinclair'sbest-selling novel, The Jungle ,which exposed unsanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry. The publicbecame so aroused by those appalling conditions that nei-ther industry nor its supporters in Congress could preventpassage of the Pure Food and Drugs Act. A part of the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Chemistry found agricultural fairs to be a preferred venuefor campaigns to educate the public.The chief chemist,Harvey W .Wiley, MD, considered by many to be thefounding father of the FDA, tried to separate scientific facts on food safety from scares that were fast becoming a publicfocus. After the run away su ccess of The Jungle ,inflamma- tory publications fed growing public mistrust, which wasfurther inflamed by congressional hearings. Examples offood safety issues that inflamed the public were the widelyused, but unsafe, food preservative borax and the manyproducts labeled \"pure\" that were in fact counterfeits.Wileyconvened a Poison Squad at the Bureau of Chemistry andsoon borax, salicylic acid, formaldehyde and copper sulfatewere banned as food additives.The operative standard for each food product became a reasonable certainty that it caused no harm. Food fortification began in the United States in 1924 with the introduction of iodized salt in Michigan. Studiesshowed that the incidence of goiter, a swelling of the thy-roid gland caused by iodine deficiency, declined from 38.6 percent to nine percent; and iodized salt was soon intro-duced throughout the country, virtually eliminating iodinedeficiency as a serious health threat by the 1930s. Perhapsthe most famous food-fortification case concerns niacin inbreads and cereals. In the early 1900s, pellagra occurred to some extent in every state, and mortality statistics indi-cated that it was the most severe nutritional deficiency disease ever recorded in U.S. history. Pellagra presents withdermatitis, diarrhea, inflamed mucous membranes and, insevere cases, dementia. It flares up when the skin is exposedto strong sunlight, and in many southern states during thepeak incidence years of 1928 and 1929, pellagra becameone of the leading causes of death. In 1937, the disease wasMilestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Back 126 Commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey W .Wiley and the Pure Food and Drug laws.tied directly to a dietary deficiency in B vitamin niacin, primarily in poor people who lacked animal food - meat,eggs, dairy products - in their diets and subsisted mainly on corn. Bakers began introducing niacin, identified as ananti-pellegra agent, into breads and cereals through yeast, andby 1939, the incidence of pellagra began a rapid decline. Current controversies in the American diet, namely an overabundance of sugar, overindulgence in processed foods and lack of control in portion size, contribute to epidemicsof dental caries, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Health and dental education in schools and homes can help stem the epidemics, but the real solution comesfrom individual will power.The Surgeon General issuesperiodic updates on healthy weights, and the number ofoverweight and obese people keeps rising, causing real concern in the public health community. Healthy foodsand portion control are only part of the solution. Increasedphysical activity in a society gone sedentary is equallyimportant. In the United States, the food safety system is based on federal and state laws that are strong, flexible and science-based and on industry's legal responsibility to produce safefoods.The development and revision of regulations occurin an open and transparent process in public, allowing -and even encouraging - participation by the regulatedindustry, consumers and other stakeholders throughout the127 An individual with pellagra. Health and dental educationin schools andhomes can help stem the epidemics, but the real solutioncomes from indi-vidual will power.process. Old agency files at the FDA contain elaborate studies conducted with scientists from academia and indus-try that gathered data that even now serve as the basis ofregulations. Not until the late 1970s, when consumer inter- est in the environment and the food supply began toincrease, did this cooperative relationship end. Since the1970s, the FDA has worked essentially at arm's length fromindustry in an adversarial environment. Still, the federal government funds important research cen- ters that are based on university campuses. North CarolinaState University, Michigan State University and RutgersUniversity each hosts an important research center for foodsafety and technology. Ironically, the federal subsidies thathelp fund these centers allow the federal government tostretch its own scarce resources. A Timeline of Food Safety Developments in the U.S.Federal Government, 1879 to the Present: 1879 Peter Collier, chief chemist at the Department of Agriculture, supports a bill to make food adulteration a federal crime; the bill finally becomes law in 1906. 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, based on Collier's bill, creates the Bureau of Chemistry within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1906 First Meat Inspection Act, allowing \"sight, touch, smell\" inspection in slaughterhouses to detect unsanitary conditions and adulterated products. 1912 Sherley Amendment to the Pure Food and Drugs Act prohibits false and fraudulent claims; although, the government has to prove intent to deceive, not easily achieved in the face of so many \"nostrum makers\" expressing faith in worthless goods. 1927 Food, Drug and Insecticide Administration is created from the Bureau of Chemistry, merging the Insecticide and Fungicide Board. 1930 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comes into being. 1933-1938 The FDA launches an intensive effort to alert the public to the shortcomings of the 1906 law by high lighting such products as mascara, diet pills and baldness cures that are outside the scope of the 1906 law. 1939 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 1940 The FDA moved from USDA to the newly formed Federal Security Agency. 1950 Congress passes the Oleomargarine Act repealing much of the legislation that restricted margarine sales. 1953 The FDA becomes part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). 1954 Miller Pesticides Amendment empowers the FDA to establish tolerances for pesticides.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Back 128129 1957 Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA). 1958 Delaney Clause in the Food Additive Amendments to the 1939 Act requires that a food or color additive, once determined to be a carcinogen, not be approved for food use. 1958 Food Additive Amendments require pre-market approval for new food ingredients (before, a marketer could add ingredients without specific FDA approval). 1960 Color Additive Amendment. 1966 The FDA proposes restrictive approach to food fortification. 1966 Fair Packaging and Labeling Act completely restructures American food labels, causing one major food company to change 20,000 labels. 1967 Wholesome Meat Act, amending the 1906 Meat Inspection Act (MIA). 1968 Wholesome Poultry Products Act, amending the 1957 PPIA. 1968 The FDA moves to the Public Health Services within HEW . 1969 President Richard Nixon convenes a White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health that recommends fortification of existing and new food products to meet national nutritional needs (this new approach, reversing the 1966 FDA stance, creates new regulations based largely on food-labeling requirements rather than on rigid standards for nutrient composition). 1970 Egg Products Inspection Act, a response to a growing problem of Salmonella infection. 1976 Vitamin-Mineral Amendment. 1977 Congress passes the first of several laws precluding FDA action to ban the use of saccharin and directs the FDA not to implement a proposed system for controlling the sanitation of shellfish. 1980 The FDA's department renamed Health and Human Services (DHHS) when Education becomes its own department. 1980 Congress passes the Infant Formula Act, imposing druglike requirements on infant formulas. 1990 Congress passes the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. 1994 Congress passes the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, severely restricting the FDA's authority to regulate human nutritional foods. 1995 CDC, the USDA, and the FDA initiate a Sentinel Site Surveillance project, known now as FoodNet, to collect precise information about the incidence of foodborne illness, especially illness caused by salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. (Findings from the project show that Campylobacter causes the majority of sporadic illnesses associated with meat and poultry products). 1996 The USDA publishes its landmark rule on Pathogen Reduction and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which establishes in-plant performance standards for Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens. 1996 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) conducts testing for the first time to ensure that these standards are met (the first such performance standard for a broad range of meat and poultry products that are raw). 1997 The President's Food Safety Initiative adds millions of dollars to the nation's food safety budget, improving coordination between food safety regulatory agencies and surveillance for foodborne diseases. 2001 President George W . Bush establishes the Office of Homeland Security. 2002 The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, known as the Bioterrorism Act, adds section 304(h) to the 1939 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allowing the detention of suspect food products.Protecting public health involves layers of control before food reaches the consumer.The first layer - industry's clearresponsibility to prepare safe food - must be monitored by a second layer - regulatory agencies - to ensure that thefood industry does its job and produces safe food. In thepolicymaking arena for food safety in the United States,science and risk analysis are paramount. The federalgovernment's current efforts focus on the risks associatedwith microbial pathogens, trying to reduce those risksthrough a comprehensive, farm-to-table approach to foodsafety.These efforts follow many years of managing chemi-cal hazards in the food supply by regulating additives,drugs, pesticides, and other chemical and physical hazardsconsidered dangerous to human health. Since biologicalhazards differ from chemical hazards, the science of foodsafety has been transformed. For example, the U.S. government's now-completed risk analysis of Salmonella enteritidis in eggs and egg products included the first farm-to-table quantitative microbial riskassessment.The government has also conducted a riskanalysis for E. coli 0157:H7 in ground beef and has entered into a cooperative agreement with Harvard University for a risk assessment of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy(mad cow disease) transmission through foods.Y et anotherrisk analysis for Listeria monocytogenes in a variety of ready- to-eat foods has also been carried out. Food safety in the United States is both highly centralized, through the FDA, the USDA and CDC, and decentralized.Each state has its own food, drug and cosmetic act, whilethe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates advertisingof food and food products under the terms of the FederalTrade Commission Act. Some kinds of food, particularly milk and dairy products, are also regulated at the county orcity level. Milk shippers cater to differing ordinances thatregulate expiration dates on milk products, sometimes in neighboring cities within the same state. The FDA serves in a public health capacity. In the early 1970s, imported products regulated by the FDA numberedapproximately 500,000 formal entries each year (e.g., thosevalued at $1,250 or more). In 1992, these products account- ed for 1.5 million formal entries, of which 78 percentMilestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Back 130 The federal gov- ernment's currentefforts focus onthe through a comprehensive,farm-to-table approach to foodsafety.(1,117,000) were food products. Between 1987 and 1992, detentions of food products nearly doubled from 14,104 to 27,865. Clearly the FDA serves a vital function in protecting public health. Americans now face a crossroads concerning the issue of safer and healthier foods. Much of the regulatory pieceensuring food safety is in place and working well, althoughit should never be taken for granted. What needswork is individual commitment to healthier eating and an active lifestyle. Less sugar, more whole-grain cereals andbreads, three to four fresh fruits a day, green vegetables and so on, coupled with exercise routines could make a remarkable difference in the overall health of theAmerican population.131 What needs work is individual commitment tohealthier eatingand an activelifestyle.The first Jack in the Box in San Diegoin 1951.Case Study Jack in the Box E. coli OutbreakMilestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Case Study Jack in the Box restaurants, founded in San Diego in 1951, popularized the concept of \"drive thru\" dining, a rite ofpassage for many American teenagers and a conveniencefor working parents who have little time to prepare meals.After the founder, Robert O. Peterson, expanded his modest hamburger restaurant into a chain that stretched toArizona and T exas, Ralston Purina acquired a controllinginterest in 1968 and pursued an aggressive expansion strate-gy. By 1979, there were more than 1,000 \"drive thru\" Jackin the Box restaurants in 32 states. A period of corporaterestructuring followed, including a pullout from the East and Midwest in 1986.T oday, Jack in the Box thrives in itsintended markets in the West and Southwest, in partbecause the public in these states admires the way Jack inthe Box responded to a serious crisis in Seattle in 1993. That crisis awakened the federal government to the fact that its established inspection systems for food safety hadfailed to protect the public health.The crisis also intro- duced the country to a microorganism, Escherichia coli O157:H7, which has since become familiar to many.132 E. coli 0157:H7 Escherichia coli (E. coli for short) was identified in 1885 when the German pediatrician Theodore Escherich firstdescribed the bacteria.These rod-shaped bacteria, profusethroughout the digestive usually benign, keepdisease-causing bacteria from taking over.The O157:H7 strain, however, is far from benign, as events in Seattle in1993 were to prove. Isolated and identified for the first time in 1982, E. coli 0157:H7 is a problem in red meat, particularly hamburger. The discovery came during an epidemic in Oregon andMichigan caused by undercooked hamburger patties sold inthe McDonald's fast food chain. At the time, public healthofficials viewed the outbreak as an isolated incident, not anomen; in fact, E. coli O157:H7 is the third most deadly bacterial toxin, after the bacteria that causes tetanus andbotulism. Its distinctive symptoms are bloody diarrhea andfierce abdominal cramps. Many patients describethe pain as so severe that it feels like a hot poker searingtheir insides. During an E. coli outbreak, between two and seven percent of patients - mostly young children and the elderly -develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which canlead to death. HUS sets in when Shiga toxins, emitted byE. coli O157:H7 ,ravage cells lining the intestines and cause bleeding.The bleeding permits the toxins to enter the cir- culatory system, and when this happens, the damage is verysimilar to that of rattlesnake venom.The toxins tear apartred blood cells and platelets, and the victim becomes vul- nerable to brain hemorrhaging and uncontrolled bleeding.Clots form in the bloodstream and block the tiny bloodvessels around the kidneys, the heart's middle layer and the brain. As the kidneys give out, the body swells with excesswaste fluids, and complications ripple through all major organ systems. Stroke, blindness, epilepsy, paralysis and heartfailure can result. Although doctors know how to manage HUS symptoms and are researching new ways to stop thetoxin, there is currently no cure or effective treatment. In 1993, Jack in the Box restaurants promoted its most popular menu item, the Monster Burger, as \"So good it'sscary.\" Eleven years after undercooked hamburgers atMcDonald's caused outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in 133 Theodore Escherich first described the bacteria, now called Escherichia coli. Many patients describe the painas so severe that itfeels like a hotpoker searingtheir insides.Michigan and Oregon, a much graver crisis struck Seattle. A Jack in the Box restaurant served undercooked MonsterBurgers and killed four children among more than 700people who became ill. When the Jack in the Box tragedy struck, 22 previous out- breaks of E. coli O157:H7 had already killed 35 people in the United States. Not until the Seattle outbreak, however,were fast food hamburgers, a staple of American culture, viewed for the first time as potentially lethal. Public healthinvestigators from Seattle/King County Department ofHealth, aware of the previous E. coli outbreaks, zeroed in immediately on undercooked hamburgers as the outbreak'slikely cause and quickly identified the particular Jack in theBox restaurant in Seattle as the source. Tracing where the contaminated meat came from, however, was no easy task. A single carcass, when shredded for ham- burger, has the potential to pollute up to eight tons of ground beef. In the Jack in the Box outbreak, investigators quickly identified the supplier but found thatthe ground beef contained meat from 443 different cattlethat had come from five slaughterhouses served by farmsand auction in six states. How does meat become contaminated? Cattle produce abundant feces, which contain bacteria; when the feces are passed back and forth in crowded feedlots, as theyinevitably are, microorganisms like E. coli spread. Cattle fed on grass seldom carry the organism. However, cattle fed on corn, the staple of the feedlot, develop acid in theirstomachs. E. coli has learned to thrive in acid environments and are now principally a feedlot microbe, very common inthe manure of feedlot animals. When cattle arrive at the meatpacking plant and pass through the door on their way to becoming food, they arecaked with manure that comes from sleeping and resting invery tight quarters. Unless the hides are carefully separated in a way that minimizes contact with the meat, E. coli O157:H7 in the manure can contaminate the meat. Bacteria present in the intestinal tract can also contaminatethe meat. Unfortunately, when E. coli then passes into human stomachs through undercooked meat, the bacteria'stolerance for acidity means that gastric auc- tion in six states.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Case Study 134It is thought that as few as 10 bacteria can kill a person once they release their lethal toxin.When Jack in the Boxbecame aware of this danger, the company attempted to setthings right.The company hired Dave Theno, a food safetyexpert, to overhaul the company's system of food prepara-tion. His advice was simple:\"Make sure the meat productsare fresh, look good, are cold, not discolored or things likethat; keep them refrigerated and cold; follow shelf-lifeinformation, coded information. And then when you cookthem and prepare them, make sure you wash and sanitizeyour hands. Clean your utensils. Ground beef should not be served medium rare or rare. Juices should run clear.Internal temperatures should be over 155. Rare hamburgersneed to be a thing of the past.\" After the Jack in the Box outbreak, the federal government proposed a new inspection system - known as \"HACCP\"(Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) - thatrequired microbial testing for the first time to detect harm- ful bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella .Since the start of this new system in 1996, the USDA has reported a drop inSalmonella contamination of ground beef, while the CDC has seen a decrease in the incidence of other foodborne illnesses. Americans may still face serious risks, however. Increasing evidence indicates that the modern meat industry's wide- spread use of antibiotics to promote growth and keep live-stock healthy results in infectious bacterial strains that resist treatment with antibiotics. Meanwhile, with global trade, the risk that diseased cattle or beef will enterthe United States and decimate the livestock populationincreases. A recent court ruling may also threaten food safety. In 2001, a T exas meat-grinding company, Supreme Beef, fileda lawsuit against the USDA after it was effectively shutdown for failing three bacterial contamination tests in suc-cession. One test found that nearly 50 percent of its meatwas contaminated with Salmonella .Supreme Beef sued the government over its right to shut down operations simplybecause the company failed to meet USDA Salmonella stan- dards.The National Meat Association supported SupremeBeef's claim, pointing out that contaminated cattle werethe source of Salmonella ,not the plant, and the shutdown135 Meanwhile, with global trade, therisk that diseased cattle or beef willenter the UnitedStates and deci-mate the livestock populationincreases.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Case Study was, therefore, unnecessarily punitive. In March 2002, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the company. Per-capita annual meat consumption in the United States peaked in the early 1970s at 85 pounds and has since fall-en; in 1995-97, it was down to 64 pounds. In 2001, morethan 100 million pounds of bad meat had to be recalled.The meat industry's response to the Seattle outbreak andcontamination incidents since has been a series of high-tech solutions, such as sprays. A spray based on milk appearsto kill E. coli .Another solution, passing meat through steam cabinets in bags of hot water, kills most of the bacteria.Finally, irradiation appeals to the meat industry because it is cost effective. Even with the highest standards for sanitary processing, some manure may still be in the meat.Irradiation eliminates the threat posed by manure. Another, much simpler solution is possible, recommended by James Russell, a researcher at Cornell University. By putting cattle on grass or hay for the last several days oftheir lives, changing the pH balance in their stomachs, theE. coli population plummets by as much as 80 percent.The industry resists this solution, however.T o them, it is costlyand impractical - shipping so much hay to feedlots is a dis-incentive, as is lost gain - that is, cattle losing pounds justbefore slaughter. The politics of meat are instructive for effective advocacy. The key associations - American Meat Institute, NationalMeat Association, and National Cattlemen's Beef Assoc-iation - target their lobbying activities to a few key law-makers and regulators. Despite a relatively low levelof financial contributions, the industry usually succeeds at preventing, weakening or delaying new meat safety initiatives.Now that T yson, the largest poultry producer,has purchased IBP , the largest beef producer, the politics of meat safety initiatives favor the industry even more. One demonstration of the meat industry's lobbying muscle came in 1995.T wo years after the Jack in the Box disasterin Seattle, the USDA proposed HACCP , the new food- safety regulations for E. Coli and Salmonella testing in beef. The meat industry, objecting to new testing, convinced amember of a key appropriations committee in the Houseof Representatives to introduce an amendment to stop therule-making process, calling for the USDA to conduct136 Despite a rela- tively low level of financial contributions, usuallysucceeds weaken- ing or delayingnew meat safetyinitiatives.more extensive hearings.This move effectively delayed the implementation of the new regulations.The meat industryhas in fact fought food-safety inspection from the start, notwanting to be held accountable. Even in the face of the Jack in the Box evidence and ensuing meat safety standards, the beef industry pushed its supporters to counter that thestandards were unscientific and did not improve meat safe-ty.The industry claims that the incidence of E. coli in beef is less than one percent. The good news for government regulators, however, is that food-safety inspections, backed by testing, work. PulseNet,a newly created testing system based at CDC, demonstrateshow testing brings benefits to everyone. PulseNet is a net-work of state public health laboratories throughout the country that are now fingerprinting E. coli O157 and other foodborne bacteria on a routine basis. E. coli O157 has many different fingerprints, and usually no two will matchin a given period of time. If a state public health depart-ment sees a string of cases in which fingerprints match orCDC learns of cases in different states that have matchingfingerprints, victims of the outbreak clearly have somethingin common. Investigations can then focus on those people,using fingerprinting to analyze what they have in common.With the technology up and running at all state public health laboratories, comparisons can be made through theInternet. Connections through matching fingerprints canbe made between E. coli infections in as many as 22 states, a real advantage in identifying outbreaks sooner and ingreater detail than ever before. The Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak in 1993 informed the public and scientific and public health communitiesthat standards for meat safety needed strengthening.Regrettably for the victims, warning signs had been over-looked. Once the threat was understood, however, thecompany itself responded with new food-preparation sys-tems that mitigated the threat.Government also played itspart, requiring testing of raw meat for invisible bacteria forthe first time and upgrading meat-inspection systems.Thepublic health and scientific communities are collaboratingin tracing genetic fingerprints of foodborne pathogens,building knowledge in particular of the mechanisms of E. coli O157:H7 .Since the outbreak in Seattle in 1993, much progress has been made.137 The Jack in theBox E. coli outbreak in 1993informed working toidentify fingerprints offoodborne bacteria.Grocery store aisles could easily become classrooms for greater knowledge about nutrition and healthy eating. Under the FDA andFood Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulations, food labels now offer more information than ever before. The challenge hasbeen to educate consumers to read the labels carefully, analyze theinformation and make healthier food choices. Despite improvementsin food labeling, the growing rates of obesity, diabetes, high choles-terol and other chronic conditions indicate that people do not alwaysuse food label information in their own best interest.The need forthe public health community to continue educating the public aboutthe use of food labels is still imperative.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Vignette Vignette Nutrition Labeling on Food Packaging138 Sample label for macaroni and cheese.Start here Check calories Limit these nutrients Get enough of these nutrients FootnoteQuick guide to percent ofdaily values 5% or less is low 20% or more is highMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic Today's food labels intend to offer consumers: /rhombus6Nutrition information about almost every food in the grocery store. /rhombus6Distinctive, easy-to-read formats that enable consumers to more quickly find the information they need to make healthy foodchoices. /rhombus6Information on the amount per serving of saturated fat, choles- terol, dietary fiber and other nutrients of major health concern. /rhombus6Nutrient reference values, expressed as \"% Daily Values,\" to help consumers see how a food fits into an overall daily diet. /rhombus6Uniform definitions for terms that describe a food's nutrient content - such as \"light,\"\"low-fat\" and \"high fiber\" - to ensurethat these terms mean the same for any product. /rhombus6Claims about the relationship between a nutrient or food and a disease or health-related condition, such as calcium and osteo-porosis, and fat and cancer, which are helpful to people con-cerned about eating foods that may help keep them healthierlonger. /rhombus6Standardized serving sizes that make nutritional comparisons of similar products easier. /rhombus6Declaration of total percentage of juice in juice drinks, to help consumers know exactly how much juice is in the product. In November 1990, President George H.W . Bush signed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). The act required the FDA to issue proposed regulations within 12 months and finalregulations within 24 months. By November 1991, the FDA had published 26 proposals and the FSIS had published a parallel pro-posal for the nutrition labeling of meats and poultry. In January 1992, the FDA and FSIS called a public hearing on the proposals and received 92 comments in person from food industryrepresentatives, the scientific community and consumer groups. More than 40,000 comments were received in writing, the largest numberever received in response to an FDA proposed regulation. Of these, 75 percent were form letters from organized campaigns. Meanwhile,the FSIS received more than 1,100 comments, most of whichrequested that FDA and FSIS labels be consistent with one another. Most requirements arising from the NLEA raised troublesome issues, such as evaluating health claims related to certain nutrients and set-ting serving sizes. Foods were grouped into 139 categories, with139serving sizes determined by establishing reference amounts that represented the amount of food customarily eaten per occasion. Health claims for certain nutrients were another matter, because little researchexisted for most claims, whether they were very specific or broad.The FDA strove to come up with a general set of principles thatcould be applied across all claims, and after lengthy and complicatedevaluations, in the end, approved seven of ten relationships between diet and health. Another challenge was agreeing on definitions. The difference between \"lean\" and \"extra lean,\" for example, had to be determinedacross product lines. The American Heart Association helped deter-mine these definitions based on different levels of fat, saturated fat,and cholesterol for all of the meat products regulated by the FDA,including fish and game meat. The final regulations arising from the NLEA can be modified in the future as required. Industry can petition for changes, as can any-one else, and the FDA will set up a fair and open evaluation process.New processed foods come on the market all the time, eating habitschange, and the next diet fad lies just around the corner. In fact, thefood pyramid recommended by the USDA, representing dietary guide-lines for healthy eating, changes with some regularity. In a sense, theNLEA created a process that never ends.Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Vignette 140 The latest USDA food pyramid.The latest USDA food guide pyramid, which introduced the most dramatic changes ever, offers consumers easy-to-use tips on how tomaintain a healthy diet. For example, completely avoiding foods thatare high in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium is unnecessary,provided the consumer calculates average intake over several days. Ifone meal contains high-fat food, it should be countered with severalsubsequent meals that contain low-fat foods. In general, limitingintake of processed foods that contain fat and added sugars is a goodidea.The USDA now posts a customized My Pyramid on its Web site,balancing nutrition and exercise for people of varying age, weight andphysical condition.The site offers the following general advice: /rhombus6Eat at least three ounces of whole-grain breads, cereal, crackers, rice or pasta daily. /rhombus6Vary your vegetables; eat more dark green and orange vegetables daily, and eat more dry beans and peas. /rhombus6Eat a variety of fruit daily (fresh, frozen, canned or dried will do), and don't overdo fruit juices. /rhombus6Get fats from fish, nuts and vegetable oils, and limit solid fats, like butter, stick margarine, shortening and lard. /rhombus6Milk is important for getting calcium-rich foods, but favor low- fat or fat-free milks (lactose-free, if necessary). /rhombus6Choose low-fat or lean meats and poultry (baked, broiled or grilled), and vary your choices with more fish, beans, peas, nuts and seeds.141Under the provi- sions of the 2002Bioterrorism Act,the USDA must withthe Office ofHomelandSecurity... in protecting thepublic from suspect foods....Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic A safe food supply depends on improvements and innova- tions in inspections, irradiation, genetic engineering andregulations. For example, the use of fingerprinting E. coli O157:H7 through PulseNet helps to quickly analyze out- breaks. In the Jack in the Box outbreak, it was just such fingerprinting that helped limit the tragedy. A safe food supply depends on the detention of suspect food products as they enter or are shipped within the coun-try. Suspect food products can even be held in their countryof origin, as Guatemala agreed to do when raspberries har-vested there in 1996 were found to be the source of an out- break due to Cyclospora in the United States. Under the provisions of the 2002 Bioterrorism Act, the USDAmust collaborate with the Office of Homeland Security both in protecting the public from suspect foods and insecuring the mammoth food infrastructure of this country.Farms, fields, processing plants, distribution and storagefacilities and supermarkets are all vulnerable to bioterrorism attacks. Such attacks might consist of microorganisms, toxinsor chemicals intentionally spread to harm the food supplyor crops, or of a pest infestation.The challenge for theUSDA, given the scope and size of the food industry infra-structure, is immense. Irradiation offers another solution for food safety. Irradiation of ground beef and of other high-risk meats will likely bean important public health tool, much as pasteurization of milk has been.The irradiation process used for meatsinduces no radioactivity in the meat. Except for the bacteriait kills, irradiation introduces no important changes in themeat at all. After irradiation, nutritional values are identicalto what they were before, and the safety of meat after irra-diation should be no issue at all. Genetic engineering is yet another promising solution for food safety and productivity. In Hawaii in the mid-1990s,the papaya ring spot virus (PRSV) threatened to decimatethe state's second-largest fruit crop. By 1998, however,Hawaiian farmers were planting seeds of PRSV-resistantpapaya made possible by genetic engineering. A team ofMilestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead How to Ensure a Safe Food Supply142researchers from academia, industry and the government had isolated and copied a virus gene, then used a gene gun toshoot the gene into cells of the papaya plant.The papaya cellsintegrated the virus gene into their own chromosomes, mak-ing the papaya and subsequent generations resistant to thevirus.While food products derived from genetic engineeringremain controversial, the Hawaiian papaya farmers have qualms neither about the process nor the products. Genetic engi-neering saved their livelihoods. The first genetically engineered product in the United States went on the market in May 1994 when the FDAapproved a new tomato that could be shipped vine-ripenedwithout rotting.The FDA determined that the geneticallyengineered tomato was as safe as other commercially growntomatoes. Called the Flavr Savr, the tomato has gained wideacceptance in this country, especially during times of theyear when fresh-picked tomatoes are unavailable. In the European community, however, genetically modified foodshave caused much greater controversy and are actively dis-couraged by regulators. On the other hand, American con-sumers have found that genetic engineering offers a greatervariety of reliably safe foods, broadening the range of avail- able nutrients during nongrowing months. Regulation offers other solutions for food safety.The doses of subtherapeutic antibiotics administered by farmersto poultry, swine and penned fish in overcrowded facilities,to diminish incidence of disease and encourage fastergrowth, result in resistant strains of Salmonella and other foodborne pathogens. A particularly aggressive strain of resistant Salmonella has been identified as DT 104 .Although policy decisions must rely on accurate research, it is alreadyapparent that regulation of feedlots and other overcrowdedanimal facilities must be stepped up.The overcrowding,itself a problem, is often compounded by reckless use ofantibiotics, and farmers need to be held to account if resist-ance is to be controlled. Regulators also need to look to thefood industry in general - processing plants, food distribu-tors, restaurants and supermarkets - to bring the problemunder control.The use of antibiotics by farmers, a responseto the imperative of controlling costs, can be mitigated ifthe links higher up in the food industry and, ultimately,the public insist that cattle, eggs, pigs, poultry and sheep be raised to market readiness in humane conditions 143 Papaya crop destroyed by the papaya ring spot virus. Flavr Savr tomatoes, the first genetically engineered product marketed in the U.S.without undue use of antibiotics.T o this point, the food industry witnessed a \"Save the Dolphins\" campaign that became so popular that tuna-fishing methods changed inresponse. Education, another important avenue for improving food safety, must encourage fundamental research on the naturalhistory of human pathogens in animals. How do thesemicroorganisms develop disease resistance and how is it thatthey produce toxins? Educating those involved in produc-ing, transporting and preparing food, including consumers,can help stem the threat of serious foodborne illnesses. Food behavior must first change with individuals in their homes and can be as simple as keeping perishable foodrefrigerated, keeping food cold before preparation and cooking food properly. For hamburgers, chicken and pork,this means using a food thermometer to determine that themeat is thoroughly cooked. If restaurants followed thesesimple rules, the incidence of foodborne illnesses woulddecline dramatically. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates conditions for the transport of edible products. In July1994, Congress passed a transportation bill that containedprovisions addressing the sanitary transportation of food.The regulations, still going through an approval process, willaddress proper temperature in refrigerated trucks amongother issues. For now, the FSIS has no comprehensive regu-latory program that governs the handling of meat, poultryand egg products once they leave a regulated plant. As ofnow, a mishmash of state and local regulations govern thetransportation of these perishable goods from the time theyleave the plant to the time they reach the consumer. CDC's ability to monitor foodborne illness outbreaks improved significantly with the President's Food SafetyInitiative of 1997. CDC now operates some 20 surveillancesystems, including the two main systems, FoodNet andPulseNet. FoodNet is an \"active\" surveillance system thatencompasses a population of 20.5 million Americans in ninegeographic areas.The system collects outbreak informationon nine foodborne pathogens, toxoplasmosis, HUS, andGuillain-Barre syndrome. Once information is collected,FoodNet estimates the burden of illnesses, monitors trends, and names specific foods that carry risks. CDC also nowfunds nine Environmental Health Specialist (EHS-Net)Milestones .Chapter 7 .Safer and Healthier Foods .Looking Ahead 144 Food behavior must first change with individualsin their homesand can be as simple as keepingperishable foodrefrigerated, keep- ing food coldbefore preparationand cooking foodproperly.states where research is conducted on the factors that most often cause illness and the best means to prevent illness in food service operations. According to Ernest Julian, PhD, Chief of the Office of Food Protection at the Rhode Island Department of Health, many states, but not all, have mandatory trainingand certification for managers of food service operations.A recent study conducted by CDC found that establishmentswithout a certified manager were more likely to be associat-ed with foodborne outbreaks than those with a certifiedmanager. Similarly, the FDA found that establishments with-out a certified manager were statistically more likely to havecertain risk factors present that are associated with food-borne outbreaks. Julian observes,\"These studies provide asound basis for all health departments to require mandatoryfood manager training and certification.While food managercertification is a critical component, inspections are stillneeded to ensure that the establishment has a certified manager as required and to make certain that there is compliance with other required food safety practices.\" In the current federal food-safety system, 12 different agen- cies enforce 35 different statutes, which can lead to bureau-cratic conflicts that undermine both enforcement and pre-vention efforts. If federal food safety responsibilities were consolidated into a single agency - from farms and feedlots to truckers to processing plants to retailers - theattention accorded food safety would be much morefocused and unified. Consolidation would also strengthenprevention efforts. Such consolidation remains only adream, however, and perhaps unrealistic in the face of many special interests in the food industry.While the public health community puts public health first, the foodindustry - farmers, processing plants, food distributors andsupermarkets - have a different concern, putting their goodsfirst. Hence, the public health community and governmentregulators, despite noteworthy advances in food safety, must remain wary.145 If federal food- safety responsibili-ties were atten-tion accordedfood safety wouldbe much morefocused and unified.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor andthe National Center for Health Statistics, in the early 1900s about one in 10 infants died before his/her firstbirthday. Between 1915 and 1997, this figure fell by morethan 90 percent. Maternal mortality rates have also experi-enced a significant decline, from approximately 850 deathsper 100,000 live births in 1900 to only 7.7 deaths per100,000 live births in 1997. Although improvements inmedical care were the main force behind these declines ininfant and maternal mortality, public health interventionsalso played an important role.These include environmentalinterventions, improvements in nutrition and living stan-dards, better surveillance and monitoring of disease andhigher education levels. Maternal Mortality Rates Maternal deaths are defined as those that occur during a pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of a pregnancyand for which the cause of death is listed as a complicationof pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium. In 1900, oneout of every 100 pregnant women died. Maternal deathrates were highest from 1900 to 1930, caused mainly byhome deliveries performed either by midwives or generalpractitioners with poor obstetric education who knew littleabout aseptic techniques. In fact, sepsis accounted for 40percent of the deaths, one half after vaginal deliveries andone half after illegally induced abortions.The remainingdeaths were due to hemorrhage and high blood pressure.Within this period, some 916 deaths were due to the flu epidemic of 1918. Another cause of maternal deaths can be linked to common medical practice in the 1920s,which included excessive surgical and obstetric interven-tions such as induction of labor, forceps, For example, Dr. J.B. DeLee of ChicagoMilestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Back Chapter 8 Advances in Maternal and Child Health Looking Back Caption147published an account of his \"prophylactic forceps opera- tion\" in which full anesthesia, delivery by forceps and man-ual removal of placenta was routine for all women, exceptthose who evaded his plan by having a quick and sponta-neous delivery. Following such examples, obstetricians withinsufficient skills undertook difficult surgical procedures,often with fatal results. After 1933, maternal mortality rates started to decrease. During that year, the Report on the White House Con-ference on Child Health Protection, Fetal, Newborn, andMaternal Mortality and Morbidity demonstrated a connec-tion between poor aseptic practices, excessive operative deliveries and high maternal mortality. During the 1930s and 1940s, the government developed guidelines definingphysical qualifications needed for hospital delivery privi-leges.These policies were aimed to have an accredited specialist obstetrician deliver every baby in a hospital.As a result, a shift from home to hospital deliveriesoccurred between 1938 and 1948, and the proportion ofinfants born in hospitals increased from 55 percent to 90percent.The shift from home to hospital deliveries andimprovements in aseptic conditions in hospitals led to a 71 percent reduction in maternal mortality by 1948.Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Back Pic.2 Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House on Child Health Day. 148During the 1950s and 1960s medical advances brought about further declines in maternal mortality.These advancesincluded the use of antibiotics, oxytocin to induce labor,safe blood transfusion and better management of hyperten-sive conditions. Furthermore, legalization of induced abor-tions led to an 89 percent reduction in deaths from septicillegal abortions between 1950 and 1973.The nationalmaternal mortality rate continued to decrease until 1982,when it reached a plateau. Since then, maternal mortalityrates have fluctuated between seven and eight maternaldeaths per 100,000 live births. As a result, the goal pro-posed in 1987 for Healthy People 2000 of 3.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births has not been achieved. At the same time, the current maternity mortality rate of 7 .2per 100,000 - a 99 percent decrease since 1900 - cannotbe underestimated. Some experts argue that the U.S. has reached a level in maternal mortality that cannot be reasonably lowered anyfurther, but the World Health Organization estimates that20 countries have reduced their maternal mortality ratebelow that of the United States.The 21st century offers an opportunity to continue the decrease of maternal deathrates, as approximately 59 percent of all U.S. maternaldeaths can be prevented through early diagnosis and appro-priate medical care of pregnancy complications. However,obstacles exist to reducing this rate. In 1996, approximately10 percent of all pregnant women received inadequate or Pic.3 \"Baby shack,\"Washington, D.C., circa 1927. 149no prenatal care. Historically, the maternal mortality rate has always been higher for black and minority women than for white women. For example, in 1920 the maternalmortality rate for white women was nearly half that ofblack women. Currently, the maternal mortality rate is 5.5 per 100,000 live births for white women compared with23.3 per 100,000 for black women and 7.9 per 100,000 forHispanic women. Interventions must be designed to createawareness of the importance of prenatal care and to apply strategies to reduce persistent differences in mortality ratesbetween white and minority women. Infant Mortality Rates The decline in infant mortality is unparalleled by any othermortality reduction in the 20th century.T oday, less thanone in 100 American babies die in infancy. A century ago,as many as one in six infants died.This incredible changeresults from a process that has roots in the 1850s when infant mortality was first recognized as a social problem. During the first 30 years of the 20th century, public health, social welfare and clinical medicine collaborated tocombat infant mortality.These partnerships began improv-ing living conditions and the environment in urban areas,upgrading the quality of commercial milk and improvingmothers' abilities to carry, bear and rear healthy infants. Atthe beginning of the last century, the first steps to decreaseinfant mortality were established. First, the establishment of sewage disposal and safe drinking water were particularlyimportant in reducing infant mortality rates during theseyears. Second, milk pasteurization, first adopted in Chicago in 1908, contributed to the control of gastrointestinalinfections from contaminated milk supplies.Third, infancyand maternity programs secured federal funding, specificallyto establish the National Children's Bureau in 1912, whichwas proposed by Martha May Elliot, among others. Martha May Elliot (1891-1978) is considered a pioneer in maternal and child health. A graduate of Johns HopkinsUniversity, she was a leading pediatrician and an importantarchitect of programs for maternal and child health. Elliotdirected the National Children's Bureau Division of Childand Maternal Health from 1924 until 1934. During hertenure, this institution became the primary governmentagency to work toward improving maternal and infant welfare. As early as her second year of medical school,Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Back 150 During the first 30 years of the20th century,public health,social welfare andclinical medicinecollaborated tocombat infantmortality.Elliot in her words,\"some kind of social doctor.\" While leading the Children's Bureau,she helped establish government programs that implement-ed her ideas about social medicine.The Children's Bureauadvocated comprehensive maternal and infant welfare serv-ices, including prenatal, natal and postpartum home visitsby health care providers. By the 1920s, the integration of these services changed the approach to infant mortalityfrom one that addressed infant health problems to one thatincluded infant and mother.The new approach focused onprenatal-care programs to educate, monitor and care forpregnant women. Even more significant changes in infantmortality were still to come, however. The advent of antimicrobial agents (sulfonamide in 1937 and penicillin in the 1940s), the development of fluid andelectrolyte replacement and safe blood transfusions acceler-ated the decline in infant mortality rates during the 1930sand 1940s. From 1950 through 1964, infant mortalitydeclined more slowly. Increasing rates of infant death were Dr. Martha May Elliot visiting a child health clinic in Washington, D.C., 1945.151attributed to prenatal causes that occurred among high-risk neonates, especially low birth weight (LBW) and pretermbabies.This led to renewed efforts in the 1950s and 1960sto improve access to prenatal care, especially for the poor,and to concentrate efforts to establish neonatal intensivecare units and to promote research in maternal and infanthealth.This research included technologies to improve thesurvival of LBW and preterm babies. In the late 1960s dur-ing the advent of Medicaid and other federal programs,infant mortality declined substantially. From 1970 to 1979,neonatal mortality plummeted 41 percent due to techno-logic advances in neonatal medicine and the regionalizationof perinatal services. During the early to mid 1980s the downward trend in U.S. infant mortality slowed again. In the early 1990s, infantmortality declined slightly faster due to the widespreadintroduction of artificial pulmonary surfactant to preventand treat respiratory distress syndrome in premature infantsand to the increased use of maternal steroids. From 1991 to1997, the decrease in infant mortality continued, in part,because of reduced mortality from sudden infant deathsyndrome (SIDS). Thanks to public health authori-ties recommending that infants be placed on their backs tosleep, SIDS rates declined greater than 50 percent duringthis time. Overall, the infant mortality rate today representsa 90 percent decrease from that experienced at the begin-ning of the 20th century. Despite this incredible achieve-ment, medical and public health problems in maternal andchild health remain to be resolved, among them birthdefects, currently the leading cause of infant mortality.Y etthe causes for 70 percent of birth defects remain a mystery. Birth Defects A birth defect is an abnormality of structure, function, ormetabolism present at birth that results in physical or men-tal disability. Birth defects can be fatal and are the leadingcause of infant mortality in the U.S., accounting for morethan 20 percent of all infant deaths. Of 120,000 U.S. babiesborn each year with a birth defect, 8,000 die during theirfirst year of life. According to a report by the NationalAcademy of Sciences, nearly half of all pregnancies todayresult in the loss of the baby or a child born with a birth defect or chronic health problem.The leading birth defectsMilestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Back Thanks to public health authoritiesrecommending that infants beplaced on theirbacks to sleep,SIDS ratesdeclined greaterthan 50 percentduring this time.152associated with infant death are heart defects (31 percent), respiratory defects (15 percent), nervous system defects (13 percent), multiple abnormalities (13 percent) and musculo-skeletal abnormalities (7 percent). Birth defects contributesubstantially to childhood morbidity and long-term disabilityand are also a major cause of miscarriages and fetal death. The true incidence of birth defects is very difficult to determine because of inconsistent and incompletenational data gathering. Although surveillance systems are vital for monitoring and detecting trends in birthdefects, there has never been an effective nationwide datasystem on birth defects.The Pew Environmental HealthCommission recently reviewed this issue, finding that while the incidence of some birth defects is increasingrather dramatically, one-third of all states have no system for tracking birth defects, and systems are inadequatein most others. Moreover, even in states with birth defectregistries, most do not include children whose defects do not become apparent until months or years after birth. In the late 1960s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started the first birth-defects surveil-lance system in the United States, but that system was limited to the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia.Since 1967, the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital DefectsProgram (MACDP) has been monitoring all major birth defects in five counties of the metropolitan Atlanta area(Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett) withapproximately 50,000 annual births in a population ofabout 2.9 million. For some time, CDC used the newbornhospital discharge summary and vital statistics to monitorbirth defects nationwide, but both of these systems provedto be extremely inaccurate because many structural con-genital anomalies were not accurately identified at birth.In 1983, the California Birth Defects Monitoring Programbegan an active surveillance system in the five countiesaround the San Francisco Bay area. Founded by Drs. JohnHarris and Richard Jackson in conjunction with Califor-nia's legislature and governor, this program became a model for surveillance in other states and a worldwideleader in birth defects research. Adding new counties to its surveillance area, statewide coverage was achieved in1990.The program is now the leader in birth defects 153 ...one-third of all states have nosystem for track-ing birth defects,and systems areinadequate inmost others.surveillance and prevention with more than 250 published findings, ongoing monitoring of 334,000 births per yearand trailblazing research. Perhaps the most important advance in the registry and prevention of birth defects data came in 1996, whenthe Congress directed CDC to establish the Centers forBirth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP).Formal-ized with the passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Actof 1998, CDC was authorized to: (1) collect, analyze andmake available data on birth defects; (2) operate regionalcenters that conduct applied epidemiologic research for theprevention of birth defects; and (3) provide the public withinformation on preventing birth defects. Currently, CDChas established centers in Arkansas, California, Iowa, Mass-achusetts, New Y ork, North Carolina,T exas and Utah.Thecenters were established in states whose existing birthdefects programs were nationally recognized for expertisein birth defects surveillance and research. The ultimate goal of tracking and research is to develop and implement effective programs to prevent birth defectsand developmental disabilities. Even without an accuratenational birth defects tracking system, it has been possibleto implement prevention campaigns to decrease birthdefects. One example of a success in this area is the national folic acid education campaign led by the March of Dimes, CDC and its partner organizations, such as theSpina Bifida Association. President Franklin Rooseveltfounded the March of Dimes in 1938 as a national volun-tary health agency to help combat birth defects.This newmultiyear national education campaign aims to increase the number of women who take folic acid daily, and it isknown to have had an impact. A study published in theJournal of the American Medical Association in 2001 showed that neural tube defects in newborns decreased 19 percentbetween 1995 and 1999 in the wake of this campaign.Furthermore, advances in neonatal technology haveimproved the survival rate of preterm babies who weighless than five pounds, eight ounces at birth. Today, birth defects loom as the No.1 cause of infant death. The fact that one in 28 babies is born with a birth defectshould give the public health community pause.

Pic.6154mortality associated with these deaths from infancy to later stages of life. However, increased funding for surveillance and research will be necessary to develop effective programsto prevent the tragedy of birth defects, which occur in 150,000 American families every year. Family Planning The hallmark of family planning in the United States in the 20th century has been the ability to achieve desiredbirth spacing and family size. Smaller families and longerintervals between births have contributed to the betterhealth of infants, children, and women and have also im-proved the social and economic role of women. However,access to effective and legal contraception has not alwaysbeen available to women. In 1900, it was illegal under federal and state laws to distribute information and to coun-selpatients about contraception and contraceptive devices. Some sectors of society rejected this law, and the moderncontraceptive movement began. In 1912, Margaret Sanger initiated efforts to circulate information about and provide access to contraception.Sanger was a public health nurse concerned about theadverse health effects of frequent childbirth, miscarriagesand abortion. In 1916, Sanger challenged the laws of theday and opened the first family planning clinic inBrooklyn, New Y ork.The police closed her clinic, butSanger continued to promote family planning by openingmore clinics and challenging legal restrictions during the1920s and 1930s.The court challenge established a legalprecedent that allowed physicians to provide advice oncontraception for health reasons, and physicians gained theright to counsel patients and to prescribe contraceptive methods. By the 1930s, a few state health departments(such as North Carolina) and public hospitals had begun to provide family planning services. By 1933, the averagefamily size had declined from 3.5 to 2.3 children. During the 1940s and 1950s, new efforts arose to create effective contraceptive methods. In the early 1950s, JohnRock, a highly regarded obstetrician and gynecologist, whograduated from Harvard University, and Gregory Pincus, a biologist, who graduated from Cornell University, workedtogether to create an oral contraceptive.They tested theirversion of an oral contraceptive pill in preliminary trials in Margaret Sanger in 1916.155Boston in 1954 and 1955. After the success of the prelimi- nary trials for the Pill, Rock and Pincus were confidentthey had created an effective contraceptive method. Butwithout large-scale human trials, the drug would neverreceive FDA approval necessary to bring the drug to market. In the summer of 1955, Pincus visitedPuerto Rico and discovered a perfect location for thesehuman trials. Puerto Rico had no anti-contraceptive lawson the books and had an extensive network of birth control clinics already in place. The base for the first trial was a clinic in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.The Rio Piedras trials got off the groundquickly in April 1956. In no time, the trial was filled tocapacity, and expanded trials began at other locations onthe island.The pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle manu-factured the pills for the trial. Rock selected a high dose of Enovid, the company's brand name for its synthetic oralprogesterone, to ensure that no pregnancies would occurwhile test subjects were on the drug. Later, after discover-ing Enovid worked better with small amounts of syntheticestrogen, that active ingredient was added to the Pill aswell. Dr. Edris Rice-Wray, a faculty member of the Puerto Rico Medical School and medical director of the Puerto RicoFamily Planning Association, supervised the trials. After ayear of tests, Rice-Wray reported good news to Pincus. The Pill was 100 percent effective when taken properly.However, she also informed him that 17 percent of thewomen in the study complained of nausea, dizziness, headaches, stomach pain and vomiting. So serious and sustained were the side effects that Rice-Wray told Pincusthat a 10 milligram dose of Enovid caused \"too many sidereactions to be generally acceptable.\" Rock and Pincus quickly dismissed Rice-Wray's conclu- sions. Confident in the safety of the Pill, Pincus and Rocktook no action to assess the root cause of the side effects.As a result, in later years, Pincus' team would be accused of deceit, colonialism and the exploitation of poor womenof color.The women had been told only that they weretaking a drug that prevented pregnancy and were not toldthat they were involved in a clinical trial, that the Pill wasexperimental and that potentially dangerous side effectswere possible. Pincus and Rock, however, believed theyMilestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Back Pic.7In the summer of 1955, Pincusvisited PuertoRico and discov-ered a perfectlocation for thesehuman trials.1561960 contraceptive pills.were following the appropriate ethical standards of the time.T o this day, questions linger over whether Pincus and Rock, in their rush to bring an effective pill to market, overlooked serious side effects from the originalhigh-dosage Pill during trials.The current dosage of oralcontraceptives has been dramatically lowered, and the inci-dence of serious side effects has been greatly reduced. In 1960, the era of modern contraception began when both the birth control pill and the intrauterine device(IUD) became available.These effective and convenientmethods resulted in widespread changes in birth controland social behavior. By 1965, the Pill had become the most popular birth control method, followed by the con-dom and contraceptive sterilization. Meanwhile, the IUDfell out of favor following reports that sterility might resultif the device was improperly implanted or monitored. Infact, lawsuits caused bankruptcy of the manufacturer of the popular Dalkon Shield. It would be decades untilnewer, safer IUDs were reintroduced to the market as a contraceptive option. In 1970, federal funding for family planning services was established under the Family Planning Services andPopulation Research Act, which created Title X of the Public Health Service Act. During this period, the SupremeCourt finally struck down state laws prohibiting contracep-tive use by married couples. Medicaid funding for familyplanning was authorized in 1972. Services provided underTitle X grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s; after 1980,public funding for family planning continued to shift tothe Medicaid program. Since 1972, the average family size has leveled off at approximately two children, and thesafety, efficacy, diversity, accessibility and use of contracep-tive methods have increased. In the late 1990s, legislatures in 19 states mandated partial or comprehensive insurancecoverage for reversible methods of contraception. Access to high-quality contraceptive services will continue to bean important factor in promoting healthy pregnancies andpreventing unintended pregnancy in this country.157Case Study Folic AcidMilestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Case Study Each year, spina bifida or anencephaly, the two most com- mon forms of neural-tube defects, occurs in one in 1,000pregnancies in the U.S. Anencephaly and spina bifida,which affect approximately 4,000 fetuses each year, areimportant factors in fetal and infant mortality. All infantswith anencephaly are stillborn or die shortly after birth;whereas, many infants with spina bifida now survive as a result of extensive medical and surgical care. However,infants with spina bifida who survive are likely to havesevere, lifelong disabilities. In addition to the emotionalcost of spina bifida, the estimated monetary cost is stagger-ing. In the U.S. alone, the total cost of spina bifida over alifetime for affected infants born in 1988 was almost $500million or $249,000 for each infant. Although these severe conditions have been recognized since antiquity, never before has progress been as fast andsubstantive as in the last three decades, particularly in thearea of prevention. During that time, evidence mountedthat vitamin supplements in the early stages of pregnancycould prevent neural-tube defects. In 1976, Dick Smithellsand colleagues in the United Kingdom reported thatwomen who gave birth to babies with neural-tube defects A doctor examines a child with spina bifida at a clinic near Brownsville, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border. 158...among women who had previouslyhad an affectedpregnancy, thosewho took duringthe early lowerrisk of another affectedfetus or infantthan those whodid not take themultivitamin.had low serum levels of micronutrients, including some vitamins.These findings led them to propose a randomizedcontrolled trial of vitamin supplementation. As a result, in 1983 they reported that among women who had previously had an affected pregnancy, those who took a multivitamin during the early stages of pregnancyhad an 86 percent lower risk of having another affectedfetus or infant than those who did not take the multivita-min. However, because Smithells and colleagues had notbeen permitted to randomly assign the use of the multivit-amin among participants in their study, their finding didnot lead to public action. In fact, action was delayed until the publication of two randomized, peer-reviewed studies a decade later. In 1991, a randomized controlled trial funded by the BritishMedical Research Council demonstrated that folic acidsupplementation before pregnancy and during its earlystages markedly reduced the risk of neural-tube defects innewborns.This finding led the Public Health Service andCDC in 1992 to recommend that all women who areplanning to become pregnant take folic acid supplementsbeginning before pregnancy and continuing through itsearly stages. CDC directs its recommendation at women of childbearing age, because as many as 50 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned.The evidence sug-gests that folic acid supplementation must begin beforepregnancy to protect against neural-tube defects. Public health officials have considered three approaches to achieving CDC's recommendation for a daily folic acidintake of 0.40 milligrams (mg): (1) promoting daily use ofvitamin supplements that contain folic acid, (2) promotingdietary intake of foliate-rich foods, and (3) fortifying foodwith folic acid. A landmark public health decision by theFood and Drug Administration allowed the third approach to be implemented in January 1998.The FDA mandatedthat all enriched grain products, such as flours and pastas,must also be fortified with 140 micrograms (\u00b5g) of folic acid per 100 grams grain.The measurement was based onthe estimate that the average American woman of repro-ductive age would consume about 100 \u00b5g of folic acid perday from foods containing enriched grain products.Thispublic health decision has proved to be a success.The addition of folic acid to commonly eaten foods has 15913 ...a record 40 per- cent of Americanwomen of child- bearing agereported taking a daily multivitamincontaining folicacid in 2004....Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Case Study dramatically reduced by 50 percent the incidence of spinal bifida in newborns. More important, the cost of fortifica-tion is small. In the U.S., it costs about one cent per personper year, or about $1,000 per neural-tube defect prevented,which represents less than one percent of the total cost of spina bifida over a lifetime for each infant affected. Regardless of the method chosen to increase folic acid intake, the full potential of preventing neural-tube defectscan be realized only if women increase their intake of folicacid supplementation at the correct time of pregnancy.In 1998, according to Gallup surveys commissioned by theMarch of Dimes, most women were taking folic acid toolate to reduce their risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect.The surveys showed a steady increase in thenumber of women who had heard of folic acid, but no increase in the number of women taking a multivitaminevery day. However, this trend has changed with time and the hard work of organizations seeking to increase women'sintake of folic acid. According to the March of Dime's latest survey published in a September 2004 Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report ,a record 40 percent of American women of childbearing age reported taking adaily multivitamin containing folic acid in 2004, up from32 percent in 2003, and the highest level since the Marchof Dimes began surveying women in the 1990s. Dr. Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes, recently said that the latest survey shows that women today seem to understand the importance of folic acid to thehealth of babies.This means that women who mightbecome pregnant in the United States are aware of thebenefits of folic acid intake and are taking this preventiveapproach. Increasing folic acid intake represents a majorstep in reducing infant mortality and morbidity and is oneof the 20th century's clearest public health successes.160Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic The tapping of amniotic fluid has been practiced for more than 100 years.Transabdominal amniocentesis in the third trimester of preg- nancy was first reported in the literature in 1877. For today's pregnantwoman, having amniocentesis, or \"amnio,\" is an important decision that she must make between 15 and 18 weeks of pregnancy. Amnio-centesis is the most common prenatal test used to diagnose chromo-somal and genetic birth defects and has an accuracy rate of between99.4 percent and 100 percent in diagnosing chromosomal abnormali-ties. Amnio is recommended for women over age 35 because the riskof chromosome disorders increases with maternal age.The test is alsorecommended to women who have had a previous child with a birth defect that amniocentesis can diagnose, a family history of a geneticdisorder or an abnormal triple-screen blood test result. In 1956, in their seminal article in the journal Nature, F.Fuchs and J. Riis reported the first use of amniotic fluid examination in the diag-nosis of genetic disease.They determined fetal sex from cells found inamniotic fluid, based on the presence or absence of the Barr body (aninactive X-chromosome found in the nuclei of somatic cells of mostfemale mammals).That same year in the United Kingdom, JohnEdward also discussed for the first time the possibility of the \"ante-natal detection of hereditary disorders.\"The determination of fetalsex led to the prenatal management of patients with Haemophilia A in 1960 and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 1964. In their paper in The Lancet in 1966, the researchers M.W . Steele and W . R. Breg demonstrated that cultured amniotic fluid cells were suitable for karyotyping. In 1972, David J.H. Brock and Roger Sutcliffe discovered that excessive amounts of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were present in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies with neural-tube defects. But a study in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1970 by Henry Nadler and Albert Gerbie was the real impetus ingenetic amniocentesis and diagnosis. Following the publication oftheir article,\"Role of amniocentesis in the intrauterine diagnosis of genetic defects,\" genetic laboratories for analysis of amniotic fluid became prevalent and included the detection of chromosomal abnormalities, X-Linked conditions, inborn errors of metabolism and neural-tube defects. Thanks to advances in technology, amniocentesis today is a safe test for both mother and fetus; although, a small risk of miscarriage Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Vignette Vignette Amniocentesis 161(one in 200 or less) exists. However, a recent study by the National Center for Human Genome Research and the Agency for HealthcareResearch and Quality found that amniocentesis can be \"cost-effectiveat any age or risk level\" and should be offered to all pregnant women.Using ultrasound as a guide, the health care provider inserts a thinneedle through the mother's abdomen. A small amount of amnioticfluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) is removed and tested. A positive diagnosis indicates, with near 100 percent certainty, a specificgenetic abnormality in the fetus. Fortunately, advances in prenatal therapy now make it possible to treat some birth defects before birth. For example, biotin dependenceand MMA (methylmalonic acidemia), two life-threatening inheriteddisorders of body chemistry, can be detected by amniocentesis andtreated in the womb, resulting in the birth of a healthy baby. How-ever, if a fetus has a condition for which prenatal treatment is not yet possible, prenatal diagnosis may help parents prepare emotionally forthe birth and plan the delivery with their health care provider.Parents can discuss their options with genetic counselors as well as with their health care providers. A framework for the role public health can play in prenatal screening such as amniocentesis, was best presented by the Institute of Medicinein The Future of Public Health (1988).The framework identifies the following four essential public health components: 1.Surveillance and population-based epidemiologic studies to assess how risk for disease and disability is influenced by the interactionof human genetic variation with modifiable risk factors. 2.Evaluation of policies and quality of genetic testing to ensure the appropriateness and quality of population-based genetic testing. 3.Intervention development, implementation, and evaluation to ensure that genetic tests and services are incorporated intoprograms that promote health and prevent disease and disability. 4.Communication and information dissemination to provide timely and accurate information to the general public and professionalaudiences on the role of genetics in health promotion and diseaseprevention. Based on the experience with amniocentesis and advances in genetics, genetic screening will challenge the field of maternal healthin the near future.Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Vignette 162State newborn screening systems were the first genetics programs for children, and they remain the largest. Nation-wide, state public health programs screen an estimated four million infants annually for genetic disorders. Eachyear approximately 3,000 babies with severe disorders are detected due to newborn screening programs. Undetectedand untreated abnormalities can result in mental retarda-tion, severe illness and premature death. State newbornscreening programs involve testing, follow-up, diagnosis,treatment and evaluation. As public health initiatives, newborn screening programs focus resources on treatable conditions that occur relativelyfrequently. Currently, tests are available for 29 genetic andmetabolic diseases, but most babies are not tested for all of these disorders because policies regarding genetic testingvary from state to state. Advances in technology, particularly in genetics and metabolic research, will enable testing fornumerous abnormalities.These deficiency, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), phenylketonuria (PKU) and sickle cell anemia (SCA). Genetics is growing in importance as the public becomes more knowledgeable and more demanding of genetic services, and as the knowledge of our genes and their func-tions permits more effective strategies for treatment andespecially for prevention, the special responsibility of public health. As genetic research yields vast informationabout sequences, mutations and variation, the public health sciences will be called upon to interpret clinical significance in the context of environmental, metabolic,nutritional and behavioral risk factors. The prevention of human disease is a time-honored and honorable goal of public health professionals.What might it mean, however, to use the special tools and authorities of public health agencies to attempt to prevent genetic disease? Many approaches to prevention are possible, butattempts to locate them within traditional public healthMilestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Genetic Screening163These decisions have a profoundimpact onprospective par-ents as individualsand as part ofsociety....17 Milestones .Chapter 7 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Ahead Pic.9categories like \"primary, secondary and tertiary\" prevent- ion have been confusing. It is important to distinguishbetween two definitions of \"prevention\" that are often used in public health genetics:\"phenotypic\" prevention and \"genotypic\" prevention. Phenotypic prevention describes medical efforts to delay or stop the clinical manifestations of a genetic disease in an at-risk patient, such as newborn screening and dietarytreatment for PKU. Genotypic prevention, on the otherhand, describes efforts to avoid the transmission of particu-lar genotypes from one generation to the next. Genotypicprevention can include pregnancy termination or the deci-sion not to have children. These decisions have a profound impact on prospective parents as individuals and as part of society, as they can affect the incidence of a disease in the larger population. From a public health perspective, the ethical issues surrounding genetic counseling include: 1.Autonomy.The right of individuals to act freely with adequate information. 2.Non-Malfeasance.The concept of \"do no harm.\" 3.Beneficence and Justice. Information should be helpful and available to all. 4.Confidentiality. All information is private and not to be shared with others. In 1997, CDC created the Office of Genomics and Disease Prevention to highlight the emerging role ofgenetics in the practice of public health in the UnitedStates.The office provides internal coordination and promotes external partnerships in activities related togenetics, disease prevention and health promotion.Prevention includes the use of medical, behavioral,and environmental interventions to reduce the risk of disease among people susceptible because of their genetic makeup.This office supports the responsible use of genetic tests and services, including adequate family history assessment and genetic counseling, to promote health and prevent disease in different communities.164 Milestones .Chapter 8 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking AheadMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic 18 Milestones .Chapter 7 .Maternal and Child Health .Looking Ahead The public health approach to genetic screening places major emphasis on preventing the occurrence or mani-festation of a particular disorder. If this proves not to befeasible, a secondary approach is to identify high-risk individuals and institute a program of early screening followed by active treatment to minimize any criticalexpression of the condition.This model works reasonablywell and is ethically acceptable when the disorder to be treated will have serious, irreversible or possibly lethaleffects in the individuals affected. In these situations, therisk/benefit ratios will more than likely benefit the indi- viduals identified as at-risk or affected. The same cannot be said of the person screened if the disorder identified will not manifest itself for a number of years, if the treatment available may be of questionablevalue or if no effective intervention is known.The issue becomes even more complex when the screening resultplaces the individual merely in a category of increased risk to develop the condition. Dr. Allen Rosenfield, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and noted authorityon maternal and child health, observes,\"20th century med-ical advances, together with universal access to maternitycare, can now prevent the most common labor complica-tions from becoming life-threatening. These advanceshave dramatically improved the lives of women in theUnited States, sparing them the unnecessarily high risk of death and disability that women in many resource-poor countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America still face.\"Rosenfield continues,\"While current state-of-the-artadvances have been of great importance, basic interventionscan help women experiencing complications when moresophisticated options are not available. Programs have beendeveloped in resource-poor countries to provide access toemergency obstetric care, including cesarean sections, treat-ment of postpartum hemorrhage and infection, and man-agement of the complications of unsafe abortions to womenwhose complications would otherwise cause death or dis-ability.\" In other words, advances in maternal and child health owe as much to sound public health practices as to new tech-nologies. In order to realize its promise, genetic screening165 \"These death disability thatwomen inAfrica, Asia andLatin America of MailmanSchool of PublicHealth, ColumbiaUniversity.19 will need to be partnered with good public health prac- tices. It is these practices that have brought such astoundingsuccess to reducing maternal and child mortality.

Associations between the mouth and diseaseselsewhere in the body - in the heart and lungs, for exam-ple - are well-documented. Still, people don't always recog-nize oral health as a key measure of overall health. Despitenotable advances in reducing the prevalence of dentalcaries, or tooth decay, during the past century, the UnitedStates still has a long way to go to make good oral health,and the improved quality of life it promotes, a public healthpriority. Poor oral health remains a silent epidemic. Disadvantaged populations are disproportionately the victims of oral diseases, resulting in great societal costs. From missed hours at school and work, to periodontal disease that leads to premature low birth-weight babies, to heart disease andstroke associated with oral infections, the costs quicklymount. In 1994, low-income children had almost 12 timesmore days of missed school due to dental problems thanChapter 9 Oral Health Looking BackMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Back 167higher income children. Early childhood caries (ECC), also called \"baby bottle tooth decay,\" occur most often inthe upper anterior primary teeth when a baby is regularlygiven a bottle with sugary liquid at bedtime or naptime. Prevalent in lower-income families, ECC can cost as muchas $6,000 per child to treat because general anesthesia andan operating room are often required. Clearly, teaching par-ents and caregivers how to avoid ECC would be morecost-effective and would help prevent unnecessary pain andinfection. Dentistry Becomes a Profession The mouth has historically been disconnected from the rest of the body in health sciences, education and practice. With the founding in 1840 of the world's first dental school, the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, dentistrybecame a separate profession from medicine. Dentistrycould have become a medical specialty had the Marylandlegislature not rejected a request, due to attendant costs,to incorporate dentistry as a department at the Universityof Maryland's medical school.Thus, dentistry set its owncourse. Dr. Chapin A. Harris, the father of American Dental Science and co-founder of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, was born in 1806 in Pompey, New Y ork.He moved West as a young man to Madison, Ohio, wherehe joined two of his brothers, one a physician, to studymedicine. In 1824, he passed the Ohio Board of MedicalCensors and began the practice of medicine and surgery in Greenfield, Ohio. Having taken up the study of dentistryin 1828, he moved to Baltimore in 1833 to pursue furtherdental studies with Dr. Horace H. Hayden. In 1839, afterestablishing an itinerant dental practice throughout theSouth, Harris founded the world's first dental journal, The American Journal of Dental Science ,and remained its chief editor and publisher until his death in 1860. Also in 1839,he published The Dental Art:A Practical Treatise on Dental Surgery ,which in 1845 became The Principles and Practice of Dental Surgery and remained the most useful dental text- book of that century through 11 editions dating to 1896.In 1840, Drs. Harris and Hayden organized the AmericanSociety of Dental Surgeons, the first national dental organi-zation. In 1845, Harris published his second book,Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Back Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking back Baltimore College of Dental Surgery168 Dr. Chapin A. HarrisIn the late 1800s... agrowing number of schools of dentistry werefounded in theUnited States andgraduates began to predominate in the ranks ofpracticing dentists.169 Dictionary of Dental Science ,which saw five editions dating to 1898. In 1840, as co-founder of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery with Hayden, Harris became its first dean and aprofessor of practical dentistry, then the school's secondpresident upon Hayden's death in 1844.The BaltimoreCollege of Dental Surgery was later to merge with theUniversity of Maryland School of Dentistry in 1923.Between 1840 and 1867, nine more autonomous dentalschools were founded in the United States using theBaltimore model. In 1867, Harvard established the HarvardSchool of Dental Medicine in association with the Mass-achusetts General Hospital, becoming the first university-affiliated dental school. By 1870, only 15 percent of the 8,000 practicing dentists in the United States had graduated from dental schools; therest were trained under preceptor arrangements or simply proclaimed themselves as dentists. Dental infections andcomplications from tooth extractions were among the mostcommon causes of death. Indeed, the Bills of Mortality list-ed dental infections and complications as leading causes ofdeath from the 1600s through the 1800s. In the late1800s, the preceptor model of dental training shifted dra-matically, as a growing number of schools of dentistry werefounded in the United States and as graduates began topredominate in the ranks of practicing dentists. In 1894,the University of Michigan School of Dentistry becamethe first dental school to offer graduate courses in dentistry.By the mid-1920s, less than three percent of practicingdentists had trained under preceptor arrangements. In the 1920s, after the transforming Flexner Report of 1910on medical education, the Carnegie Foundation funded Dr.William J.Gies of Columbia University to study existingdental schools, most of which we re merely trade schools unaffiliated with universities. In 1926, Gies published whatcame to be known as the Gies Report.The report advocat-ed for incoming dental students to have at least two yearsof university education and for the teaching of the basicbiology of oral structure and the pathology of oral-facialdisease.Widely adopted, the report's recommendationsbegan transforming American dental education into an oral specialty of medicine.With the growing interest in dental education, more university-based dental schools and newly formed dental societies took hold.They contin-ued to operate separately from medical schools and medicalsocieties, however, and as a consequence, many health careprofessionals were never fully educated on the impact oforal diseases on overall health. The dental health profession consists of dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dental laboratorytechnicians. Nine dental specialties - dental public health, endodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oralpathology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics,prosthodontics and radiology - are joined by other oralhealth specialties within medicine. Endocrinologists dealwith salivary glands, neurologists address the mouth's nervous system, and orthopedic surgeons correct musculo-skeletal defects. Dramatic improvements in oral health occurred once dentistry became a profession in 1839. For the next 100years, the United States led the world in research and innovations and paved the way for preventive dentistry.Although dental caries and periodontal diseases were farmore prevalent a century ago, today the silent epidemic oftooth decay continues unabated.This is especially true inlow-income, inner-city and rural populations and amongdevelopmentally disabled people and other underservedgroups, such as the homeless, homebound and medically compromised. Preventive dentistry's success story has yet to reach everyone who can benefit, and until it does, poororal health remains a neglected epidemic. The Beginnings of Oral Health Dental infections were a common cause of death in ancientpeoples, often the result of extensive dental caries. Rates ofdental caries correlated largely to diet. Diets heavy on meattended to lower caries rates, while diets rich in vegetablestended to increase them. In pre-Columbian America, forexample, pre-contact Zuni Indians had high vegetable dietsand a caries rate of 75 percent. Pre-contact Eskimos, on theother hand, with a diet rich in meat, had the lowest rate ofdental caries - about one percent. Once refined sugar wasintroduced to their diet, however, the caries rate amongEskimos soared.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Back 170 Dramatic improvements in oral healthoccurred once dentistry becamea profession in1839.Archeologists in Egypt discovered that lower-class people in ancient Egypt show a very low caries rate while royalty,with diets rich in carbohydrates, show an 80 percent cariesrate. In Egypt, ancient skulls have been found with smallholes drilled through the jawbone, thought to be a way toalleviate the pressure of abscesses, a secondary complicationof dental caries.The earliest known dentist, Hesi-Re, datesfrom the Zoser dynasty in Egypt around 2600 BC. In addi-tion to ancient Egypt, written records of oral health carehave been handed down by ancient civilizations in China,India, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome and by more recentcivilizations in the Islamic Middle East and MedievalEurope and in Mexico and Central America. In ancientMesopotamia, dentistry was part of medicine, its historypreserved by the Sumerians as far back as 2800 BC throughideograms, later to be translated by Assyrian and Babylo-nian students and copied on clay tablets with cuneiformwriting.The Code of Hammurabi (1900 BC) shows that asfar back as 2500 BC the government regulated the medical profession, and with it, dentistry. Milestones in Dental Innovations Toothbrushes Chewsticks, the first toothbrushes, were borrowed from the Chinese and Babylonians and first mentioned as a common method for cleaning the teeth by the Romans.They are still common today in many parts of Africa andmany Islamic countries. In Islam, oral hygiene is part of the Toothbrush drill in New York City, 1913.171 Hesi-Re, earliest- known dentist.religion, and the use of the chewstick, called the Miswak or Siwak, is a daily ritual. Any stick of fibrous material, smallerin diameter than a pencil and about six inches long, willdo. One end is chewed until the fibers separate and theseare then used to clean the surfaces of teeth, one at a time.Early bristle toothbrushes, invented by the Chinese, weremade from the neck bristles of cold-climate pigs. In mod-ern times, nylon toothbrushes date only from 1938, whenDuPont introduced them. It was only after World War IIthat tooth-brushing became a daily routine for mostAmericans, when returning soldiers kept up an enforcedmilitary discipline. In fact, the rejection rate of draftees during World War II due to poor oral health had been so high that standards had been lowered to meet targets. Toothpaste The roots of toothpaste can be traced to ancient China and India as far back as 500 BC.T oothpaste more similar to what we know today began to be developed in the1800s. In 1824, Dr. Peabody added soap to toothpaste;and in the 1850s, Dr. Harris added chalk. In 1873, Colgatebegan to mass-produce scented toothpaste in a jar. In 1892, Dr. Sheffield's Creme Dentifrice, the creation of Dr.Washington Sheffield of Connecticut, became the firsttoothpaste put into a collapsible tube. In 1896, ColgateDental Cream became the first toothpaste packaged in collapsible tubes to become widely available, and it was Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Back Women filling toothpaste tubes in the 1890s.172 A chewstick called a Miswak.Alfred Einhorn Dr. Charles C. Bass173 not until 1986 that the pump dispenser, introduced from Europe, began to compete with the collapsible tube.Colgate's research led the way to introducing fluoride totoothpaste, but Procter & Gamble and its Crest brand werefirst out of the gate with fluoride toothpaste in 1956. Fortoothpaste to be effective in preventing tooth decay, it musthave fluoride.Without fluoride, toothpaste can help preventgum disease but not tooth decay. Mouth Rinses Another means for cleaning teeth, discovered by theRomans, was the mouth sponge. Long branches and vineswere collected, scorched to remove the bark and then woven into a tight ball.When a bite of this sponge was chewed, it released a foaming substance, an astringent thatwas alternately rinsed and spit out during the 20 minutes the chewing normally took. Novocaine In 1905, the chemist Alfred Einhorn researched easy-to-use and safe anesthesia for dental procedures. He refinedthe chemical procaine until it was effective and named itNovocaine.This synthetic local anesthetic had none of theaddictive properties of cocaine, which had been introducedas an ophthalmologic anesthetic in 1884 by Dr. Carl Koller,a colleague of Sigmund Freud in Vienna, and as a blockingagent in oral surgery by the American surgeon, Dr.WilliamHalsted. Dental Floss Dental floss has existed in one form or another sinceancient times.The creator of modern dental floss, a NewOrleans dentist named Levi Spear Parmly, was born in1790 and died in 1859. In 1815, he began to promoteflossing with a string of silk thread. It was not until 1882that a company in Randolph, Massachusetts, began to manufacture unwaxed silk floss for home use.The Johnson& Johnson Company of New Brunswick, New Jersey,patented dental floss in 1898 and continues to be the major manufacturer today. Dr. Charles C. Bass developednylon floss during World War II and made flossing the important part of oral hygiene it is today. High-Speed Drill In 1957, John Borden introduced a high-speed, air-driven, contra-angle hand piece for drilling teeth. Called theAirotor and an immediate commercial success, the drillobtained speeds of up to 300,000 rotations per minute andlaunched a new era of high-speed dentistry. The Major Oral Diseases Dental Caries The three general types of tooth decay are coronal (on the crowns of teeth), root surface (on the roots of teeth) andrecurrent (reoccurring tooth decay).The elderly are espe- cially vulnerable to root surface decay, but 84 percent of17-year-old school children have had tooth decay, with anaverage of eight affected surfaces; and 99 percent of adults aged 40 to 44 have had tooth decay, with an average of 30affected surfaces. Gum Diseases Gingivitis and periodontitis are the two common infections of the soft tissues (gum) surrounding teeth.Gingivitis, a localized infection or inflammation of the soft tissues characterized by swelling and bleeding of thegums, disproportionately affects certain populations,especially Native Americans and Alaskan Natives, MexicanAmericans and low-income individuals. Periodontitis, alsoan infection or inflammation of the soft tissues, involves the supporting alveolar bone around teeth with loss ofperiodontal attachment. Its prevalence increases with age,and it disproportionately affects immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Oral Cancer A serious epidemic, oral and pharyngeal cancers affectmore than 30,000 Americans each year, and about 7,800die annually. Men over 40 years of age are most at risk due to tobacco and alcohol use, which are associated with over 70 percent of oral and pharyngeal cancers.Oral cancer incidence may increase in the future due tothe growing use of smokeless tobaccos, especially amongteenagers. Of all cancers, oral and pharyngeal cancers showMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Back 174 Coronal tooth decay.Complete tooth loss, oredentulism, wasonce much morewidely prevalentthan it is today.the largest discrepancy in five-year survival rates between Euro-Americans (56 percent) and African-Americans (36percent). Other Oral Diseases Complete tooth loss, or edentulism, was once much more widely prevalent than it is today. Still, of those aged65 and older, 30 percent have no teeth at all. Crookedteeth, another widespread epidemic, cause severe or verysevere malocclusion in an estimated 29 percent of adoles-cents. Finally, cleft lip and palate affect one out of 700Americans born each year.175Case Study FluoridationMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Case Study The link between fluoride and healthy teeth is the great discovery and success story for better oral health in the past 100 years. Community water fluoridation is one of thegreat preventive health measures in history.Who first linked fluoride in drinking water with decreased dental caries, andhow was the discovery applied to the public's health? Fluoride, whether present in tap water, toothpaste and oral rinses or as a topical application administered by dentists or oral hygienists, has become an integral part of better oralhygiene for most Americans. Fluoride occurs naturally in all drinking water, in greater or lesser concentrations accordingto geological features, and is odorless, colorless and tastelessat the recommended level. The fluoridation movement can be traced to the early years of the 20th century, when dentists began to focus on naturally fluoridated water for its preventive action on dentalcaries, or tooth decay.The most famous example was namedthe Colorado Brown Stain phenomenon by its discoverer,Frederick S. McKay, a young dentist who established hispractice in Colorado Springs. In 1908, Dr. McKay began to investigate why people in particular communities inColorado had severe tooth discoloration, known as dentalfluorosis, or more popularly, mottled enamel. In 1909, heenlisted the collaboration of a renowned dental researcher,Dr. G.V . Black of Northwestern University, who was lured to Colorado by a report of the Colorado Springs DentalSociety showing that nearly 90 percent of the city's locallyborn children were subject to the blight of mottled enamel.Together, Black and McKay determined that children waiting for their secondary teeth to erupt were at high risk of Colorado Brown Stain, while adults whose teeth had calcified without the stain were no longer at risk. Before Black's death in 1915, the two also realized that teeth afflicted with Colorado Brown Stain were inexplicablyresistant to decay. In 1923, McKay's hunch that the Colorado Brown Stain phenomenon might result from an ingredient in water was176 Drs.Black (left) and McKay (right) visitColorado Springs to investigate brownstain phenomenon.given a boost in Oakley, Idaho. Parents in Oakley were alarmed by a sudden onset of severe tooth discoloration intheir children and invited McKay to investigate.The com-munity had recently constructed a communal pipeline to a warm spring five miles away. McKay evaluated this new source of water and while it appeared normal according tohis tests, he nonetheless advised the community to ceaseusing the pipeline and begin using a nearby spring instead.Over the next few years, he determined that the new watersource had the effect of ending new cases of mottled enamelin children and that affected children were also relieved of theblight when their secondary teeth erupted. Separately, also in 1909, Dr. F .L. Robertson realized that people drinking water from a newly dug well in Bauxite,Arkansas, were showing signs of severe mottled enamel.Theblight became so widespread that the well was closed in 1927. McKay, hearing of the trouble in Bauxite, a companytown owned by the Aluminum Company of America, trav-eled there with Dr. Grover Kempf of the U.S. Public HealthService to investigate.They were surprised to learn thatmottled enamel was nonexistent in a town five miles away, but their tests with the available technology failed to deter- mine the causative agent for the children's mottled enamel Bauxite.Their report reached the desk of H.V . Churchill,ALCOA's chief chemist in Pennsylvania, who had spentyears defending aluminum cookware from charges it was poisonous. In 1930, to avoid yet another controversy,he ran a photospectrographic analysis on water from theBauxite well. The results showed a high presence ofnaturally occurring fluoride, something he could not believe,having never heard of fluoride in water. He tested a secondsample from the well with the same result. He immediatelywrote a letter to McKay, inviting him to send water samples from Colorado. McKay sprang to action, and Churchill's photospectrographic analyses of the Coloradowater samples also showed fluoride as the agent causing discoloration. In 1931, McKay finally knew that fluoride was the natural element in drinking water that caused the Colorado BrownStain phenomenon. His single-minded investigation overseveral decades proved that naturally fluoride in water.Dr.H.Trendly DeanMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Case Study the water supply would mottle tooth enamel but at the same time inhibit dental caries.T o McKay, the question washow to harness fluoride at a dosage that would inhibit bothdental caries and mottled enamel. In the 1930s, McKay collaborated with Dr. H.Trendly Dean of the U.S. Public Health Service to determine if fluoridecould be added to drinking water to prevent cavities.Theycollaborated on several classic studies, one an epidemiologicstudy involving 32 communities with naturally fluoridatedwater supplies, and established a community fluorosis index. Their associates conducted further studies that predicted theoptimal amount of fluoridation for preventing both toothdecay and discoloration. In effect, they were searching for anadjusted fluoridation standard that would have the benefit ofreducing dental caries while avoiding tooth discoloration, and they concluded that the standard should be one part permillion (1 ppm). World War II interrupted further studies, but on January 25, 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city in the world to adjust its water fluoride concentration to thenew adjusted fluoridation standard. [The 60th anniversary of fluoridation was observed, therefore, in early 2005.]Newburgh, New Y ork, added sodium fluoride to its watersupply in June 1945, and later that month, Brantford,Ontario, did the same. In February 1947, Evanston, Illinois, Grand Rapids schoolchildren collected saliva samples once a year from 1945 to 1960 to help dentists study the effects of fluoridation.178fluoridated its water supply. Four nearby communities with similar demographics were used as the control group -Muskegon in Michigan, Kingston in New Y ork, Sarnia inOntario, and Oak Park in Illinois. Careful tracking of ratesof dental caries ensued over 15 years, and the studies concurred that one part fluoride per million parts of a community's drinking water was the optimal standard,giving maximum protection against dental caries with minimum staining of the teeth. Emboldened after just five years by the success of these studies, the U.S. Public Health Service in 1950 recom-mended community water fluoridation as a public healthmeasure.The American Dental Association seconded thatrecommendation six months later. In the initial studies dating from 1945 conducted by the U.S. Public HealthService, the prevalence of caries decreased 48 percent to 70 percent among 12- to 14-year-olds who had lived in the four original fluoridated communities their entire lives.In other communities studied, the prevalence of cariesdecreased 45 percent to 94 percent (median 58 percent)among children who had been exposed to fluoridation forten years. By the early 1980s, epidemiologic evidence indi-cated that the prevalence of dental caries was decliningthroughout the United States. Three national surveyscompleted between 1971 and 1987 showed that childrendemonstrated a continued decrease in caries prevalence. Today, 60 years after Grand Rapids led the way, 170 million people live in fluoridated communities in the United States,including an estimated 10 million who live in communitieswith water supplies that are naturally fluoridated at the opti-mum level (1 ppm).Another 30 to 40 million people are estimated to live without public water supplies, dependingon such sources as drilled wells or natural springs. Despiteconclusive proof that community water fluoridation at theaccepted standard benefits oral health, with no known sideeffects, the remaining population of the United States live in communities without fluoridated water supplies. Only afew of the top 50 cities in the U.S. have yet to be fluoridat-ed, including Portland (Oregon), San Antonio (T exas) andSan Jose (California).Tucson,Arizona, voted to fluoridate in1992, but as of early 2005 had not yet fluoridated, a case in179 Three national surveys complet-ed between 1971and 1987 showedthat and more.Milestones .Chapter 1 .Vaccines .Case Study point for how long it can take to fluoridate a community. San Diego and the surrounding counties, involving 100water districts and nearly 18 million people, approved fluori- dation in 2003 but allowed 30 months for it to take effect. While the benefits of fluoridation to the public's health are incontrovertible and not at all controversial to scientists andpublic health professionals, the notion of community waterfluoridation still sparks controversy among people whooppose any form of government intervention in private lives and who regard it as forced medication and a violationof personal freedom.Although opponents often base theircounterclaims to fluoridation on quack science, masked bythe twin complaints of safety and effectiveness, adverse publicity has succeeded in delaying community fluoridation.In 1980, for example, 41 fluoridation referenda were held in the U.S. but only eight were approved. In the periodbetween 1977 and 1982, approximately 25 percent of fluoridation referenda passed. In both 2002 and 2004, 26communities across the country voted in referenda for fluoridation, while in 2003, 14 communities voted for fluoridation. Most communities (91 percent) fluoridateadministratively through local or state government. Fortunately, the furor caused by opponents of fluor- idation has dissipated slowly in the past two decades, withthe underlying science holding sway more and more. Since1980, however, progress in fluoridating the water in commu-nities with central water supplies has been disappointing.Only 11 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Ricohave passed laws that require fluoridation, usually only incommunities of a certain size (California, Connecticut,Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska,Nevada, Ohio, South Dakota). In the last great tumult, inCalifornia in 1995, opponents of fluoridation suffered astinging defeat when the state legislature mandated fluor-idation in communities with public water systems servingmore than 10,000 households. Nonetheless, many opponentshave persisted with legal challenges. Michigan, for example,changed the wording in its law and made fluoridation voluntary rather than mandatory. In the 30 years from 1954 to 1984, more than a dozen cases reached the U.S. SupremeCourt. None of the cases were actually heard by the court;Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Case Study 180they were dismissed either for lack of a substantial federal question or because they were simply not commented upon. Long-range studies show conclusively that children who grow up from infancy until age six drinking fluoridated water are much less prone to dental caries and other oral diseases, perhaps for the rest of their lives.The United Statesled the way in harnessing fluoride as a natural preventive for dental caries and leads the way with the largest numberof people in the world living in fluoridated communities. In2002, more than 67 percent of the U.S. population wholived in communities with public water supply systemsreceived fluoridated water. Still, much work remains to be done to ensure that the greatest possible number of peoplebenefit from community water fluoridation. Because oralhealth impacts the quality of everyone's life, and becausefluoridation can be shown to help keep students in school,learning, and workers at work, working, every communitywithout water fluoridation should carefully consider the evi-dence. Overwhelmingly, the evidence shows that communi-ties with fluoridated water supplies have reduced the preva-lence of dental caries in their populations.181 Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings placed as liquid plastics on the pits and fissures of the chewing surfaces of teeth and then poly-merized.While fluorides are most effective at preventing decay on the smooth surfaces of teeth, sealants effectively prevent decay on the chewing surfaces of teeth. Applying dental sealants is painless andnoninvasive and does not require anesthesia or the cutting of toothstructure. Children aged six to eight and 12 to 14 years should be targeted for the procedure, just as the six-year and 12-year molarserupt.These molars are the most susceptible to decay. The origins of dental sealants lie in the work of Dr. Michael Buonocore who, in 1955, discovered the properties required to bond resins to tooth enamel.The process involves applying a phos-phoric acid solution to the tooth surface for 30 seconds, then rinsingand applying shortly afterward an acrylic resin on the same surface.Buonocore experimented first on extracted teeth and then on volunteers to determine the right amounts and adhesion times. His discovery first led to composite fillings for anterior tooth surfaces,especially fractured incisors, and then evolved into the preventivedentistry of fissure sealants.The application of fissure sealants, aneffective method to prevent fissure caries in permanent molars, relieson the acid etching and bonding to enamel perfected first byBuonocore in 1955. Currently, more than 85 percent of school-aged children lack dental sealants.The simple efficacy of fissure sealants in preventing fissurecaries - people with sealants suffer six times less tooth decay - callsfor their widespread application in young children. Effective school-based prevention programs should combine fluorides and sealants,to protect both the smooth and pitted surfaces of teeth. For childrenwho live in communities without fluoridated water, an alternateapproach would be to apply fluoride topically to the smooth toothsurfaces. Fluoride application is most preventive in children when first and second molars erupt, between the ages of six and eight and 12 and 14, respectively. As it happens, these are the precise times when the application of fissure sealant is also most preventive.Sealants, together with community water fluoridation, representmajor milestones in preventive dentistry and improved oral health and promise to spare millions of children the discomforts of dentalcaries and gingivitis.Vignette Dental Sealants 182 Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .VignetteDr. Myron Allukian, former director of OralHealth, Boston PublicHealth Commission.Oral health must become a higher priority at the local, state and national levels if oral health disparities are to beimproved and resolved. Dr. Myron Allukian, a retired direc-tor of oral health at the Boston Public Health Commissionand a former president of the American Public HealthAssociation, says,\"Fluoridation and community-based pre-vention must be the foundation for better oral health.\" In 2000, the U.S. Surgeon General issued its first-ever Report on Oral Health ,with a call to action that has yet to be real- ized. Among the report's recommendations, local and statehealth departments and every other level of the publichealth system are called upon to emphasize oral health to amuch greater degree and to create dental health programs with properly trained staff to address a neglected epidemic. Report on Oral Health by the U.S. Surgeon General The major findings of the report are as follows : 1.Oral diseases and disorders in and of themselves affect health and well-being throughout life. 2.Safe and effective measures exist to prevent the most common dental diseases - dental caries and periodontaldiseases. 3.Lifestyle behaviors that affect general health such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, and poor dietarychoices affect oral and craniofacial health as well. 4.There are profound and consequential oral health disparities within the U.S. population. 5.More information is needed to improve America's oral health and eliminate health disparities. 6.The mouth reflects general health and wellness. 7.Oral diseases and conditions are associated with other health problems. 8.Scientific research is key to further reduction in the burden of diseases and disorders that affect the face, mouth and teeth.Looking Ahead Oral Diseases, Still a Neglected EpidemicMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Ahead 183Concerns for the Future /rhombus6Currently, at the federal level about a dozen oral health specialists work within the CDC and just a handfulremain in the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA), which once had 300. Just one oral health professional works at the Centers for Medicaid andMedicare, the largest health-related program in the federal government.The federal government couldshow a greater commitment to fighting oral diseases by boosting the number of oral health specialists in its key agencies. /rhombus6At the state level, 39 percent of states do not have full-time state oral health directors, and some states are eliminating them. /rhombus6In 2004, only 152 of the 160,000 practicing dentists in the U.S. were board-certified in public health. About1,600 dentists work in public health roles, but only 600have at least two years of advanced education.While aclinician may see 800 patients a year on average, publichealth dentists reach millions of people. Unfortunately,training in public health is perceived to diminish earn-ings potential, a perception that can be changed only ifgovernment at every level validates the work of publichealth dentists. /rhombus6Currently, only 2.2 percent of practicing dentists in the United States are African-American, as compared witha 12 percent share of the total population. Hispanics andNative Americans are similarly underrepresented, andthis is cause for concern in lower-income communities. /rhombus6According to a Government Accounting Office (GAO) study in 1998, only 20 percent of children in Medicaidreceive dental care, even though Medicaid includes dental services aimed specifically at children throughthe Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment(EPSDT) Program. In the same vein, the oral compo-nent of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)needs to be upgraded. Meanwhile, in an unfortunateresponse to deficits, many states have eliminated dental care from adult Medicaid. /rhombus6Of people in the United States older than 40 years, 93 percent have not had an oral cancer exam in theMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Ahead 184past year. Oral cancers are more prevalent than cervical cancer, yet most women receive pap smearsroutinely. /rhombus6Of nursing home residents in the United States, 81 percent have not had an annual oral exam. For the 19percent who did, the exam often comes only after theresident has been rushed by ambulance for emergency care. /rhombus6Currently, only about half of the United States popula- tion has some form of dental insurance. If a diabeticperson presents with a leg ulcer, medical insurancewould cover care, but if that same individual presents with a mouth ulcer, his care would not be coveredwithout dental insurance. /rhombus6As a percentage of total health expenditures, dental service expenditures have decreased 28 percent, from6.4 percent in 1970 to about 4.6 percent today. The most vulnerable in the population are most at risk for oral diseases and suffer their worst effects. Studies showthat up to 97 percent of homeless people need dental care;over half of Head Start children in some locations have had early childhood caries (ECC); almost half of abusedchildren have orofacial trauma; and so on. Jonathan Kozol,the education critic and author of Death at an Early Age,winner of the National Book Award in 1968, and Savage Inequalities ,a best-seller published in 1992, writes, \"Bleeding gums, impacted teeth and rotting teeth are routine matters for the children I have interviewed in the South Bronx. Children get used to feeling constantpain.They go to sleep with it.They go to school with it....Children live for months with pain that grown-upswould find unendurable.\" Since 1997, with the introduction of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), nearly every state hasbegun to offer dental benefits to low-income children. Inmost cases, SCHIP affords both preventive and diagnosticcare, providing a new vehicle to reach a large segment ofthe U.S. population previously underserved with dentalcare. In 2003, seven states had already exceeded HealthyPeople 2010 goals, while many others were quickly approaching the goals. By providing dental care to low-185 \"Bleeding gums,impacted teethand rotting teethare Bronx.Children get usedto feeling con-stant pain....\"186 income people, usually for the first time, SCHIP saves growing numbers of children from unendurable pain. More important, SCHIP also provides families with peace ofmind. Public-Private Partnerships Partnerships between the public sector and private industry can provide access to quality dental care for underservedchildren. One such approach is the Crest \"Healthy Smiles2010\" campaign initiated by Procter & Gamble in 2001with the backing of the American Dental Association, theBoys & Girls Clubs of America and the American Academyof Pediatric Dentistry.\"Healthy Smiles 2010\" aims to reach50 million children this decade to alleviate the silent epidemic of tooth decay, the most common chronic child-hood disease.T ooth decay in children is five times moreprevalent than asthma and seven times more prevalent than hay fever. Key initiatives in the campaign are \"GiveKids a Smile\" Day in February, the Crest First GradeProgram, and Crest \"Smile Shoppes,\" full-service dentalclinics established in Boys & Girls Clubs in six U.S. cities.As well, more than 1,000 Boys & Girls Clubs throughoutthe country have become \"Cavity-Free Zones\" thanks toan oral health curriculum for children in grades K-3 set up in on-the-spot education centers in the clubs. Perhaps most critical, Crest won the commitment of dental schools throughout the country to send dentalstudents into schools in their communities to provide preventive treatment and oral health instruction to children, especially underserved and at-risk children. \"Creating public-private partnerships can help affect change in the oral health of our country.These collectiveefforts can help educate both the public and health profes-sionals, as well as provide the health care services and oralcare tools needed to help end the current disparity in ournation's oral health,\" said Dr. David Satcher who, as U.S.Surgeon General, oversaw the publication of the Report on Oral Health in 2000.The Crest \"Healthy Smiles 2010\" campaign distributes millions of toothpaste tubes andtoothbrushes to children free of charge every year, and children learn how and when to brush their teeth, criticalsteps to good oral hygiene.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Ahead \"Creating public- private partner-ships can helpaffect change inthe oral health ofour country.\"A Sealant Success Story Another example of public-private partnerships is the Case Western sealant program in Cleveland, Ohio.Thepresident of Case Western Reserve University, Dr. EdwardM. Hundert, came from the medical school at theUniversity of Rochester, where as dean, he focused onpublic health and eliminating disparities in care among ethnic groups. After he arrived at Case Western Reserve in 2002, Hundert moved quickly to involve students in Cleveland. His constant refrain has been to give studentsreal-life experiences by helping the community.T o this end, Case Western dental students currently apply sealant to the teeth of 15,000 second- and sixth-graders in theCleveland Public Schools every year.\"Our philosophy isthat the external things we're doing are the things that will set our university apart,\" Hundert said. For now, the dental sealant program symbolizes most visibly Case Western's engagement with Cleveland and, for dentalstudents, has become the high point of their year.\"It's awonderful thing on all sides,\" said Dr. James Lalumandier, the chairman of community dentistry.\"In this country, 80percent of dental disease is in 20 percent of the children,and these are the 20 percent. Students arrive at the medicalschool and dental school with a desire to help people, andif you get them into clinical work quickly, they don't losethat desire.\" \"When you sit down for the first time to use a probe in the mouth, it's a big moment,\" said Oliver Thuernagle, astudent from Idaho.\"I'm from a place where you don'tlock the door when you go on vacation, and here I am at schools where you sign in and they check you for guns,\"Thuernagle said.\"We saw children whose teeth had erupt-ed only five months ago and were already rotten to thecore.Y ou refer them to someone who will take care of thecavities. But you wish you were there five months ago.\" The Challenges Ahead To address oral health needs, the number one priority of public health policymakers should be to extend communitywater fluoridation as widely as possible. As Dr. Allukian says,\"Fluoridation is nature's way to prevent tooth decay.\"The second priority should be to make school-based dentalMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic Dr.Edward M. Hundert Applied dental sealant.187Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking Ahead Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic sealant programs as widely available as possible to high-risk children whose first molars have fully erupted (ages six toeight) and again when second molars have erupted (ages 12to 14). Children without deep crevices and who show nosign of tooth decay would not be deemed high-risk. Asidefrom good oral hygiene, which must be taught systematic-ally in schools, these two measures - community waterfluoridation and school-based dental sealant programs -would together, if fully implemented, address the neglected epidemic of oral disease.The most effective preventivemeasures, focused on school-aged children, require the fullengagement of government in fostering public-private partnerships. Government can engage by supporting the dental public health infrastructure. More minorities need to be recruitedto careers in oral health, more local and state oral healthdirectors need to be named and funded, and more public-private partnerships need to be cemented to provide carewhen it counts most, when first and second molars erupt.Successful sealant programs require follow-up a year laterto be sure that the initial applications were done carefully.The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which announceda $19 million program to recruit minorities to careers inmedicine and dentistry, could also fund outreach tominorities for public health training. Why shouldn't there be a national movement for community-based prevention? As Allukian says,\"There'snever been one and there should be.\" Mouth guards shouldbe required for all contact sports. Every second-gradershould receive sealants. community's water supplysystem should be fluoridated. Boston's fluoridation processtook eight years and involved approvals from 33 separatecommunities, but thanks to Allukian's persistence, it gotdone. Everywhere he goes in Greater Boston, Allukian can take satisfaction from the fact that the teenagers heencounters won't suffer as in the past from oral diseasesthat cause debilitating pain. A final word from Allukian:\"Oral diseases are a neglected epidemic in our country, and the oral health disparities ofthe underserved are shameful.We need to reconnect themouth to the rest of the body.\" Why shouldn'tthere one should be.\"Milestones 9 Health .Looking Ahead 188Photo credits Page 167: Dentist examing a girl's teeth, \u00a9 Peter Beck/CORBIS.

Many fami-lies in the United States and across the world deal privatelywith some form of addiction as part of their daily lives. As many people know too well, addictions transcend the user and can have negative physical and emotionaleffects on family, friends and the community. Nicotine addiction, caused by tobacco use, adversely affects the health of cigarette smokers and those around themthrough second-hand smoke, leading to exacerbation ofasthma and otitis media (ear infections) in children. Alcoholaddiction causes extensive liver damage and organ systemfailure and creates mental and physical challenges for those around alcoholics.The deadly combination of drinking anddriving causes injury and death for hundreds of innocentvictims each year. Substance abuse of illegal psychoactivedrugs - marijuana, cocaine, LSD and opiates, among other mood-alter ing drugs - leads users to crimes such as burglary and prostitution to support a habit and can further lead to wholesale wars between rival drug-dealing gangs. The challenge for public health in chang- ing addictive behavior is further compli-cated by shifting public attitudes towarddrug and alcohol use and by the impact of advertising and peer pressure. It is notunusual for one generation to come of agewithout direct experience of an addictionthat an older generation knows too well.For example, during the 1800s opiates and cocaine were both thought to have beneficial health effectsfor users.They seemed palliative, easing symptoms of illhealth; the public viewed them positively, despite theiraddictive properties, and began using them widely. In fact,when the soft drink Coca-Cola was invented in the lateMilestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Back Chapter 10 Addiction Looking Back191 As many people know too well,addictions tran-scend the userand have neg-ative physical andemotional effectson family, friendsand the commu-nity. An opium den in New York, 1881.1880s, many thought that the coca plant was one of its original ingredients. By the early to mid-1900s, however, the public's view of psychoactive drugs changed. Addictive properties of thedrugs were now frowned upon, and the public began toclamor for stricter controls. Alcohol, too, was viewed nega-tively by a public acutely aware of its addictive properties,and in 1919, under the leadership of Carrie Nation, theTemperance Movement achieved the prohibition of alcohol through the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights (the 21st Amendment reversed Prohibition in 1933). After World War II and especially in the1960s and the 1970s, the public became more tolerant ofsuch psychoactive drugs as marijuana, not fully aware thatmarijuana often opens doors for users to try much moreaddictive and debilitating drugs, such as cocaine.The heavi-ly publicized drug excesses of the last decades of the 20thcentury, however, have shifted public opinion in the early21st century back toward intolerance. How do addicts differ from occasional or even frequent users of the same substances? What makes an addict? TheAmerican Psychiatric Association defines someone with anaddiction as meeting at least three of five criteria.The firstis tolerance, the need for markedly increased amounts ofthe substance to achieve the desired effect or, with contin-ued use of the same amount, a markedly diminished effect.The second is withdrawal.When the user stops taking theMilestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Back 192 Prohibitionist Carrie Nation ...the public became more tolerant of such psychoactive drugs as marijuana, notfully debilitatingdrugs, such ascocaine....which finds users sacrificing the full dimensions of life - social,occupational andrecreational - to satisfy cravings for the substance.substance for a time, uncomfortable or dangerous symp- toms result. For example, tobacco users experience irri-tability, lack of concentration, fatigue and hunger whenthey go without nicotine.The third is loss of control, whena user takes more of a substance over a longer period oftime than was intended. Again, using tobacco as an exam-ple, 70 percent of smokers would like to quit, but less thanhalf actually do.The fourth is preoccupation, leading a userto spend a great deal of time obtaining and using a sub-stance or recovering from the effects. The final crite-rion is continuation despite adverse consequences, which finds users sacrificing the full dimensions of life - social,occupational and recreational - to satisfy cravings for thesubstance. What gives substances their addictive properties? Researchers have studied the effects of psychoactive drugson the brain for decades. Drugs cause short-term surges in dopamine and other brain messengers that signal pleas-ure or reward. Pleasure and reward lead to cravings thatbecome fixed in memory, making it difficult for a user to resist the lure. Meanwhile, as the brain's pleasure circuits adapt to the deluge of short-term surges, they becomedesensitized and can suffer withdrawal once the binge isover. A perplexing aspect of addiction - that drugs usually don't induce as much pleasure after prolonged use - is due, in part, to the phenomenon of tolerance. Despite thereduced pleasure, addicts keep taking their drug of choice even as they consciously try to abstain. Positron emission193 The brain of a person taking cocaine. Normal brain On cocainetomography (PET) scans show that parts of the nervous system are unusually active when people experience crav-ings. Cravings can be provoked by the slightest stimulation- the whiff of a remembered odor, the flashback of a place,a remembered pleasurable activity or piece of drug para-phernalia. An addict's cravings are awakened by stimuli inthe same way Pavlov's dogs salivated. Relapses, the coreclinical problem of addiction, are frequent, even years afterthe last dose.The brain's demand for the pleasure \"fix\"usually overcomes any rational thoughts to the contrary. Before researchers came to understand addiction more fully,\"inebriety\" was viewed by the health professions as afunctional disease thought to be triggered by an underlyingmental disturbance. An individual could inherit or acquirea weakened, nervous constitution and be more susceptibleto addictive behavior than another individual viewed asneurologically normal. Rather than a vice, as the generalpublic might view it, the public health community viewedaddictive behavior as a disease that affected susceptible peo-ple for whom there were risk factors, environmental trig-gers and potentially successful treatments if identified early. Purified cocaine became commercially available in this country in 1884, and its use spread rapidly. Cocaine affectsthe central nervous system powerfully, creating a sense ofeuphoria.The pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis sup-plied cocaine in 15 forms, from coca cigarettes to cocainefor injection to cocaine for sniffing, all of which were legalat the time. Marijuana, on the other hand, entered the U.S.through Mexico during a time of drug intolerance in the1920s and spread more slowly. Not until the public moodshifted once again toward drug tolerance in the 1960s didmarijuana become widely used. It is estimated that more than half of all smokers suffer serious health consequences from tobacco addiction - foremost, premature death from lung cancer - and innocentbystanders also suffer health consequences from exposure to secondhand smoke, known as environmental tobaccosmoke (ETS).The legislative accomplishments of cities and towns in outlawing smoking in public places, a publichealth phenomenon of the 1990s and continuing into thepresent, offer a vivid contrast to the laissez faire attitude of earlier generations toward this health hazard.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Back 194 An 1894 emergency kit, readily available to the public, carriedcocaine, morphine,atropine and strychnine. Pavlov's dog.Alcohol abuse and dependence continue to be major health problems in the United States. Unlike other drugs, alcoholis legal, advertised widely and sold in the retail market.Alcohol finds uses in religious ceremonies, happy eventssuch as weddings, and sad gatherings such as wakes; it isoften a gift given to commemorate special occasions.Nonetheless, nearly 14 million Americans - one in 13adults - are either alcoholics or abuse alcohol heavily.Alcohol abuse also occurs among teenagers who mayindulge in the extremely dangerous habit of binge-drinkingby consuming, within several hours, more than five alco- holic drinks at one sitting.The body metabolizes alcohol at approximately one drink per hour, so an amount thatexceeds that causes intoxication and can lead to potentialcomplications. In 2000, more than 18,500 deaths in the United States resulted from alcohol abuse. In 1990, the economic costs were estimated to exceed $98 billion, and alcoholinvolvement was implicated in nearly half of all traffic crashdeaths. In 1988, alcohol-related deaths numbered 107,800,or five percent of the total mortality in the United States.One-fifth of these deaths were directly attributable to alco-hol abuse and dependence - involving liver cirrhosis, forexample.The remaining four-fifths were alcohol-related,representing 35 percent of all accidental fall fatalities; 28 percent of all suicides; 45 percent of all accidental fire fatal-ities; 38 percent of all accidental drownings; and 50 percentof all deaths due to cancers of the lip, oral cavity, pharynxand esophagus. Clearly, the costs of alcohol abuse, whetherdirect or indirect, are staggering. Alcoholism, also known as alcohol dependence, is a chronic, progressive and potentially fatal disease. Manymore Americans are addicted to alcohol than to illicitdrugs. Researchers at the University of Colorado HealthSciences Center in Denver have identified 41 genes thathelp determine whether a person becomes an alcoholic.Alcoholics display the following characteristics: /rhombus6Drinking excessive amounts frequently. /rhombus6A strong need or compulsion to drink. /rhombus6Inability to limit one's drinking on any given occasion.195 In 1990, the economic costswere estimated to exceed $98 billion, and alco-hol involvementwas implicated in nearly half of alltraffic crashdeaths.Susan B.AnthonyWomen drink alcoholduring pregnancyrun the risk of miscarriages andinfant death./rhombus6Inability to curb drinking despite medical, psychological or social complications. /rhombus6Increased tolerance to alcohol. /rhombus6Withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, anxiety and shaking after stopping drinking. Alcohol is classified as a depressive drug because it causes relaxation, sedation, and if a sufficient quantity is con- sumed, coma and even death. Among the major healthproblems that result from alcohol abuse are damage to thedigestive system, including stomach irritation, gastritis andulcers and cirrhosis of the liver, which results from alcoholdecreasing the liver's ability to metabolize fat. Other healthproblems include enlargement of the heart leading to coro-nary heart disease, high blood pressure, and psychiatricproblems that include irritability, hyperactivity, paranoiaand hallucinations. Women who drink alcohol during pregnancy run the risk of miscarriages and infantdeath, and pregnant women who are alcoholics run the risk of delivering infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. Women have often been outliers with regard to substance abuse. Historically, women were much less likely to usetobacco, viewing it as masculine, and local ordinances often forbade bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol towomen. During the Victorian era, society strove to preserve an image of purity in women.Women who used andabused alcohol, in saloons or elsewhere, were commonlyviewed as prostitutes. In fact, divorce law in many jurisdic-tions allowed \"intemperance\" on the part of the wife to be grounds for divorce.T oday, women are nearly as likely as men to smoke, and alcohol abuse knows no gender.Thefact that more women than men die from cardiovascular disease, a common complication of smoking, shows thatwomen have equalized the playing field of substance abuse. The late 1800s in America gave rise to progressivism, a political movement seeking to redress the wrongs andexcesses of industrial capitalist society. Progressivism in turngave rise to the T emperance Movement, led by womenwhose goal was to save their husbands from alcohol abuse.The T emperance Movement reached its pinnacle in 1919when the 18th Amendment to the Bill of Rights passed,outlawing the distribution and sale of liquor. A prominentMilestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Back 196leader of the T emperance Movement, Susan B. Anthony, also led the fight for women's suffrage, and while she didnot live to vote herself, her life's work achieved its goal in 1920 when the 19th Amendment, giving women theright to vote, quickly followed Prohibition. It was no coincidence that the amendments introducing Prohibitionand women's suffrage passed in consecutive years; womenwho wanted to save men from the ravages of drink andchauvinism were energized enough to influence thenation's politics. Although Prohibition had at its core thegoal of eliminating alcohol abuse in men and saving families, its enforcement became such a problem that the 21st Amendment was passed in 1933, repealingProhibition and ending the brief age of the \"speakeasy.\" In the 1960s, when the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco gave rise to a psychedelic movement, the word\"hippie\" came to define a generation.This restless, resistantgeneration, raised in relative affluence by fathers who wereWorld War II veterans and mothers who stayed at home, made its presence felt in anti-war politics. Ironically, as theJohnson administration launched a far-reaching, ambitious War Against Poverty to right economic disparities in American society, the Vietnam War tore the generationsapart.\"Never trust anyone over 30\" became a mantra.One of many dividing lines was tolerance for psychotropicdrugs.While alcoholic, nicotine-addicted World War II veterans filled Veterans Administration hospitals, many Vietnam War veterans returning from an unpopular war to a tumultuous society continued to use marijuana, hashishand other psychotropic drugs that had been readily avail-able in Vietnam.This generation had a high tolerance forillicit drugs and suffered from their addictive properties.The public health community, prominent in the ranks ofthose fighting the War Against Poverty, was late in recog-nizing the public health implications of excessive drug use. To gain traction against addiction, the public health com- munity often has to overcome public misperceptions - the hippie celebration of psychotropic drugs is an example -and to sway government to intervene to regulate health hazards.The federal government and the cumbersome legislative machinery of Congress often enter the fray last.Effective legislation usually takes place first at the state and197 Prohibition ends, April 1933.

The National Centeron Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at ColumbiaUniversity has found that children who reach the age of 21without smoking, using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol arevirtually certain never to do so. In 1984, Congress passedlegislation denying highway funds to states unless theymandated a minimum legal drinking age of 21. Most stateshave also outlawed tobacco sales to teens under 18;in some states, new laws have raised that age to 19.Whilestates vary in sentencing guidelines for those convicted of the sale and distribution of illicit drugs, legal penaltieshave generally toughened over time. In combating thehealth hazards of addictive substances, the public healthcommunity has, in the end, found government to be a willing and necessary ally.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Back 198 ...children who reach the age of 21 without smok-ing, using illegaldrugs or abusingalcohol are virtu-ally certain never to do so.Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, wrote in a recent report:\"In the four decades following therelease of the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health ,we have seen dramatic progress in reducing tobacco use in this country. Adult-smoking rates have been cut nearly in half between 1965 and 2001, from 42.4percent to 22.8 percent, and per-capita consumption oftobacco products has fallen more than half, from 4,345 cigarettes in 1963 to 1,979 cigarettes in 2002. But, tragically,smoking remains the leading preventable cause of deathand disease in the United States, claiming the lives of morethan 440,000 Americans each year.The good news is thatwe know what works to curb tobacco use: comprehensive programs combining school, health care, community, mediaand policy efforts.\" In 2001, 46.2 million adults in the United States were current smokers and an estimated 8.6 million people hadserious smoking-related illness.T obacco's enormous toll onthe health of the public causes 4.8 million deaths world-wide.The World Health Organization projects that by theyear 2030, the use of tobacco will kill 10 million people annually, including seven million in developing countries.Just as in the United States, tobacco use will become the rest of the world's leading cause of preventable death. Excluding adult deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke, adult males and females in the United States lose an average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively, if they smoke. Among adults, between 1995 and 1999, mostdeaths caused by tobacco use were from lung cancer(124,813), ischemic heart disease (81,976) and chronic airway obstruction (64,735). Estimates show that smokingcauses $82 billion in lost productivity and $75 billion inexcess medical expenditures annually.The costs are estimat-ed to be about $4,391 per smoker per year. Each cigarettepack sold in the U.S. costs the nation an estimated $7.18 inmedical care costs and lost productivity. Joseph A. Califano, Jr., director of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, observes,\"CigaretteMilestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Case Study Case Study Tobacco199 ...adult males and females in theUnited States losean average of 13.2and 14.5 years oflife, respectively, ifthey smoke.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Case Study 200 smoking is Public Health Enemy Number One in the United States. People who smoke are committing slow-motion suicide.The economic cost of smoking in healthcare, fires, accidents and lost productivity tops $150 billion.The cost in grief and sadness for the children and familiesof the victims is beyond calculation.\" Every day, more than 4,000 young people try cigarettes for the first time. From 2000 to 2003, tobaccouse among high school students declined significantly,from 34.5 percent to 28.4 percent, continuing a down-ward national trend since 1997.There were no significant declines among middle school students, however. The demographics of tobacco use have been changing. For the first time, smoking prevalence among black men is similar to that among white men. During the period 1965-2001, smoking declined faster for non-Hispanic blacks aged18 years and older than for non-Hispanic whites of thesame age. In 2001, among racial and ethnic groups, smok-ing prevalence was highest among American Indians/AlaskaNatives (32.7 percent) and lowest among Hispanics (16.7percent) and Asians (12.4 percent). In 2002, the prevalenceof smoking in the United States stood at 25.5 percentamong men and 21.5 percent among women, down fromthe peaks of 57 percent among men in 1955 and 34 per-cent among women in 1965.The decline in rates of smok-ing reached a plateau in 1990 that has persisted, however. In 2001, 41 percent of smokers stopped smoking for at least one day because they wanted to quit. The success rate is daunting, however - less than five percent of smokers who quit for one day are able to do so for three to 12 months. Smoking and mental illness are closely linked. Smoking rates have been reported to be over 80 percent among people who have schizophrenia, 50 percent to 60 percentamong people with depression, 55 percent to 80 percentamong those who have alcoholism, and 50 percent to 66percent among those who have other substance-abuse prob-lems. In one study, smokers with coexisting psychiatric orsubstance-abuse disorders were estimated to account for 44percent of all cigarettes smoked in the United States.Thispercentage reflects both the high prevalence of smoking inconnection with these conditions and the fact that patientswith these disorders are likely to be very heavy smokers.Every day, morethan 4,000 youngpeople try cigarettes for thefirst time. The success rateis daunting, how-ever - less than five percent ofsmokers who quitfor one day areable to do so for three to 12months.201 On January 11, 1964, Luther L.T erry, Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, released the report of theSurgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health , commonly known as the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health .This landmark document was America's first widely publicized official recognition that cigarettesmoking causes cancer and other serious diseases. Spurredto action by the report, Congress enacted in 1965 theFederal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, requiring warning labels on cigarette packs. In 1969, Congress passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, strengtheningthe warning label to read \"Warning:The Surgeon Generalhas determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to yourhealth.\"This is the label that is still in effect. Starting in1971, federal laws enacted by Congress prohibited cigaretteadvertising on broadcast television and radio. On January11, 1978, the 14th anniversary of the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano, Jr. publiclydeclared a war on smoking. Tobacco companies, consummate marketers of a product that depends on nicotine addiction for continued business,quickly found ways to combat the first Surgeon General'sReport and a suddenly activist Congress.

Califano, Jr.Milestones .Chapter 8 .Addiction .Case Study 202 Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Case Study the work of creating smoke-free environments happens at the state and local levels, tobacco companies used their lobbying muscle and campaign donations to enlist the support of influential state legislators to keep anti-smokinglegislation at bay.The preferred approach over the years has been to bottle up proposed legislation in committee,and tobacco companies have won those battles surprisinglyoften. The terrain for anti-tobacco efforts changed significantly in 1999 with the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA)negotiated between the attorneys general of 46 states and five territories and the major tobacco companies.Theattorneys general, led by Mississippi, signed a $206 billionagreement with tobacco companies to settle Medicaid lawsuits that had been filed to recover the high medicalcosts associated with treating terminal illnesses caused bysmoking. Although $206 billion has now been completelydistributed to the states, in varying amounts, the overallpercentage of the settlement money dedicated to fightingtobacco addiction and, thus, helping reduce the associatedMedicaid costs, has been surprisingly low. Instead, manystates have chosen to balance their budgets with the windfall. Recent developments in combating tobacco addiction include therapeutic agents, such as patches and gum, that are sold over the counter in drugstores.Therapeutics alsoinclude prescription antidepressants for patients with theco-morbidity of depression. Over the last decade,campaigns to reduce and prevent the prevalence of smok-ing among youth have mushroomed in states. Many ofthese programs take place in schools and in organizationsserving youth such as Boys and Girls Clubs, led by localand state health departments. One such program is theTruth@ campaign, developed by the American Legacy Foundation.Truth@ is a hard-hitting advertising, grassroots and Internet program designed to prevent youth smoking;public health experts credit Truth@ for increasing anti-tobacco attitudes among young people, making it less likelythat they will smoke. The primary driver of the anti-smoking message comes through health education at the local level, assisted by a growing movement to eliminate smoking in the work- Over the lastdecade, facilities.These anti-smoking meas- ures strengthen the message in campaigns aimed at youth. They also reinforce the message that environmental tobacco smoke (secondhand smoke) can be as deadly forinnocent bystanders as for smokers themselves.Whilerestaurant trade associations joined forces with tobacco companies to fight smoking restrictions at every turn,restaurants and bars have learned that smoking restrictions in fact help build business. In 2002, when New Y ork Cityoutlawed smoking in bars and taverns, tavern owners led apublic outcry that helped contribute to a sharp drop inMayor Michael Bloomberg's popularity.The mayor wouldnot be swayed, however, stating that the decision was rightand good for the public's health.With time, the outcry hasdissipated and taverns have found that customers continueto sidle up to the bar.203 They also reinforce the message that environmentaltobacco smoke(secondhandsmoke) can be asdeadly for inno-cent bystanders as for smokersthemselves.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Vignette 204 Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) was founded in 1980 at a steak house in Sacramento, California, by a group of mothers whowere enraged that a repeat drunk-driving offender had killed Candace Lightner's 13-year-old daughter, Cari.T wo days before Cari's death,the offender had been released on bail for a hit-and-run drunk-drivingcrash, after having been convicted for two previous drunk-drivingcrashes and a third that had been plea-bargained to \"reckless accident.\"When Cari died, the offender carried a valid California driver'slicense, and the group of women rallying around Candace Lightnervowed to organize to prevent drunk driving. MADD originally stood for \"Mothers Against Drunk Drivers,\" but in 1984 MADD changed\"Drivers\" to \"Driving.\" Meanwhile, across the country in Maryland in 1979, Cindi Lamb's five-and-a-half-month-old daughter Laura became one the world'syoungest quadriplegics when a repeat drunk driver traveling at 120 mph caused a head-on crash. Cindi Lamb and her friends began towage a war against drunk driving in Maryland.When the publicity generated by Candace Lightner's group in California reached CindiLamb the next year, the two groups joined forces. By 1981, MADDhad 11 chapters in four states. What empowered MADD to grow? According to figures for 2000 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),three of every ten North Americans will be affected, at some point intheir lives, by an alcohol-related traffic crash. In 1999, roughly 17 per-cent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes were intoxicated at the timeof their crash. For every age from six through 33, traffic crashes are thesingle greatest cause of death, and about 45 percent of these fatalitiesare in alcohol-related crashes. In 2000, when 16,653 people werekilled in alcohol-related traffic crashes in the United States, these fatalities reflected an increase for the first time in five years. Examples of why MADD's mission resonates with people are legion. One particularly horrific example was a bus crash in Carrollton,Kentucky, on May 14, 1988.That day, a drunk driver in a pickup truck drove the wrong way on I-71 and crashed head-on into a schoolbusfull of children, teens and chaperones who were heading home from a church outing at an amusement park in Cincinnati. Flames killed 24young people and three adults and injured 30 others.The driver of the pickup, a repeat drunk-driving offender, survived. Just a few terribleVignette Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic moments shattered the lives of 57 families and sent an entire commu- nity into shock. In 1982, just two years after MADD organized at the steak house in Sacramento, President Ronald Reagan invited MADD to serve on thePresidential Task Force on drunk driving. By the end of that year, theorganization had grown to 100 chapters. MADD's first national advo-cacy success, helping Congress enact a law that established the firstNational Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week, came thatDecember. In 1983, the organization opened national headquarters in Hurst,T exas, and became the subject of a made-for-televisionmovie broadcast by NBC.The media attention helped open manymore chapters. In 1984, with a strong push from MADD, Congresspassed the federal \"21\" minimum legal drinking-age law, and MADDopened a chapter in Canada, the first of many international chapters. Among the many services provided by MADD, victims' support and training are foremost. MADD chapters offer Victim AssistanceInstitutes to train volunteers to support victims of drunk driving andto serve as their advocates in the criminal justice system. In 1987,MADD established a national toll-free hotline to offer support to victims. After filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in1987 defending the federal \"21\" law, which was upheld by the court,205 On July 17, 1984, President Reagan signs legislation that will force states to choose between a 21-year-old drinking age or a loss of federal aid.

John Porter R-IL; NJ; Sen.Frank Lautenberg,D-NJ; and Rep. Norman Lent,R-NY .Third row, l. to r.: Rep. Gene Snyder, R-KY; and Sen. John Danforth (R-MO).MADD pushed states to come on board with that law. By 1988, all states had passed laws establishing 21as the legal minimum drinking age. In 1990, MADD filed another amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, this time defending the constitutionality of sobriety check-points.When the court ruled in favor of the checkpoints, MADDestablished the week of July Fourth as National Sobriety CheckpointWeek. Over the ensuing years, MADD worked with states to change sobriety laws to reflect a standard 0.08 blood alcohol content, downfrom 0.10 and a significant change. In 1994, NHTSA released figuresshowing that alcohol-related traffic deaths had dropped to a 30-yearlow during the previous year and credited MADD and tougher lawswith making the difference. Unfortunately, that decline has not continued. In 1999, the MADD National Board of Directors voted unanimously to change the organization's mission statement to include the prevention of underage drinking.That same year, with the addition of two chapters in North Dakota, MADD was repre-sented in all 50 states. In becoming one of the most successful advocacy organizations in the world, Mothers Against Drunk Driving showed how a group of brokenhearted mothers, assembled loosely at first but fueled by outrage, could empower national change.With more than three million members and supporters, MADD today is the largest crime-victims' assistance organization in the world.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Vignette 206 Wrecked car in which three teenagers died.All three had been drinking.Research shows that people who become addicted to any substance before the age of 21 have less of a chance ofbeing able to break their addictive behavior. For reasons thatare becoming clear through studies now under way, girls aremore susceptible to addiction than boys. Girls take upsmoking, drugs and alcohol for different reasons than boysand become more vulnerable to long-lasting addiction.Thechallenge for the public health community, therefore, is toemploy successful strategies aimed at youth, and especiallygirls, to prevent substance abuse in the first place. Effective health education in the home, schools and community, sup- ported by messages in the media, needs to reach children as early as possible in their preteens to prevent addictivebehavior. As Joseph Califano of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse points out,\"The issue of substanceabuse and addiction - whether the substance is tobacco,alcohol, illicit or prescription drugs - is all about kids. Achild who gets through age 21 without smoking, usingdrugs or abusing alcohol is virtually certain never to do so.\"Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Fighting Addiction in Young Women207 Girls take up smoking, drugsand alcohol fordifferent reasonsthan boys andbecome morevulnerable tolong-lastingaddiction.The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University in New Y ork City, known as CASA,was founded in 1992. CASA calls for a nationwide overhaul in prevention and treatment programs serving youth, espe-cially girls. Puberty is a time of higher risk for girls thanboys, with girls who experience early puberty at significant-ly higher risk for using substances sooner, more often and ingreater quantities than later-maturing peers. Girls are more likely than boys to be enticed into trying illicit substancesin private settings by female acquaintances, female relativesor a boyfriend and are less likely to be asked for proof ofage when buying cigarettes. Girls are also more likely thanboys to be depressed, to have eating disorders, and to have ahistory of sexual or physical abuse, all of which increase therisk for substance abuse. Girls are more likely than boys to use alcohol and drugs to improve their mood, enhance sexand reduce inhibitions. As girls mature and become women,they are far less likely to beat their addictions than are men.They get hooked faster and suffer the consequences soonerthan boys and young men. Why should this be? It starts in the advertising and promo- tion of tobacco, with cigarette manufacturers knowingly targeting young girls. One-size-fits-all prevention efforts are partly to blame as well. Unisex approaches to preventionas well as treatment ignore the unique characteristics ofsubstance abuse in young females and fail to influence mil-lions. Physiological differences between the sexes also play a role. On average, the impact of one drink of alcohol for a woman has the impact of two drinks for a man. School-related transitions, from elementary to middle to high school and then to college, are risky times for girls.Parents, teachers and school counselors can make a differ- ence in young girls' lives by encouraging them to talk abouttheir anxieties and by validating their feelings of vulnerabil-ity. Furthermore, frequent changes in homes and neighbor-hoods increase the risk of substance abuse more for girlsthan for boys.Transitions unique to females, such as a girl'sinitial use of birth control or pregnancy, present key oppor-tunities for intervention that are often missed. Becausefemale substance use sinks more quickly and dangerouslyinto abuse and addiction than does male substance use,timely and sensitive intervention is essential. Interventionshould target all girls and young women who are goingMilestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking Ahead 208 Advertising has promoted the \"glamour\" of smoking.

About 17 percent of high schoolgirls report being abused physically, and 12 percent report being abused sexually, and these girls are at special risk forabusing substances earlier, more often and in greater quanti-ties. Girls whose parents are known substance abusers arealso at special risk. In the United States today, more than 4.4 million women are alcoholics or abusers of alcohol, more than two million use illegal drugs, and more than 31 million smoke. In highschools, 27.7 percent of girls currently smoke, 45 percentdrink alcohol, 26.4 percent binge drink, and 20 percent usemarijuana. About 3.7 percent use cocaine and 4.2 percentuse inhalants.Y ounger girls have been smoking and drinkingas much as boys and are catching up in the use of illicitdrugs. Girls initiate substance use nearly as early asboys but suffer consequences beyond those of boys. About 34.5 percent of high school girls report regular feelings of sadness and hopelessness compared with 21.6 percent of boys. A strong link exists between feelings ofdepression and smoking, drinking or using drugs. Amonghigh school girls who smoke and drink, those who reportfeeling depressed clearly outnumber those who have neversmoked (47 percent vs. 25.3 percent) or drank alcohol (38.7percent vs. 20 percent).Those who use marijuana are alsolikelier to report feeling sad or hopeless than those whohave never used marijuana (42.9 percent vs. 29.7 percent).High school girls are more likely than boys to consider suicide (23.6 percent vs. 14.2 percent) and to attempt suicide(11.2 percent vs. 6.2 percent), and high school girls whosmoke and drink are more than twice as likely to consideror attempt suicide than girls who have never smoked (37.7percent vs. 14.4 percent) or drank (27.4 percent vs. 11.2percent).The equivalent figures for marijuana are 34.5 percent vs. 19.5 percent. How can the public health community deal with these alarming statistics? Education, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, the essential elements of any public health strategy, are increasingly being applied to substance abuse and addiction issues. Establishing awarenessin the community can lead to the first line of defense,209 Girls initiate sub-stance use nearlyas early as boysbut suffer conse- quences beyondthose of boys. Poster from the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.which are conversations that need to take place in the home. Most girls who have conversations with their parentsabout substance abuse say the conversations make them lesslikely to smoke, drink or use drugs. CASA research has consistently found that the more often children eat dinnerwith their parents, the less likely they are to smoke, drink or use drugs. As a result, CASA created an annual \"FamilyDay\" in 2001 to promote the idea that regular family timeis a means to reduce substance abuse among children andteens.\"Family Day\" has since become a nationwide effort,held on the fourth Monday of September every year. Health professionals must also be alert to signs of trouble. Pediatricians, family physicians, obstetricians/gynecol- ogists, and dentists can all detect signs of substance abuse or eating disorders during routine checkups.They shouldscreen young women for substance use and encourage treatment for those who seem to be in need. Clergy canalso play a significant role. Since girls tend to be more religious than boys and hold more favorable opinions of religion, spirituality and religion can play protective roles with young women.The more frequently girls attend religious services, the less likely they are to smoke, drink, binge drink or use drugs. As always in public health, messages about healthier out- comes must prompt individuals to change their behavior.Public health succeeds when individuals take responsibilityfor their own good health and encourage those aroundthem to do the same.The cure for addiction comes whenindividuals change their behavior. Public health can recog-nize the extent of the problem, educate those at risk aboutthe risks and provide assistance to those addicted, but it isthe individual who, in the end, must rise to the challengeand overcome the addiction.While the public health community, friends and family members provide crucialsupport for changing behavior, it is the individual addictwho must overcome the addiction.210 Pediatricians, family physicians, obstetricians/gynecologists, alldetect signs ofsubstance or eating disordersduring routinecheckups.Milestones .Chapter 10 .Addiction .Looking AheadPhoto credits Page 191: \u00a9 Carrie Nation, \u00a9 Bettmann/CORBIS.

OnJuly 16, 1798, President John Adams signed a bill into law that provided for the care and relief of sick and injuredmerchant seamen in American ports.The earliest marinehospitals were located along the East Coast, with Boston asthe site of the first such facility.They were established lateralong inland waterways, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf andPacific Coasts. In 1870, reorganization converted the loose network of locally controlled hospitals into a centrally controlled Marine Hospital Service with its headquarters in Washington, D.C.The position of supervising surgeon(later known as the Surgeon General) was created toadminister the service, and President Ulysses S. Grantappointed John Maynard Woodworth as the first supervising surgeon in 1871. The scope of the Marine Hospital Service's responsibilities expanded beyond the care of merchant seamen in the closingdecades of the 19th century, beginning with the control ofinfectious disease through better sanitation. As a result of itsbroadening responsibilities, the service's name was changedin 1902 to the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service.In 1912, the Marine Hospital Service became known offi-cially as the Public Health Service. As Elizabeth Fee and Theodore Brown describe in their article The Unfulfilled Promise of Public Health: D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu All Over Again, public health in the United States surged as a necessity-driven response to immediate local threats.Theauthors explain that these \"threats\" were closely tied in the popular imagination to epidemic disease, and as a con-sequence, public health was understood to be the set ofmeasures undertaken to protect the local population fromChapter 11 U.S.Public Health Infrastructure Looking BackMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Back 213 John Adams, the second president of the United States. First supervising surgeon John Maynard Woodworth.epidemic disease. Based on this definition of public health, it could be expected that the first local and state healthdepartments would arise during a yellow fever outbreakthat terrified the new nation between 1793 and 1806. In fact, the first Board of Health was established in Phila- delphia in 1794, followed by Baltimore in 1797, Boston in1799,Washington, D.C., in 1802, New Orleans in 1804,and New Y ork City in 1805. Once the yellow fever outbreak came under control, public and budgetary support for these newly formed localboards of health also diminished. Interest in public healthremained quiescent until 1830, when New Y ork City citizens formed a civilian group known as the \"sanitaryreformers\" in response to a cholera outbreak.The reform- ers pressured public officials to take their public healthresponsibilities seriously and improve the city's living conditions. Fee and Brown further explain that from 1857 to 1860 the sanitary reformers held \"Sanitary Conventions.\" During theCivil War, the group persuaded President Abraham Lincolnto create a Sanitary Commission to investigate conditionsamong the Union Forces and take measures to improvesanitation and health interventions. One of the measurestaken by civilian and military authorities in response to theSanitary Commission's pressure was improved sanitationMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Back Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking back214 Yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, 1793. Carriages rumbled through the streets to pick up the dying and the dead. Once the yellow fever outbreakcame under con-trol, public andbudgetary support for these newlyformed localboards of healthalso diminished.among the troops. Another critical measure - educating officers and enlisted men - taught the closely confinedtroops about the spread of infectious diseases and the needfor personal and public hygiene. After the war ended,Sanitary Commission measures continued in New Y ork,Chicago and Massachusetts, creating a record of success for the first effective boards of health. By the 1870s,most major cities had instituted some form of public health organization. Advancing in history to the New Deal years in the 1930s and, again, visiting the Public Health Service, as it becameknown in 1912, Congress heeded President FranklinRoosevelt and, in response to the Great Depression, createdthe welfare state.The Public Health Service benefited fromsupport in Congress and expanded greatly during the NewDeal years.With the Social Security Act of 1935, Congressestablished social insurance and cash assistance programsthat improved the public's health by ensuring income security for groups at greater risk of poverty and disease. Much later, in 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare andMedicaid programs, expanding social insurance. Medicareand Medicaid broadened significantly the role that the federal government plays in addressing health care issues for the needy.By the 1870s,most major citieshad institutedsome form ofpublic healthorganization.215 President Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act.The consolidation of the modern federal public health establishment came in the mid-20th century. In 1930, theRansdell Act established the National Institutes of Health,which have evolved into the current well-funded enginefor biomedical research and training throughout the UnitedStates. In 1946, the Centers for Disease Control (known asthe CDC) was formed from the Office of Malaria Controlin War Areas and became part of the Public Health Service,significantly expanding the federal government's publichealth responsibilities. In 1953, the federal public health and social welfare func- tions were consolidated into one cabinet-level department,the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.Thisnew department housed virtually all of the federal agencieswith public health responsibilities that had evolved sincethe Civil War, including the Medicare and Medicaid pro-grams. In 1979, when a new Department of Education was formed, the newly named Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) became the home of federalhealth and social services programs. Today the nation's public health system is a complex net- work of people, systems and organizations working at the local, state and national levels. The U.S. public healthsystem is distinct from other parts of the health care systemin two key respects: its primary emphasis is preventing dis-ease and disability, and it focuses on population rather thanindividual health. Both the public and private sectors play important roles in public health.The nation is served by more than 3,000county and city health departments, 3,000 local boards ofhealth, 59 state and territorial health departments, andmore than 160,000 public and private laboratories. A seriesof federal health and environmental agencies set nationalstandards and provide funding, training, scientific guidanceand technical support. Hospitals, clinics, managed care organizations, civic and volunteer groups, and national associations support the work of local, state and federal public health agencies.The associations include the National Association of Countyand City Health Officials (NACCHO), the Association of State and T erritorial Health Officials (ASTHO), theAssociation of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), theMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Back 216 The U.S. public health system isdistinct fromother parts of thehealth care systemin focuses on pop-ulation ratherthan individualhealth.National Association of Local Boards of Health (NALBOH), the Council of State and T erritorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)and the American Public Health Association (APHA). Although these components are numerous, the public health infrastructure is but one piece of a larger publichealth system.The system depends on three interrelatedcomponents: the capacity and competency of the work-force, information and data systems, and organizationalcapacity. Deficiencies in one area can have a ripple effectthroughout the entire public health system. Workforce Capacity and Competency Workforce capacity and competency refers to the expertise of professionals who work in federal, state and local publichealth agencies to protect the public's health. Thegovernmental portion of the public health workforceincludes 448,754 professionals deployed at the local, stateand national levels. At the local level, public health workersare found in local health agencies and in private and non-profit organizations concerned with the public's health. The most common professional disciplines within the U.S.public health workforce are nurses, physicians, environmental specialists, laboratorians, health educators,disease investigators, outreach workers and managers.Public health also includes dentists, social workers, nutri-tionists, anthropologists, psychologists, economists, politicalscientists, engineers, information technology specialists,public health informaticians, epidemiologists, biostatisticiansand lawyers. Any professional whose primary function is toimprove health can be considered part of the public healthworkforce. However, it is workers in official public health agencies who are on the front lines in tracking diseasetrends, implementing communitywide health promotionand disease-prevention programs, and responding to emerging threats and outbreaks. The federal government has traditionally supported a vari- ety of programs to enhance public health workforce capac-ity. For example, grant programs at the Health Resourcesand Services Administration (HRSA) are devoted to publichealth professional development and training. Over the last decade, CDC has also provided valuable trainingopportunities for state and local public health leaders and217 The governmentalportion of thepublic healthworkforce includes 448,754professionalsdeployed at thelocal, state andnational levels.professionals. In addition, state and local health departments are actively developing ways to strengthen their publichealth workforce. For example, New Jersey established credentials and competency-based training requirements for public health workers. In Pennsylvania, the AlleghenyCounty Health Department joined the University ofPittsburgh Center for Public Health Practice to create apartnership for faculty and workforce development. Privatefoundations also help build workforce capacity by provid-ing grants to schools of public health, funding educationand training opportunities at the state and local level, sup-porting research and sponsoring national conferences. Despite efforts to grow the workforce capacity of the nation, there is a gap between the increasing demandsplaced on the dedicated public health workforce and thegrowing complexity of disease patterns, interventions, part- nerships, technology, tools and training necessary to meetthe demands.There are 448,254 public health workers in the United States, according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics from 2004, compared with 490,000 lawyers,532,740 bank tellers, and 2,026,000 fast food workers. Insetting a public health goal to improve the public healthworkforce by the year 2010, the federal government calls for each community to be served by a \"fully trained,culturally competent public health team, representing theoptimal mix of professional disciplines.\" Surveillance and Information Systems The delivery of effective public health services depends on timely and reliable information and data. Perhaps perceivedas not as exciting as other public health disciplines, surveil-lance and information systems are nonetheless the heart ofpublic health planning and interventions.These tools helpto monitor disease and enable efficient communicationamong public and private health organizations, the mediaand the public.They also make it possible for health profes-sionals to diagnose the health of populations, distributeresources to the right locations, and alert the public about public health issues and threats. The ongoing systematic collection, analysis and inter- pretation of health-related data is called \"surveillance.\"Surveillance systems provide data on illness, disability anddeath from acute and chronic conditions; on injuries; onMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Back 218 ...by the year 2010, the federalgovernment callsfor each commu-nity to be take thelead in publichealth theyrepresent only necessarypartners col-lect, analyze andtranslate thesedata.personal environment and occupational risk factors; on preventive and treatment services; and on program costs.Data from these systems can assist prevention efforts byfunctioning as early-warning signals for new and emergingconditions. Data systems also facilitate planning, as publichealth agencies use data on disease prevalence to developprevention programs. Although federal agencies take the lead in collecting national public health data, they represent only a fraction ofthe many necessary partners that collect, analyze and trans-late these data. Programs in each area collect informationfrom local communities. Other data-collection systemsdepend upon the participation of private citizens nation-wide. Still other systems rely on the administrative recordsand surveys of public and private health care organizations. Despite advances in technology, many local health depart- ments still lack access to basic information-system capabili-ties. Access is critical because state and local public healthdepartment staffs need the Internet and other electronicinformation systems to perform their job functions effec-tively. Similarly, it is essential that staff be trained to usethese systems. In 1999, to address this issue, the CDC part-nered with local and state health agencies, as well as nation-al public health organizations, to develop the Health AlertNetwork (HAN), a nationwide, integrated information andcommunication system capable of distributing health alerts,prevention guidelines and other information. In 2000, theCDC launched another program, the National ElectronicDisease Surveillance System, to provide national standards,specifications, and working prototypes so that informationcollected by local health departments can be used to detectand manage outbreaks that affect more than one area. Organizational Capacity Organizational capacity is the structure and mechanisms on which a functioning public health system relies - its facili-ties, laboratories and financing mechanisms. In order toperform activities and provide services that safeguard thehealth of a community, public health departments and lab-oratories must have modern facilities, adequate financing,successful partnerships with institutions in both the publicand private sector, properly trained personnel and up-to-date information systems.In 1998 and 2000, studies performed by the University of North Carolina and the CDC's National Public Health Performance Standards Program measured healthdepartment performance. Both studies revealed thatthe state public health systems have half or less of the organizational capacity they need to optimally performessential public health services.The average performancescore for local public health departments was slightly high-er than for state public health systems. In part, the cumula-tive result of budget cuts, lack of staff training and outmod-ed information systems and laboratories, these scores alsoreflect the growing demands on the public health system. The public health infrastructure has had trouble keepingpace with the demands for performance. On two occasions, in 1988 and 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) addressed public health infrastructure intwo IOM reports. In the 1988 report, titled The Future of Public Health ,IOM presented proposals for ensuring that public health service programs would be effective and efficient enough to deal not only with current challengesbut future crises as well.The report identified the core functions of public health: assessment, policy developmentand assurance of essential health services. It also recom-mended the manner in which the performance of thesecore functions be divided among federal, state and locallevels.The subsequent 2002 IOM report, titled TheFuture of the Public's Health in the 21st Century ,reviewedthe nation's public health capabilities and recommended a comprehen-sive framework for involving public health agencies withmultiple partners in both the public and private sectors to create a more integrated public health system. Among the2002 IOM report's recommendations for this integratedpublic health system were the following: /rhombus6Adopt a population health approach that considers multiple determinants of health. /rhombus6Strengthen government's public health functions, the backbone of the public health system. /rhombus6Develop new partners across sectors, requiring accountability in the process. /rhombus6Make decisions based on evidence.Milestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Back 220 ...state public health systemshave half or lessof the organiza-tional capacitythey need to opti-mally publichealth services./rhombus6Enhance communication within expanded public health system.221 Essential Public Health Functions* *From the Public Health Functions Project (1994-1999), directed by a Steering Committee chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon General withthe participation of CDC and a host of public health associations, foundations andorganizations.1.

As a part of the U.S. PublicHealth Service, the original CDC mission was to workwith state and local health officials in the fight againstmalaria, then still prevalent in several Southern states,as well as typhus and other communicable diseases. Itsfounder, Joseph W . Mountin, MD, a visionary public health leader, had high hopes for this small and compara- tively insignificant branch of the Public Health Service.Dr. Mountin received his medical degree from MarquetteUniversity in Milwaukee,Wisconsin, in 1914. He began hiscareer with the Public Health Service during World War Iworking in sanitation in the temporary living quarters specially built by the U.S. Army for soldiers in militaryareas throughout the United States. In his distinguishedcareer with the Public Health Service, Mountin becamewidely known as the father of many service programs.In late November 1951, he was appointed to the post ofbureau chief with the rank of Assistant Surgeon General. Mountin died unexpectedly the following year at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda.222 Dr. Joseph Mountin, third from left, meeting with CDC staffers.During the first years of CDC, medical epidemiologists were scarce. It was not until 1949 that Dr. Alexander Langmuir, now known as the father of infectious diseaseepidemiology, arrived to head the epidemiology branch. Helaunched the first-ever disease surveillance program andconfirmed his suspicions that malaria control, the largestpart of the CDC budget, had long since become unneces-sary. Subsequently, disease surveillance became the corner-stone of CDC's mission of service and, in time, changed the practice of public health. Langmuir was CDC's chiefepidemiologist from 1949 to 1970. He spent the rest of his life teaching at Harvard Medical School and at JohnsHopkins, where he had earned his degree in public health.In 1993, he died of kidney cancer at the age of 83. World events also had an impact on CDC's mission. In 1950, the start of the Korean War gave impetus to creatingthe Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS).With the threat ofbiological warfare looming, Langmuir wanted to train epi-demiologists to detect new emerging agents and at thesame time guard against common threats to public health.In 1955, CDC broadened its focus to include poliomyelitis(polio) and established the Polio Surveillance Unit. Two major health crises in the mid-1950s cemented CDC's credibility and long-term survival. In 1955, afterpolio appeared in children who had received the Salk vaccine, only recently approved, CDC stopped the national inoculation program.The cases were traced tocontaminated vaccine from a laboratory in California;223 Dr.Alexander Langmuir An EIS officer using the muscle evaluation test for polio.Milestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Case Study once the problem was corrected, the inoculation program resumed, at least for first- and second-graders.T wo years later, surveillance traced the course of a massive influenzaepidemic. From data gathered in 1957 and subsequent years,national guidelines for influenza vaccine were developed. In the 1950s and 1960s, CDC grew by acquisition.The venereal disease program came to Atlanta in 1957 and with it, the first Public Health Advisors.The tuberculosisand immunization programs were moved under CDC's\"umbrella\" in 1960; and in 1961, CDC took over publica-tion of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). The MMWR, which lists important data on deaths andcertain diseases from every state every week, is still pub-lished every week and is considered an essential publichealth tool.The Foreign Quarantine Service, one of theoldest and most prestigious units of PHS, became part ofCDC in 1967, followed by the long-established nutritionprogram and the National Institute for Occupational Safetyand Health. One of CDC's greatest accomplishments, the worldwide eradication of smallpox, was launched in 1966.TheSmallpox Eradication Program aimed to eradicate smallpoxand control measles in 20 African countries and support the worldwide efforts of the World Health Organization'ssmallpox crusade.The disease had killed millions of peopleover the centuries. By the late 1970s, just over a decade later, CDC efforts helped eradicate smallpox from theworld. CDC also achieved notable success at home track- ing new emerging infections such as Legionnaire's disease,toxic-shock syndrome and hantavirus. More importantly,the MMWR published the first report of a new and fataldisease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), in the June 5, 1981, issue. During the 1990s and early 2000s,CDC broadened its focus to address chronic disease prevention and obesity. As CDC's activities expanded in scope far beyond communicable diseases to include chronic disease controland health promotion, its name had to be changed to reflect a broader mission. In 1970, the name became the Center for Disease Control. In 1981, after extensive reor-ganization,\"Center\" became \"Centers.\" In 1992, the words\"and Prevention\" were added, but by law, CDC retained its well-known three-letter abbreviation.224 Dr. Stan Foster, EIS officer, administeringsmallpox vaccine toa Nigerian woman in 1967.Milestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic More than 40 years ago on January 11, 1964, Luther L.T erry, MD, Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, released thereport of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.This landmark document, now referred to as the firstSurgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health ,had a tremendous impact on public attitudes and policy for three important reasons.First, an official U.S. agency recognized for the first time that cigarettesmoking caused cancer and other serious diseases. Second, it prompt-ed a series of public health actions reflecting changes in societal attitudes toward the health hazards of tobacco use.Third, the SurgeonGeneral's report was the first to receive widespread media and publicattention. Although evidence that smoking caused harm had accumu-lated since the 1930s, official sources did not recognize the ill effectsat the time. Epidemiologists used statistics and large-scale, long-termcase control surveys to link the increase in lung cancer mortality tosmoking. Pathologists and laboratory scientists confirmed the statisti-cal relationship of smoking to lung cancer as well as to other seriousdiseases, such as bronchitis, emphysema and coronary heart disease. In1957, then-Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney declared as the officialposition of the U.S. Public Health Service that smoking caused lung cancer. The impulse for an official report on smoking and health did not come until 1961, however, pushed by an alliance of prominent privatehealth organizations.The American Cancer Society, the AmericanHeart Association, the National Tuberculosis Association, and theAmerican Public Health Association called for a national commissionon smoking in a letter addressed to President John F . Kennedy.Theletter sought a commission dedicated to \"seeking a solution to thishealth problem that would interfere least with the freedom of indus-try or the happiness of individuals.\" The Kennedy administration responded the following year. In 1962, recently appointed Surgeon General Luther L.T erry announced that he would convene a committee of experts to conduct a comprehen-sive review of the scientific literature on the smoking question.T erryinvited representatives of the four voluntary medical organizationswho had first proposed the commission, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the AmericanMedical Association, and the T obacco Institute (the lobbying arm of the tobacco industry) to nominate ten commission members.Milestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Vignette 225 Vignette Surgeon General's Report of 1964From November 1962 through January 1964, the committee reviewed more than 7,000 scientific articles with the help of more than 150 consultants.The advisory committee concluded that ciga-rette smoking caused both lung cancer and chronic bronchitis.The committee recognized for the first time, officially, that \"cigarettesmoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the UnitedStates to warrant appropriate remedial action.\" The 1964 Surgeon General's report became the first of a series of steps to reduce the impact of tobacco use on the health of theAmerican people.The circumstances surrounding the release of the first report in 1964 were peculiar. Surgeon General T erry issuedthe commission's report on a Saturday, a strategy meant to minimizethe effect on the stock market and maximize coverage in the Sundaypapers.\"This strategy succeeded,\"T erry remembered two decadeslater,\"because the report hit the country like a bombshell. It wasfront-page news and a lead story on every radio and television station in the United States and many abroad.\" Among the steps that followed the report were banning tobacco advertising on broadcast media, placing mandatory health warningson cigarette packages and developing effective treatments for tobaccodependence.The Office of the Surgeon General has issued 27 subse-quent reports on tobacco use, covering such topics as environmental(i.e., secondhand) tobacco smoke.These reports helped lead the wayto smoke-free public places, restaurants and bars. The widespread media and public attention led to significant changes in public attitudes toward smoking. A Gallup survey conducted in1958 found that only 44 percent of Americans believed smokingcaused cancer; that figure grew to 78 percent by 1968. Between 1965and 2002, adult smoking rates have been cut from 42.4 percent to22.5 percent, nearly in half, and per-capita consumption of tobaccoproducts has fallen from 4,345 cigarettes in 1963 to 1,979 cigarettesin 2002, more than half. The 1964 Surgeon General's report was significant because it marked the first of a series of authoritative scientific statements by theSurgeon General that helped shape the debate on the responsibility ofgovernment, physicians and individual citizens for the nation's health.Indeed, Surgeon General's reports since 1964 have addressed a broadrange of health issues.These include secondhand smoke, maternal andchild health, nutrition and physical exercise, mental health, and issuesthat lie outside medicine, such as suicide and gun violence, that arestudied for how they affect public health.Milestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Vignette 226Public health needs to gaincapacity as it prepares torespond to acute and chronicthreats to thenation's health.... Dr.William Keck of Northeastern OhioUniversities College of Medicine.The 21st century presents a new set of challenges to thenation's health.Whether confronting bioterrorism attacks,emerging infections, lifestyle behaviors, disparities in healthstatus, or increases in chronic disease and injury rates, thepublic health community now more than ever needs a strengthened infrastructure. Public health needs to gain capacity as it prepares to respond to acute and chronic threats to the nation's health, not all now known. Only apublic health system supported by political will, public andprivate partnerships, and other financial resources can meetongoing and new health challenges. As Dr.William Keck of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Northeastern Ohio UniversitiesCollege of Medicine points out,\"A continually expandingpublic health agenda in an era of shrinking governmentalresources diminishes the ability of many local health depart- ments to meet basic community health needs, let alone lifttheir communities to the highest levels of health possible.The successful public health department of the future willdevelop multiple funding sources, advocate effectively forresources to meet community needs, and build strong collab- orative linkages with other community health agencies andthe illness care system. It will otherwise be impossible toensure that each citizen has access to a seamless web of serv-ices that promote health, prevent illness and injury, diagnosedisease early and provide disease treatment that is efficientand effective.\" Bioterrorism Bioterrorism is defined as the unlawful release of biologic agents or toxins to kill or sicken people, animals or plantswith the intent to intimidate or coerce a government orcivilian population.A bioterrorism attack would represent amajor public health threat in the United States. CDC, thegovernment agency in charge of responding to public healthemergencies for decades, must now prepare for bioterrorismattacks.Milestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Ahead Looking Ahead Public Health - A 21 stCentury Perspective227CDC and public health authorities became aware of the threat of domestic bioterrorism after several small acts offocused bacteriologic criminal assault in the United States.These acts included the intentional contamination of saladbars with Salmonella organisms in 1984 in Oregon and of muffins and pastries with Shigella organisms in T exas in 1996. As a result, the United States government decided to revisitand update a national plan for bioterrorism preparedness andresponse. In 1999, as part of this strategy, CDC collaborated with the Association of Public Health Laboratories and theFederal Bureau of Investigation to establish the Laboratory Response Network.This network develops local, state andfederal public health laboratory capacity to respond tobioterrorism events. Only in the fall of 2001 were CDC's bioterrorism plans put into action, in response to an anthrax attack in the U.S.At a time of heightened tension due to the events of Sep-tember 11, letters containing anthrax powder spread thisinfectious disease deliberately through the postal system;22 people were infected and five people died. Lifestyle and Behavior Change While this century's medical advances and public health efforts have dramatically reduced the threat of infectious disease in the U.S., poor health due to lifestyle behaviorsremains a threat to public health. Poor lifestyle behaviors are linked to chronic diseases, the heaviest burden on theMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Ahead 228 Anthrax was spread through the postal system in the fall of 2001.health care system today.These behaviors involve tobacco use, alcohol and drug abuse, lack of healthy diet and exercise,and risky sexual practices. In particular, poor nutrition and asedentary lifestyle are considered by some experts to be \"the21st century plague\" as they lead to obesity and diabetes,now considered national epidemics.They also contribute toa host of other serious medical problems, such as heart dis-ease and cancer - the two leading causes of death in the U.S. Public health professionals know that promoting healthy behaviors is one of the best ways to prevent disease and disability. Consequently, many public health activities aredesigned to help individuals and communities achieve andmaintain a healthy lifestyle at any age. For example, CDClaunched a campaign called VERB (to connote action) in2002 to fight childhood obesity, encouraging young peopleages nine to 13 to be physically active every day.The cam-paign combines paid advertising, marketing strategies andpartnership efforts to reach the distinct audiences of tweensand adults/influencers.As CDC Director Dr. Julie L.Gerberding said,\"The VERB campaign has surpassed expectations and is responsible for improving physical activity levels among youth.\" In February 2004, CDCreleased the results of a telephone survey that indicate that physical activity among the nation's youth is increasing as a result of the VERB campaign. Chronic-Disease Prevention and Control Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer, cause 70 percent of all deaths in the United Stateseach year.A large number of these deaths are preventable.People with chronic conditions are the largest, most costly and fastest-growing group in health care, and their numbersare expected to swell in the 21st century. From specific laboratory measures to more complex studies of behaviors and risk factors, CDC's efforts are designed tounderstand the causes and consequences of chronic diseasesand to place the powerful tools of prevention within reachof more people every day. Moreover, CDC works to ensurethat advances in basic scientific and behavioral research areput into practice to benefit all Americans.As part of its mis-sion, CDC works with states to develop comprehensive, sus-tainable prevention programs that target the leading causes of229 CDC Director Julie L. GerberdingMilestones .Chapter 9 .Oral Health .Looking ahead: Still a neglected epidemic death and disability in our society and their risk factors. In addition, numerous efforts to manage chronic disease, alongwith social marketing campaigns, changes in food (such asremoval of trans fats) and a new food pyramid have gained an increasing role in chronic-disease prevention. Newapproaches to prevention are crucial to fight chronic diseasesin this century. Infectious Diseases and Emerging Threats Despite incredible gains in combating infectious diseases, they remain a public health concern in the 21st century.Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death in the United States and still predominate worldwide, withacute lower respiratory tract infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhealdiseases, tuberculosis and malaria as the major threats. Although the combination of improved hygiene and sanita- tion, vaccinations and antibiotics has helped turn the tideagainst infectious diseases in this country, new diseases andthe resurgence of old ones make infectious diseases a con-stant concern. Emerging infections are those that have not been previously recognized. The AIDS pandemic is an example of a truly new and emerging infectious disease whose public health impact had not been previously experi- enced. On the other hand, infections that have beenexperienced previously reappear in a more virulent form or in a new epidemiological setting.The influenza type A pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968 are examples of this. Global air travel, now widely available and affordable, introduces infected travelers to the U.S. with diseases thatonce might have stayed overseas. For example, severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, due to global air travel, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries inNorth America, South America, Europe and Asia.Accordingto the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8,098people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003outbreak. Of these, 774 died. In the United States, only eightpeople had laboratory evidence of SARS infection and all ofthem had been traveling in other countries where SARS hadbeen identified. Fortunately, CDC worked closely with theWHO and other partners in a global effort to address theMilestones .Chapter 11 .U.S.Public Health Infrastructure .Looking Ahead 230 The AIDS pan- demic is an exam-ple of impact hadnot been previ-ously experienced.SARS outbreak of 2003, preventing SARS from spreading more widely in the United States. CDC continues its work of increasing the capacity of laboratories and surveillance systems here and abroad to detect and monitor changes in disease patterns and to serveas an early-warning system. For example, surveillance centersin both the U.S. and Asia monitor the ever-present threat of influenza pandemics. CDC also continues to work withpublic and private partners to change the way antibiotics areprescribed and used in hospitals and other settings. CDChelps form working teams that link epidemiology, partner-ships, education of health care p roviders and patients, and vector control to counter the spr ead of specific infectious disease threats.These threats range from sexually transmitteddiseases, like syphilis and chlamydia, to bloodborne threats,like hepatitis C.The teams help control existing infectiousdisease threats and prepare the nation for new ones. Meeting the challenges of infectious diseases in the 21st century means that the scientific and technological advancesthat form the foundation of a public health response mustevolve quickly and continually.As former CDC director Dr. Jeffrey Koplan observed in the 2002 IOM Report,\"We are only as prepared as the least prepared among us.\"231 Paramedics during the SARS outbreak in Toronto.

In celebrating ten milestones of publichealth in the United States during the 20th century, thisbook outlines potential challenges that, if addressed basedon lessons learned from the past, will create the next gen-eration of milestones in public health. Although we cannotbe certain what the 21st century milestones will be, we canbe certain that the public health community will face chal-lenges in achieving them and, in the process, will improvethe health and well-being of the nation. As always withpublic health, success redefines the challenge. Certain common denominators - technological advances, sound public policies and legislation, adoption of individualhealthier behaviors and corporate responsibility - havehelped the public health community meet the challenges of the 20th century and produce solutions. Public health'sbiggest challenge has been gaining traction in these areassimultaneously. As the problems faced by the public healthcommunity grow more complex, so do the solutions. Fortunately, public health is a diverse field that engages a wide spectrum of expertise.The population's healthdepends on the collective work of attorneys, environmen-talists, journalists, legislators, social workers and teachers, aswell as administrators, laboratory scientists and researchers. The population's health advances when workers from manydifferent fields collaborate to implement educational pro-grams, develop public policies and legislation, administer services and conduct research. If the next set of milestonesis to be achieved, this diverse workforce will need to workin a synchronized manner that captures the public's atten-tion and changes behavior. Public health seeks to protect the health of entire popula- tions, and future public health milestones will be so far-reaching that they will affect every aspect of society.T o accomplish its goals, the public health community willneed to protect individual rights and privacy, prompt thepublic to respond to messages that point the way to health-ier lifestyles and to persuade corporations to tap their233234 Milestones .Epilogue resources to assist in reaching the goals. Lessons learned in the 20th century must be assessed with open minds as society searches for new ways to improve the public'shealth. Society must learn from the milestones outlined in this book and build on their success. Could a newly enacted federal law dramatically reduce death rates on our highways due to drunk driving byrepeat offenders? Preliminary figures for 2004 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show aslight decline in highway deaths but also show that threecategories of drivers - repeat offenders, those with veryhigh blood alcohol levels, and those who continue to drivewith suspended licenses despite convictions for drunk driving - account for nearly 40 percent of fatal crashes,unchanged for many years. For the milestone of reducingdeath rates due to repeat offenders to be possible, driversthemselves would have to abstain from excessive drinking.Improvements in automobile and highway design, such asan ignition interlock that would prevent a car from startingif a sensor detects that the driver's blood alcohol level istoo high, would also play a role. Finally, Congress wouldplay its role by nationalizing standards for stricter enforce-ment of drunk driving. Could public health messages about eating healthy diets and exercising regularly reduce dramatically the rate ofobesity in our youth? Public health experts continue to bealarmed by obesity statistics that lead to unacceptably highrates of diabetes and incipient cardiovascular disease.Thepublic health response has been to promote a combinationof healthy diets, regular physical activity and early screeningfor warning signs of metabolic syndrome.T o conquer thischallenge and build a healthier society, individuals, foodcorporations, government and communities will have torally together. Could the silent epidemic of tooth decay be conquered? Proven public health interventions - water fluoridation andsealant programs - would need to be far more universalthan they are today; access to dentists, far more prevalent.These measures are part of the solution. For the milestoneto be achieved, responsible individuals would need to eathealthy diets and practice good personal hygiene. Publichealth messages highlighting healthy outcomes, employedby public health experts to change behavior, can succeed only when individuals and society as a whole respond.New laws, improvements in technology and refinements of public health techniques are never enough. Sentinel public health milestones occur when society's attitude and behavior change so significantly that the preventive or screening measure is adopted routinely. Forexample, seat belts are a proven means to reduce mortalityin car crashes, and laws requiring them are effective onlywhen individuals voluntarily comply. Most people nowdon't think twice about buckling up - especially their children, in safety-tested car seats - and this compliance has saved countless lives. Public health messages offeredproof of improved mortality, so manufacturers installed seatbelts. Legal requirements, coupled with public campaignsdesigned to educate about seat belts, changed society's attitude, and this led to changes in behavior. Who would have thought that regulations promoting smoke-free indoor environments could effectively elimi-nate environmental smoke as a threat to the public's health?People no longer light up on airplanes and in schools and, in many states, in workplaces and other public spaces.Labels on cigarette packages warn pregnant women thatsmoking is dangerous to the health of their unborn chil-dren. Laws enacted to restrict smoking in public spaces andthe warnings about its health hazards have been factors inchanging attitudes and behavior toward smoking. Similarchanges in behavior have occurred with drinking and driving, drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and the use of bicycle helmets. Advances in public health in the 21st century could sur- prise us. In 50 years, a new edition of Milestones in Public Health might highlight 10 advances that can hardly be con- templated today. Even then, the public health communitywill have moved on to new challenges, and the story willrepeat itself.This is the appeal of public health, a dynamic field that builds on past successes but strives always to findnew ways to improve the nation's health.The public healthcommunity, in marshalling all available resources, will engageworkers across a wide variety of fields to persuade a reluc- tant public to change behavior, reluctant legislatures to pass laws that protect and promote health, and reluctant235scientists to develop and test technologies that can prevent illnesses or detect and cure them. New generations willdemonstrate the value of public health, a field that refusesto accept things as they are. Scientists will be rewarded,public officials won over, legislatures persuaded, and newlaws and regulations passed that protect and promote betterhealth outcomes. The milestones of this new century depend on the best of our nation's youth enlisting in the field to seek newways to improve the public's health.The work of a new generation, inspired by the successes of earlier generations,is sure to bring about the next milestones in public health.
