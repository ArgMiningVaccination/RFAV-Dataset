But it's possible to build a healthier pie that still feels like a treat. We show you the way, here. Nothing screams, \"It's the weekend!\" more than a Friday night pizza. Or maybe you prefer pizza on Monday, to kick off the week with something delicious. No matter what evening (or evenings, we won't tell) you prefer to have a slice, there's good news for pizza lovers: Pizza can be a healthy, well-rounded meal. \"Pizza, when you think about it, is composed of carbohydrates from the crust, protein from the cheese, and fat from the cheese and toppings, and these are all the components of what a meal would typically contain,\" says [Amy Kimberlain, RD](https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/), a Miami-based dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist. \"Not to mention that it provides energy and flavor, and overall can really hit the spot.\" Though some people believe pizza is an indulgence, that isn't always the case. \"It was often thought that pizza may not be the healthiest choice as it is generally considered high in sodium, calories, and [saturated fat](/saturated-fat/guide/) \u2014 however, not all slices are created equal,\" says Kimberlain. The key is to think about the toppings, crust, and even the sides you have with it, Kimberlain notes. \"Just like any other food, it's about how you make it,\" says [Angela Lemond, RDN](https://lemondnutrition.com/about-lemond-nutrition/team/angela-lemond), co-owner of Lemond Nutrition in Plano, Texas. If, for example, you order a 12-inch pan-crust pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut, you're looking at 286 calories, almost 14 grams (g) of [fat](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/skinny-on-fat.aspx) (including 5 g saturated fat), and over 29 g carbohydrates per slice, [according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173280/nutrients)). Double those numbers if you have a second slice (which, let's be honest, many of us would) and you may be on your way to overdoing it on saturated fat for the day. To maintain a healthy weight and heart, if you're consuming 2,000 calories per day, limit your saturated fat to 13 g per day or less, according to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day) (AHA). That means one slice almost gets you to a third of your daily limit. That's why you may want to whip up your pizza at home. \"There are a lot of different ways that pizza can be healthy. First, by making it at home you have the control over how, ultimately, it's being made \u2014 and that's the first step,\" says Kimberlain. Read on to find other ways you can make pizza night healthier, so you can sit back and enjoy your pie without an ounce of guilt or worry. 1. Load Your Pizza With Veggies for Extra Nutrients Think of pizza as a scrumptious way to score heaps of veggies in one pan. \"Add on as many vegetables as you can. They're rich in vitamins and minerals, along with [fiber](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/fiber-benefits-food-sources-supplements-side-effects/) to boot!\" says Kimberlain. Not sure what veggies work well together on a pie? Try Kimberlain's favorite combination: \"For the traditional red sauce pizza, I like throwing on all the veggies \u2014 tomatoes, peppers, onions, mushrooms, artichokes, olives, basil. I love the combination of them all,\" she says. This way, you get a meal bursting with nutrients your body needs to thrive. Mushrooms, for one, are a great way to get vitamin B3 ( [niacin](/drugs/niacin)), [according to Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-foods-for-vitamins-and-minerals) and the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168434/nutrients). One cup of sliced, raw, brown mushrooms delivers 3 milligrams (mg), which is 21 percent of your daily value (DV), the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-niacin/art-20364984) notes. And this multitasking vitamin helps keep your digestive system, skin, and nervous system healthy. Meanwhile, bell peppers give you [vitamin C](/diet-nutrition/vitamin-c/), [as the USDA notes](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2258590/nutrients) \u2014 you're getting 142 mg per 100 g of peppers, which is over 150 percent of the DV. So when in doubt, add more veggies for a filling, vitamin-packed pie. RELATED: [Which Foods Are High in Vitamin C?](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/top-foods-high-in-vitamin-c.aspx) 2. Opt for a Thin-Crust Pizza to Cut Down on Calories Whether you're ordering in or making the pizza yourself, go for a thin crust when you can. Why? \"Thin crust means you can get more of the veggies in before getting full,\" says Lemond. By going the thin-crust route, your main focus of the meal is the veggies, rather than the bread. Why that matters: Eating a more [plant-based diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/plant-based-diet-food-list-meal-plan-benefits-more/) is an all-around healthy way to eat. For example, [one study found](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.012865) that people eating mostly plant-based diets, with a focus on vegetables, [nuts](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/0406/why-you-should-go-nuts-for-nuts.aspx), whole grains, fruits, and legumes, had lower odds of dying from a heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular-related diseases, compared with people who ate more animal-based foods. A thin crust has other perks, too. \"Choose thin crust versus thick crust or even stuffed crust to help reduce the total calories and sodium,\" says Kimberlain. One slice of a small thin-crust pizza with cheese has 230 calories and 564 mg sodium, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173294/nutrients). Meanwhile, a small slice of thick-crust pizza with cheese has 312 calories and 687 mg sodium, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173293/nutrients). So to fill up on more veggies \u2014 the MVPs of your pizza \u2014 and lower your calories and sodium, thin crust is your best bet. 3. Be Mindful of the Cheese You Choose to Limit Saturated Fat Most pizza lovers will tell you that [cheese](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/cheese-health-benefits-risks-types-top-sellers-more/) is essential for a good pie. But still, it's important to be smart about what cheese you add. \"Cheese will provide protein and [calcium](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/calcium/); simply be mindful of how much you're adding, as it does have saturated fat, too,\" says Kimberlain. \"Opt for a 2-percent or part-skim mozzarella or skim ricotta.\" Here's the nutrition info for those cheeses, which tend to be lower in fat than their whole-milk counterparts: Part Skim Mozzarella According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170847/nutrients), 1 ounce (oz) contains: - 72 calories - 4.51 g total fat - 2.87 g saturated fat - 222 mg calcium, which is 17 percent of the DV The same portion of [whole-milk mozzarella](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170845/nutrients) contains 85 calories, 6 g total fat, 4 g saturated fat, and 143 mg calcium (11 percent of the DV). Part-Skim Ricotta Cheese According to the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171248/nutrients), 1 oz contains: - 39.1 calories - 2.24 g total fat - 1.4 g saturated fat - 77.1 mg calcium, which is about 6 percent of the DV Comparatively, [1 oz of whole-milk ricotta](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170851/nutrients) has about 43 calories, 2 g total fat, 2 g saturated fat, and 58 mg calcium (5 percent of the DV). Like Kimberlain, Lemond is a fan of ricotta on a pie. \"My current favorite way to make pizza is doing these veggies on top of a layer of ricotta cheese, then bake or grill it on a pizza stone,\" she explains. RELATED: [5 Cheeses You Can Eat on the Keto Diet \u2014 and 5 You Can't](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ketogenic-diet/cheeses-you-can-eat-on-the-keto-diet-and-you-cant/) 4. Go for a Whole-Wheat Crust for Extra Nutrition or a Veggie Crust for Fewer Carbs Whether you're making pizza at home or ordering in, it's important to think not just thin versus thick crust but also the type of dough. \"If you're able to make a whole-grain crust, this will help give you a boost of fiber,\" says Kimberlain. Consider this slice-by-slice comparison. A small whole-wheat thin-crust pizza with cheese, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2344171/nutrients), has over 3 g of fiber. Meanwhile, a small regular thin-crust pizza with cheese has less than 1 g of fiber, [per the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2344160/nutrients). That's almost 11 percent of your DV for fiber in whole wheat versus about 3 percent for a regular crust. \"While you'll still need to pay attention to the total portion consumed, starting off with a healthier crust can make a difference,\" she adds. Veggie crusts are also a solid option. \"I like the alternative pizza crusts on the market or ones that can be homemade, like cauliflower, broccoli, and beet, as ways to help complement a pizza night, which you can eat in addition to your traditional crusts to help increase vegetables,\" says Kimberlain. That means, you could, for example, have a slice of traditional crust pie as well as a slice of veggie crust pie to mix things up. You'll also score fiber from the veggie crust \u2014 and it's [low in carbs](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/low-carb-diet-beginners-guide-food-list-meal-plan-tips/), too. A frozen cauliflower crust, for example, has about 3 g of carbohydrates per slice, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/567379/nutrients), and just under 1 g of fiber. You'll get other nutrients from a cauliflower crust, too, like 9 g protein (due in part to the egg and cheese that's also in the recipe), according to the USDA. 5. Choose Lean Proteins Like Chicken Over High-Sodium, High-Fat Pepperoni Thanks to the cheese, your pizza will already contain protein, but many pizza lovers add another [protein source](/diet-nutrition/protein-how-much-you-need-benefits-sources-more/) as well, so be mindful of what else you put atop your pie. \"Avoid fatty meats. Either do vegetarian or keep it to leaner meats like chicken breast, seafood, or extra-lean meat,\" says Lemond. Adds Kimberlain, \"Current recommendations are to limit the intake of processed meats like bacon, sausage, and pepperoni, which are not only high in sodium but also saturated fat.\" The [AHA recommends](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/meat-poultry-and-fish-picking-healthy-proteins) minimizing processed red meats like bacon, salami, and sausages. A large slice of thin-crust pizza with extra veggies, for example, has 5.5 g saturated fat and 704 g sodium, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2344113/nutrients), while a large slice of thin-crust pizza with extra meat has over 8 g saturated fat and 874 mg sodium, [per the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2344141/nutrients).

Slather On the Red Sauce \u2014 It's Loaded With Essential Nutrients Red sauce makes pizza taste delicious, and it also delivers serious nutrients. \"Traditional red sauce will provide vitamins A and C along with the antioxidant lycopene,\" says Kimberlain. For example, \u00bc cup of tomato-based sauce gives you over 7 mg of vitamin C, which is about 7.8 percent of your DV, as well as 21 micrograms RAE of [vitamin A](/drugs/vitamin-a-oral-injection), for about 2 percent of the DV, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/172880/nutrients). Vitamin A, meanwhile, is important for everything from vision to keeping your immune system functioning at its best, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945). Furthermore, lycopene is an antioxidant that gives red fruits and vegetables their hue, and it has even been linked to [lowering the odds of certain cancers](https://www.everydayhealth.com/cancer-photos/top-foods-to-fight-cancer.aspx), as well as reducing the [risk of stroke](/stroke/guide/symptoms/), according to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/lycopene-rich-tomatoes-linked-to-lower-stroke-risk-201210105400). \"Red sauce is a better option than the creamier sauces like white pizza options,\" says Kimberlain. The [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-make-healthy-pizza/) adds that you should also avoid barbecue sauce because it's high in added sugar and sodium. If you're not a red sauce fan, there are other options. \"You can use pesto, made with heart-healthy nuts and oils,\" says Kimberlain. Pesto is made with pine nuts (though you can also substitute [almonds](/diet-nutrition/diet/almonds-nutrition-benefits-how-eat-more/) or walnuts), and nuts can potentially do everything from help lower your [LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol](https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/ldl/) to improve the health of the lining of your arteries, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/nuts/art-20046635). Pesto is also made with [olive oil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/olive-oil-nutrition-benefits-beauty-uses-top-sellers-more/), the AHA](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/03/05/olive-oil-may-lower-heart-disease-risk), may Pesto confers a [basil](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/basil-what-it-does-your-body-different-types-enjoy-more/)- and nutty-driven flavor. \"Simply watch the quantity that you're using \u2014 a little actually goes a long way with the flavor,\" says Kimberlain. 7. Pair Your Pie With a Healthy Side to Complete Your Meal Pizza night isn't just about the pie \u2014 it's also about what you pair with your slices. \"Side dishes can play a big role in creating an overall balanced meal,\" says Kimberlain. Try a veggie appetizer. \"I love to munch on cut-up veggies before the pizza \u2014 so celery, cucumber, and carrots \u2014 paired with a yogurt-based ranch dip,\" says Kimberlain. Then when it comes to dinner time, she suggests enjoying two slices of thin-crust pizza with a side salad. \"The vegetables help provide fiber, which play a role in helping you to feel fuller,\" says Kimberlain. For example, 1 cup of raw [kale](/diet-nutrition/diet/kale-nutrition-health-benefits-types-how-cook-more/) provides 1 g of fiber, [according to the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168421/nutrients). Throw a few other veggies on top (like sliced carrots and cucumbers), then toss it with a dressing made from lemon juice, olive oil, and a bit of salt, and you've got one satisfying, fiber-filled meal.

Eat Slowly to Enjoy Your Food, and Relish the Company Yes, you'll want to consider what's on your plate during pizza night but also [think about the pace at which you eat](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/intuitive-eating-beginners-guide-anti-diet/). \"Really savor the flavor of the food. Instead of shoveling in your food in a matter of minutes, slow down and enjoy the pizza,\" suggests Kimberlain. \"This, too, can help with your portions.\" If you eat slowly, then you'll realize when you're full, without overdoing it. Lemond adds, \"Your protein, grain, and vegetable is all in the pizza, so you can just eat slowly until satisfied.\" Also, don't forget to enjoy the people you're dining with. \"Maybe in your house, Friday night is now pizza night \u2014 think of all the memories that can and will be created,\" says Kimberlain. Why might this matter? \"Research continues to show the health benefits of friendship, social connections, and creating a family bond,\" she explains. [According to Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships), strong relationships and social bonds can improve health and increase longevity \u2014 win-win. [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603716/) suggested that social connections helped improve the well-being of people living with long-term health conditions. \"More important sometimes than the food is the tradition itself that's been created,\" says Kimberlain.
